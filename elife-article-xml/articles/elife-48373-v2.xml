controlling and modulating the ‘behavior’ of brain networks. How their structural composition, most notably their quantitative morphology underlie their computational properties remains rather unclear, particularly in humans. Here, excitatory synaptic boutons (SBs) in layer 4 (L4) of the temporal lobe neocortex (TLN) were quantitatively investigated. Biopsies from epilepsy surgery were used for fine-scale and tomographic electron microscopy (EM) to generate 3D-reconstructions of SBs. Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and that of the three functionally defined pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified. SBs were comparatively small (~2.50 μm<sup>2</sup>), with a single AZ (~0.13 µm<sup>2</sup>); preferentially established on spines. SBs had a total pool of ~1800 SVs with strikingly large readily releasable (~20), recycling (~80) and resting pools (~850). Thus, human L4 SBs may act as ‘amplifiers’ of signals from the sensory periphery, integrate, synchronize and modulate intra- and extracortical synaptic activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>3D-volume reconstructions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yakoubi</surname><given-names>Rachida</given-names></name><name><surname>Lübke</surname><given-names>Joachim HR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lübke</surname><given-names>Joachim HR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neocortical synapses in layer 4 of the human temporal lobe neocortex were quantitatively characterized, at the subcellular level, using high-end, high-resolution electron microscopy and 3D-volume reconstructions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neocortex of various animal species including non-human primates (NHPs) and humans is characterized by its six-layered structure, the organization into vertical oriented functional slabs so-called cortical columns and a system of long-range horizontal axonal collaterals that connect neurons in the same (intra-laminar) and different (trans-laminar) cortical layers of a given brain area, but also with trans-regional projections to different brain regions (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rockland and DeFelipe, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The TLN representing ~17% of the total volume of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kiernan, 2012</xref>) is regarded as a highly specialized associative brain region roughly subdivided into a superior, medial and inferior gyrus that is highly interconnected with the limbic and various sensory systems. In addition, it is well documented that the TLN represents a homotypic granular, six-layered associative neocortex with cytoarchitectonic similarities to primary sensory cortices but different to heterotypic agranular motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">von Economo and Koskinas, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vogt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Zilles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher, 2017</xref>). Hence, the TLN is regarded as a higher-order, but not primary, or early sensory neocortex. The growing interest in the TLN is motivated by its importance in superior brain functions as audition, vision, memory, language processing, and various multimodal associations with other brain regions (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Insausti, 2013</xref>). Moreover, the TLN is also involved in several neurological diseases, most importantly, as the area of origin and onset of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tai et al., 2018</xref>). TLE is the most common form of refractory <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy">epilepsy</ext-link> characterized by recurrent, unprovoked <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_seizure">focal seizures</ext-link> that may, with progressing disease, also spread to other areas of the brain. Taken together, the TLN represents an important region in the normal and pathologically altered brain in humans. However, relatively little is known about its neural (but see for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeFelipe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Varga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Molnár et al., 2016</xref>), structural and functional synaptic organization (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mansvelder et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Synapses are highly specialized entities involved in neural communication at any given network of the brain. However, for the most common type of synapses in the CNS, neocortical synapses, rather little data are available, in particular about their quantitative geometry. More recently, neocortical synapses have been quantitatively described in rodents and NHPs (for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson and Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Freese and Amaral, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Popov and Stewart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rollenhagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rollenhagen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bopp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rodriguez-Moreno et al., 2018</xref>), but less is known about these structures in humans, particularly at the presynaptic site (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cragg, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gibson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirkpatrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernhardt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu and Schumann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domín-guez-Álvaro et al., 2019</xref>). Such coherent and comprehensive quantitative studies depend on the availability of suitable human brain tissue with highly preserved ultrastructure which can be only guaranteed by access tissue from epilepsy surgery biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yakoubi et al., 2019</xref>) but not post-mortem material.</p><p>The final goal in investigating SBs and their target structures in humans is to describe the synaptic organization of the cortical column, layer by layer, as exemplified by the TLN. First, L5 SBs were quantitatively analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yakoubi et al., 2019</xref>), because this layer represents the major output layer from the neocortex to the sensory periphery. The next logical step was to investigate SBs in L4 of the TLN. In granular primary sensory cortices, L4 is regarded as the main recipient layer for signals from the sensory periphery and thus represents the first station of intracortical information processing (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sherman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clascá et al., 2016</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>). Since the TLN is regarded as a higher-order, but not primary, or early sensory neocortex, here L4 represents a convergent input layer for both thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical inputs (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Insausti, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We took advantage of non-epileptic neocortical access tissue provided from TLE surgery, and used high-resolution fine-scale transmission and tomographic EM and subsequent computer-assisted quantitative 3D-volume reconstructions of synaptic structures to look for structural correlates relevant for synaptic transmission and plasticity.</p><p>The comparison of L4 (this study) and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yakoubi et al., 2019</xref>) SBs showed marked and highly significant layer-specific differences in almost all structural parameters investigated. Strikingly, although ~2-fold smaller in SB and AZ size, L4 SBs contain a nearly 3- to 4-fold larger readily releasable (RRP), a 2-fold larger recycling (RP) and a slightly larger resting pool when compared to L5 SBs suggesting marked differences in synaptic efficacy and strength, but also in the modulation of synaptic plasticity. The structural values obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yakoubi et al. (2019)</xref> and the present study are in line and support recent findings of layer-specific differences in synaptic transmission between L4 and L5 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>) and experimental animals (rodent L4 connections: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feldmeyer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lübke and Feldmeyer, 2007</xref>; rodent L5 connections: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Markram et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ramaswamy and Markram, 2015</xref>). Thus, it might be speculated that layer-specific differences are also present in the other cortical layers to be investigated in humans (work in progress). Hence layer-specific differences in synaptic ‘behavior’ and computational properties of intra-laminarintralaminar cortical networks could be expected, and may contribute to an ‘orchestrated’ action of synapses in the entire network of the cortical column.</p><p>Finally, the quantitative 3D-models of SBs also provide the basis for realistic numerical and/or Monte Carlo simulations of different parameters of synaptic function, for example, neurotransmitter release and diffusion at AZs that remain only partially accessible to experiment, at least in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Density of synaptic contacts established by SBs in L4 of the human TLN</title><p>First, the density of synaptic contacts was measured since such data are rare for humans particularly for the TLN (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marco and DeFelipe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Finnema et al., 2016</xref>).

In Golgi-stained and semithin sections throughout the human TLN, L4 was distinguishable from the lower part of L2/3 and L5 by the absence of pyramidal-shaped neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and is further characterized by a zone relatively sparse of neurons with comparatively small, round to ovoid cell bodies organized in a cluster-like fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B framed area, D</xref>). At the EM level, GAP-junctional coupling between dendrites was frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>) in L4, as well as tight junctional coupling mainly between astrocytes. Interestingly, L2 was composed of pyramidal cells that were densely packed but randomly distributed throughout the neuropil in semithin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) whereas L3 contained somewhat larger pyramidal neurons which in contrast to L2 were more loosely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

It has been demonstrated that at large CNS synapses glutamate spillover, synaptic cross talk and a switch from asynchronous to synchronous release upon repetitive stimulation occurred at these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">von Gersdorff and Borst, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hallermann et al., 2003</xref>). Astrocytes at L4 synaptic complexes thus act as physical barriers to neurotransmitter diffusion thereby preventing spillover of released glutamate by active take-up and removal of glutamate in the cleft. In addition, they terminate synaptic transmission and may thus, speed-up the recovery from receptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danbolt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Oliet et al., 2004</xref>).

Thus, L4 represents the first station of intracortical information processing from peripheral sensory signals. From L4, these signals are then transferred via translaminar connections within a cortical column and via transcolumnar axons to adjacent columns or even transregional to other cortical regions (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rockland and DeFelipe, 2018</xref>). It has to be noted though that the TLN is regarded as a higher-order, but not primary, or early sensory neocortex. Thus, L4 of the TLN represents a convergent input layer for both thalamocortical and corticocortical synaptic inputs.</p><p>In rat and mouse neocortex, and recently in humans, it has been elegantly shown by paired recordings that L4-L4 excitatory synaptic connections are characterized by a comparatively high synaptic efficacy and strength as indicated by their high average EPSP amplitudes (rat barrel cortex 1.0 to 1.6 mV, mouse primary visual cortex 0.54 mV, human L4 0.95 mV), low coefficient of variations (&lt;0.4) and low failure rates (&lt;5%) indicative for highly reliable synaptic transmission (rat: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feldmeyer et al., 1999</xref>; mouse and human: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>) when compared with excitatory connections in other cortical layers (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lübke and Feldmeyer, 2007</xref>). Some of these L4-L4 connections in rat somatosensory cortex are so strong that high-frequency trains of postsynaptic action potentials can be evoked causally related to the high abundance of NMDA-receptors contributing with ~40% to the overall EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feldmeyer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rollenhagen et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, L4-L4 excitatory synaptic connections show a high degree of bidirectional coupling (~30%) resulting in recurrent excitation or feed-back inhibition.</p><p>Finally, rat L4 spiny neurons are highly interconnected with ~200 other excitatory spiny neurons within a ‘barrel’ column: in turn ~300–400 L4 spiny neurons converge onto a single L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lübke et al., 2003</xref>). This intra-columnar connectivity is not only a major determinant for reliable signal transduction in L4, acting as ‘feed-back amplifiers’ even for weak signals from the sensory periphery, but also for the safe and reliable distribution of signals to other neurons located in different layers within the cortical column with which L4 neurons are interconnected (canonical microcircuit of the cortical column).</p><p>Assuming such a scenario described above exists in L4 of the human TLN, several structural parameters contribute to its function as an important associational area involved in the induction, maintenance and regulation of various computations underlying perception, executive control, learning and memory in which the TLN plays an important role.

On the other hand, the large variability in AZ size and the three pools of SVs may be involved in the sorting, modulation, and further discrimination of intrinsic and extrinsic signals by neurons in the TLN. Together, all these characteristics ensure the proper wiring and firing of neurons in L4 of the human TLN (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>), to accomplish its function as a recipient layer for both thalamocortical and corticocortical inputs and help to explain information processing from incoming signals of the sensory periphery, within the TLN and from brain regions with which the TLN is interconnected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Perspectives to work on the TLN</title><p>As already mentioned earlier, the TLN represents ~17% of the total volume of the neocortex in humans and is regarded as a multimodal associational granular neocortex with a wide range of reciprocal connections with other cortical and subcortical sensory and associational areas.

The superficial part of the neocortex is characterized by a complete lack of neurons, absence of dendritic structures and a marked damage of SBs in the neuropil in two patients. Interestingly, this situation changes gradiently when moving to the more infragranular part of the TLN. Here, more and more SBs become ‘normally’ structured, neurons and dendritic structures start to reappear in the neocortex, and down to the white matter the neocortex appears ‘normally’ structured. However, how such a severely damaged neocortex can compensate the complete ‘loss’ of its supragranular layers that are connected and interact with their counterparts on the opposite hemisphere remains unanswered. How that would influence the synaptic organization and its possible re-arrangement is a challenging task to accomplish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human neocortical tissue processing for EM</title><p>Biopsy material was obtained from three male and three female patients (25–63 years in age, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) who suffered from drug-resistant TLE und underwent surgery to control the seizures.

The density of synaptic contacts was unbiasedly estimated in six patients (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) using the physical dissector technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mayhew, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fiala and Harris, 2001</xref>) by counting the synaptic complexes in a virtual volume generated by two adjacent ultrathin sections that is the dissector: the reference section and the look-up section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sterio, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaplan et al., 2011</xref>).

An unbiased counting frame was first set and synaptic contacts to be considered (counted) are the one present in the reference section only, and meeting the following criteria: presence of a PreAZ and a prominent or thin PSD separated by a synaptic cleft and SVs in the presynaptic terminal. Care was taken to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts, as well as the postsynaptic target structures (dendritic spines or shafts). Finally the density of synaptic contacts (<italic>N<sub>v</sub></italic>) per 1 mm<sup>3</sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) was calculated using the formula below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fiala and Harris, 2001</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>Q<sub>d</sub></italic> is the number of synaptic contacts per dissector and V<sub>d</sub> is the volume of the dissector given by: Number of dissectors x frame area x section thickness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>3D-volume reconstructions and quantitative analysis of excitatory L4 SBs</title><p>All electron micrographs composing each series were imported, stacked, and aligned in the reconstruction software OpenCAR (Contour Alignment Reconstruction; for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sätzler et al., 2002</xref>). Synaptic structures of interest were outlined on the outer edge of their membranes throughout the series. 3D-volume reconstructions were then generated and the following structural parameters were analyzed: 1) surface area and volume of SBs; 2) volume of mitochondria; 3) surface area of the PreAZs and PSDs; 4) number and diameter of clear synaptic and DCVs, and 5) total pool of SVs and the RRP, RP and resting pool.</p><p>Excitatory SBs were characterized by large round SVs and prominent pre- and postsynaptic densities in contrast to putative GABAergic terminals that have smaller, more oval-shaped SVs and thin PSDs. A SB was considered completely captured, when it was possible to follow the axon in both directions through the entire series (<italic>en passant</italic> bouton) or the enlargement of the axon leading to an endterminal bouton. The start of a bouton was defined by the typical widening of the axon and the abrupt occurrence of SVs.</p><p>The PreAZs and PSDs were regarded as complete when their perimeters were entirely reconstructed in a series of ultrathin sections. The PreAZ surface area was measured by extraction from that of the presynaptic terminal membrane. The size of the PSD was the perimeter ratio between the outlines of the PSD to that of the synaptic contact. The synaptic cleft diameter was measured because of its importance for the transient increase of glutamate concentration, reversible binding of glutamate to appropriate glutamate receptors and eventual uptake and diffusion of glutamate out of the cleft. To a large extent, these processes are governed by the geometry of the synaptic cleft and the shape and size of the PreAZs and PSDs. Synaptic cleft width measurement was performed only on synaptic contacts cut perpendicular to the AZ. The distance between the outer edge of the pre- and postsynaptic membranes at the center of the synaptic contact and at the two lateral edges was measured and averaged for each synaptic contact. All SVs were marked throughout each SB and their diameters were individually measured. To determine the distribution profile of the SVs, the minimal distance between each SV membrane to the contour lines of the PreAZ was measured throughout the SB in every single image of the series. Large DCVs were only counted in the image where they appeared largest (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yakoubi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, aldehyde fixation was used that is thought to induce tissue shrinkage thereby biasing structural quantification (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eyre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). A direct comparison of structural parameters obtained from either aldehyde or cryo-fixed and substituted tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>), had shown differences in cortical thickness (~16% larger in cryro-fixed material), volume of extracellular space (~6-fold larger in cryo-fixed material), a slight increase in glial volume and overall density of synaptic contacts (~14% in cryo-fixed material), but no significant differences in neuronal structures such as axons, dendrites and vesicle length.</p><p>Concerning synaptic parameters as estimated here no significant difference was found for SB size and other synaptic subelements such as mitochondria, AZs and SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Zhao et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Zhao et al., 2012b</xref>). Therefore, no corrections for shrinkage were applied and we are thus convinced that the synaptic parameters reported here are accurate and can be directly used for detailed computational models. In addition, large-scale preservation for ultrastructural analysis will therefore continue to rely on chemical fixation approaches, due to the limited preservation of the ultrastructure in cryo-fixed material as stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Korogod et al.

Subsequently, the samples were post-fixed overnight in 0.15M cacodylate buffer (CB) + 2% PFA, 2.5% GA and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> before they were embedded in 4% Agar-Agar dissolved in water. After removing access Agar-Agar, vibratome sections of 150 µm thickness were cut (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) in the frontal (coronal) plane through the human TLN. Sections were collected in multi-well plates in 0.3M CB + 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and thoroughly washed (5 × 3 min) with 0.15M CB + 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Thereafter, sections were incubated in 0.15M CB + 1.5% potassium hexocyanoferrate (II), 2% osmium tetroxide and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr on ice, in the dark. After washing (5 × 3 min) with deionized water (‘MilliQ’, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), sections were placed in an aqueous 1% thiocarbohydrazide solution for 20 min followed by another washing step with deionized water (5 × 3 min). This was followed by another treatment with an aqueous 2% osmium tetroxide solution for additional 30 min at room temperature, in the dark and washing with deionized water (5 × 3 min). Block contrasting was conducted with a filtered, aqueous 1% uranyl acetate solution, overnight at 4°C, in the dark. On the next day, samples were washed with deionized water (5 × 3 min) and stained with lead aspartate (20 mmol lead nitrate in a 30 mmol L-aspartic acid solution, pH 5.5) for 30 min at 60°C. After thorough washing with deionized water (3 × 5 min), sections were dehydrated through an ascending series of ice-cold, aqueous ethanol dilutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, each 5 min, 2 × 100%, anhydrous, each 10 min) before they were transferred into propylene oxide (2 × 10 min). Finally, the samples were infiltrated with an ascending series of Durcupan ACM (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in propylene oxide (2:1; 3:1, each for 1 hr and pure Durcupan ACM, overnight) before the sections were flat-embedded between two overhead projector foils, which in turn were placed between two microscopic glass slides and polymerized at 60°C for 2 days.</p><p>For the quantitative analysis of L4 SBs 3D-volume reconstructions were made based on z-stacks obtained using focused ion beam (FIB) scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the overall appearance of the sample, an area of interest was trimmed out of a flat-embedded section, using a 4 mm biopsy puncher, which was then glued onto a pre-polymerized resin block. Excess resin was removed around the tissue using a histology diamond knife on an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). The tissue sample was removed from the resin block with a razor blade and was then glued onto an SEM aluminum specimen stub using colloidal silver paste. The sample was dried in a vacuum chamber overnight, then sputter-coated with platinum/palladium for 15 s and finally placed into the FIB-SEM (Crossbeam 540, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) for 3D analysis.</p><p>A trench was milled with the FIB at 30 kV/30 nA, polishing of the surface was performed at 30kV/3nA and fine milling for data acquisition was performed at 30kV/7nA. The cross-section surface was imaged with an electron energy of 2keV and an electron beam current of 500 pA using an in-column energy-selective backscatter electron detector. The dwell time was 10 µs with line average 1. The pixel size in the XY-plane was 10 nm and the slice thickness (z-direction) was 50 nm yielding a voxel size of 10 nm x 10 nm x 50 nm. The image acquisition software Atlas 3D (Ver. 5.2.0.125, ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany) allowed the automated collection of 3D SEM datasets using automated correction algorithms for drift, focus and astigmatism (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The advantage in using the FIB-SEM technique is three-fold: 1) a much higher throughput of different tissue samples at once; 2) definition of a much larger region of interest per sample and 3) increase of the z-dimensions of the individual samples. However, the disadvantage of this method is still the weaker resolution of single SVs compared to TEM. This approach, together with TEM, will be used in future studies for further image processing, 3D-volume reconstructions and subsequent data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EM tomography of L4 SBs in the TLN</title><p>EM tomography was carried out on 200–300 nm thick sections cut from blocks prepared for ultrathin sectioning as described above.

The detailed structural setup of excitatory synapses in the human neocortex, however, is still much less explored. Here, the authors report a detailed electron-microscopic analysis of the structural features of synapses in layer 4 of human temporal lobe neocortexThe tissue was obtained from biopsies during epilepsy surgery aimed at deeper brain structures. The authors report remarkably large synaptic vesicle pools, that are even larger than those observed in the synaptic boutons of human synapses from layer 5, which are at the same time about 5-fold larger in volume. This data emphasizes the need to analyse human cortical tissue for understanding the commonalities and differences to data obtained from rodents.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ultrastructural heterogeneity of human layer 4 excitatory synaptic boutons in the adult temporal lobe neocortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kathleen Rockland (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have extensively discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing and Senior Editors, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript reports an ultrastructural description of synapse composition in layer 4 of human cortex obtained from epilepsy surgery samples. The data are of very high quality and provide a reference for layer 4 synaptic composition in human.</p><p>While the relevance of data from the human brain was seen by all reviewers, the reviewers were concerned about the relationship of the presented data to a previous publication by the same group about synapses in L5 of human neocortex (Yakoubi et al., 2018).</p><p>The reviewers therefore agreed to request an extensive revision of the manuscript that should ensure:</p><p>- a clear and insightful comparison of the presented data to the L5 data, and to the literature (see detailed points in the reviews below). This may include the need for additional analyses, see below.</p><p>- a more elaborate explanation of the significance of data from L4, especially in the temporal lobe.</p><p>- a much extended methodological description that provides all details required for comparing the results to previous work. Again, the reviews below describe the missing detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Anatomical data in human brain are still frustratingly limited, and in this regard, the current manuscript can enjoy an assumption of relevance.

These are overall very nice. However, the laminar boundaries seem a bit inexact, mainly because the indicating lines are not parallel to the pia. For Figure 2, layer 2 (about the same thickness as layer 1?) should again be distinguished from layer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Yakoubi et al. examines the ultrastructure of human brain tissue from the region of layer 4 the temporal cortex. The analysis has included a number of samples from the different patients undergoing surgery, both male and female. The paper appears to be a follow-on study published in 2018 in Cerebral Cortex in which the same authors studied layer 5 of human temporal cortex. The Results section gives a detailed set of figures showing a number of parameters concerning the morphology of synaptic boutons.</p><p>The quality of the electron microscopy and the analyses are clear and precise, however, I have a few concerns about some of the interpretations, and the overall significance of the results. I appreciate this piece of work as a careful analysis of bouton structure in the human brain. They are interesting, however, how interesting to a broad audience is questionable. One reason is that it's not obvious how comparisons of certain parameters such as synapse sizes and vesicle pool sizes with other regions in other species can say much about functional differences, or any about the rules of connectivity of plasticity. Comparisons within the same tissue would perhaps be more valuable, but this is just a single snapshot, and interpretations from this structural data in terms of the plasticity of connectivity is perhaps stretching it somewhat.</p><p>I have some questions about the images shown and the analysis. Figure 1 shows some electron micrographs of gap junctions. However, It's not clear as to whether these are gap junctions or not. In part F (Figure 1) it would appear that there is a segment of endoplasmic reticulum against the membrane and I wonder how well the authors are able to identify a cell junction. It's not evident in the image shown. Also, the characteristic periodicity in staining along the length of a gap junction is missing, in either of the images.</p><p>In Figure 2 some examples of axonal boutons are shown. However, are these just the glutamatergic type, or are any others shown? There is little mention of which boutons are analyzed, and it's also not clear how the authors define where a bouton starts and the axon ends. What criteria did they use to define just the bouton? In the example shown in Figure 2D this single bouton extends over several microns and appears to be multisynaptic, and very different in morphology from the others shown, at least in the 2D images. How were the synapses on multi-synaptic boutons considered.</p><p>In Table 2 the authors have measured the size of the synaptic cleft, but it's not clear why. Is there a functional significance to this analysis, and the results?</p><p>In several places, there are images showing possible vesicles emerging from the mitochondria and referred to as 'mitochondrial-derived vesicles'. The evidence for these type of structures at the EM level is weak, and these anecdotal images add little to the paper. To include this would require at least some verification that this is not some artifact of fixation.</p><p>In Figure 9, the authors indicate the presence of an astrocytic element close to a synapse. What criteria have been used to identify this element as astrocytic? Could this not be a microglial process?</p><p>The revisions should include more details of the methods. The authors give little information as to how extensively the synaptic densities were measured in each sample. How many synapses were counted overall? I also found it odd that they make no compensation for tissue shrinkage, stating instead that the paper by Korogod showed little change, when in fact it showed the opposite. This makes it more difficult to compare with other studies. On this point, they cite the paper of Mayhew, 1996 that proposes expressing synapse number as a function of synapses per neuron, or per brain region rather than per unit volume, which they clearly do not apply here. It would, of course, make it difficult to compare with their previous work, but a better explanation should at least be given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study examines ultrastructural features of spines in layer 4 neurons of the temporal lobe of human cortex. The work appears to be generally well done. However, the study may be viewed as incremental because of similar, previously published EM analysis of spines in human cortex, from the same group:</p><p>Quantitative Three-Dimensional Reconstructions of Excitatory Synaptic Boutons in Layer 5 of the Adult Human Temporal Lobe Neocortex: A Fine-Scale Electron Microscopic Analysis. Yakoubi R, Rollenhagen A, von Lehe M, Shao Y, Sätzler K, Lübke JHR. Cerebral Cortex, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy146">https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy146</ext-link>. Published: 21 June 2018.</p><p>In particular, the 2018 Cerebral Cortex publication examined human layer 5 neurons whereas the present study examines human layer 4 neurons. Similarities in the numbers of synaptic vesicles reported in the 2018 paper and the present study (1800 vs 1500) and the readily-releasable pool (20 vesicles in spines in each of the studies) and active zone sizes are notable. So, the present study is highly related to published work by this group, focusing on different neurons of the human temporal lobe, a short distance away, and many of the conclusions are the same, including that synapses and their vesicle compositions are much larger in human cortex than other species. For this reviewer, the advance in the present study is incremental, and the work would be better suited for a specialized journal.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Ultrastructural heterogeneity of human layer 4 excitatory synaptic boutons in the adult temporal lobe neocortex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers and editor were disappointed that the authors did not make more efforts to address the reviewers' concerns, in particular since some of them were merely requests for additional context and discussion, i.e. textual additions. Below reviews give a very constructive description of what would be required to make this manuscript a worthwhile addition to the previously published L5 data.</p><p>Furthermore, the issue of tissue shrinkage needs to be rightfully addressed, with proper references to the literature, as outlined by reviewer 2.</p><p>Finally, the request for clarification of the definition of gap junctions should be plausible within the context of this paper (see comments of reviewer 2 on Figure 1F,G).</p><p>We will be happy to evaluate a final revision of this manuscript, but do request that the points raised are faithfully and thoroughly addressed in the final revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I continue to admire, in this revised manuscript, the quality of the research and the potential significance of the results. At the same time, I have rarely been so disappointed with the revisions, which in this case are truly minimalist. My particular requests had been for a careful comparison with previous work from this laboratory on layer 5 (Yaboubi et al., 2019). &quot;We previously reported…. In ongoing work along these lines, we next… Our motivation….&quot; There are only a slight additional reference to this 2019 paper in the revised manuscript, with the consequence that the present extension into layer 4 is left to dangle as little more than a descriptive add-on. I acknowledge that further discussion of layer specific microcircuitry implications risks to be &quot;overly speculative,&quot; but there are several tactics the Authors could have taken; for example, to refer to and discuss other reports on human specializations (i.e., Mansvelder), or differences in monkey and rodent (Luebke and colleagues). The stage must be carefully set to engage the reader, and without this, the very fine results, to repeat, come across as merely &quot;descriptive.&quot; A &quot;meaty&quot; paragraph or more, in the Introduction and Discussion are essential – not just a casual reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This re-submission is well presented with very high-quality EM imaging. The previous comments have been addressed and I appreciate the authors' qualification of most of the points raised.</p><p>I only have two outstanding points, also brought up before. I fully recognize the senior author's expertise in electron microscopy and thank him for including some previous images of gap junctions. They are beautiful. However, I'm still unclear about what is shown in Figure 1 but accept I could be missing something, or there is a lack of pixels in this copy. In part F, I see 4 parallel membranes and wonder where the junctional complex is, and how this is distinguished. In part G, I see three parallel membranes and it’s not clear which part represents the gap between the two apposed membranes.</p><p>The final point is concerning the tissue shrinkage. I fully accept the difficulties in making comparisons due to the wide differences between fixation protocols. That would be the advantage of normalizing the value per neuronal cell body or axonal length. However, the authors continue to state that, 'overall density of synaptic contacts was not significantly different…' when comparing aldehyde or cryo-fixed and substituted tissues. The paper they refer to, Korogod et al., 2015, shows a significant difference in synapse density between the two fixation methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48373.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Anatomical data in human brain are still frustratingly limited, and in this regard, the current manuscript can enjoy an assumption of relevance.

First, it is still very controversially discussed whether experimental data obtained in animals can be transferred 1:1 to humans. Since there are not many quantitative data available in humans, the comparison with experimental data obtained from various animal species, also limited and not always coherent, is currently a good option to assess similarities and differences in synaptic structures. Our final aim is to describe the layer-specific synaptic organization of the human neocortex, exemplified for the temporal lobe neocortex. Such data are not at all available and thus represent an important add-on to what is already known about the quantitative geometry of CNS synapses. In the reviewer’s comments of already published work from our group it is always stated that such data are long expected and required to better understand the role of these structures in synaptic transmission and plasticity.</p><p>The reviewer is right that a comparison with the same tissue is valuable. Hence we have included the already published data from layer 5 excitatory synaptic boutons to Table 2 and discussed the findings in the human temporal lobe in more detail (see text).</p><p>We again disagree with the reviewer on his last point. For example differences in the density of synaptic contacts in a certain volume of a given brain region can help to predict connectivity rates in the corresponding region. Moreover, it has been demonstrated by meanwhile several studies that structural data of synaptic boutons, such as the number, size and shape of the active zones and the organization and size of the three pools of synaptic vesicles, involvement of astrocytes and mitochondria may allow prediction about the release machinery, mode and probability of neurotransmitter release and thus about synaptic transmission and plasticity. For example, it has been demonstrated that the size of the active zones is positively correlated to the mode and probability of release (for example Matz et al., 2010; Freche et al., 2011; Holderith et al., 2012). The quantitative structural analysis of the three functionally defined vesicle pools also allow prediction about synaptic strength, efficacy and modulation of synaptic plasticity (for example Denker and Rizzoli, 2010; Imig et al., 2014; Schikorski, 2014; reviewed by Rizzoli and Betz, 2004, 2005). All the other structural parameters mentioned above were thoroughly discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>Meanwhile such data as analyzed here provide the basis for numerical or Monte Carlo simulations of various synaptic parameters, for example neurotransmitter diffusion via the synaptic cleft, that at least in humans are still inaccessible to experiment. To further demonstrate the value of such data, we were asked by several computational neuroscientists to provide our data to perform realistic simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have some questions about the images shown and the analysis.

We would like to point out that the senior author of the paper has a more than 30 years of expertise in electron microscopy, and is thus able to identify gap junctions and other membrane specializations. In Figure 1F we have followed the gap junction over consecutive sections to make sure that is indeed a gap junction and took the best image for publication. In Figure 1G a higher magnification of a gap junction was taken to better visualize the typical three-layered structure of this membrane specialization that makes it also distinguishable from desmosomes and tight junctions. Further examples of gap junctions, meeting the criteria as used by us, are found in numerous text books and publications (for example see Figure 6 from Vervaeke et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 some examples of axonal boutons are shown.

For clarity we have added a sentence to the Results section and to the figure legends. We agree with the reviewer about the definition of where the bouton starts and axon ends and added a text in material and methods. Regarding Figure 2D, does the reviewer mean the multisynaptic boutons in Figure 2B and C? If so, we would like to mention that the majority (~97%) of excitatory synaptic boutons in L4 contained a single release site equivalent to the synapse, the term used by the reviewer. The remaining contained two to three synapses as exemplified in Figure 2 B and C which were not differently handled in our analysis. For clarity we have added a text in Materials and methods under the chapter: 3D-volume reconstructions and quantitative analysis of excitatory L4 SBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Table 2 the authors have measured the size of the synaptic cleft, but it's not clear why. Is there a functional significance to this analysis, and the results?</p></disp-quote><p>The width of the synaptic cleft is of importance for the temporal and spatial transient increase of the glutamate concentration in the cleft, reversible binding of glutamate to appropriate glutamate receptors and the vertical but also horizontal diffusion and eventual uptake of glutamate out of the cleft by fine astrocytic processes. To a large extent, these processes are governed by the geometry and width of the synaptic cleft. However, how and to what extent a larger cleft width contribute to differences in synaptic transmission has to be directly demonstrated by electrophysiology or simulations (Freche et al., 2011). The synaptic cleft measurements will be needed for future simulation studies in our lab together with the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. In our past studies, this measurement was requested by other reviewers because of its relevance to synaptic transmission and plasticity. We have also added a small paragraph for further explanation in Materials and methods under chapter: 3D-volume reconstructions and quantitative analysis of excitatory L4 SBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In several places, there are images showing possible vesicles emerging from the mitochondria and referred to as 'mitochondrial-derived vesicles'.

Hence these structures cannot be regarded as an artefact of fixation. Even anecdotal and unfrequently observed in our samples, these structures are an interesting finding that add information to describe synaptic boutons in humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 9, the authors indicate the presence of an astrocytic element close to a synapse.

Could this not be a microglial process?</p></disp-quote><p>We have identified astrocytic processes according to established criteria introduced in the famous textbook about the ultrastructure of the nervous system: neurons and supporting cells by Peters et al., 1991, and later adopted and published by Ventura and Harris, 1999.</p><p>Astrocytic processes were identified by their irregular, stellate shape and by the presence of glycogen granules and bundles of intermediate filaments in a relatively clear cytoplasm (see also Peters et al., 1991). In addition to astrocytes, we have also observed microglial cells and macrophages, especially near to degenerating neurons. Microglial cells are always distinguishable from astrocytes and their fine processes, by their different shape and appearance at the electron microscopic level. In addition, their occurrence was infrequent and varied substantially between tissue samples. Hence, we have never seen fine processes of microglial cells near synaptic complexes or establishing direct contact with a bouton. In contrast there is structural evidence of the existence of such contacts between astrocytes and their target structures as shown for example for the so-called tripartite synapse in the hippocampus and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. We have added a short paragraph to the Results sections, under the chapter: Astrocytic coverage of L4 SBs in the human TLN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The revisions should include more details of the methods. The authors give little information as to how extensively the synaptic densities were measured in each sample. How many synapses were counted overall? I also found it odd that they make no compensation for tissue shrinkage, stating instead that the paper by Korogod showed little change, when in fact it showed the opposite. This makes it more difficult to compare with other studies. On this point, they cite the paper of Mayhew, 1996, that proposes expressing synapse number as a function of synapses per neuron, or per brain region rather than per unit volume, which they clearly do not apply here. It would, of course, make it difficult to compare with their previous work, but a better explanation should at least be given.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer upon our density measurements and not compensating for tissue shrinkage. For the density measurements we followed established and standardized protocols used by other scientists that performed such an analysis as cited in Materials and methods under chapter: Stereological estimation of the density of synaptic contacts. In this context the reviewer misinterpreted, in our opinion, that “Mayhew 1996” proposes expressing synapse number as a function of synapses per neuron, or per brain region rather than per unit volume, because: the physical dissector method implies already calculation per unit volume as also indicated by the equation used here (see Materials and methods). This led to a synaptic density per unit volume which could be then compared to other published data evaluated the same way.</p><p>Regarding tissue shrinkage, there is still a controversial and ongoing discussion whether structural experimental data should be corrected for shrinkage. We would like to point out here that different subelements in the neuropil, such as somata, dendrites, axons and synaptic vesicles, show different patterns of shrinkage. Hence, a general shrinkage factor is hard to apply. Thus, in numerous quantitative studies, shrinkage is not corrected. If a correction for shrinkage was applied, various different methods for estimating the tissue shrinkage factor were used, and thus, the experimental data corrected for shrinkage are not comparable. Furthermore, tissue shrinkage could not only be related to the fixation process, but could be also influenced by various other factors like differences in the protocols used for electron microscopy, for example the use of cacodylate vs phosphate buffer; ethanol vs. acetone dehydration and embedding media.</p><p>After again thoroughly reading the Korogod-paper, the following assumptions can be made: the overall brain volume is reduced in chemical fixation due to the reduction of the extracellular space and glial volume. However, no significant difference was found in neuronal elements, such as dendrites and axons. Moreover, no significant difference was found in the overall synaptic density, only for symmetric synapses which are not relevant for the present study as we analyzed asymmetric (excitatory) synapses.</p><p>Surprisingly, the number of synaptic vesicles in the readily releasable pool was somewhat lower in cryo-substituted material when compared to chemical fixation (but see Sätzler et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2012b), which is the only difference to our findings.</p><p>Finally, we would like to quote the final sentence of the Korogod-paper: “Large-scale preservation for ultrastructural analysis will therefore continue to rely on chemical fixation approaches”.</p><p>However, we have extended the paragraph regarding tissue shrinkage in Materials and methods section under the chapter: 3D-volume reconstructions and quantitative analysis of excitatory L4 SBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study examines ultrastructural features of spines in layer 4 neurons of the temporal lobe of human cortex. The work appears to be generally well done. However, the study may be viewed as incremental because of similar, previously published EM analysis of spines in human cortex, from the same group:</p><p>Quantitative Three-Dimensional Reconstructions of Excitatory Synaptic Boutons in Layer 5 of the Adult Human Temporal Lobe Neocortex: A Fine-Scale Electron Microscopic Analysis.

Published: 21 June 2018.</p><p>In particular, the 2018 Cerebral Cortex publication examined human layer 5 neurons whereas the present study examines human layer 4 neurons. Similarities in the numbers of synaptic vesicles reported in the 2018 paper and the present study (1800 vs 1500) and the readily-releasable pool (20 vesicles in spines in each of the studies) and active zone sizes are notable. So, the present study is highly related to published work by this group, focusing on different neurons of the human temporal lobe, a short distance away, and many of the conclusions are the same, including that synapses and their vesicle compositions are much larger in human cortex than other species. For this reviewer, the advance in the present study is incremental, and the work would be better suited for a specialized journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this reviewer’s opinion about the non-suitability of this paper for <italic>eLife</italic>, because of the fact that it only considered as an extension to a previously published work and the conclusions are the same. Again we would like to quote reviewer 1 “Anatomical data in human brain are still frustratingly limited, and in this regard, the current manuscript can enjoy an assumption of relevance”.</p><p>Our submission is further substantiated by the need of such structural data for functional studies (for example see Seeman et al., 2018 published in <italic>eLife</italic>) and computational neuroscientists to perform different simulations based on realistic values of several structural synaptic parameters. As already stated in our reply to reviewer 2 we were asked to provide these data for further modelling. The final aim as already raised above is to describe the synaptic organization of the neocortex exemplified for the temporal lobe neocortex. To do so, it is important to describe, at the subcellular level, each cortical layer individually to look for similarities and differences between layers. The synaptic organization in each layer may contribute to explain the computational properties of neurons in intra- and translaminar networks, for example constituting the network of a cortical column.</p><p>Finally, synapses are key elements in any given network of the brain. Detailed information about their structural composition is required for an improved understanding of the function of the brain in health and disease.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers and editor were disappointed that the authors did not make more efforts to address the reviewers' concerns, in particular since some of them were merely requests for additional context and discussion, i.e. textual additions.

At the same time, I have rarely been so disappointed with the revisions, which in this case are truly minimalist. My particular requests had been for a careful comparison with previous work from this laboratory on layer 5 (Yaboubi et al., 2019). &quot;We previously reported…. In ongoing work along these lines, we next… Our motivation….&quot; There are only a slight additional reference to this 2019 paper in the revised manuscript, with the consequence that the present extension into layer 4 is left to dangle as little more than a descriptive add-on. I acknowledge that further discussion of layer specific microcircuitry implications risks to be &quot;overly speculative,&quot; but there are several tactics the Authors could have taken; for example, to refer to and discuss other reports on human specializations (i.e., Mansvelder), or differences in monkey and rodent (Luebke and colleagues). The stage must be carefully set to engage the reader, and without this, the very fine results, to repeat, come across as merely &quot;descriptive.&quot; A &quot;meaty&quot; paragraph or more, in the Introduction and Discussion are essential – not just a casual reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank Dr. Kathleen Rockland for her helpful suggestions to improve the manuscript. We have now hopefully addressed her request for a ‘meaty’ paragraph in the Introduction and Discussion where we directly compared human L4 and L5 in the TLN and point to our final goal to describe the synaptic organization, layer by layer of the cortical column (Introduction). We also gave a perspective at the end of the discussion that we plan to also work on epileptic neocortical tissue. However, we would like to point out that we improved our manuscript by directly comparing our results of L4 and L5 in humans and other experimental animal including NHPs; these comparisons are now highlighted in blue throughout the text, including the functional relevance chapter. However, we already discussed structural and functional layer-specific differences in layer 4 synaptic connections of the rodent (Feldmeyer et al., 1999, 2002, Silver et al., 2003) and between rodents and humans (Seemann et al. 2018). The same holds true for our results about bouton geometry and AZ size with findings in rodents and non-human primates (see papers by Hsu et al., 2017 and Bopp et al., 2017). Since the reviewer already pointed out that the discussion is already long we have now just added a short hopefully ‘meaty’ chapter about future perspectives to work on the human TLN by directly comparing results in ‘health’ and disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This re-submission is well presented with very high-quality EM imaging. The previous comments have been addressed and I appreciate the authors' qualification of most of the points raised.</p><p>I only have two outstanding points, also brought up before. I fully recognize the senior author's expertise in electron microscopy and thank him for including some previous images of gap junctions. They are beautiful. However, I'm still unclear about what is shown in Figure 1 but accept I could be missing something, or there is a lack of pixels in this copy. In part F, I see 4 parallel membranes and wonder where the junctional complex is, and how this is distinguished. In part G, I see three parallel membranes and it’s not clear which part represents the gap between the two apposed membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to point that we followed the definition of a Gap-junction by well-established criteria set by others. Per definition, Gap-junctions are specialized direct intercellular connections between two neurons, which allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to directly pass through a regulated gate between the cells. One Gap-junction channel is composed of two connexons (or hemichannels), which connect across the intercellular space. At the ultrastructural level Gap-junction plaques were confirmed to have variable composition being home to connexon and non-connexin, but display a typical-three layered structure with two distinct and apparent band of connexons separated by two lipid layers spaced by another but thinner band of proteins. However, Gap-junctions are variable in size and the third thinner band can be disrupted even Gap-junctions can be periodically interrupted.</p><p>We have used this criteria to identify these membrane specializations in our serial sections as exemplified in Figure 4F and G. Furthermore, we were able to follow Gap-junctions over several consecutive ultrathin sections where these structures markedly change in shape and size and were disrupted. Moreover, it is rare to see a long-range continuous band connecting the two neurons. In addition, we also asked for the expertise of two colleagues, Prof. Karl Zilles (FZJ Jülich) and Prof. Holger Jastrow (Medical Research Center, University of Duisburg-Essen), which are experts in the field of subcellular structures at the EM level. They both confirmed our opinion that what we show in Figure 4F, G are indeed Gap-junctions.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to mention that we have a paper published in Frontiers in Neuroanatomy where we described Gap-junctional coupling between clusters of neurons in the reeler mouse neocortex, and identified Gap-junctions by the same criteria where our results were not questioned by the reviewers.</p><p>Finally we would like to stress that Gap-junctional coupling was an interesting side finding but not the main focus of our study. Thus we hope that the reviewer is now convinced with our reply.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final point is concerning the tissue shrinkage. I fully accept the difficulties in making comparisons due to the wide differences between fixation protocols. That would be the advantage of normalizing the value per neuronal cell body or axonal length. However, the authors continue to state that, 'overall density of synaptic contacts was not significantly different…' when comparing aldehyde or cryo-fixed and substituted tissues. The paper they refer to, Korogod et al., 2015, shows a significant difference in synapse density between the two fixation methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment that defining tissue shrinkage is difficult to achieve and to compare due to the wide differences between fixation and embedding protocols. We would like to mention again that there is still an intensive ongoing, but controversial discussion whether experimental data should be corrected for shrinkage. We and many other scientists that face this discussion decided not to correct our experimental data because of numerous uncertainties during fixation and embedding that could lead to a false correction in shrinkage. As already stated in our first rebuttal we believe that certain structures shrink differently during the fixation and embedding process.</p><p>Concerning the density of synaptic contacts the reviewer is correct in his statement that significant differences in synaptic density exist between the two fixation methods used in the Korogod-paper. Comparing the two given values the difference was ~14%, however, with a significance value of just under 0.05 (0.042). Nevertheless, we have extended the chapter about tissue shrinkage in Materials and Methods to point out the difficulties one has with exactly determining tissue shrinkage.</p></body></sub-article></article>
