homeostatically regulated, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We here demonstrate that metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 5 (mGluR5) contribute to the molecular machinery governing sleep-wake homeostasis. Using positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electroencephalography in humans, we find that increased mGluR5 availability after sleep loss tightly correlates with behavioral and electroencephalographic biomarkers of elevated sleep need. These changes are associated with altered cortical myo-inositol and glycine levels, suggesting sleep loss-induced modifications downstream of mGluR5 signaling. Knock-out mice without functional mGluR5 exhibit severe dysregulation of sleep-wake homeostasis, including lack of recovery sleep and impaired behavioral adjustment to a novel task after sleep deprivation. The data suggest that mGluR5 contribute to the brain's coping mechanisms with sleep deprivation and point to a novel target to improve disturbed wakefulness and sleep.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PET-MRS</kwd><kwd>molecular imaging</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>Y-maze</kwd><kwd>plasticity marker</kwd><kwd>fragile X syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_135414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landolt</surname><given-names>Hans-Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>Universität Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sleep and Health</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landolt</surname><given-names>Hans-Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NCCR Neural Plasticity and Repair</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seifritz</surname><given-names>Erich</given-names></name><name><surname>Landolt</surname><given-names>Hans-Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-modal imaging, genetic and behavioral findings in humans and mice revealed that metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 5 contribute to the molecular machinery keeping track of sleep need and coping with physiological and behavioral consequences of sleep loss, pointing to novel targets for improved wakefulness and sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>‘Why do we sleep?’ is one of the remaining unanswered questions in biomedical research. To elucidate function(s) of sleep, the molecular substrate(s) of sleep homeostasis, that is, increased sleep need and intensity after prolonged wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achermann and Borbély, 2011</xref>), need to be identified. Dynamic changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) slow-wave (SWA) or delta activity (0.5–4.5 Hz), and the slow oscillation (&lt;1 Hz) in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, reliably index sleep need. These fundamental sleep rhythms are thought to reflect neural plasticity across the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krueger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). They are generated in the intact brain by complex cortical networks, homeostatically controlled, and provide neurophysiological markers for sleep-dependent memory consolidation and waking plasticity determining sleep need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crunelli and Hughes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>). The strong genetic control of these neurophysiological markers of sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Landolt, 2011</xref>) demonstrates that sleep need has a molecular substrate.</p><p>The activity-dependent expression in cortex and hippocampus of the immediate early gene Homer1a currently provides the most specific molecular correlate of sleep-deprivation-induced rebound in delta power in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maret et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, sleep slow waves systematically recruit cortical and subcortical brain regions with high availability of metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 5 (mGluR5), including medial superior frontal cortex, dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and precuneus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ametamey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang-Vu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hefti et al., 2013</xref>). Homer1a selectively uncouples mGluR5 from effector targets in the post-synaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kammermeier and Worley, 2007</xref>). This uncoupling attenuates mGluR5-mediated activation of phospholipase C, production of inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacyl glycerol, rise in intracellular calcium, and downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berridge, 2016</xref>). The interaction between Homer1a and mGluR5 can induce synaptic long-term depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ronesi and Huber, 2008</xref>) and ensure stable neuronal excitability despite local changes in synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). Such forms of neural plasticity contribute to the fine-tuning of synaptic strength across the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diering et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krueger et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this view, sleep deprivation increases availability of mGluRs in the human and rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hefti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tadavarty et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, specific mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators promote and consolidate sleep in rats, whereas positive allosteric modulators promote wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahnaou et al., 2015a</xref>). Based upon this background, the current work tackled the next essential steps in defining the exact roles of mGluR5 in physiological sleep-wake regulation. Thus, an unparalleled multimodal approach was applied along a translational axis in humans and mice that combined behavioral, molecular brain imaging and neurophysiological studies before and after sleep deprivation, to investigate the involvement of mGluR5 in regulating sleep need.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans</title><p>Twenty-six healthy male volunteers were kept awake for 40 hr under constantly supervised, controlled conditions.

A previously established <sup>1</sup>H-MRS protocol of a single voxel within the pregenual anterior cingulate gyrus of the medial prefrontal cortex was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hulka et al., 2016</xref>). Changes in metabolite concentrations were considered relevant if simultaneously fulfilling the following criteria: (1) significant alteration by sleep deprivation and (2) significant correlation with global mGluR5 availability in both sleep conditions, or with the sleep deprivation-induced increase in mGluR5 availability. These stringent criteria eliminated all but two detected metabolites: myo-inositol and glycine. While the level of myo-inositol was reduced by sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the values in both experimental conditions correlated positively with mGluR5 availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). These results reflect a similar intra-subject variation in myo-inositol levels and mGluR5 binding in baseline and after sleep deprivation. In addition, the glycine concentration was enhanced after sleep loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and the increase was associated with the increased mGluR5 availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

In humans, increased mGluR5 availability after sleep deprivation was tightly associated with increased propensity to fall asleep during brain imaging, as well as delta and low frequency (&lt;1 Hz) EEG activity in NREM sleep, reliable neurophysiological hallmarks of sleep homeostasis. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy further identified associated changes in brain myo-inositol and glycine levels, providing evidence for sleep loss-induced modifications in the downstream signaling cascade of mGluR5. Finally, the build-up of delta power during wakefulness in baseline and recovery periods in mice devoid of functional mGluR5 was severely disturbed, particularly during the dark phases of baseline and recovery periods. Together, the findings highlight in convergent translational fashion that mGluR5 likely contribute to functional aspects of sleep. For example, enhanced &lt;1 Hz EEG activity in early NREM sleep improves memory functions in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>), whereas in mice the mGluR5 signaling complex is important for the consolidation of contextual memory in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 1997</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional mGluR5 availability predicts EEG low (&lt;1 Hz) activity in NREM sleep</title><p>The slow (&lt;1 Hz) rhythm in the human EEG and its cellular counterpart, the slow oscillation, are characterized by brief sequences of membrane depolarization and intense neuronal firing (up-states), followed by membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silence (down-states) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achermann and Borbély, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steriade, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>). In vitro and in vivo data suggest that mGluR1 and mGluR5 contribute to the regulation of the slow oscillation and the associated fluctuations in the membrane potential between up-states and down-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hays et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>). While other mechanisms regulating cortico-thalamic interactions and excitability of cortical neurons are likely also involved, these observations are consistent with the striking positive association found in this study between global mGluR5 availability and &lt;1 Hz EEG activity, suggesting that mGluR5 may be important for maintaining or generating this slow rhythm. The slow oscillation and the corresponding down-state may provide a period of reduced synaptic inputs and be important for neuronal maintenance and rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013</xref>). Our data indicate that these rest periods are regulated or gated by mGluR5. Intriguingly, the slow &lt;1 Hz rhythm has been associated with increased blood flow in precuneus, posterior cingulate, as well as medial frontal, parietal, and central gyri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang-Vu et al., 2008</xref>). These brain regions are almost identical with those where we observed the strongest associations between mGluR5 availability and EEG &lt;1 Hz activity.

In this way, Homer1a buffers in activity-dependent manner the mGluR5-dependent release of calcium from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bottai et al., 2002</xref>). The two metabolites found to be associated with mGluR5 availability and sleep deprivation, myo-inositol and glycine, are both linked to the mGluR5-Homer1a-IP<sub>3</sub> signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berridge, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moghaddam and Javitt, 2012</xref>). Myo-inositol is the most abundant inositol derivative in the brain and a structural precursor of IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croze and Soulage, 2013</xref>). The positive association with mGluR5 availability suggests that the two molecules are tightly linked in the human brain. Moreover, myo-inositol was previously shown to be inversely coupled to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). A plausible interpretation of the present data could be that the sleep deprivation-induced reduction in myo-inositol is caused by increased activation of mGluR5 after sleep loss, which triggers the formation of IP<sub>3</sub> at the cost of myo-inositol. Future studies are warranted to corroborate this possible underlying mechanism.</p><p>Glycine is an important allosteric modulator of glutamatergic NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson and Ascher, 1987</xref>) and activation of mGluR5 triggers enhanced activity of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Awad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conn and Pin, 1997</xref>). The concomitant sleep loss-induced rise in glycine and the availability of mGluR5 suggest that NMDA receptor activation is enhanced after sleep deprivation. Indeed, in vitro electrophysiological analyses and immunoblotting of purified synaptosomes demonstrated that insufficient sleep alters NMDA receptor subunit composition and functions, whereas recovery sleep reverses these sleep deprivation-induced changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, studies in rats revealed that glycine in low doses promotes wakefulness and reduces sleepiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bannai et al., 2012</xref>), whereas high doses of glycine rather promote NREM and REM sleep in a NMDA receptor-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>). In view of the diverse effects of glycine on wakefulness and sleep, the elusive mechanisms underlying its rise by sleep deprivation, as well as glycine’s varying functions in different neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeilhofer, 2005</xref>) the present data need to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the spectroscopic findings may indicate that the mGluR5-associated Homer1a-IP<sub>3</sub> and glycine-NMDA receptor pathways importantly contribute to the molecular machinery that regulates sleep-wake homeostasis in humans and open up promising new avenues for future research.</p><p>It may be noteworthy that the endogenous ligand of mGluR5, glutamate, and the related metabolites, glutamine and γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA), were not altered by sleep deprivation nor associated with the availability of mGluR5 (t<sub>15</sub> &lt; 0.67, p<sub>all</sub> &gt; 0.5; data not shown). This observation suggests that the association between functional mGluR5 availability and sleep deprivation likely does not reflect upstream changes in glutamatergic signaling. Nevertheless, because PET and <sup>1</sup>H-MRS imaging were slightly displaced and the spectroscopic data were acquired from a single voxel, future studies are needed to establish the generalizability of this notion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Genetic loss-of-function of mGluR5 in mice causes dysregulation of sleep-wake patterns and sleep EEG delta activity</title><p>The baseline sleep-wake pattern in mice without functional mGluR5 was similar as in their littermates, although a slight variation in the distribution of NREM sleep, REM sleep and wakefulness during the light phase was present. When sleep homeostasis was challenged by sleep deprivation, however, a clear dysregulation of wakefulness and sleep became apparent. The KO animals not only lacked the normal rebound in NREM and REM sleep in the recovery dark phase, they even lost roughly half an hour of NREM sleep when compared to baseline. This is in striking contrast to more than 1 hr of sleep gained in HT and WT mice by the end of the recovery period. To our knowledge, no comparable sleep-wake phenotype has ever been described in the literature in an animal model before. The data corroborate that functional mGluR5 are necessary for maintaining the normal physiologic homeostatic sleep response to sleep deprivation.</p><p>Already in baseline, the KO mice showed a markedly attenuated build-up in delta power during spontaneous wakefulness, although the distribution of vigilance states was comparable to the other genotypes. When challenged with sleep deprivation, both KO and HT animals showed an reduced build-up of delta power, resulting in lower values at the beginning of the recovery light phase when compared to WT littermates. In accordance with our findings, a diminished rebound in NREM sleep EEG delta power after prolonged wakefulness in <italic>Grm5</italic> KO animals was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahnaou et al., 2015b</xref>). Nevertheless, the profound changes in sleep amounts and the dynamics of EEG delta power observed here were not found in the previous study. The discrepancy between the studies may be due to several methodological differences, in particular the use of an automated sleep deprivation technique by the other authors which induces forced locomotion. Forced locomotion causes stereotypic behavior unequal to normal wakefulness and the dissipation of sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, unlike the previous report, we also studied a HT group and found an intermediate phenotype between the WT and KO mice. This gene dose-effect relationship further highlights the importance of mGluR5 for the sleep-wake-dependent regulation of delta activity in NREM sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Lack of mGluR5 compromises adjustment to novel environment after sleep deprivation</title><p>Consistent with previously reported deficits in various learning and memory paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jia et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manahan-Vaughan and Braunewell, 2005</xref>), <italic>Grm5</italic> KO mice performed worse than WT and HT littermates in a Y-maze working-memory task. In addition, KO animals initially explored less and were compromised in adapting exploratory behavior to the novel environment when sleep deprived.

One and 6 days after initial testing, however, the sleep deprived animals reduced exploratory activity to a lesser extent than the non-sleep deprived controls. Thus, acute sleep deprivation appears to induce a long-lasting impairment of the normal habituation to a novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolivar, 2009</xref>). Mice lacking functional mGluR5 were particularly sensitive to this impairment, suggesting that mGluR5 contribute to the beneficial role of sleep to habituate to stressful conditions.

The question remains whether increased mGluR5 availability is a compensatory mechanism to promote wakefulness in the sleep-deprived state, signals the necessity to sleep, or both. Recent studies investigating the effects of positive and negative allosteric modulators of mGluR5 in rats may help to tackle this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahnaou et al., 2015a</xref>). It was found that the positive allosteric modulator, ADX47273, promoted wakefulness and reduced NREM sleep and total sleep time. On the contrary, the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator, MPEP (2-methyl-6-(2-phenylethynyl)pyridine;hydrochloride), increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Thus, sleep-wake-dependent changes in mGluR5 signaling may aid or facilitate sustained wakefulness and the proper homeostatic build-up of sleep propensity during wakefulness as reflected in EEG delta power in NREM sleep. At the same time, mGluR5-dependent mechanisms may promote and maintain deep sleep rich of slow waves. As such, mGluR5 could provide a promising new target for sleep-wake enhancing compounds, which may be beneficial in treating sleep-wake disorders such as hypersomnia or insomnia. Furthermore, behavioral studies will have to determine whether interventions targeting mGluR5 may promote sleep-associated brain functions such a memory consolidation and stress resilience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (1964) and approved by the cantonal (ethics committee for research on human subjects of the canon of Zurich [Reference Nr.

Anatomical whole-brain T1-weighted three-dimensional fast gradient echo MRI scans (180 slices, FOV = 220 mm, matrix = 224 × 224 reconstructed to 256 × 256, voxel size = 0.98 × 0.98 × 1.5 mm) were obtained to exclude subjects with morphological abnormalities, in order to co-register MR and PET images for accurate cerebellum delineation and to accurately position the <sup>1</sup>H-MRS voxels.</p><p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) data were acquired from a single 9 ml voxel (25 × 18 × 20 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in the bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) using a birdcage transmit-receive head coil with a maximum radiofrequency field strength (B<sub>1</sub>) of 20 μT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ernst et al., 2017</xref>). The <sup>1</sup>H-MRS was performed using a maximum echo-sampled 2-D J-resolved point-resolved spectroscopy (JPRESS) sequence (relaxation time (T<sub>R</sub>) of 1600 ms, echo time (T<sub>E</sub>) ranging from 26 to 224 ms with step size of 2 ms, 100 encoding steps, eight averages per step) with variable power and optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR) water and interleaved inner volume suppression. <sup>1</sup>H-MRS acquisitions lasted 22 min and allowed for the quantification of 17 metabolites. Besides the three metabolites directly associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission: glutamate, glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA); an additional 14 metabolites were quantified, including: total creatine and phosphocreatine, n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid (NAAG), total choline, myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, glucose, lactate, taurine, glycine, glutathione, phosphoethanolamine, aspartate, and ascorbic acid. MR-spectra quantification was improved by ProFit 2.0 fitting, a method which has been extensively validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>). Prototypical projections of 2-D J-PRESS spectra including spectral fit and residuals of the pgACC in sleep control and sleep deprived condition for one representative individual are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>.</p><p>Because the two <sup>1</sup>H-MRS scans were always performed consecutively, the effect of scan-order and sleep deprivation (condition) was assessed using two-way repeated measure ANOVAs. Applying internal water as a reference, total creatine was observed to be significantly altered by scan-order (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 4.91, p&lt;0.05). Because of this instability in creatine, metabolite levels were all referenced to internal water. The water referenced values were corrected for segmentation-based volume tissue composition and relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasparovic et al., 2006</xref>). Individual T2 relaxation correction were performed in ProFit 2.0, with the resulting metabolite concentrations reported in arbitrary units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hulka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the quality of the ProFit 2.0 fit, the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) was used as an internal control for each metabolite peak. Metabolite estimates with CRLBs &gt; 20% were excluded. Because of movement artifacts or CRLBs &gt; 20%, one spectrum had to be excluded in the sleep deprived condition. The quality criterion based on the CRLBs resulted in exclusion of a few data points. This applied especially to the analysis of the smaller GABA peak, in which n = 13 (control condition) and n = 10 (sleep deprivation condition) could be included. For the analyses of glutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol and glycine, n = 17 (control condition) and n = 14 (sleep deprivation condition) were included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>EEG and polysomnographic recordings</title><p>Continuous polygraphic recordings were conducted during PET scans and in all experimental nights. The EEG, electrooculogram (EOG), submental electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded with Rembrandt Datalab, Version 8 (Embla Systems, Planegg, Germany) using an Artisan polygraphic amplifier (Micromed, Mogliano Veneto, Italy). During PET image acquisition, subjects were instructed not to fall asleep and in case of sleep-like EEG activity, they were alerted via intercom. The EEG recordings were started shortly before initiation of PET imaging. The recording durations were virtually identical in the two conditions: baseline: 67.3 ± 1.0 min; sleep deprivation: 67.3 ± 0.7 min (p &gt; 0.95). The amounts of intermittent N1 sleep expressed as a percentage of measurement time were analyzed.</p><p>The analog EEG signals were sampled at 256 Hz and conditioned by high-pass (−3 dB at 0.15–0.16 Hz) and low-pass filtering (−3 dB at 67.2 Hz). The EEG was recorded from one referential (C3M2) and eight bipolar derivations; the data of the C3M2 derivation are reported here. Sleep stages were visually scored in 20 s epochs according to standard criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iber et al., 2007</xref>). Four-second EEG spectra (fast Fourier transform [FFT] routine, Hanning window, 0.25 Hz resolution; 0–20 Hz) were calculated with MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA), averaged over five consecutive epochs, and matched with scored sleep stages. Arousal- and movement-related artifacts were visually identified and eliminated. Mean slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power within 0.5–4.5 Hz) and power in the frequency range of the sleep slow oscillation (power within 0.25–1.0 Hz) in the first NREM sleep (stages N1–N) episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feinberg and Floyd, 1979</xref>) were calculated in each participant in the baseline night of the first study block and in the recovery night after sleep deprivation.

A 6 hr sleep deprivation started at light onset (ZT [zeitgeber] 0 to 6) of the third day and was achieved by so called ‘gentle handling’. During this procedure, animals are not handled but the bedding material is gently moved, the cage tapped, or novel objects introduced as soon as behavioral signs of sleep appeared. In addition, mice are provided with a clean cage halfway during the sleep deprivation (ZT 3), which provides additional stimulation. The sleep deprivation was followed by a 18 hr recording period during which recovery from sleep deprivation was quantified (n = 8 mice/genotype).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>EEG/EMG implantation and recordings</title><p>Surgery for fronto‐parietal EEG recordings was performed under deep ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (intraperitoneal injection, 75 and 10 mg/kg at a volume of 10 ml/kg) at 10‐12 weeks of age. EEG/EMG signals were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mang and Franken, 2012</xref>). Briefly, six gold-plated mini‐screws (1.1 mm diameter) were implanted over frontal and parietal cortices. Over the right hemisphere, two screws soldered to the recording leads prior to implantation, served as frontal (1.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.7 mm lateral to midline) and parietal (1.0 mm anterior to lambda, 1.7 mm lateral to midline) electrodes. The remaining four screws served as anchors. For EMG recordings two gold wires were inserted into the neck muscle. Anchor screws, EEG and EMG electrodes were fixed to the skull by using dental cement. The incision was closed by stitching and animals received a 10 mg/kg dose of analgesic (Flunixine). Animals were allowed 5 days to recover, followed by a 6‐day habituation period, to adapt to the connecting cable. EEG/EMG signals were recorded with Somnologica (Somnologica Science 3.3.1.1529, Medcare), amplified, analog‐to‐digital converted (2 kHz) and down-sampled to 200 Hz. Power spectral analysis between 0–100 Hz was performed with FFT of 4 s epochs of frontal‐parietal differential EEG recordings, yielding a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz. The vigilance states wakefulness (W), REM sleep and NREM sleep were determined for consecutive 4 s epochs using standard criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mang and Franken, 2012</xref>).

In brief, absolute spectral power density (PSD) between 0.75 and 49 Hz in 0.25 Hz bins was measured for each vigilance state and condition. To account for inter-individual differences in total EEG power, overall reference values were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franken et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mang et al., 2016</xref>). This was done by calculating the area under the PSD curve per vigilance state for baseline and multiplying it by the percentage of contributing epochs per 24 hr. The sum of weighted values corresponds to the total power reference values used for further analysis. Absolute state specific power (i.e. Wake, NREM, REM separately), was divided by the total power reference value of the respective mouse, to obtain the relative power data used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Time course analysis of EEG delta power</title><p>The time course of delta power (0.75–4 Hz) in NREM sleep was computed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franken et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maret et al., 2007</xref>).

In brief, all animals were exposed to a Plexiglas tunnel for 3 days before the first experimental session. They were habituated by gently picking them up repeatedly for 30 s with the tunnel and allowing them to recover for 1 min in between. This protocol was repeated on 2 days, twice per day at random time points, during the week prior to the experiments.</p><p>To test working memory, continuous spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) was assessed in the Y-Maze (three arms of equal size symmetrically placed at 120°; inner length: 36.5 cm, width: 6 cm, height: 15 cm, color: grey) described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramanathan et al., 2010</xref>). Each mouse was picked up with the tunnel, released to the center of the maze and allowed to explore freely for 7 min, before being returned with the tunnel to the home cage. The maze was surrounded by black walls to avoid any extra-maze cues and cleaned with 1% acetic acid between mice. Testing was performed from ZT 22.5–24 in the dark phase, the main activity phase of mice, under indirect dim light (15 lux). Each animal was tested three times: run one at the end of the first recovery day after sleep deprivation (i.e. after 16.5 hr of recovery), run two followed 24 hr later, whereas run three was performed 1 week after sleep deprivation (6 days after run two). Number of control animals: 6 WT, 8 HT and 6 KO mice; numbers of sleep deprived animals: 7 WT, 9 HT and 10 KO mice. Mouse behavior in the maze was video-recorded from above and arm entry sequences assigned visually. Spontaneous alternations [%] were defined as successful entry sequences (i.e. all three arms visited in three consecutive entries) relative to possible successful entry sequences (i.e. total number of entries minus two). An arm was considered to be entered, when the mouse had placed all four paws within the walls of the arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes, 2004</xref>). Mice were tested in four batches.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Lazarus (Reviewer #2); Anita Lüthi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The present work is an interesting study combining human and mouse experimentation that lends further support to a molecular element in homeostatic sleep regulation: the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and associated signaling pathways. Direct measurements of mGluR5 availability and associated signaling in humans through PET and subsequent MRI are combined with spectral and behavioral assessments of sleep deprivation and early baseline sleep. Sleep-wake behavior in mGluR5-deficient mice unravels additional complex roles of this receptor in sleep-wake regulation and behavioral adaptation to sleep pressure.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors found that the availability of mGluR5 in human brain is positively correlated with EEG δ activity of recovery sleep. Consistent with the human results, they also found that mice without mGluR5 gene showed retarded increase of EEG δ power in the dark phase and after sleep deprivation. Consequently, the mGluR5 knockout mice showed greatly reduced rebound sleep after sleep deprivation. This study provides strong evidence for the function of mGluR5 in regulating mammalian sleep homeostasis, suggesting that mGluR5 is indispensable for the accumulation of sleep need after sustained wakefulness.</p><p>A sleep phenotype of mGluR5-/- mice has been reported by another group in 2015 (Ahnaou et al., 2015). The phenotype of mGluR5-/- mice described by Ahnaou et al. is somewhat different than reported here. In their study, the mGluR5-/- mice showed no increased wakefulness and no reduced NREM sleep after sleep deprivation. So the authors need to present and discuss these apparently contradictory results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The author's statements in subsection “Sleep deprivation-induced changes in brain metabolites reflect downstream markers of mGluR5 activation “(&quot;Collectively, mGluR5 contribute to sleep regulation by affecting downstream mechanisms of mGluR5-mediated protein phosphorylation and enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signaling&quot;) and subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans” (&quot;[…]but represents a molecular marker of elevated sleep need in response to sleep loss in humans.&quot;) are overreaching based on evidence provided by the human studies. One important question that the authors should address is mGluR5 availability or expression levels in sleep-deprived mice (wild-type and KO mice) as compared to control mice. This may provide a link between human imaging studies and mouse behavior to support their hypothesis that mGluR5 is important for sleep need.</p><p>2) The authors state in subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans” that &quot;A similar relationship was also observed for the entire 0.5-4.5 Hz band (yet not any other frequency band)[…] &quot;. It would be informative if the data for the other frequencies are shown.</p><p>3) The authors argue that altered EEG δ power dynamics are suggesting &quot;a deficient build-up of homeostatic sleep need in wakefulness&quot;. It is however possible that changes in δ power in the KO mice is independent from the homeostatic sleep need, because there are no differences in baseline sleep between the genotypes. Moreover, the statement &quot;… demonstrating a severely disturbed sleep homeostatic response to prolonged wakefulness.&quot; (subsection “Important role for mGluR5 in homeostatic response to sleep deprivation”) is at odds with Figure 5—figure supplement 1, in which the KO mice actually show a higher NREM sleep amount after sleep deprivation in the remaining light phase, indicating a homeostatic sleep response exists which may just be stronger than in wild-type mice during this period (i.e. the dissipation of sleep need may be enhanced).</p><p>4) In the Discussion section, the authors suggest that sleep loss causes an increase in glycine levels. What could be the reason for this rise in glycine by sleep deprivation? Without a reasonable explanation, it is possible that this is unrelated to the mGluR5/NMDA signalling system.</p><p>5) The statement &quot;Thus, increased mGluR5 signaling during prolonged periods of spontaneous or enforced wakefulness may aid or facilitate sustained wakefulness&quot; (subsection “Lack of mGluR5 compromises adjustment to novel environment after sleep deprivation”) is inconsistent with the fact that mGluR5 KO mice have a lower amount of recovery sleep and SWA. The authors need to define more carefully the role of mGluR5 in sleep (or wake) regulation. What does a prolonged period of spontaneous wakefulness look like?</p><p>6) One asset of this work is the combination of studies on human and mouse. Could this be pushed even further? The human studies include recovery sleep after sleep deprivation. Were there interindividual variabilities in this recovery sleep that correlated with the availability of mGluR5? Can anything be said about the activity profile in the day after recovery sleep?</p><p>7) The interindividual variability in mGluR5 availability and its correlation with baseline sleep properties a remarkable observation that can help explain basic differences in sleep need. Have any assessments been done with the subjects in this direction, e.g. via questionnaires? Were there any differences in mood-related behaviors?</p><p>8) The interindividual variability should be better emphasized in the paper. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it is not clear which points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> relate to the points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, it can be guessed that there is a subgroup of subjects that show particularly large increases in mGluR5 availability. Were low mGluR5-expressers particularly vulnerable to SD in terms of mGluR5 changes?</p><p>9) Why were maximal availability increases after SD not higher than the maximal availability values in baseline?</p><p>10) The use of frequency bands in the power spectra of NREM sleep needs to be better described. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the full δ (0.5-4 Hz) and the high δ (2-4 Hz) bands are analyzed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it is the slow wave band (&lt; 1 Hz) that is emphasized. Although it is very interesting to note that in particular power in the high δ band correlates with mGluR5 increases, this needs to be clearly motivated. Same for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>11) Homer 1a is also upregulated with SD, and Homer1a uncouples mGluR5 from its intracellular signaling partners. However, myo-inositol levels are decreased in a manner that correlate with decreases in mGluR5 levels. Are decreased myo-inositol levels also correlated with enhanced low-frequency power levels in the spectrogram? Is this to conclude that augmented mGluR5 activation overcomes Homer1a upregulation? The results seemed to be pointing to this somewhat paradoxical situation, and should be further discussed.</p><p>12) Three subjects were excluded from PET imaging, so why n =26 in subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans”?</p><p>13) In a supplementary figure, can example metabolites be presented to better illustrate the criteria for exclusion/inclusion as described in subsection “Sleep deprivation-induced changes in brain metabolites reflect downstream markers of mGluR5 activation”?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28751.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors found that the availability of mGluR5 in human brain is positively correlated with EEG δ activity of recovery sleep.

(2015) reported reduced EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) and sleep drive in mGluR5 knock-out (KO) mice after sleep deprivation. However, the profound changes in sleep amounts and EEG δ power in the dark period after sleep deprivation were not found by the previous authors. The discrepancy may be due to several methodological differences between the studies, including different durations and techniques of sleep deprivation (automated procedure vs. gentle handling), different EEG-EMG recording devices (implants vs. cables), etc. Most importantly, Ahnaou et al. employed an automated sleep deprivation technique with forced locomotion during 8 hours, while we have used the well-established gentle handling sleep deprivation for 6 hours. Prolonged forced locomotion induces a stereotypic behavior different from normal wakefulness, which decreases cortical activity and the rebound in subsequent sleep δ activity (Fisher et al., 2016; Franken et al., 2001). In the revised manuscript, we write (subsection “Genetic loss-of-function of mGluR5 in mice causes dysregulation of sleep-wake patterns and sleep EEG δ activity”): “In accordance with our findings, a diminished rebound in NREM sleep EEG δ power after prolonged wakefulness in mGluR5 KO animals was reported previously (Ahnaou et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the profound changes in sleep amounts and the dynamics of EEG δ power observed here were not found in the previous study. The discrepancy between the studies may be due to several methodological differences, in particular the use of an automated sleep deprivation technique by the other authors which induces forced locomotion. Forced locomotion causes stereotypic behavior unequal to normal wakefulness and the dissipation of sleep pressure (Fisher et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The author's statements in subsection “Sleep deprivation-induced changes in brain metabolites reflect downstream markers of mGluR5 activation “(&quot;Collectively, mGluR5 contribute to sleep regulation by affecting downstream mechanisms of mGluR5-mediated protein phosphorylation and enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signaling&quot;) and subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans” (&quot;…, but represents a molecular marker of elevated sleep need in response to sleep loss in humans.&quot;) are overreaching based on evidence provided by the human studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the above statements are overreaching based on the data presented. However, we have been more careful in interpreting our results than implied above. In subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans“, we wrote in the original version of the manuscript: “These results provide the first puzzle piece of evidence for the hypothesis that functional mGluR5 availability not only correlates with absolute low-frequency EEG power, but represents a molecular marker of elevated sleep need in response to sleep loss in humans.” Furthermore, in subsection “Sleep deprivation-induced changes in brain metabolites may reflect downstream markers of mGluR5 activation”, we were careful in writing: “Collectively, these findings suggest that mGluR5 contribute to sleep regulation by affecting downstream mechanisms of mGluR5-mediated protein phosphorylation and enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signaling.” To be even more careful, we added “may suggest” in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One important question that the authors should address is mGluR5 availability or expression levels in sleep-deprived mice (wild-type and KO mice) as compared to control mice. This may provide a link between human imaging studies and mouse behavior to support their hypothesis that mGluR5 is important for sleep need.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers’ for the suggestion. We performed qPCR analyses of mGluR5 mRNA expression extracted from cortex, hippocampus and striatum in mGluR5 wild type (WT), heterozygous (HT) and KO mice and found no consistent effect of sleep deprivation on mGluR5 mRNA expression. We report these experiments in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>Other authors recently also failed to find differences in mGluR5 protein expression between wakefulness and sleep (Diering et al., 2017, Figure S1). Therefore, the sleep deprivation-induced changes in mGluR5 availability found in our human experiment are likely to indicate a functional synaptic change due to receptor trafficking rather than a change in overall mRNA or protein levels. To replicate the human findings in mice, autoradiographic quantification could be performed in future studies. We write in the revised version of the manuscript (subsection “Lack of mGluR5 in mice interferes with sleep rebound after sleep deprivation “): “Furthermore, we performed qPCR analyses of mGluR5 mRNA expression extracted from cortex, hippocampus and striatum in mGluR5 WT, HT and KO mice after sleep control and sleep deprivation. While mGluR5 expression importantly varied according to allele ‘dose’, we did not observe a consistent effect of sleep loss on mGluR5 mRNA expression in WT and HT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, other authors recently failed to find differences in mGluR5 protein expression between wakefulness and sleep (Diering et al., 2017). Therefore, the sleep deprivation-induced changes in mGluR5 availability we found in our human experiment are likely representing a functional synaptic change due to receptor trafficking rather than changes in overall mRNA or protein levels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state in subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans” that &quot;A similar relationship was also observed for the entire 0.5-4.5 Hz band (yet not any other frequency band)…, &quot;. It would be informative if the data for the other frequencies are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree that the higher frequency bands are interesting and potentially valuable to present. They were omitted in the original manuscript because the statistical analyses revealed no significant correlations with regional mGluR5 availability. We now present a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, including the correlation analyses for five predefined frequency ranges between 0.5 and 20 Hz. We emphasize in the revised manuscript that with the exception of the δ band, the statistical results do not withstand correction for multiple comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that altered EEG δ power dynamics are suggesting &quot;a deficient build-up of homeostatic sleep need in wakefulness&quot;. It is however possible that changes in δ power in the KO mice is independent from the homeostatic sleep need, because there are no differences in baseline sleep between the genotypes. Moreover, the statement &quot;… demonstrating a severely disturbed sleep homeostatic response to prolonged wakefulness.&quot; (subsection “Important role for mGluR5 in homeostatic response to sleep deprivation”) is at odds with Figure 5—figure supplement 1, in which the KO mice actually show a higher NREM sleep amount after sleep deprivation in the remaining light phase, indicating a homeostatic sleep response exists which may just be stronger than in wild-type mice during this period (i.e. the dissipation of sleep need may be enhanced).</p></disp-quote><p>Baseline differences in time-spent-asleep cannot be taken as evidence of a different homeostatic ‘need’. That would imply that all sleep expressed under undisturbed baseline conditions is homeostatically defended, which we know is not the case and we also know that factors other than homeostatic drive can influence undisturbed time-spent asleep. Moreover, would less sleep time signal a higher sleep pressure as a result of sleeping less or a reduced need for sleep?</p><p>The sleep-wake dependent changes in δ power are widely used as markers of momentary sleep ‘need’ because the longer one is awake, the higher δ power in subsequent NREM sleep will be. Thus, the lack of a genotype difference in the amount and distribution of sleep during baseline in the presence of a marked blunting of the build-up of δ power in the dark or active period shows that the quantitative relationship between time-spent-awake and δ power is severely altered in KO mice. If the reviewers can agree that δ power is a marker of a homeostatic process then one is allowed to interpret this finding to indicate that per unit time spent awake sleep need increases less when mGluR5 is missing. The observations made after an enforced period of wakefulness (i.e., sleep deprivation) confirms this interpretation. By contrast, δ power normally decays during sleep (i.e., during the light periods of baseline and recovery).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Discussion section, the authors suggest that sleep loss causes an increase in glycine levels. What could be the reason for this rise in glycine by sleep deprivation? Without a reasonable explanation, it is possible that this is unrelated to the mGluR5/NMDA signalling system.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the spectroscopic data of our study need to be interpreted with caution, yet they open up possibly promising new avenues for future research. We added a cautionary note in the Discussion section: “In view of the diverse effects of glycine on wakefulness and sleep, the elusive mechanisms underlying its rise by sleep deprivation, as well as glycine’s varying functions in different neuronal circuits (Giber et al., 2015; Zeilhofer, 2005), the present data need to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the spectroscopic findings may indicate that the mGluR5-associated Homer1a-IP<sub>3</sub> and glycine-NMDA receptor pathways importantly contribute to the molecular machinery that regulates sleep-wake homeostasis in humans and open up promising new avenues for future research.”</p><p>5) The statement &quot;Thus, increased mGluR5 signaling during prolonged periods of spontaneous or enforced wakefulness may aid or facilitate sustained wakefulness&quot; (subsection “Lack of mGluR5 compromises adjustment to novel environment after sleep deprivation”) is inconsistent with the fact that mGluR5 KO mice have a lower amount of recovery sleep and SWA. The authors need to define more carefully the role of mGluR5 in sleep (or wake) regulation. What does a prolonged period of spontaneous wakefulness look like?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this part of the Discussion section was partially unprecise. We revised the respective paragraph: “Thus, sleep-wake dependent changes in mGluR5 signaling may aid or facilitate sustained wakefulness and the proper homeostatic build-up of sleep propensity during wakefulness as reflected in EEG δ power in NREM sleep. At the same time, mGluR5-dependent mechanisms may promote and maintain deep sleep rich of slow waves.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One asset of this work is the combination of studies on human and mouse. Could this be pushed even further? The human studies include recovery sleep after sleep deprivation. Were there interindividual variabilities in this recovery sleep that correlated with the availability of mGluR5? Can anything be said about the activity profile in the day after recovery sleep?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their detailed interest in these results.</p><p>To further investigate the relationships between recovery sleep after sleep deprivation and inter-individual variation in mGluR5 availability, we created additional supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. First, we subdivided the data by median split into study participants with low and high change in global mGluR5 availability after sleep deprivation, and compared the effect of prolonged wakefulness on EEG δ and slow-oscillation activity. These analyses revealed that the group with a minor change in mGluR5 availability also showed a significantly reduced increase in δ and &lt; 1 Hz activity when compared to the group with a more pronounced increase in mGluR5. By contrast, neither theta, α, σ (p = 0.06) nor β activity were differently changed by sleep deprivation in the two groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The interindividual variability in mGluR5 availability and its correlation with baseline sleep properties a remarkable observation that can help explain basic differences in sleep need.

Were there any differences in mood-related behaviors?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this interesting question.</p><p>The associations between sleep deprivation-induced changes in subjective measures and mGluR5 availability were the focus of our previous publication (Hefti et al. 2013). The current manuscript focuses on the associations between objective markers of elevated sleep need after prolonged wakefulness and mGluR5 availability.</p><p>Given the interesting nature of the above question, however, we performed additional analyses to shed some light on possible associations between mGluR5 availability in baseline and mood. Mood assessments with the 24-item Profile of Mood States (POMS) were performed at 3-hour intervals during extended waking and before each imaging session. Investigating POMS scores collected immediately before the baseline PET scans, and the average scores for the six assessments across the baseline day, did not reveal significant correlations with global mGluR5 availability in baseline (p<sub>all</sub> &gt; 0.1). Variables tested included the total mood score and the subcategories depression, fatigue, vigor and irritability. Given the negative statistical tests results, these new analyses are not included in the manuscript. It needs to be kept in mind, however, that a homogenous group of carefully screened healthy volunteers was studied.</p><p>Whether mGluR5 availability in specific brain regions could be associated with mood measures (such as found in depressed patients; Deschwanden et al., 2011) or whether other mood questionnaires or test scores may be more sensitive than the POMS to capture interindividual variation in mGluR5 availability remain possible subjects for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The interindividual variability should be better emphasized in the paper. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it is not clear which points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> relate to the points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, it can be guessed that there is a subgroup of subjects that show particularly large increases in mGluR5 availability. Were low mGluR5-expressers particularly vulnerable to SD in terms of mGluR5 changes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the inter-subject variability in mGluR5 availability and individual responses to sleep deprivation can be better illustrated. To show each individual’s response, we created an additional supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In addition, we split the subjects based on either low (n = 11) or high (n = 12) global mGluR5 availability at baseline (median split) and found that those study participants with a lower baseline expression of mGluR5 exhibit a significantly larger increase by sleep loss than those participants with a higher baseline mGluR5 availability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Why were maximal availability increases after SD not higher than the maximal availability values in baseline?</p></disp-quote><p>The global change in mGluR5 availability by sleep deprivation equals roughly 5% , which makes it difficult to capture with the naked eye. As illustrated above (reviewer item # 8), the participants with the highest mGluR5 availability in baseline typically showed a minor increase, or even a slight decrease, in mGluR5 availability after sleep deprivation. Interestingly, a similar bi-directional relationship was recently reported for the effects of sleep deprivation on markers of associative synaptic plasticity in the human cortex (Kuhn et al., 2016). These authors suggested that their findings could be explained by the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro theory of bi-directional synaptic plasticity, stating that the threshold for LTP (long-term potentiation/LTD (long-term depression) induction is adjusted to the level of prior synaptic activity (Bienenstock et al., 1982). Our data may offer the fascinating possibility that sleep deprivation-induced changes in mGluR5 availability provide a molecular substrate contributing to the observed effects of sleep loss on LTP- and LTD-like plasticity. Alternatively, high baseline mGluR5 availability may be difficult to increase further by increased time awake and the data may reflect a ceiling effect. Further studies are necessary to investigate the different hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The use of frequency bands in the power spectra of NREM sleep needs to be better described. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the full δ (0.5-4 Hz) and the high δ (2-4 Hz) bands are analyzed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it is the slow wave band (&lt; 1 Hz) that is emphasized. Although it is very interesting to note that in particular power in the high δ band correlates with mGluR5 increases, this needs to be clearly motivated. Same for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the presentation of the different frequency bands could have been better explained in the manuscript.</p><p>The study’s primary aim was to address the hypothesis that mGluR5-related mechanisms are associated with sleep homeostasis. For that reason, we focused on the EEG δ range below 5 Hz. In the initial analysis steps, we only considered frequency bands relevant if multiple adjacent frequency bins showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlation between mGluR5 availability and consecutive 0.25-Hz bins in the EEG δ range at baseline and sleep deprivation. This analysis revealed highly significant correlations in the bins &lt; 1 Hz. Interestingly, the 0.5-4.5 Hz band remained significant yet generally with lower correlation coefficients than the &lt; 1 Hz bins. When examining the relative correlations, i.e., how EEG activity and mGluR5 availability changed with sleep deprivation, the high δ range &gt; 2 Hz was significant.</p><p>To further illustrate the frequency specificity of these associations, the figure below shows the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between global mGluR5 availability and EEG power between 0-20 Hz at baseline, sleep deprivation and the change caused by sleep loss. The green lines indicate r-values that are above (or below) the a = 0.05 significance threshold. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> illustrates that the 2-4 Hz range is relevant for the change after sleep deprivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Homer 1a is also upregulated with SD, and Homer1a uncouples mGluR5 from its intracellular signaling partners. However, myo-inositol levels are decreased in a manner that correlate with decreases in mGluR5 levels. Are decreased myo-inositol levels also correlated with enhanced low-frequency power levels in the spectrogram? Is this to conclude that augmented mGluR5 activation overcomes Homer1a upregulation? The results seemed to be pointing to this somewhat paradoxical situation, and should be further discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, which is difficult to answer at present.</p><p>As discussed in the manuscript, our results are in line with published data in rats showing that myo-inositol is inversely correlated with neuronal activity (Xu et al., 2005). In addition, our findings are consistent with a very recent publication (available on-line) in male adolescents reporting that frontal cortex myo-inositol levels correlated negatively with subjective sleepiness and positively with total sleep time (Urrila et al., in press). We did not measure Homer1a expression in humans before and after sleep deprivation, nor, to our knowledge, has this been quantified in any other published study. Future work is warranted, to simultaneously quantify mGluR5 and Homer1a expression as a function of time awake.</p><p>When correlating myo-inositol concentrations with EEG power in the low frequency range, we found marginally significant associations with &lt; 1-Hz activity (baseline: r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.06; sleep deprivation: r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.02). By contrast, the sleep deprivation-induced change in myo-inositol did not correlate significantly with the relative changes in single 0.25-Hz bins and the entire band within the 0.5-4.5 Hz range after sleep deprivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Three subjects were excluded from PET imaging, so why n =26 in subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans”?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this mistake. It has been corrected in the revised manuscript (subsection “mGluR5 availability predicts behavioral and EEG markers of sleep need in humans”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In a supplementary figure, can example metabolites be presented to better illustrate the criteria for exclusion/inclusion as described in subsection “Sleep deprivation-induced changes in brain metabolites reflect downstream markers of mGluR5 activation”?</p></disp-quote><p>To better illustrate the criteria for the selection of relevant metabolites, the statistical test results are summarized in the Table below.
