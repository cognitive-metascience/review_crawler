polyomaviruses, we identified a peptide derived from the BK polyomavirus (BKV) minor structural proteins VP2/3 that is a potent inhibitor of BKV infection with no observable cellular toxicity. The thirteen-residue peptide binds to major structural protein VP1 with single-digit nanomolar affinity. Alanine-scanning of the peptide identified three key residues, substitution of each of which results in ~1000 fold loss of binding affinity with a concomitant reduction in antiviral activity. Structural studies demonstrate specific binding of the peptide to the pore of pentameric VP1. Cell-based assays demonstrate nanomolar inhibition (EC<sub>50</sub>) of BKV infection and suggest that the peptide acts early in the viral entry pathway. Homologous peptide exhibits similar binding to JC polyomavirus VP1 and inhibits infection with similar potency to BKV in a model cell line. Lastly, these studies validate targeting the VP1 pore as a novel strategy for the development of anti-polyomavirus agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BK polyomavirus</kwd><kwd>JC polyomavirus</kwd><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>Joshua R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaul</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name><name><surname>Frommlet</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Andreas O</given-names></name><name><surname>Knapp</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Bussiere</surname><given-names>Dirksen E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Ornelas</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuellar</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Hyrina</surname><given-names>Anastasia</given-names></name><name><surname>Abend</surname><given-names>Johanna R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wartchow</surname><given-names>Charles A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>Joshua R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A peptide derived from BK and JC polyomavirus protein VP2/3 inhibits viral infection by targeting a binding site in the pore of polyomavirus VP1 pentamers, enabling future VP1-targeted therapeutic strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>BK polyomavirus (BKV), also known as human polyomavirus 1, is a small non-enveloped virus with a circular double-stranded DNA genome. BKV was first isolated from an immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipient in 1971 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gardner et al., 1971</xref>), and is among the few clinically important human polyomaviruses, including JC polyomavirus (JCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Padgett et al., 1971</xref>) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). BKV is ubiquitous in human populations, with an estimatedÂ ~80% sero-prevalence worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knowles, 2006</xref>). Primary exposure to BKV occurs in early childhood, with 50% of 3-year-olds and over 90% of 10-year-olds testing sero-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Knowles, 2001</xref>). Post-exposure, BKV infection is characterized by subclinical persistence with kidney tissue suspected as the viral reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahsan and Shah, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heritage et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shinohara et al., 1993</xref>). Reactivation of BKV infection can occur in conditions of immunosuppression, particularly in the context of kidney and hematopoietic cell transplantation. BKV infection in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is first evident as viruria (20â70% of KTRs), which can progress to viremia (10â60%); BKV nephropathy (BKVN) is diagnosed in 3â4% of KTRs and 15â50% of those patients will suffer graft loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambalathingal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuypers, 2012</xref>). The primary course of care for treating BKVN is reduction of immunosuppressive therapy which carries the risk of acute graft rejection; up to 30% of BKVN cases treated by reduction of immunosuppressive therapy will experience an acute rejection episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohl and Brennan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sood et al., 2012</xref>). BKV reactivation in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients can result in hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). In a recent study, 16.6% of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations developed HC with BKV detected in the urine in 90% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunde et al., 2015</xref>). There are currently no FDA-approved antiviral therapies for BKV, presenting an unmet medical need for these indications.</p><p>The lifecycle of BKV begins with virion binding to host GT1b and GD1b gangliosideÂ receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Low et al., 2006</xref>). The virus subsequently undergoes endocytosis via a caveolin-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eash et al., 2004</xref>) and is trafficked in endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moriyama and Sorokin, 2008</xref>), where a series of host cell enzymes orchestrate capsid disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schelhaas et al., 2007</xref>). The partially disassembled particle then interfaces with components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to undergo a critical step of retrotranslocation from the ER lumen into the host cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). Nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains within the capsid minor structural proteins then interact with components of the host nuclear pore complex to facilitate nuclear import of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2015</xref>), wherein host cell transcription machinery initiates viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helle et al., 2017</xref>). The BKV virion is not known to contain any enzymes, viral or host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fang et al., 2010</xref>); entry pathway steps are carried out via interactions between viral and host cell factors, and intra-virion interactions between the major and minor capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao and Imperiale, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The polyomavirus virion consists of a capsid formed by the major structural protein VP1 encapsidating the minor structural proteins VP2 and VP3, and the viral genome chromatinized with host histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cubitt, 2006</xref>). The capsid consists of 72 copies of homomeric VP1 pentamers cross-linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds to form a TÂ =Â 7d icosahedron structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nilsson et al., 2005</xref>). VP1 pentamers within the capsid interact via <italic>C</italic>-terminal arms. 12 pentamers are pentavalent forming contacts with five neighbor pentamers, andÂ theÂ remaining 60 are hexavalent forming contacts with six neighboring pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belnap et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prasad and Schmid, 2012</xref>). VP1 pentamers form a central pore with five-fold symmetry, at the base of which a single copy of VP2 or VP3 is bound, forming a 5+1 complex as elucidated by X-ray and cryo-EM structures of infectious virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hurdiss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurdiss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liddington et al., 1991</xref>). All three structural proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) contain DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clever et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Soussi, 1986</xref>) and make contacts with the viral genome inside the infectious virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carbone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurdiss et al., 2016</xref>). VP2 and VP3 share a reading frame, with BKV VP3 consisting of the 232 carboxy-terminal residues of VP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helle et al., 2017</xref>). Reconstitution of the VP1 pentamer with full-length VP2 or VP3 has yet to be achieved; reconstitution of VP1 with a truncated VP2 protein and the corresponding X-ray structure has been reported for murine polyomavirus, implicating a âloopingâ structure for VP2 with the <italic>C</italic>-terminus interacting near the âbaseâ, or inner virion-facing side, of the five-fold VP1 pentamer pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). Details of residues in the structural proteins contributing to the interactions of VP1 and VP2/3 have been elucidated primarily using either genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2015</xref>) or co-precipitation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barouch and Harrison, 1994</xref>). Through these experiments, a region shared by both VP2 and VP3 near the carboxy-terminus of both proteins has been identified as required for the interaction with VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakanishi et al., 2006</xref>). The biological function of the five-fold symmetry pore above the site of VP1-VP2/3 interactions at the base of capsid pentamers is not well defined. A study investigating the biological role of the JCV five-fold symmetry VP1 pentamer pore found substitution of pore residues did not interrupt VP1-VP2 interactions nor inhibit proper JCV pseudovirus (PSV) assembly; however, substitution of pore residues resulted in greatly reduced JCV PSV transduction and defective exposure of VP2 despite successful trafficking to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the inhibitory nature of the five-fold VP1 pentamer pore substitutions, the authors of the aforementioned study noted the pore may be a suitable target for small-molecule antiviral therapies against polyomaviruses. For simplicity when referring to regions of the five-fold symmetry pore, âtopâ indicates the region nearest the exterior of the virus, and âbottomâ or âlowerâ indicate the region nearest the interior of the virus.</p><p>In the current study, we report the discovery of a thirteen amino acid BKV VP2/3-derived peptide D1<sub>min</sub> (corresponding to VP2 residues 290â302) that binds to BKV VP1 pentamers with single-digit nanomolar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. We show that homologous peptide derived from JCV VP2/3 binds JCV VP1 with similar affinity, demonstrating a conserved binding interface. Protein-observed 2D NMR studies show this peptide interacts with VP1 residues in a previously uncharacterized location within the five-fold symmetry pore formed by pentameric VP1, with the binding location within the pore further corroborated by a structurally-guided model generated using X-ray data from co-complexed D1<sub>min</sub> and VP1. Treatment of cells with D1<sub>min</sub> in the context of BKV infection elicits nanomolar antiviral activity by the peptide, with a relationship established between peptide binding affinity to VP1 pentamers and antiviral potency by alanine-substitution of key peptide residues. Additionally, we show the peptide exhibits antiviral activity against JCV, potentially indicating a pan-antiviral mechanism. We demonstrate through cell-based assays that the antiviral mechanism of action (MoA) involves blocking key steps in the viral entry pathway, likely prior to the critical step of ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation. Mutations of residues in the VP1 pore that mediate peptide binding or of residues in the VP2/3 region from which the peptide is derived impact BKV infectivity, indicating the peptide-binding site may constitute a previously uncharacterized VP1-VP2/3 binding interface. In short, we report the first anti-BKV and anti-JCV molecule that directly targets the polyomavirus VP1 five-fold symmetry pentamer pore.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VP2/3-derived peptide binds pentameric capsid protein VP1 with high affinity</title><p>In order to better characterize the structural relationship between the BKV major structural protein VP1 and the minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3, we focused on a stretch of amino acids near the carboxyl-terminus of VP2/3 previously referenced as âD1â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakanishi et al., 2006</xref>). The region is largely invariant in related polyomaviruses JCV and simian virus 40 (SV40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We initially tested binding of a 22-mer peptide VP2<sub>281-302</sub> (APGGANQRTAPQWMLPLLLGLY; D1<sub>22</sub>) to purified BKV VP1 pentamers (VP1<sub>2-362</sub>) by Biacore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and measured high affinity binding to the pentamer (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â =Â 4.8 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The curve from a 1:1 interaction model overlays well with the SPR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with a high quality, specific interaction despite the hydrophobic nature of this peptide. In addition to directly measuring binding affinity by SPR, we developed an AlphaScreen assay to detect binding of carboxy-terminus biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> to VP1 and measure the half-maximal concentration at which the biotinylated peptide is displaced by unlabeled peptide (IC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> for unlabeled D1<sub>22</sub> is 11Â Â±Â 2.9 nM and this value is comparable to the SPR-determined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. We additionally tested the homologous D1<sub>22</sub> sequence from JCV with its cognate VP1 pentamer, and observed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 44Â Â±Â 6.4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Noting that protein-protein interactions often involve âmolecular hot spotsâ where most of the binding energy is associated with a limited number of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Roey et al., 2014</xref>), we split D1<sub>22</sub> into two fragments, VP2<sub>281-290</sub> (APGGANQRTA) and VP2<sub>290-302</sub> (APQWMLPLLLGLY, henceforth referred to as D1<sub>min</sub>), and tested each fragment for binding to VP1. While no binding was observed for VP2<sub>281-290</sub> up to 10 Î¼M (data not shown), we observed similar binding affinity for the 13-mer peptide D1<sub>min</sub> as was observed for D1<sub>22</sub> (VP2<sub>290-302</sub>; <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â =Â 1.4Â Â±Â 0.49 nM, IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 3.6Â Â±Â 0.57 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

pentamers by Biacore SPR and the AlphaScreen competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The SPR <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> and biochemical assay IC<sub>50</sub> results are comparable for the alanine-substituted peptides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Both assays identify peptideÂ residues W293, L297, and L298 as key determinants of high affinity binding, with each substitution causingÂ ~600â1000 fold loss of affinity to VP1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â =Â 920Â Â±Â 190 nM, 1600Â Â±Â 610 nM, and 1000Â Â±Â 160 nM, respectively). Alanine-substitution of other residues (M294, L295, L299, Y302) results in 40â60 fold loss of affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>), demonstrating that these may also contribute to binding affinity.</p><p>To see if we could further reduce the size of the peptide required for high affinity binding, we evaluated hexamer peptides covering the length of D1<sub>min</sub> in the AlphaScreen displacement assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All hexamer peptides were significantly less potent relative to D1<sub>min</sub>. Notably, peptide D1<sub>min</sub> HEX4 (<sub>293</sub>WMLPLL<sub>298</sub>) contains all three key determinant residues and yetÂ has an IC<sub>50</sub> that is greater than 1000-fold higher than that of full-length D1<sub>min</sub> peptide. Trimer peptides covering the length of D1<sub>min</sub> yielded similar results, showing greater than 1000-fold reductions in binding affinity to VP1 relative to the full-length D1<sub>min</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We conclude that the key D1<sub>min</sub> residues W293, L297, and L298 contribute significantly to the interaction of D1<sub>min</sub> and VP1; however, additional peptide residues are required for the highest affinity binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Peptide D1<sub>min</sub> binds within the upper pore of VP1 pentamers</title><p>In order to determine the bindingÂ location of the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide to VP1 pentamers, protein-observed 2D-NMR spectroscopy was performed. <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C-HMQC spectra of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>12</sup>C-BKV VP1<sub>30-297</sub> with <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C methyl-labeled residues Ile- (I), Leu- (L), Val- (V) and Thr- (T) were recorded in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of wild-type orÂ W293A D1<sub>min</sub> peptides, and ligand-induced chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) and line broadening were monitored. To enable mapping of binding locations we obtained peak assignments for select methyl groups through a combination of amino acid point mutations and a 4D-NOESY-HSQC based methyl walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Proudfoot et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The NMR peaks assigned to BKV VP1 residues T224, T226, V231 (pro-<italic>R</italic> and pro-<italic>S</italic>), and V234 (pro-<italic>R</italic> and pro-<italic>S</italic>) were greatly affected by the addition of the peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These residues are in close proximity to each other, clustering in the upper pore of the VP1 pentamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Binding of peptides to the upper pore appears specific since the site can be saturated (no additional CSPs observed at higher peptide concentrations) and only certain VP1 residues show CSPs while the majority of signals remained unaffected. As the set of perturbed peaks and the directions of chemical shifts are the same for both the wild-type and the alanine-substituted peptide, it can safely be concluded that both ligands have the same binding pose. Interestingly, while the wild-type peptide induces strong line broadening of certain peaks at sub-stoichiometric ligand concentrations, an observation that can be attributed to slow exchange kinetics, the alanine-substituted peptide causes pure chemical shift changes, which are usually a sign of fast chemical exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top right corner). These results are consistent with our SPR and biochemical assay data, which showed that the wild-type D1<sub>min</sub> peptide has a high affinity interaction with VP1 (low nanomolar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) whereas the W293A peptide interacts with weaker affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â &gt;1 Î¼M).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NMR characterization of the VP1-D1<sub>min</sub> interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C-HMQC spectra showing peptide (12.5 ÂµM) induced perturbations of tr-VP1 (125 ÂµM; black) ILVT methyl signals.

We found that non-polar to polar substitution of either P232 or V234 leads to a substantial decrease in peptide binding relative to wild-type VP1 (P232S: 1.3 Â± 0.26%, V234S: 1.6 Â± 0.32% of wild-type signal). In contrast, a substitution that conserved the hydrophobicity of the putative binding site increased observed peptide binding (V234I: 250 Â± 26% of wild-type signal). Alanine-substitution of VP1 pore residues further down into the pore (T224A/T243A) impact binding to a lesser degree (34 Â± 0.56% of wild-type signal). X-ray structures of VP1 proteins with these substitutions do not appear to have any major structural rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and we observe normal pentamer formation of these VP1 variants by size-exclusion chromatography during purification (data not shown). Consistent with our observations, previous work on JCV five-fold symmetry VP1 pentamer pore residues showed substitution of multiple pore residues, including the homologous residue for BKV VP1 P232, did not affect either pentamer formation or thermal stability, with X-ray data showing structural differences from wild-type VP1 pentamers were largely limited to the pore itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). These results are consistent with a specific interaction of peptide D1<sub>min</sub> within the upper pore of VP1 pentamers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NMR identifies second peptide binding site at the base of VP1</title><p>At a wild-type D1<sub>min</sub> peptide concentration of 25 ÂµM, well above the low nanomolar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> observed for the primary peptide binding site in the upper pore, we observed additional ligand induced CSPs and line broadening in the 2D NMR spectrum. The VP1 peaks that were affected upon addition of peptide and for which assignments were available are I45, T46, T118, T238, and T243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). Without exception, these residues are located in the lower pore of the VP1 pentamer. Based on the first appearance of spectral changes at 25 ÂµM D1<sub>min</sub> peptide for a titration starting at 6.25 ÂµM (where no CSPs were observed), we estimate that the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is greater than 250 ÂµM. For peptide D1<sub>min</sub> W293A, only at a ligand concentration of 100 ÂµM did a few very weak additional peak shifts became visible; hence, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value for this peptide is likely in the low single-digit millimolar range. At a wild-type peptide concentration of 50 ÂµM and higher the above-mentioned peaks as well as signals from amino acids located in the upper pore show significant line broadening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This observation can potentially be explained by binding of multiple ligand copies or small soluble peptide aggregates. However, as the peptide induces signal perturbations of only certain VP1 residues all of which are in close proximity, the interaction site likely represents a binding hotspot. Consistent with this result, the predicted location of the second interaction site is consistent with the modeled position of the D1 region of BKV VP2/3 in a recent cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hurdiss et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>X-ray model details interaction between D1<sub>min</sub> peptide and VP1 pore</title><p>To further characterize the binding mode of D1<sub>min</sub> within the VP1 pore, a structurally guided model was generated using 2.36 Ã resolution X-ray data from 13-mer D1<sub>min</sub> peptide in complex with truncated VP1<sub>30-297</sub> pentamers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Refinement with a best-fit model of observed electron density maps yields a primary chain of density consistent with an Î±-helical peptide running <italic>N</italic>-terminus at the top of the pentamer pore to <italic>C</italic>-terminus lower in the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), although electron density maps indicate multiple binding poses of the helix within the pore. VP1 pore residues that show peptide-induced CSPs by 2D NMR (T226, V231, V234; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>) as well as residues important for peptide binding as determined by substitution (P232, V234; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) form a hydrophobic pocket around key D1<sub>min</sub> residues L297 and L298 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Based on the structural studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, the proposed mechanism of antiviral action by D1<sub>min</sub> is through binding of the peptide to the VP1 pore. To confirm that D1<sub>min</sub> peptide can bind to infectious BKV virions containing the minor structural proteins VP2 and VP3, we performed an affinity purification of biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> in the presence of VP1 moieties. Full-length VP1 pentamers, VLPs, or purified infectious BKV virions were incubated in 10-fold molar excess of either biotinylated or unlabeled D1<sub>22</sub>, followed by affinity-purification of biotinylated peptide and assaying co-purification of VP1. VP1 pentamers, VLPs, and infectious particles co-purified with D1<sub>22</sub>, demonstrating that the peptide can bind to infectious BKV virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, only amino-terminal biotinylation was compatible with the assay; carboxy-terminal D1<sub>22</sub> was unable to co-purify VP1 pentamers or VLPs, even when tested with truncated VP1 pentamers (VP1<sub>30-297</sub>) and extended peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

However, an interesting alternative model exists wherein D1<sub>min</sub> directly interactsÂ with a putative host-cell receptor to induce an antiviral signaling pathway resulting in the observed antiviral activity associated with peptide treatment. To exclude this possibility, we first tested whether or not treatment of RPTE cells with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide induced expression of known antiviral genes, comparing induction to treatment with interferon beta (IFN-Î²) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). While we observe robust expression of all genes tested with 20 hr of IFN-Î² treatment (except for IFNA2, which showed modest increase in expression after IFN-Î² treatment), we fail to observe gene induction with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide treatment. Next, we tested whether peptide can bind to the surface of RPTE cells, a requirement for interacting with a host-cell receptor. We assessed peptide-cell binding using <italic>N</italic>-terminal biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> peptide, assessing peptide binding to the cell surface by immunofluorescent microscopy and using the addition of BK VLPs as a positive control for recruiting peptide to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We observe background biotin staining when cells were treated only with biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> peptide and observe a large increase in biotin staining intensity with the addition of BK VLP, with the two stains overlapping to a high degree. Importantly, the increase in biotin stain is abrogated upon addition of unlabeled D1<sub>min</sub> WT peptide in excess, demonstrating the recruitment of peptide to the cell surface by BK VLPs is specific; the same abrogation is not observed when using unlabeled D1<sub>min</sub> L297A peptide. We conclude that there is no evidence to support a model of D1<sub>min</sub> directly acting on host cells, and that our data is consistent with a peptide antiviral mechanism requiring direct interaction with BKV virions.</p><p>After observing loss of D1<sub>min</sub> activity rapidly after initiating BKV infection in our time-of-addition study, we next asked whether D1<sub>min</sub> acts as a cell-binding antagonist by performing a cell binding assay. Briefly, RPTE cells were incubated with BKV that had been pre-treated with D1<sub>min</sub> or P8D11 for 1 hr at 4Â°C to block endocytosis. Cells were rinsed, immediately fixed, and we performed indirect immunofluorescent staining for cell-associated VP1 puncta as a readout for cell-bound virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We observed no effect on the number of cell-associated VP1 puncta in cells treated with D1<sub>min</sub> up to 5 Î¼M (&gt;100 fold over observed EC<sub>50</sub>). In contrast, we observe loss of cell-associated VP1 puncta in the presence of the neutralizing antibody P8D11 treatment starting at concentrationsÂ &gt;0.43 nM (&gt;62 ng/mL), roughly the observed EC<sub>50</sub> concentration. In addition, we tested whether pre-treatment of the virus, as performed in this assay, has any impact on antiviral efficacy of D1<sub>min</sub> peptide and observed no difference in EC<sub>50</sub> between pre-treatment of BKV versus pre-treatment of RPTE cells with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We conclude that D1<sub>min</sub> does not block binding of BKV to cells and the observations from the time-of-addition experiment are due to the inability of the peptide to permeate the cell membrane rather than the peptide inhibiting BKV adsorption. This model is consistent with the delayed loss of antiviral activity observed for cell-penetrating variants of D1<sub>min</sub>. Thus co-entry with the infecting virion, consistent with direct binding to the five-fold symmetry VP1 pentamer pore, is required for D1<sub>min</sub> entry into cells and subsequent antiviral activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>D1<sub>min</sub> activity occurs prior to BKV ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation</title><p>Next, we examined whether D1<sub>min</sub> treatment affects the ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation of BKV, a critical entry step and distinguishing feature of polyomaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dupzyk and Tsai, 2016</xref>).

Consistent with this result, overall VP2/3 staining was reduced by treatment with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide only, whereas VP1 staining was unchanged across all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâH</xref>). We conclude that treatment with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide results in virions that are unable to proceed through proper capsid disassembly that would result in the essential exposure of minor structural protein epitopes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Polyomaviruses are the causative agents of multiple human diseases, and the lack of effective antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of polyomavirus infections and associated diseases represent an unmet medical need. Accordingly,Â we report the discovery and characterization of the first described anti-polyomavirus inhibitor that acts through a novel antiviral MoA by binding toÂ the viral capsid five-fold symmetry VP1 pentamer pore â the BKV VP2/3-derived peptide D1<sub>min</sub>. Treatment with D1<sub>min</sub> elicits potent antiviral activity against BKV in cell-based assays (EC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 30 nM). D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral activity is also observed against related JCV, denoting a possible conserved MoA.</p><p>To characterize the D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral MoA, we performed informative, exploratory mechanistic studies. Time of inhibitor addition studies showed D1<sub>min</sub> must co-enter the cell with BKV to elicit antiviral activity, since D1<sub>min</sub> lost antiviral efficacy when administered after viral endocytosis. Importantly, time-of-addition studies with a cell-penetrating version of D1<sub>min</sub>, a TAT-fused peptide, resulted in a delayed loss of activity relative to unmodified peptide, which is consistent with an antiviral mechanism occurring within the cell. In agreement with an intracellular MoA, D1<sub>min</sub> did not block binding of BKV to host cells. Fractionation experiments identified the D1<sub>min</sub> MoA as occurring prior to the critical step of BKV retrotranslocation from the ER lumen to the host cell cytosol, and the presence of BKV capsid protein in the pelleted fraction is consistent with a D1<sub>min</sub> MoA that does not block BKV entry into cells.</p><p>Through extensive biophysical (SPR), biochemical (AlphaScreen), and structural (NMR, X-ray crystallography) characterization of D1<sub>min</sub>, we show the peptide specifically and unambiguously binds to a novel site in the upper pore formed by VP1 pentamers with high affinity (SPR <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â =Â 1.4 nM, biochemical IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 3.6 nM). Alanine-scanning of D1<sub>min</sub> identified key residues that mediate interaction of D1<sub>min</sub> with VP1, withÂ ~1000 fold loss of affinity for VP1 associated with single residue substitutions, demonstrating that peptide binding is specific and not due to non-specific binding driven by peptide hydrophobicity. Moreover, key D1<sub>min</sub> residue substitutions that result in loss of VP1 affinity also result in loss of D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral efficacy, linking VP1 binding and antiviral activity. Consistent with this link between in vitro binding studies and in-cell BKV assays, we show a related variant, the biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> peptide, can bind infectious virions using in vitro co-purification studies.</p><p>With these findings, we posit the following model for D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral activity: D1<sub>min</sub> binds to the upper pore of VP1 pentamers in the capsid of BKV prior to endocytosis; peptide remains bound to the virus during endocytosis, and antiviral activity occurs within the cell after endocytosis but prior to escape from the host ER lumen, resulting in inhibition of VP2/3 exposure. A caveat to this proposed MoA is the lack of direct testing of whether peptide remains engaged with BKV within the cell after endocytosis, which would further inform an intracellular mechanism directly involving association of the peptide with VP1. This mechanism, or other mechanisms involving, for example, intracellular release of the peptide and interaction with an intracellular receptor, are interesting and may be differentiated with additional study.</p><p>We examined an alternate mechanism where the peptide binds to a cell-surface receptor and induces a pathway that results in antiviral activity. To explore this possibility, we performed several experiments that differentiate this MoA from our proposed MoA. In summary, we do not observe peptide association with the cell surface in the absence of VP1 protein, we do not observe induction of a panel of antiviral genes after cell treatment with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide, and we observe an MOI-dependence of D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral efficacy. In the last experiment, higher viral titers require more peptide to bind the increased abundance of VP1 pore binding sites, whereas the abundance of a putative cell-surface receptor should be independent of viral titer. Furthermore, the observed relationship between loss of VP1 binding affinity and loss of antiviral efficacy by alanine-substitution of key D1<sub>min</sub> residues is consistent with the proposed MoA; that a putative cell-surface receptor would bind the same peptide sequence and also be susceptible to the same alanine-substitutions as the VP1 binding site is unlikely, but cannot be excluded. Additional evidence that is contrary to the MoA involving a cell-surface target is as follows: one would not expect the TAT-fused peptides to behave differently from unmodified peptide in the time-of-addition studies if the D1<sub>min</sub> target is on the cell surface. D1<sub>min</sub> and TAT-fused D1<sub>min</sub> share the same binding sequence and have similar IC<sub>50</sub> values in our biochemical assay (TAT-D1<sub>min</sub>: 2.7 nM, D1<sub>min</sub>-TAT:&lt;1.5 nM, D1<sub>min</sub>: 3.6 nM). As both <italic>N</italic>-terminal and <italic>C</italic>-terminal TAT-fused D1<sub>min</sub> showed a delayed loss of activity relative to unmodified peptide, it is unlikely that the TAT addition is disrupting an interaction with a putative cell-surface receptor. While we cannot definitively rule out alternative D1<sub>min</sub> MoAs that indirectly impact BKV infection, we find that the current studies are consistent with the MoA where the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide initially binds to the VP1 pentamer pore of BKV, it crosses the cell-membrane via endocytosis of BKV with associated D1<sub>min</sub>, and has anti-viral activity within the cell.</p><p>We characterized the binding determinants of D1<sub>min</sub> as well as demonstrated binding specificity of the peptide to VP1 pentamers using alanine-scanning mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cunningham and Wells, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lozano et al., 2017</xref>). We identified three key residues in D1<sub>min</sub> â W293, L297, and L298 â where single alanine-substitutions resulted inÂ ~1000 fold loss of binding affinity to VP1 as measured in both an AlphaScreen competition assay and SPR studies. A structurally-guided model based on X-ray data acquired from VP1-D1<sub>min</sub> complexes details an Î±-helical peptide binding in the upper VP1 pore, running <italic>N</italic>- to <italic>C</italic>-terminal from the top of the pore to the lower pore. Additionally, the model places key D1<sub>min</sub> residues L297 and L298 within a hydrophobic pocket formed by VP1 pore residues T226, V231, P232, and V234. We note that the homologous residue to P232 in JCV was identified as a critical residue in VP1 pore biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). We observe that these residues experience chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) by 2D NMR upon peptide binding to VP1, with the exception of P232, which is not labeled with <sup>13</sup>C isotope and is therefore not visible by this NMR method. Biochemical peptide binding assays with substitutions of VP1 pore residues P232 and V234, as well as BKV spreading infection studies with mutations at VP1 P232 or V234, confirm and validate both the 2D NMR data and structurally-guided model of the peptide binding in the VP1 pore. Studies of trimer and hexamer truncations of the 13-mer D1<sub>min</sub> peptide were unable to reconstitute high-affinity binding, including a hexamer peptide that contained the three key residues W293, L297, and L298, indicating these key residues are necessary but not sufficient for high affinity peptide binding to VP1. This may indicate that other residues likely contribute to peptide potency and/or the helical conformation of the peptide is important for its mode of binding. Peptides less than nine residues in length are unlikely to form secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gellman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Manning et al., 1988</xref>). Accordingly, the high affinity binding of D1<sub>min</sub> to VP1 likely uses some combination of structural and sequence elements.</p><p>Since the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide is derived from a native sequence found in the VP2/3 D1 region, and the peptide binds the five-fold symmetry VP1 pentamer pore with high affinity, intriguing questions are raised about the biology of the peptide and the pore to which it binds. Mutations in pore residues that are in close proximity to the peptide-binding site including VP1 P232 and V234 generally result in noninfectious virus without grossly altering VP1 pentamer structure. Likewise, all tested mutations in the D1 region of BKV VP2/3 resulted in noninfectious virus. We have shown that pore residues VP1 T226, V231, P232, V234 are important for peptide binding and that the D1 region of VP2/3 from which the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide is derived, namely VP2/3 290â302, are largely invariant across multipleÂ polyomaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Viral proteins are subject to rapid sequence change over time due to relatively high viral genome mutagenesis rates unless maintained by purifying selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duffy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kistler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tokuriki et al., 2009</xref>); polyomaviruses are no exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pastrana et al., 2013</xref>). As such, invariance of viral protein sequences is a potential indication of biological relevance. Further to this point, studies with JCV show both high affinity peptide binding to VP1 and inhibition of infection at a similar potency (EC<sub>50</sub>) as BKV in COS-7 cells, suggesting a conserved mechanism across at least two polyomaviruses. Both the sequence invariance of residues in the VP1 pore and inÂ the VP2/3 D1 region that mediate D1<sub>min</sub>-VP1 interactions, and the convergence of phenotype between the VP1 pore mutations and VP2/3 D1 region mutations suggest that the peptide-binding site represents a previously uncharacterized VP2/3 binding site in the VP1 pore.</p><p>Multiple structures have been reported previously for infectious polyomavirus virions using both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), with most reporting the minor structural proteins VP2/3 as a globular density at the base of the VP1 pentamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurdiss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liddington et al., 1991</xref>). More recently, a cryo-EM structure of an infectious BKV virion mapped the resolved <italic>C</italic>-terminus of VP2/3, including the region containing the D1<sub>min</sub> sequence, at the base of the VP1 pentamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hurdiss et al., 2018</xref>). These results are consistent with our current observations of a D1<sub>min</sub> low affinity âsecond binding siteâ identified in the NMR studies. Although the affinity of 13-mer peptide for the âsecond siteâ is low, in the intact virion the D1 region that matches the sequence of D1<sub>min</sub> may bind this site with higher affinity, particularly in the context of full-length VP2/3.</p><p>An intriguing question raised by the study is whether the specificity and high affinity of D1<sub>min</sub> binding to VP1 is coincidental or reconstitutes an interaction between VP1 and the VP2/3 D1 region that occurs during the viral lifecycle. Dramatic restructuring of the viral capsid takes place during disassembly including reduction of intra-capsid disulfide bonds, decrease in virion size, and exposure of previously hidden minor structural protein epitopes from the capsid core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magnuson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Norkin et al., 2002</xref>). Our BKV infection assays indicate that residues involved in D1<sub>min</sub> binding to the VP1 pore are critical for BKV infectivity. The low- and high-affinity D1<sub>min</sub> binding sites found at the base and in the upper pore of VP1 pentamers, respectively, may represent VP1-VP2/3 interactions during different stages of disassembly, and subsequent exposure of VP2/3 may be required to allow for essential viral-host protein interactions. For example, interaction of the VP2/3 NLS with importin Î±/Î² is required for efficient nuclear import of SV40 and BKV viral genomes during entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakanishi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakanishi et al., 2002</xref>). The process by which polyomaviruses decrypt masked VP2/3 protein-protein interaction domains via structural rearrangements may involve the translocation of VP2/3 D1 region from a low-affinity binding site at the base of VP1 pentamers to the high-affinity binding site in the upper pore. Further studies are required to validate the proposed model, in particular studies that may deconvolute potential VP2/3 interactions with the lower and upper VP1 pore.</p><p>The essential entry step of membrane penetration by non-enveloped viruses is an incompletely characterized process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Polyomaviruses complete this lifecycle step by exploiting the host cell ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to undergo retrotranslocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dupzyk and Tsai, 2016</xref>). This process involves viral interaction with numerous host factors and requires the presence of VP2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dupzyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inoue and Tsai, 2017</xref>). Treatment of BKV with D1<sub>min</sub> peptide inhibits two key observable lifecycle steps: exposure of VP2/3 epitopes to immunofluorescent staining and retrotranslocation of VP1 protein from the ER lumen into the cytosol. The mechanism by which D1<sub>min</sub> elicits these antiviral observations remains incompletely defined. Interestingly, mutations in the VP1 pore of JCV PSVs reduce exposure of VP2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with a D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral mechanism directly elicited via pore binding. In addition, VLPs which lack minor structural proteins or polyomavirus with VP2 or VP3 deletions are unable to escape from the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</xref>), and this translocation step is also blocked for BKV in the presence of D1<sub>min</sub>. Accordingly, we envision a few, non-exclusive models for D1<sub>min</sub> antiviral action. First, D1<sub>min</sub> binding in the VP1 pore may block interactions with host factors that interact with the pore. Indeed, a cryo-EM study of infectious BKV particles identified possible heparin binding to the upper VP1 pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hurdiss et al., 2018</xref>). Blocking host factor interactions could result in improper trafficking of the incoming virion or inhibit capsid processing. Previous studies have shown that small molecules that inhibit polyomavirus trafficking to the ER block exposure of VP2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2015</xref>). Second, binding of D1<sub>min</sub> peptide mayÂ stabilizeÂ the capsid and inhibits proper disassembly. The host restriction factor HD5 was shown to both inhibit VP2/3 exposure and stabilize the JCV capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zins et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the two phenotypes may be related. Third, D1<sub>min</sub> may disrupt an essential interaction between the VP1 pore and VP2/3. Last, D1<sub>min</sub> may block an interaction between a host factor and VP2/3. As D1<sub>min</sub> and VP2/3 D1 region share an identical sequence, the peptide may act by dissociating from the VP1 pore after endocytosis and binding to a host factor VP2/3 binding site, blocking an essential interaction. In general, these models posit an antiviral mechanism of antagonist D1<sub>min</sub> peptide acting as a competitive inhibitor for the VP1 pore binding site, the VP2/3 D1 region, or both in the case of disrupting a putative interaction between VP2/3 and the VP1 pore. Deciphering which, if any, of these models is correct will require further investigation.</p><p>InÂ conclusion,Â to identify potential therapeutics for BK and JC polyomaviruses, we explored the potential of targeting the major capsid protein VP1, one of the few proteins expressed by members of the polyomavirus family. This strategy of antiviral agents targeting viral capsids has also been explored for HIV, dengue virus, picornaviruses, and hepatitis B virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blair et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Colibus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deres et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fox et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klumpp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lamorte et al., 2013</xref>). Relevant to polyomaviruses, a study of the JCV VP1 pentamer pore confirmed the sensitivity of the virus to substitution of pore residues, establishing the potential of the pore as a target for small-molecule therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). D1<sub>min</sub> represents the first antiviral agent against BK and JC polyomaviruses that specifically targets the VP1 pentamer pore. The peptide is derived from polyomavirus minor structural proteins VP2/3 D1 region, and NMR and X-ray studies show the peptide binds to a novel site within the pore formed by pentameric VP1 capsid protein. The biological relevance of the interaction between peptide and the VP1 pore was tested by mutagenesis of the viral genome, with cell-based viral proliferation assays being impacted by mutations within the VP2/3 D1 region or the corresponding binding region within the VP1 pore. These observations indicate the peptide-binding site may be biologically-relevant, potentially constituting a previously uncharacterized VP1-VP2/3 binding interface. Given the single-digit nanomolar binding affinity of D1<sub>min</sub> to the VP1 pore, the peptide provides a powerful new tool molecule for probing polyomavirus entry biology. In particular, as the <italic>N</italic>-terminus of the peptide faces the exterior of the virion, one could imagine extending the peptide in this direction to add an assay-dependent probe to monitor stages of BKV entry, including virion disassembly and viral-host interactions. Finally, the D1<sub>min</sub>-binding site within the VP1 pore reported in this study may represent a novel target for development of first-in-class antiviral therapies to address the unmet medical need presented by polyomavirus infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary renal proximal tubule epithelial (RPTE) cells were purchased from ATCC (PCS-400â010) and cultured in RenaLife Basal Medium with supplements (Lifeline Cell Technology LL-0025) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abend et al., 2007</xref>).

Polyomaviruses enter target cells by endocytosis and then travel to the nucleus via the endoplasmic reticulum. This study shows that a peptide corresponding to 13 residues of the BK polyomavirus minor capsid protein VP2/3 binds tightly to the central pore of the VP1 pentamer on the viral capsid, interferes with an intracellular step that appears to correspond to a viral uncoating transition, and inhibits the infectivity of both BK virus and JC virus. Strengths of the study include the generally high technical quality of the work, the tight binding of the peptide, the novel binding site and mode of action, and the insights on the poorly understood intracellular step(s) that constitute the uncoating transition. The study will be of general interest to molecular virologists, protein biochemists, and those interested in developing therapeutic strategies to combat polyomaviruses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A polyomavirus peptide binds to the capsid VP1 pore and has potent antiviral activity against BK and JC polyomaviruses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The manuscript by Kane and colleagues shows that a peptide corresponding to 13 residues of the BK virus minor capsid protein VP2/3 binds tightly to VP1 pentamers and inhibits infection of both BK virus and JC virus. Biophysical assays, including NMR and x-ray crystallography, show clearly that the peptide binds in the upper portion of the 5-fold pore formed by 5 VP1 monomers and the binding amino acids were mapped on both the peptide and VP1. Importantly, the peptide can bind whole virions containing both minor capsid proteins so the endogenous VP2/3 protein does not appear to occlude the binding site for this peptide in the mature virion. The data are clear that the binding is within the pore thus making this the first reagent targeting the VP1 pore.</p><p>This is an interesting and important study that is largely convincing. Strengths include the generally high technical quality of the work, the tight binding of the peptide, the novel binding site and mode of action indicated by the mapping, the peptide activity against at least one other polyoma virus (JCV), the insights on the poorly understood uncoating transition, and the need for anti-polyoma inhibitors for use in immunosuppressed patients, particularly following kidney transplantation. That said, the study is necessarily mostly descriptive (i.e., showing where the peptide binds, identifying mutations that inhibit binding, and defining the stage of the viral life cycle where inhibition occurs) rather than mechanistic (it isn't clear why blocking this pore binding site inhibits BKV replication), the peptide itself won't be a viable therapeutic (though it might be used to establish a screen for small molecule inhibitors that binding in the same site), and some technical concerns about experimental design and interpretation (see below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authentication of the Peptide Target. There is a possibility that the biological data has been misinterpreted if the peptide is acting as an antagonist to signaling pathways at the cell surface (and the mutants disrupt this interaction). This is easily tested by asking if wild type or mutant peptides bind to the cell and elicit a response (e.g. IFN production). Related issues are that RPTE cells were pre-treated with the peptide for 2 hours before challenging with virus. If the mechanism involves the peptide binding to the virus one would have thought that the virus would have been preincubated with the peptide first and then added to the cells. In that experiment (i.e., preincubation of the virus with peptide first), only cell binding was measured (and was not disrupted), but infection should also be scored.</p><p>2) Site of Peptide Activity. Experiments show clearly that endocytosis and delivery to the ER is not affected by the peptide, but subsequent translocation of VP1 to the cytosol is disrupted and VP2 is not exposed in the ER. However, it's unclear from these experiments that the peptide is actually present along with the virus in the ER because the antibody to VP2 recognizes the endogenous VP2. Similarly, it's unclear how and when the peptide would engage the virion given how the experiments were conducted. One has to imagine that the peptide is endocytosed along with the virus (or penetrates the membrane separately â similar to the proposal for the Tat-tagged peptide). What's missing is evidence to show peptide and virus engaged within the cell. Finally, can the time-of-addition experiments be explained by a simple model that the authors have not considered, in which the peptide has to bind to the virion, so that adding it after the virus has entered the cell will be too late? (even if this is true, it does not refute the conclusion that the peptide acts at/before disassembly).</p><p>3) Strengthening the Proposed Mechanism of Action. Several simple experiments would significantly strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>A) VP1 Release/Virion Disassembly. The Helenius group reported a simple gel-based assay for release of VP1 from the capsid (Cell, 2007). It would be informative to determine if the peptide blocked this step. This is important because the only other evidence for a disassembly block is based on immunofluorescence staining in infected cells, which could be misleading.</p><p>B) Peptide Binding and Function. There is a correlation between peptide binding and inhibitory activity, but there are simple experiments that would greatly strengthen this correlation. For example, the VP1 V234L mutation has little effect on infectivity, and the V234I mutation causes an intermediate phenotype. Peptide binding should be checked in these mutants. If binding is defective, the prediction is that the peptide would not inhibit these mutants. Such a result would definitively establish that binding to the mapped site is required for inhibition. Similarly, do the biotinylated peptides inhibit infection? Does only the N-terminal biotinylated peptide inhibit, which is the one that binds? Finally, the correlation between binding affinity to VP1 and inhibitory activity of mutant peptides was established with purified VP1 pentamers. Affinities should be measured with intact virions, which were used in the infectivity assays. Collectively, these experiments would strengthen the correlation between binding and activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50722.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authentication of the Peptide Target.

The reviewer-proposed model is an antiviral MOA wherein the peptide binds to an unidentified cell-surface receptor, initiating a signaling cascade that results in the observed antiviral activity associated with D1<sub>min</sub> treatment. In response, we think that this MOA is unlikely based on the time-of-addition study in the original experiments, which we did not discuss in this context, and based on new additional experimental data in the revised manuscript.</p><p>First, the time-of-addition experiments are consistent with VP1 as the target. Treatment with D1<sub>min</sub> peptides containing the <italic>N-</italic> and <italic>C-</italic>terminal cell-penetrating TAT sequences is consistent with VP1 as the target and not a host receptor. <italic>N-</italic> and <italic>C-</italic>terminal TAT-tagged peptides inhibit biochemical assays with similar IC<sub>50</sub>s as the native peptide (TAT-D1<sub>min</sub> and D1<sub>min</sub>-TAT 2-3 nM, D1<sub>min</sub> 4 nM) but they have different profiles in the BKV time-of-addition studies. For the TAT peptides, there is a delay in loss of antiviral activity by &gt;10 hours as compared to 4 hours for the untagged peptide, which is consistent with the cell-penetrating peptide accessing BK VP1 after endocytosis. If the antiviral activity of D1<sub>min</sub> were due to the binding of the peptide to a cell-surface receptor, the time-of-addition study would show identical profiles for all three peptides since they should bind to the unidentified cell-surface receptor. Since we examined both <italic>C-</italic> and <italic>N-</italic>terminal additions of the TAT sequence to D1<sub>min</sub>, it is unlikely that we are disrupting interactions with an unidentified receptor at either terminus of the peptide.</p><p>Next, to further support the hypothesis that the target of the peptide is VP1, we added results to the revised manuscript where we increased the viral titer in an MOI-dependency assay. If the EC<sub>50</sub> for D1<sub>min</sub> were observed to be independent of viral titer, the MOA would be consistent with targeting a cell surface receptor (the abundance of which should remain invariant with respect to viral titer), whereas if the EC<sub>50</sub> were to shift to higher peptide concentrations, this would be consistent with VP1 as the target of the peptide. Consistent with our hypothesis, the EC<sub>50</sub> shifted 15.4-fold with increased BKV titer in this experiment. The results of these studies are consistent with a mechanism of inhibition that requires the interaction of D1<sub>min</sub> with viral VP1.</p><p>Next, we found that <italic>N</italic>-terminal biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> peptide, which contains additional <italic>N</italic>-terminal residues that are not involved in VP1 recognition, does not bind to the cell surface in the absence of VP1. As a positive control for this finding, we observed detection of the biotinylated peptide in the presence of VLPs, which bind to the cell surface and bind the biotinylated peptide.</p><p>Lastly, we asked whether treatment with peptide elicited a gene-expression response of interferon-stimulated genes, as suggested by a reviewer. We used RT-qPCR to assess whether genes linked to antiviral activity are induced in RPTE cells after peptide treatment. We observe no measurable induction of genes (CXCL10, IFNA2, IFNB1, MX1, OAS1, and STAT1) with peptide treatment for 20 hours, whereas treatment with interferon-Î² induced expression of all genes tested (albeit with modest induction of IFNA2 expression). While we did not perform a genome-wide analysis, the results are consistent with the peptide MOA acting through VP1 binding and not induction of a cellular signaling pathway. Although not definitive, it is worth noting that individually D1<sub>min</sub> residues Trp or Leu to Ala in D1<sub>min</sub> peptide APQ<italic>W</italic>MLP<bold><italic>L</italic></bold>LLGLY results in loss of antiviral activity and ~1000-fold reduction in potency in vitro. That a mammalian cell-surface receptor would bind the exact same sequence with high affinity and also be susceptible to these same mutations is unlikely, but this MOA cannot be fully excluded based on sequence analysis or sequence changes alone. In summary, the time-of-addition, MOI-dependency, peptide-cell binding, and RT-qPCR studies are convincing and are consistent with an antiviral MOA directly involving VP1 binding.</p><p>To the final reviewerâs concern regarding the timing of peptide treatment, we performed an additional cell-based assay comparing the antiviral efficacy of D1<sub>min</sub> whether the virus or the cells are treated first (âpre-treatmentâ). We compared our original protocol of pre-treating cells with peptide to pre-treating virus with peptide for the same duration, and found no difference in peptide antiviral EC<sub>50</sub> (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3). This result is consistent with association of the peptide with virus prior to endocytosis.</p><p>In summary, we added the following data in response to this revision: Figure 4C, and Figure 5âfigure supplements 1-3; the Results section is updated to describe these experiments and their results in the relevant locations. In addition, we discuss the topic of alternative peptide MOA in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Site of Peptide Activity.

(even if this is true, it does not refute the conclusion that the peptide acts at/before disassembly).</p></disp-quote><p>This important point relates directly to the cellular MOA. We agree with reviewers that the current experiments do not directly test whether the peptide is associated with the virus after endocytosis. D1<sub>min</sub> must interact with the virus for delivery into the cell, and the results with the cell-penetrating TAT-fused peptides in our time-of-addition assay are consistent with a peptide antiviral mechanism acting within the cell. Together, these results suggest a mechanism where D1<sub>min</sub> peptide associates with virions extracellularly and has subsequent antiviral activity within the cell through a mechanism directly involving VP1, or through release of the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide and subsequent interaction with an intracellular protein. We observe that after endocytosis, peptide D1<sub>min</sub> inhibits exposure of virion-associated VP2/3. Since virion-associated VP2/3 contains the D1<sub>min</sub> sequence (within the D1 region of VP2/3), one can infer the target should bind both D1<sub>min</sub> and VP2/3. Accordingly, direct interaction of D1<sub>min</sub> and related TAT-fused peptides with pentameric VP1 and subsequent blocking of the interaction of virion-associated VP2/3 with VP1 is a potential intracellular MOA. However, we cannot fully rule out an MOA involving intracellular release of D1<sub>min</sub> from the virion and subsequent interaction with a cellular target involved in native VP2/3 interactions. Either MOA is revealing and interesting, and further study is required to fully understand the peptide MOA. To clarify the intracellular MOA, we modified the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>We indeed attempted to directly assess whether D1<sub>min</sub> peptide is engaged with the virus within the cell. We performed a colocalization assay with <italic>N</italic>-terminal biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> peptide, testing whether colocalization with BKV occurred at various timepoints post-infection. However, while we observed the desired colocalization at various timepoints, we also observed high background due to staining of endogenous cellular biotin, reducing the utility of the assay. We consider these initial results promising but are not including these data in the revised manuscript. We dismissed other methods of assessing peptide-virus interaction, such as affinity purification of biotinylated peptide using streptavidin beads, as they would not demonstrate peptide was bound to virus prior to cell lysis (after which association could occur and give an erroneous positive result).</p><p>To address the question regarding the mechanism by which the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide may enter the cell, the reviewers suggest a model we did not explicitly state, that the peptide must bind the virion in order to enter the cell. It is clear from the time-of-addition study that the peptide must enter the cell contemporaneously with the virus, and that D1<sub>min</sub> entering the cell is linked to the mechanism of action. We demonstrated that biotinylated peptide is able to bind to infectious virions (Figure 4E), and we favor a mechanism by which the peptide binds to incoming virions to enter cells. Consistent with this model, our peptide-cell binding assay of biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> and BK VLPs shows that peptide association with RPTE cells requires interaction with the BK VLPs, and the binding of peptide to VLPs is specific as biotinylated-D1<sub>22</sub> can be competed away with unlabeled D1<sub>min</sub> peptide but not mutant D1<sub>min</sub> L297A peptide. Finally, weâve updated the text concluding the time-of-addition description to state: âThus co-entry with the infecting virion, consistent with direct binding to the VP1 pentamer pore, is required for D1<sub>min</sub> entry into cells and subsequent antiviral activity.â</p><p>In summary, we have updated the conclusion of the Results section describing the time-of-addition studies to describe how the peptide likely binds the virus to co-enter cells with BKV during endocytosis, and discuss the lack of direct assay to test BKV and peptide engagement in the cell at the end of the first paragraph of our Discussion section. We additionally describe how the TAT-fused peptides support an intracellular antiviral MOA for D1<sub>min</sub> in the first and second paragraphs of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Strengthening the Proposed Mechanism of Action.

Collectively, these experiments would strengthen the correlation between binding and activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers that more experiments would help provide a more comprehensive description of the peptide antiviral MOA. The gel-based VP1 release / capsid disassembly assay developed by the Helenius group referenced by a reviewer was indeed performed for this study. We performed the assay as described using BKV that was chemically labeled with biotin. We found no effect on capsid disassembly from wild-type D1<sub>min</sub> treatment; however, the assay lacks a positive control to ensure the quality of the experiment, and as such, we viewed the data as not yet fit for publication. We would add that not all the data provided for the MOA of the peptide is based on immunofluorescent staining. Our fractionation assay is immunoblot-based and shows that the peptide prevents the virion from successfully completing retrotranslocation from the ER lumen into the host-cell cytosol, an important step in polyomavirus entry.</p><p>For the proposed additional peptide-binding experiments to bolster the observed relationship between peptide binding and antiviral activity, we performed a limited mutagenesis study involving BKV VP1 residues P232 and V234 and made several mutants (S, L, and I). As described, all three P232 mutations in BKV VP1 resulted in a complete loss of Tag-positive cells (and therefore BKV replication), and mutation V234S also resulted in a complete loss of BKV infectivity. These results show that these pore residues are necessary for replication, in agreement with the Atwood group findings in JCV. With respect to pore mutants V234L and V234I, the substitution of the valine side chain for structurally similar non-polar side chains from leucine and isoleucine had less impact on replication, whereas a switch in polarity from non-polar valine to polar serine had significant impact.</p><p>To further explore the link between the infectivity assay and the biochemical assay, we examined one of the V234 mutants, but not both in the AlphaScreen assay. The V234I mutant showed a modest increase in binding response with the D1<sub>22</sub> peptide compared to wild-type (~2.5-fold, noted in the relevant Results section). This response demonstrates that this mutant is competent for binding VP1 in the biochemical assay, which is consistent with the partial impact on infectivity for the corresponding mutation in BKV. To highlight this datapoint, weâve updated the relevant figure (Figure 2C) to include VP1 V234I. Again, as discussed in the manuscript, the dataset suggests that while hydrophobic to hydrophilic substitutions that alter the hydrophobicity of the putative peptide binding site (e.g. V234S) have a significant effect on both peptide binding and viral infectivity, substitutions that alter the size of the residue without affecting the pocket hydrophobicity (V234L, V234I) are less impactful. These side chains are flexible, and may be able to rotate into positions that accommodate the respective mutations. As such, it is unsurprising that the V234L substitution does not impact the infectivity of BKV in our spreading infection assay. Speaking to the intermediate phenotype of the V234I substitution in the spreading infection assay, if indeed this mutation perturbs ligand binding to the VP1 pore toward increased affinity relative to the wild-type protein, this could certainly affect viral biology, given that strengthening an interaction can have a deleterious effect on function in addition to weakening an interaction. Additional biochemical studies with the VP1 pore mutants would indeed provide additional insight, but we chose to focus on other experiments related to the D1<sub>min</sub> peptide.</p><p>With respect to reviewer questions regarding the biotinylated peptides used in the current study, we observe both <italic>N</italic>- and <italic>C</italic>-terminal biotinylated D1<sub>22</sub> (22-mer) peptide elicit antiviral activity against BKV with EC<sub>50</sub> values that are similar to untagged D1<sub>22</sub>.</p><p>The proposal to measure <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s for the interaction of the peptides with intact virions is an interesting proposal. We know that the D1<sub>22</sub> peptide with <italic>N</italic>-terminal biotin interacts with BK virions from pull-down experiments, but we did not measure the affinity of this interaction due to the limitations of our methods, which are designed for recombinant proteins (AlphaScreen and Biacore SPR). Measurement of affinity requires the development of a distinct assay with sufficient sensitivity. It is possible that a radioimmunoassay could be developed or perhaps the AlphaScreen assay could be adapted for this purpose, but we are not equipped to run the former, and we are no longer capable of running the latter.</p></body></sub-article></article>
