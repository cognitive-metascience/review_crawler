However, there is still no direct evidence on CeA GABAergic neurons’ real-time dynamic during cataplexy. We used a deep brain calcium imaging tool to image the intrinsic calcium transient as a marker of neuronal activity changes in the narcoleptic VGAT-Cre mice by expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6 into genetically defined CeA GABAergic neurons. Two distinct GABAergic neuronal groups involved in cataplexy were identified: spontaneous cataplexy-ON and predator odor-induced cataplexy-ON neurons. Majority in the latter group were inactive during regular sleep/wake cycles but were specifically activated by predator odor and continued their intense activities into succeeding cataplexy bouts. Furthermore, we found that CeA GABAergic neurons became highly synchronized during predator odor-induced cataplexy. We suggest that the abnormal activation and synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons may trigger emotion-induced cataplexy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cataplexy</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS096151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21NS101469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep brain calcium imaging reveals the abnormal neuronal activity patterns of the amygdala GABAergic neurons in an animal model of human sleep disorder narcolepsy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep fragmentation, and hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. Cataplexy is cardinal among these symptoms and characterized by a sudden loss of skeletal muscle tone during waking.</p><p>Even though it is known that the loss of the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin, HCRT) system causes narcolepsy with cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nishino et al., 2000a</xref>), the entire brain circuitry responsible for the presentation of all narcoleptic symptoms is not fully understood. An important clue to unraveling the brain circuit of narcolepsy comes from the fact that cataplexy is usually triggered by strong emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dauvilliers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morawska et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, there is some evidence pointing to the involvement of the amygdala as part of the narcolepsy circuit, whereas the exact circuitry involved and the specific abnormalities in the amygdala are still unknown. A single unit recording study done in narcoleptic dogs found that, during cataplexy, some amygdala neurons become activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gulyani et al., 2002</xref>). However, the intrinsic technical limitations of the single-unit recordings prevented the identification of the phenotypes of those neurons activated during cataplexy. To overcome this limitation, in the present study, we took advantage of molecular genetic tools to both tag and measure the in vivo activity of CeA GABAergic neurons from transgenic narcoleptic mice. We first crossed vesicular GABA transporter <italic>Cre</italic> mice (<italic>Slc32a1-ires-Cre</italic>, or VGAT-Cre mice) with orexin KO mice (<italic>Hcrt</italic> <sup>-/-</sup>), to generate VGAT-Cre narcoleptic mice (<italic>Slc32a1-ires-Cre<sup>+/-</sup>/Hcrt</italic> <sup>-/-</sup>). Later, we transfected CeA GABAergic neurons with genetically controlled calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensor GCaMP6, which could be imaged via a GRIN lens embedded in the amygdala and a miniature microscopic camera. Predator odor coyote urine was used to trigger emotion-induced cataplexy. We monitored and calculated the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients because they are reliable readouts of the excitability level of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We wanted to know what, in the absence of orexin modulation, could be the abnormality in the CeA GABAergic neurons and how it is associated with the timing of cataplexy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Orexin immunostaining</title><p>All mice from the control group (<italic>Slc32a1-ires-Cre<sup>+/-</sup>/Hcrt</italic> <sup>+/-</sup>) showed abundant orexin immunoreactive neurons.

Additionally, in the narcoleptic group, 8.06% (15/186) were identified as spontaneous cataplexy-ON (SC-ON) cells, with 11 of these cells exclusively activated during cataplexy, while the other four also activated during NREMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, showing one SC/NREMS-ON cell).

We found abnormal hyperactivity during active waking episodes and hyper synchronization during succeeding emotion-induced cataplexy from amygdala GABAergic neurons. The following are the five important implications from this study.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CeA GABAergic neurons are more active during REMS and AW</title><p>Past studies found the amygdala can modulate sleep states. Early in 1975, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Smith and Miskiman, 1975</xref>) found that electrical stimulation of the amygdala significantly increased REMS. Likewise, electrophysiological recordings showed that amygdala neurons become very active during waking and REMS, whereas displayed the lowest activity during NREMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Corsi-Cabrera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Muñoz-Torres et al., 2018</xref>). Our current study using in vivo imaging of individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in GABAergic neurons corroborates those electrophysiological recordings.</p><p>We found that in both control and narcoleptic mice, CeA GABAergic neurons showed their maximal activities during AW and REMS. During these two states, these neurons displayed significantly higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and larger percentages of active neurons as compared to QW and NREMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also observed that neurons active during REMS are a distinct group of cells from those neurons that become active during AW. Less than 7% of all imaged neurons were equally active during both REMS and AW. The segregation in the activity profile during either state suggests there might be two distinct neural pathways activating specific groups of CeA GABAergic neurons. For instance, we observed that GABAergic AW-ON neurons became maximally active during eating. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis claiming that amygdala GABAergic neurons regulate food consumption through a positive-valence circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Douglass et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, REMS-ON GABAergic neurons might be part of the amygdala-related memory processing circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Genzel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We found that the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and the percentages of active neurons in each sleep/wake state were similar between the control and narcoleptic mice. The normal activity of CeA GABAergic neurons during sleep/wake states measured in the narcoleptic mice suggests these neurons function normally outside of conditions leading to emotionally-triggered cataplexy.</p><p>On the other hand, we also found, in both groups, a particular group of CeA GABAergic neurons (unscored cells) with relatively low activity and insignificant activity changes during undisturbed sleep/wake states. In other words, it is unnecessary for all of the GABAergic neurons to be activated during normal sleep/wake states, suggesting there might be a modulating mechanism preventing the amygdala from being overactive. Indeed, this modulating mechanism might be even stronger in wild type mice because exposure to predator odor only awakened a small portion of these ‘unscored cells’. In contrast, among the narcoleptic group, the majority of these ‘unscored cells’ became highly activated upon odor exposure and actively participated in the subsequent emotion-induced cataplexy. The absence of orexin might be the main reason for the failure of this modulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Narcoleptic mice CeA GABAergic neurons become hyperactive during predator odor exposure</title><p>Although many studies have demonstrated the importance of the amygdala on narcolepsy and cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mahoney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Snow et al., 2017</xref>), the precise causal role of the amygdala in narcolepsy is still unknown. Functional imaging studies on human narcolepsy have given inconsistent results. Some studies observed reduced activity and volume within the amygdala while others found increased activity and unchanged volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brabec et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ponz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vaudano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wada et al., 2019</xref>). The discrepancy may arise from either the individual disease seriousness among different patients or the limitations of current functional imaging tools used clinically, which do not have the single-cell resolution or cannot measure directly neuronal activity. Our study has overcome both technical barriers, and because we used a genetic animal model of narcolepsy, we also had a consistent level of symptomatology. We are providing the very first direct evidence that CeA GABAergic neurons of narcoleptic mice become hyperactive upon presentation of an innate fearful stimulus. Control mice did not become hyperactive, whereas both narcoleptic and control mice showed avoidance and fear behaviors. CeA GABAergic hyperactivity found in the narcoleptic mice had both increased recruitment (percentage of AW-ON neuron doubled) and stronger facilitation (higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> Z-scores, higher peak amplitude and frequency). In other words, aside from increasing activity intensity in regular AW-ON neurons, many additional neurons that were otherwise ‘unscored’ or active during REMS, became active in response to predator odor. ‘Unscored cells’ themselves made up 44.64% (50/112) of all activated neurons upon odor exposure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, when orexin modulation is undisturbed, neither the percentage of AW-ON neurons nor their activity levels change significantly after exposure to the same predator odor. Activities of most ‘unscored cells’ did not change significantly. Because CeA GABAergic neurons did not display hyperactivity unless narcoleptic mice had exposure to predator odor, it strongly indicates that orexin plays a vital modulating role during strong emotional states. When orexin is missing, the functional compensation effects from other neuropathways might prevent amygdala GABAergic neurons from behaving over actively until emotion stimuli come in.</p><p>Prior evidence indicated that orexin inhibits amygdala neurons by exciting serotoninergic terminals within the CeA to block cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>). In this way, serotonin keeps GABAergic neuronal activity in check. Orexin can also excite inhibitory interneurons in the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dustrude et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>). GABAergic hyperactivity once triggered, could successively send overwhelming inhibitory inputs into the brainstem and cortex. Particularly, when GABAergic inhibition occurs in motoneurons, muscle weakness, or even paralysis may arise. Interestingly, our group recently identified a group of GABAergic bifurcating neurons in CeA and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that simultaneously project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the vlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Because vlPAG is a critical hub for controlling muscle tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weber et al., 2018</xref>), excessive GABAergic input to the vlPAG may lead to reduced motor output. Likewise, excessive GABAergic tone may be the cause of the hypo-excitability of motor cortical areas observed in narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nardone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weber et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cataplexy-ON GABAergic neurons in the CeA of narcoleptic mice</title><p>CeA GABAergic neurons that become active during both spontaneous (SC) and emotion-induced cataplexy (EC) were identified. The SC-ON neurons either were exclusively activated in SC or also activated in NREMS, indicating that SC may share part of the neural substrate with NREMS, but not REMS, AW or EC, because none of the SC-ON neurons became active in above three states. However, EC-ON neurons had a wide range of sources, with about 50% from unscored cells, 23% from AW-ON cells and 23% from REMS-ON cells. Many EC-ON neurons were maximally activated during the preceding hyperactive AW (HAW) episode and continued showing intense activity until the end of the cataplexy bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, D and F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The transition activity analysis indicated that it was the ‘unscored cells’ that contributed most to the high activity level during EC. Thus, it is intriguing to track down the potential targets of these ‘unscored’ EC-ON cells and to see how it may trigger cataplexy.</p><p>Usually, cataplexy episodes that happen without any exogenous emotion stimulus are defined as SC, while those induced by emotion stimuli such as palatable food or aversive odor are defined as EC. However, neither behavioral nor neural mechanism criteria have been available for distinguishing SC and EC. We, for the first time, observed the potential neural substrate differences in between at the amygdala level, by using the HAW episode as the marker of EC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Hyper synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons during cataplexy</title><p>In addition to activity intensity, the coordination patterns among neurons are crucial for brain functions. The stable, intermediate cross-correlations observed among CeA GABA neurons in the control mice might be necessary for maintaining the amygdala’s normal functions. Instead of being a pure stimulating or inhibiting source, orexin neurons would be more like a complicated modulator to maintain the hemostasis on both activity intensity and correlations in the amygdala. The absence of orexin caused not only hyperactivity but also a failure to stabilize the rhythms of neuronal activities. As a result of this failure, CeA GABAergic neurons stayed desynchronized until challenged by emotion-induced cataplexy, in which CeA GABAergic neurons presented a hyper synchronization. The involving mechanism resulting in this hyper synchronization is still unclear. More evidence is needed to confirm the direct causal relationship between hyper synchronization and cataplexy. If hyper synchronization does facilitate cataplexy, instead of using strong inhibition, which oppresses the normal functions of the amygdala, desynchronizing might be a better way to alleviate emotion-induced cataplexy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cataplexy and REMS</title><p>Cataplexy has long been considered as an inappropriate REMS intrusion into waking because of the similarities on EEG features and ‘muscle atonia’ symptom, which is usually observed during REMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Roth et al., 1969</xref>). However, this hypothesis has never been experimentally verified. Narcolepsy patients and narcoleptic animals still have an ultradian rhythm of REM sleep. Stimulating cholinoceptor in the basal forebrain of narcoleptic dogs induced cataplexy attack but did not block the cyclicity of burst of rapid eye movement, implying separate mechanisms underlying cataplexy and REMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nishino et al., 2000b</xref>). Furthermore, the close linking among emotions, REMS, and cataplexy remains mostly unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that some amygdala GABAergic neurons involved in spontaneous cataplexy were also active in NREMS, but none were also active in REMS. Though many amygdala GABA neurons were actively involved in REMS, these RMES-ON neurons were not one of the major components of cataplexy-ON neurons during emotion-induced cataplexy. Instead, those ‘unscored’ neurons that were not previously activated in sleep became the major component of cataplexy-ON neurons with a highly activated and synchronized way. It is implying that these neurons might use brain circuitry, distinct from the one for REMS generating and regulating, to trigger muscle atonia during cataplexy.</p><p>Although the potential abnormalities of Amygdala GABAergic neurons before and during cataplexy were identified in this study, their effect on cataplexy duration is still unclear. We found that the difference in cataplexy duration between SC (n = 10) and EC (n = 14) has no statistical significance, though the SC duration seems longer than EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Offspring with the confirmed genotype <italic>Slc32a1-ires-Cre<sup>+/-</sup>/Hcrt</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> were used as the narcoleptic group (n = 10, both sexes, 6–10 months of age) while littermates with the confirmed genotype <italic>Slc32a1-ires-Cre<sup>+/-</sup>/Hcrt</italic> <sup>±</sup>were selected as the control group (n = 8, both sexes, 6–10 months of age). Genotype validation on mice tail snips was done off-site by Transnetyx (Cordova, TN). The temperature in the mice housing/recording room was always maintained at 23–25°C under a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 A.M.). Mice were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to regular laboratory food and water.</p><p>Under deep anesthesia (isoflurane 1.0–2.0%) and using a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA), AAV vectors with Cre inducible expression of GCaMP6 slow (AAV5-CAG-DIO-GCaMP6s, Titer: 3.48 × 10<sup>13</sup> genomic copies/ml; University of Pennsylvania Preclinical Vector Core) were microinjected unilaterally into the CeA at the following coordinates: 1.11 mm posterior to Bregma, 2.95 mm lateral to the sagittal suture, and 4.30 mm ventral to the brain surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Viral vectors were delivered in a volume of 500 nl using a 10.0 μL Hamilton syringe coupled to a 33-gauge stainless steel injector (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA). Injections were done gradually over 15 min. After microinjection, the injector needle was left in place for 15 min and then withdrawn slowly. At this time, and following the same injection track, a miniature Gradient Refractory INdex lens (GRIN, O.D. diameter: 0.6 mm, length: 7.3 mm; Inscopix Inc, Palo Alto, CA) was driven into the brain just above the CeA and cemented to the skull. Then, and as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), four small screw-type electrodes and a pair of plate-type electrodes (Plastics One, CA) were implanted onto the mouse skull and nuchal muscles for recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) activity respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ten days after GRIN lens placement, mice were deeply anesthetized again (1.0–2.0% isofluorane). A baseplate was attached to a single photon miniaturized fluorescence microscope/CCD camera (nVoke from Inscopix, Inc, CA). The miniaturized microscope, along with the baseplate, were carefully placed atop the GRIN lens. The distance between the miniaturized microscope and the GRIN lens top was precisely adjusted until fluorescent neurons came into focus. At this focal point, the baseplate was secured around the GRIN lens cuff with dental cement, and then the microscope was detached. To protect the GRIN lens from debris and scratches, a cap was secured onto the baseplate. One week later mice were habituated to the recording experiment setting for three consecutive days before the sleep and Ca<sup>2+</sup> recording started.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sleep recording and identification of sleep states or cataplexy</title><p>After being amplified and filtered (0.3–100 Hz for EEG; 100–1 K Hz for EMG, MP150 system; Biopac Systems Inc, CA), the EEG/EMG signals were acquired and synchronized to the imaging of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. In parallel, a night-vision camera was used to record mouse behavior. Streaming video of the mouse behavior was also synchronized with imaging of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (Neuroscience Studio acquisition software, Doric Lenses Inc, QC, Canada). A MATLAB (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA) script was used to plot the spectrogram of the EEG activity (1 s window size and 0.5 s overlap).</p><p>EEG/EMG data (as CSV files) along with synchronized behavior video files were then transferred into SleepSign software (KISSEI Comtec Ltd., Nagano, Japan) and scored in 4 s epochs as wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), REMS, and cataplexy. Wakefulness was identified by the presence of desynchronized EEG coupled with high amplitude EMG activity and further divided into quiet wakefulness (QW) or active wakefulness (AW) depending on whether the mouse displayed behaviors such as walking, rearing, grooming, eating, drinking, digging (AW), or was just standing still but awake (QW). Thus, during QW, the mouse kept an immobile posture often interspersed with movements of the head (e.g., bobbing) but did not exhibit any further purposeful movement. QW often occurred in between, in anticipation of, or following sleep states and lasted from a few seconds to several minutes. NREMS was scored when the EEG showed high-amplitude/low-frequency waves (delta waves) together with a lower EMG activity relative to waking. REMS was identified by the presence of regular EEG theta activity coupled with very low EMG activity.</p><p>To be qualified as a cataplexy attack, an episode had to meet the following criteria: 1) An abrupt episode of nuchal atonia lasting at least 8 s. 2) Immobility during the episode. 3) Theta activity dominant EEG during the episode. 4) At least 40 s of wakefulness preceding the episode (discrete cataplexy) or the first episode when several cataplexy episodes occur sequentially. The above criteria were slightly modified from the International Working Group on Rodent Models of Narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scammell et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Miniature microscopy Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients imaging</title><p>At 10:00 AM, the mouse was gently restrained (swaddled in Terrycloth), while the miniature fluorescent microscope/camera was attached to its baseplate. At the same time, a lightweight cable was plugged to record the EEG/EMG signals. The tethered mouse was then returned to the home cage and allowed to adapt for 6 hr for three consecutive days. On the fourth day (recording day), the same adaptation routine was followed, but at 4:00 PM, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients-derived fluorescence began to be imaged by the nVoke miniaturized microscope/CCD camera (Inscopix, CA) and collected by its acquisition software. Ca<sup>2+</sup> associated fluorescence was continuously generated by a blue LED (power: 0.2 mW) and imaged at 10 frames per second (fps). To synchronize the timestamps of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with the EEG/EMG, a TTL signal was sent from the nVoke interface console into the Doric console. Mouse was exposed to the predator odor coyote urine between 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM. Briefly, 1.0 ml coyote urine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.predatorpee.com">www.predatorpee.com</ext-link>, Bangor, ME), stored in a 5 ml plastic vial filled with cotton, was placed in the home cage at 7:00 PM for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients imaging data</title><p>The person analyzing data was blind to the mice’s genetic background, which has not been decoded until all analyses finished. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient data were processed off-line by the Inscopix data processing software (version 1.1.2). Briefly, raw movies were first pre-processed to correct for defective pixilation, row noise and dropped frames. Preprocessed movies were then corrected for motion artifacts to generate the steadiest Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescent signals. The motion-corrected movies were subsequently mean filtered. To normalize the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, a single frame average projection of the filtered movie was generated. The average frame was used as the background fluorescence (F0) to calculate the instantaneous normalized Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescent signals (ΔF/F) according to the formula; (ΔF/F)<sub>i</sub>=F<sub>i</sub>-F0/F0 where i represents each movie frame. The normalized movie or ‘ΔF/F movie’ was then used for semiautomatic extraction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescent signals associated with individual cell based on the principal and independent component analysis (PCA-ICA). Regions of interest (ROIs) identified by PCA-ICA were visually selected as candidate cells based on ΔF/F and image (cell-morphology). To be chosen as <italic>bona-fide</italic> neurons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces had to fulfill the canonic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike waveform featuring fast-rising onset followed by slower decaying signal. Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace (ΔF/F) of each ROI (cell) was further standardized as Z-score using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of each cell’s ΔF/F (Z-score = (ΔF/F-Mean)/SD). Since the lowest Z-score values were observed during QW, and no cell reached its maximal activity during QW, we used the average Z-score of QW (Z-<sub>QW</sub>) as the baseline. If a cell has an average Z-score during a specific state equal to or greater than (Z-<sub>QW</sub> +1), it is scored as an ‘ON’ cell in that state. After cells were completely scored, we ran the ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test to confirm that the average Z-score of these ‘ON’ cells were statistically higher than that of those ‘non-ON’ cells. In the meantime, ΔF/F Z-scores expressed as the percent of its maximal Z-score value across the whole recordings were plotted on a heat map (Sigmaplot software, Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA). We then used the percentage threshold, which was defined as 80% of the maximum Z-score value during the whole recording period, to detect the prominent neuronal peak events, and set 2 s as the minimum interval between two adjacent peaks. The cumulative probabilities of peak frequency were compared between AW and AWO in the narcoleptic group with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Synchronicity and cross-correlations analysis of amygdala GABAergic neurons</title><p>First, the Z-score data were processed with Pearson correlation analysis (two tails) with Prism eight software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), to obtain the pairwise correlation coefficient R between every two cells. Coefficient R is the index for correlation ranging from −1 to 1 (0 represents no correlation, −1.0 represents a negative correlation. 1.0 represents a perfect correlation). Next, we transferred the R to <bold>Z<sub>R</sub></bold> based on the Fisher’s Z transformation formula (<bold>Z<sub>R</sub></bold> = 0.5[ln(1 + R) – ln(1 R)]) so that the <bold>Z<sub>R</sub></bold> became normally distributed. The average <bold>Z<sub>R</sub></bold> of all positive correlations (R &gt; 0) in each cell was calculated for statistical comparisons among groups and states. Finally, to show the correlation results intuitively, we generated the 2D spatial maps of all recorded cells and linked every two cells with color-coded lines representing the R values (strong positive correlations with R between 0.6–1.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of the study, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%) and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline (5–10 ml) followed by 10% buffered formalin in 0.1M PBS (50 ml). Mice brains were harvested and cross-sectioned at 40 µm thickness (four sets) on a compresstome (Precisionary Instruments, Greenville, NC). To visualize the GRIN lens track and the location of the GCaMP6s transgene expression, coronal sections were scanned on a Leica fluorescent microscope. Mice that had a main GCaMP6s expression area outside of the amygdala were excluded from further analysis. To verify that GCaMP6 was expressed exclusively in GABAergic neurons, VGAT immunostaining was performed on one set of brain sections. Briefly, sections were incubated at room temperature for 24 hr with mouse anti-VGAT monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilutions, Synaptic System, Germany), followed by 1 hr incubation with Alexa fluor-568 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, CA). GCaMP6 and VGAT positive cells were counted on digitized images using MCID image analysis software (St. Catharines, ON, Canada). To confirm the correctness of the genotyping, orexin immunostaining was made on a separate set of brain sections. Briefly, sections were incubated at room temperature for 24 hr with goat anti-orexin polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilutions, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), followed by 1 hr incubation with biotinylated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:500, Millipore, Burlington, MA) secondary antibody and finally labeled using ABC–DAB–nickel staining (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis (SPSS, version 25) with unconstructed covariance and Sequential Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used to compare the means of Z-score among each sleep/wake state inside or between two animal groups.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yang Dan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sun et al. measured calcium activity of CeA GABAergic neurons across different vigilance states including spontaneous and emotionally-activated cataplexy using narcoleptic mice and micro-endoscopic calcium imaging. They measured activity of CeA GABAergic neurons in spontaneous cataplexy and predator odor-induced cataplexy. The author concluded that abnormal activation and synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons trigger emotion-induced cataplexy. The study addresses an important question. Although the observations are very interesting, some claims are not well supported by the results. In addition, the messages of the individual figures as well as in the texts are not clearly described. The manuscript also contains many typo and grammatical errors that should be corrected before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors should perform more thorough statistical analysis and show more data to demonstrate that activation of CeA neurons is really correlated with cataplexy attacks. E.g. are SC- and EC-ON cells consistently activated during cataplexy attacks? SC-ON neurons might be activated just by chance during spontaneous cataplexy attacks and EC-ON neurons might not be specifically correlated with the attack, but rather activated by the predator odor (which might be still present in the recording chamber during the attack or the activity of the neurons might have a slow off dynamics and consequently overlap with the attack).</p><p>- The difference between spontaneous cataplexy and predator odor-induced cataplexy (e.g., duration and EEG spectrum) is not well described. What is definition of two different cataplexy states? How did the author distinguish spontaneously cataplexy which may occur during coyote urine application? To compare previous reports, this definition is important. For example, it is well known that palatable food such as chocolate induced cataplexy. The authors also need to provide a clear definition of cataplexy attacks (spontaneous vs. odor-induced), a more thorough discussion of the mouse model, and more detailed analyses of HAW behaviors.</p><p>- The manuscript lacks detailed information to evaluate the importance of findings. For example, there are no confirmation and quantitative data that GCaMP6 was exclusively expressed in the GABAergic neurons. Please provide GCaMP6s expression in vGAT-expressing neurons and expression ratio in the CeA and other brain regions include BLA.</p><p>- one needs to be very careful with the apparent correlation between neurons seen in single-photon imaging, because of neuropil contamination. This concern is particularly strong when many neurons in the field of view are activated. Much more careful analyses are needed to support the claim.</p><p>- The claim that abnormal activation and synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons trigger emotion-induced cataplexy is not supported by any data. The authors need to tone down their conclusion, and if they wish to claim that abnormal activation and synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons trigger emotion-induced cataplexy, they need to inhibit CeA and test its effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48311.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors should perform more thorough statistical analysis and show more data to demonstrate that activation of CeA neurons is really correlated with cataplexy attacks.

We did observe some neurons showing strong activity in some episodes of a brain state (such as REM sleep) while staying silent during some other episodes of the same brain state. So we did not use an individual “activity peak” as the criteria to identify “ON cells.” Instead, we used significantly elevated average Ca<sup>2+</sup> intensity of all episodes during each state, as the threshold, to reduce the bias from pure coincidence. For example, an SC-ON neuron was only scored when it had a significantly higher average activity level during all SC episode in this mouse.</p><p>As for the EC-ON neurons: We agree that the HAW-ON and EC-ON neurons were activated, indeed, by the predator odor, but it does not exclude the possibility that they were still specifically correlated to EC. It may follow the serial connection that the odor activates these neurons then these neurons subsequently trigger cataplexy. The current study is simply to describe the neuronal activity pattern during odor exposure and cataplexy. We do agree that further studies are needed to verify the direct causal effect between EC-ON neurons and emotion-induced cataplexy.</p><p>To further confirm the abnormal hyperactivity of CeA GABAergic neurons, we updated Figure 4E-J to demonstrate the significant increases on Z-score, Peak amplitude, and frequency after odor exposure in the narcoleptic mice. The original Z-scores were also plotted in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, to show the increased activity level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The difference between spontaneous cataplexy and predator odor-induced cataplexy (e.g., duration and EEG spectrum) is not well described.

Cataplexy that happens without any exogenous emotion stimulus is called spontaneous cataplexy (SC), while those induced by palatable food or aversive odor are called emotion-induced cataplexy(EC). But, so far, there are no exclusive behavior or neurochemistry criteria for distinguishing between SC and EC. We, for the first time, used a hyperactive active waking (HAW) event as the criteria. If a cataplexy bout is led by a HAW then it is defined as an EC. Otherwise, it is defined as an SC. Most important, we found that EC and SC may have distinct neural substrate at the amygdala level. We have added more descriptions in the manuscript on how to define HAW and emotion-induced cataplexy with one-sample T-test. We are currently testing that if the palatable food or odor could also produce similar hyperactivity in the amygdala in the narcoleptic mice during cataplexy.</p><p>Since we only recorded for an hour after odor exposure, we did not see any SC during the odor exposure duration. But we believe it is possible to see an SC in the presence of the odor given the exposure duration is so long that animal becomes fully adapted to the odor.</p><p>In our previous study (2006) using coyote urine, we did not see significant differences in EEG spectrum and duration between control night and coyote urine night in the same orexin-KO mice. In this study, we calculated the average duration of 10 SC and 14 EC and found no significant difference (see Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The manuscript lacks detailed information to evaluate the importance of findings.

Here we performed VGAT immunostaining with a cytoplasm VGAT antibody. New pictures showing VGAT/GCaMP6 double-labeled neurons were added in Figure 1. &gt;95% of GCaMP6 expressing neurons were also containing VGAT immunoreactivities (see Figure 1—source data 1 for the counts).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- one needs to be very careful with the apparent correlation between neurons seen in single-photon imaging, because of neuropil contamination.

The Inscopix data analysis software contains a pre-processing component that removes out some of the noise from neuropil. After that, the spatial filter process also removes low-frequency noise. We recorded 27-44 cells in each field of review. This was an intermediate density allowing decent distance among most of the recorded cells, that helped keep the neuropil contamination minimal. We are currently working with collaborators to develop a customized tool for completely eliminating neuropil contaminations in our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The claim that abnormal activation and synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons trigger emotion-induced cataplexy is not supported by any data.
