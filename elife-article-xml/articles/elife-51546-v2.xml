phenomenon where an infected erythrocyte (IRBC) is attached to uninfected erythrocytes (URBC). In some studies, rosetting has been associated with malaria pathogenesis. Here, we have identified a new type of rosetting. Using a step-by-step approach, we identified IGFBP7, a protein secreted by monocytes in response to parasite stimulation, as a rosette-stimulator for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>- and <italic>P. vivax</italic>-IRBC. IGFBP7-mediated rosette-stimulation was rapid yet reversible. Unlike type I rosetting that involves direct interaction of rosetting ligands on IRBC and receptors on URBC, the IGFBP7-mediated, type II rosetting requires two additional serum factors, namely von Willebrand factor and thrombospondin-1. These two factors interact with IGFBP7 to mediate rosette formation by the IRBC. Importantly, the IGFBP7-induced type II rosetting hampers phagocytosis of IRBC by host phagocytes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. Part of the parasite life cycle happens inside human red blood cells. The surface of an infected red blood cell is coated with parasite proteins, which attract the attention of white blood cells called monocytes. These immune cells circulate in the bloodstream and use a process called phagocytosis to essentially 'eat' any infected cells they encounter. However, the monocytes cannot always reach the infected cells.</p><p>Some of the proteins made by the parasites make the infected red blood cells stickier than normal. This allows the infected red blood cells to surround themselves in a protective cage of uninfected red blood cells. Known as “rosettes” because of their flower-like shape, these cages seem to protect the infected cells from attack by the immune system. Lee et al. noticed that adding white blood cells to parasite-infected red blood cells made them clump together more, but it was unclear exactly how and why this happened.</p><p>To find out, Lee et al. took fluid from around monocytes grown in the laboratory and added it to red blood cells infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. This made the cells clump together, suggesting that something in the fluid may potentially be alerting the parasites to impending immune attack. The fluid contained almost 700 different molecules, and Lee et al. narrowed down their investigations to the five most likely candidates. Interfering with the activities of these five proteins revealed that one – a protein IGFBP7 – not only alerted the parasites but also helped them to form the rosettes. It turns out that the parasites appear to use IGFBP7 like a bridge, linking it to two other human proteins to stick red blood cells together. Once the rosettes had formed, the monocytes were unable to eat the infected blood cells by themselves. Instead several monocytes had to work together as a team to consume the whole rosette.</p><p>Further research is now needed to shed light on this interaction between malaria parasites and human cells. Such research would be particularly relevant in the clinical setting, since some previous studies has linked the forming of rosettes to the severity of disease for malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Along its intraerythrocytic development, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. modifies the infected erythrocyte (IRBC) rheology (increased rigidity for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> IRBC, reduced rigidity but increased fragility for <italic>P. vivax</italic> IRBC). Such alteration increases the susceptibility of IRBC to splenic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Handayani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chotivanich et al., 2002</xref>); however, the parasites have developed escape strategies to avoid splenic elimination. For instance, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> expresses adhesins on the IRBC that mediate adhesion to the endothelial cells, resulting in deep microvasculature sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sherman et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, an IRBC can bind directly to uninfected red blood cells (URBC) to form a ‘rosette’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Russell and Cooke, 2016</xref>). This rosetting phenomenon has been described in all human malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angus et al., 1996</xref>); however, the functional importance of rosetting remains ambigous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clough et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wahlgren et al., 1989</xref>). While the supposed role of rosetting in facilitation of merozoite invasion of URBC is unlikely; recent studies show that rosette formation may have a role in parasite immune-evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clough et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deans and Rowe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Theoretically, the masking of rosetting IRBC with URBC may hamper IRBC recognition and therefore their clearance by the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moll et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, rosetting has been associated (in some but not all studies) with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Treutiger et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rowe et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doumbo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">al-Yaman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 1991</xref>). Here, we observed that the addition of leukocytes increased the rosetting rates of various <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> isolates. We next demonstrated that IRBC stimulated monocytes to secrete products capable of stimulating rosetting, the most important being insulin growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7). We further showed that IGFBP7-mediated rosetting was different from the previously described rosetting (defined here as type I rosetting), where it (we refer to this as type II rosetting) required additional serum factors to occur, in addition to the interaction between the parasite-derived ligand on IRBC surface and the receptor on the surface of URBC. Functionally, we observed that the IGFBP7-mediated type II rosetting reduced phagocytosis by monocytes, and therefore defined a new escape mechanism for the malaria parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The key resources table is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of human leukocytes on rosetting</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic>- and <italic>P. vivax</italic>-IRBC formed rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top panel) in the presence of 20% autologous human serum and the extent of rosetting at baseline is variable depending on the parasite isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). When autologous blood leukocytes were incubated with clinical isolates, the rosetting rate increased by 10–40% depending on individual isolates for both parasite species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This effect was mediated primarily by monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To exclude donor variability as a confounding factor, we repeated the experiment with the THP-1 cell line, which was derived from the peripheral circulation of an acute monocytic leukaemia patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auwerx, 1991</xref>). The rosette-stimulation mediated by THP-1 was similar to that of peripheral monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

They were significantly less phagocytosed than their non-IGFBP7-exposed counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Individual phagocytes could engulf non-rosetting IRBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>); however, successful engulfment of a rosette was only observed when several phagocytes were recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K and L</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rosetting is a common characteristic of late stage-IRBC in human malaria parasites, occurring frequently in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). It has been proposed to provide a survival advantage for the parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moll et al., 2015</xref>). Earlier studies have shown that rosetting occurs between the direct interactions of the parasite-derived ligands on the IRBC (i.e. PfEMP1, RIFIN, and STEVOR proteins for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) with various receptors on the URBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rowe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barragan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cserti and Dzik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrated the existence of a different type of rosetting, which we have called ‘type II rosetting’ that does not result from the direct interaction of IRBC with URBC. It was observed in all the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> isolates tested. This type II rosetting differs from the classical type I rosetting as it requires bridging by soluble mediators: IGFBP7, VWF, and TSP-1 between a rosetting ligand on IRBC and HS expressed by URBC. The fast rosette-stimulating effect by the protein and its fast reversion after the protein removal from the culture suggest that IGFBP7 does not mediate rosetting via irreversible binding to neither the rosetting receptor nor ligand. Instead, it is more likely to be mediated by weaker forces. It also suggests that these soluble mediators need to be present at a minimum concentration for the rosettes to occur.</p><p>We have shown that PfEMP1 is likely the principal <italic>P. falciparum</italic> rosetting ligand in this IGFBP7-mediated type II rosetting via usage of trypsin treatments, genetically modified <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clones that cannot surface-express PfEMP1, and the late ring stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the stage of maturation that manages to surface-express only one rosetting ligand, PfEMP1. However, we cannot fully dismiss the involvement of other rosetting ligands such as STEVOR or RIFIN as these proteins are encoded by multigene families and there is a lack of tools to assess and evaluate the implication of these proteins thoroughly. To our surprise, <italic>P. vivax</italic> IRBC also interacted with IGFBP7 similarly. There are no PfEMP1 orthologues in <italic>P. vivax</italic>. Based on the rosetting trend of <italic>P. vivax</italic> post-trypsin treatments, we postulate that <italic>P. vivax</italic> has multiple rosetting ligands with different trypsin sensitivities, and the one required by IGFBP7 is highly sensitive to trypsin. IGFBP7 requires the HS moieties on URBC to exert their rosette-stimulatory effect. Interestingly, removal of HS from the surface of URBC by heparinase caused the clumping of untreated IRBC (which harboured both rosetting ligands and receptors) when supplied with IGFBP7. Importantly, without enzymatic interference, the presence of this protein does not induce non-specific binding of URBC to each other, or autoagglutination-like clumping of IRBC. We hypothesized that the IGFBP7-mediated binding occurs preferably between the URBC and IRBC under normal circumstances possibly as a result of electrostatic differences between the URBC and IRBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokumasu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>IGFBP7 requires other serum factors, namely VWF and TSP-1 to exert its rosette-stimulating effect. For healthy individuals, the VWF levels in the serum range from 0.48 to 1.24 IU/ml (median 0.84 IU/ml), whereas individuals with underlying pathological conditions have much higher levels of serum VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terpos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kastritis et al., 2016</xref>). Serum TSP-1 levels in healthy individuals vary greatly (0–12060 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouanne et al., 2016</xref>). We found that under serum-free conditions (Albumax- supplemented medium), concentrations of VWF as low as 0.5 IU/ml and of TSP-1 at 10 ng/ml were enough to optimally facilitate IGFBP7-mediated rosette-stimulation at IGFBP7 of 100 ng/ml (the minimum concentration needed to optimally stimulate type II rosetting). The rosette-stimulation by the presence of these three proteins was comparable to that of 20% serum-enriched medium supplied with IGFBP7, reinforcing that IGFBP7 is the limiting factor for the rosette-stimulation.</p><p>Based on the data presented here, we propose the following mechanism of interactions for type II rosetting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). IGFBP7 binds to HS on URBC; the interaction between IGFBP7 and cell surface HS has been demonstrated and well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sato et al., 1999</xref>). IGFBP7 has also been shown to bind to the D4-CK region of VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Breevoort et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lenting et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryckaert et al., 2015</xref>). Although heparin is found to interact with the A1 region of VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryckaert et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that HS does not interact directly with VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Denis et al., 1993</xref>) as we did not observe any rosetting when VWF was added alone in the absence of IGFBP7. Therefore, the HS on URBC interacts with IGFBP7, which also interacts with VWF. In turn, VWF interacts with PfEMP1 on IRBC via TSP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryckaert et al., 2015</xref>). While the extracellular domain of PfEMP1 that binds to TSP-1 has yet to be identified, it should be noted that TSP1 has been commonly associated with PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janes et al., 2011</xref>). The pervasive role of TSP-1 may explain why a wide range of clinical isolates and laboratory-adapted parasite lines were capable of responding positively to IGFBP7 addition.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram illustrating interactions of HS on URBCs, IGFBP7, VWF, TSP-1, and PfEMP1 on IRBCs.</title><p>IGFBP7 binds to HS on the surface of URBCs.

Previously, it has been shown that CFD in the serum can stimulate rosetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luginbühl et al., 2007</xref>). This molecule was also identified in our proteomic study. Experiments with anti-CFD antibodies showed that CFD could also induce type II rosetting, but to a lesser extent. The knock down of IGFBP7 expression in THP-1 demonstrated that IGFBP7 is a major monocyte-derived rosette-stimulating factor. Culture supernatant from IGFBP7-KD_THP-1 collected after 18 h of parasite exposure could not induce rosette-stimulation. Other rosette-stimulating factors may be secreted by the cells much later. Interestingly, IGFBP7 and VWF are components in Weibel-Palade bodies, the storage granules of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Breevoort et al., 2012</xref>). Future work should characterize the effect of IRBC on the secretion of IGFBP7 by endothelial cells. Of note, the reported physiologic and pathological serum concentrations of IGFBP7 vary greatly, where most of the reported normal serum IGFBP7 concentrations fall below 50 ng/ml, but the serum IGFBP7 levels in different pathological conditions (e.g. various vascular disorders and cancers) are higher (as high as ~1000 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutsukake et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shersher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barroso et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the working concentration of IGFBP7 in this study (100 ng/ml) is still within the pathophysiologic range in clinical settings. It would be interesting to compare the serum/plasma IGFBP7 levels of uncomplicated and severe malaria patients from the same area to understand better the role of IGFBP7 in malaria pathogenesis.</p><p>The importance of monocytes/macrophages in eliminating <italic>Plasmodium</italic> during its course of infection has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Groux and Gysin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Theander, 1992</xref>). Peripheral monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turrini et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muniz-Junqueira and Tosta, 2009</xref>), as well as the tissue-resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosta et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sponaas et al., 2009</xref>), have been shown to engulf IRBC readily. To survive, parasites must counter or avoid this host’s immune responses. The ability to perceive a phagocyte’s secreted IGFBP7 as a signal of ‘approaching threats’ and to respond by rosetting may provide survival advantage to the parasites.</p><p>In conclusion, the host-derived IGFBP7 is used as an ‘incoming phagocyte signal’ by the IRBC, and the IRBC in turn use this protein, along with two serum factors, VWF and TSP-1, to stimulate rosette formation, which acts as an immune-evasion strategy by hampering phagocytosis of the IRBC. It is hoped that future clinical studies will investigate associations between IGFBP7 and malaria pathogenesis and immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experiments were performed with isolates of late-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> late stages unless stated otherwise (materials used in the experiments and the work flow are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref>).

Experiments were conducted when parasite population reached late stages. For each parasite line, two conditions were applied; one was incubated with IGFBP7 (100 ng/ml), whereas the other acted as a IGFBP7-free control. Rosetting assay was conducted afterwards. Five replicates were conducted for each experiment setting. In a separate experiment, a laboratory-adapted clinical isolate from Thai-Burmese border (NHP1106) was cultivated and staging of parasites was tightly synchronized. The experiment was conducted when the parasite population reached late rings (~hour 16–26). Two settings were prepared; one was incubated with IGFBP7 (100 ng/ml) and the other acted as a IGFBP7-free control. One hour of incubation under in vitro cultivation conditions was done prior to rosetting assay. Nine replicates (across three cycles of cultivations) were conducted.</p><p>The role of heparan sulfate (HS) in IGFBP7-mediated rosetting was also tested. URBC (blood group O) were treated with heparinase I (final working concentration of 25 µg/ml) or heparinase III (final working concentration of 25 µg/ml), with the untreated URBC served as control. The enzyme-erythrocyte mixtures and the untreated controls were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After that, the suspension was centrifuged to remove supernatant. The treated erythrocytes were washed with 20% human serum enriched-culture medium three times. Subsequently, cells were suspended in plain culture medium. The prepared cells were kept at 4°C until use within 1 week. Late stage-IRBC were concentrated with MACS. The IRBC (IRBC purity: 90–96%) were divided into three groups, each mixed with the control, heparinase I-treated and heparinase III-treated URBC, respectively.</p><p>The roles of complement receptor 1 (CR1/CD35) and A/B blood antigens were also investigated. Recruited isolates were matured in vitro, subsequently divided into four groups. One group served as the control, another group was added with rhIGFBP7 (final concentration 100 ng/ml). The third group was added with mouse anti-human CR1 (CD35) IgG<sub>1</sub> (final concentration 25 µg/ml), whereas the fourth group was added with rhIGFP7 (final concentration 100 ng/ml) and mouse anti-human CR1 IgG<sub>1</sub> (final concentration 25 µg/ml). Rosetting assay was conducted after the incubation. Separately, the late stage-IRBCs were sorted with MACS. The sorted cells were divided into four groups, each to be mixed with URBCs of A, B, O, and AB groups, respectively. Each of the cell mixture groups was further divided into two groups, where rhIGFBP7 (final concentration 100 ng/ml) was added into one group and the other group served as control.

Rabbit anti-human VWF polyclonal IgG was used at a working concentration of 25 µg/ml, whereas IGFBP7 at 100 ng/ml was applied. Rosetting assay was done after incubation. In another experiment, the packed cells of parasite cultures (3D7, MKK183, NHP1106, WPP3065, WPP2803, NHP4770, FVT201, FVT402) were divided into two parts, one was suspended with 20% serum-enriched RPMI1640 whereas the other group was suspended with 2% serum-enriched RPMI 1640.

Subsequently, the cells were suspended with 0.25% Albumax-RPMI. Each isolate was further divided into seven categories, each added with different concentrations of VWF (0, 0.125, 0.5, 2.0 IU/ml). All these groups were given IGFBP7 (working concentrations 100 ng/ml) and TSP-1 (10 ng/ml). Rosetting assay was conducted after incubation. In a separate experiment, the levels of IGFBP7 of media used in the experiments (20% human serum-enriched RPMI media, Albumax-enriched RPMI media and plain RPMI media) were quantitated using an ELISA kit, following instructions provided by the kit’s manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>IGFBP7 secretion quantification</title><p>Peripheral monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup>) were purified from blood collected from five healthy donors via the Ficoll concentration method, followed by CD14<sup>+</sup> bead purification.

Lentiviral transduction particles to knockdown expression IGFBP7 (hPGK-Puro_CMV-tGFP; SHCLNV-NM_001553) were added (MOI 3) based on formulas provided in the kit’s user guide. On the following day, the media containing lentiviral particles were removed, and replaced with fresh medium. The next day, the transduced cells were cultivated with puromycin-added medium (working concentration 3 µg/ml) for selection.

One such mechanism, presumed to be used by the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite, is rosetting. This mechanism involves aggregation of red blood cells around red blood cells infected with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> or <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, two infectious parasites that cause severe malaria. In this manuscript, Lee and colleagues describe a novel type of rosetting and the authors name it type II rosetting. This novel rosetting is distinct from the type I rosetting in that it is enhanced by the addition of monocytes and is mediated by the release IGFBP7. Two other serum factors, the Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin-1, are also required to mediate the type II rosetting. The functional importance of type II rosetting is its immune-evasion as it might hinder phagocytic uptake of infected red cells by macrophages. The details of the mechanism of rosetting are potentially crucial for aiding the development of vaccines and other immune-prophylactic approaches to eliminate <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors were asked to provide a plan for revisions before the editors issued a final decision. What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;<italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected erythrocytes induce secretion of IGFBP7 to form type II rosettes and escape phagocytosis&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work.</p><p>Lee and colleagues describe a novel type of rosetting, called type II rosetting of <italic>Plasmodium (P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>) infected red blood cells (IRBC) with uninfected red blood cells (URBC). Although rosetting has not been demonstrated in vivo (as it may be rather difficult), these authors perform series of experiments demonstrating a novel pathway/mechanism of this interesting in vitro phenomenon ascribed to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> IRBC. This type II rosetting is distinct from the type I rosetting in that it is enhanced by the addition of monocytes and both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> reveal an increased rate of rosetting. The increased rate of rosetting stems from a factor, namely IGFBP7, released during interaction between monocytes and IRBC. In addition, two other serum factors, the Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin-1, are also required for the IGFBP-7-mediated rosetting. An interesting aspect of this study was the demonstration of a functional importance of type II rosetting as it may aid the parasite in immune-evasion in that rosetting hinders phagocytosis of IRBC.</p><p>The following is a rather long &quot;list&quot; of key concerns with both the experimental approaches and data interpretation.</p><p>1) The observation that IGFB7, released from monocytes and monocyte cell line THP-1, mediates rosetting is based on the interpretation of the data shown in Figure 3 (neutralizing antibody) and gene knockdown experiments (Figure 8). As regards the experiment with neutralizing antibody, it appears that a proper control is missing. The authors included isotype controls but do not state whether controls were at concentrations similar to anti-IGFB7 Ab. Also, the IgG control is against NID1 rather than being a nonspecific IgG. It might be helpful to show rosetting without CSMT in the figure as well to provide baseline. It is possible that the differences in Abs effect are not due to blocking of specific receptors but rather that they reflect differences in properties of Abs.</p><p>2) IGFB7 was identified as a factor that mediates rosetting, but it is not clear whether IGFB7 exhibit similar heat sensitivities as did the activity from the supernatant (Figure 1). The authors did not conduct any experiments that would show if the concentrations of IGFB7 found in the supernatant of THP1 cells are similar to those that mediate rosetting.</p><p>Figure 1B: autologous leukocytes are added. Why is it important with autologous cells? If the rosetting was as dependent as the authors try to state on IGFBP7, it should not make a difference whether it is autologous or heterologous cells?</p><p>Figure 1C: Are these autologous cells?</p><p>Figure 1C: 3 donors and 4 parasites should give 12 data points but only 10 are plotted.</p><p>Figure 1D lacks statistical testing.</p><p>3) Another concern regards the second major conclusion, namely that Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin-1 are required for the effects of recombinant IGFB7 on rosetting. The involvement of these two factors must occur when they are added at saturating concentrations. Otherwise each factor might be effective through the same mechanism. Thus, a dose-response relationship needs to be demonstrated with Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin and rosetting.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript the authors talk about &quot;serum factors&quot;. But the only reference I can find when it comes to collection of blood, is lithium heparin. That means <italic>plasma</italic>, not <italic>serum</italic>. So is this paper actually about plasma factors?</p><p>Figure 3: In general, <italic>P. vivax</italic> generates a lot more rosetting than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. What is the explanation for this?</p><p>4) In experiments examining enzyme sensitivity (trypsin in Figure 5 and heparinase in Figure 6), the authors do not remove the enzyme before testing for rosetting. Also, the authors report the effects of enzyme concentration rather than enzyme activity. The enzymes used are not pure and thus nonspecific effects must be considered.</p><p>5) The authors use a wide range of parasite lines and isolates from patients and there is a significant heterogeneity in the results obtained. The rational for the use of the different lab isolates needs to explained better. Also it should be made clear that clinical isolates most likely are clonal.</p><p>6) The VAR2CSA expressing parasite – can the authors confirm that it expressed VAR2CSA? What about CS2_WT?</p><p>7) In Figure 5D, the clinical isolate has very low rosetting as compared to many of the other isolates used. Can the authors suggest why this may be the case?</p><p>8) The VAR2CSA expressing line is particularly poor in rosetting. This suggests that levels of rosetting may be impacted by the PfEMP1 expressed. It would be interesting if the authors could provide some insights into this. For example what is unique about FVT402 as compared to 3D7 or MK183?</p><p>9) The authors propose that PfEMP1 is the parasite ligand that mediates this rosetting via TSP1. However, it is clear that the levels of rosetting varies between isolates and lines.</p><p>10) In Figure 6 the authors show that rosetting is impacted of in clinical isolates and is effected by anti-CR1 me. This result is somewhat surprising, as it would suggest that all the parasites express a CR1 binding PfEMP1. Isn't so that only a subset of PfEMP1 that bind CR1? Can the authors explain this?</p><p>11) Figure 7 and subsection “Serum-derived co-factors in IGFBP7-mediated rosetting”, the authors appear to state that large proteins were removed with a 0.45 micron filter. The statement is inaccurate. It is more likely the authors are removing large protein aggregates.</p><p>12) The experiment depicted in Figure 8 is missing controls. Lentiviral vector mediated knockdowns experiments require controls for off-target effects. It is necessary to have two shRNA vectors targeting different sequences on the same gene. The authors present only one. There may also be some confusion regarding the technique as subsection “Knockdown of IGFBP7 expression by THP-1 using RNAi transduction” states that siRNA was used and the correct term should be shRNA.</p><p>13) In an attempt to be concise and brief, the authors provide very little experimental details – particularly concerning how an experiment addresses a particular question in the main text. This makes it very difficult for someone that is not an expert in the field to understand the work. While the Materials and methods section provides all the relevant information, it is very detailed and therefore makes it difficult and cumbersome to find the relevant information. For example &quot;using Zymosan A&quot; for many readers this would not provide the relevant information to interpret the results. Other concerns arose regarding clarity throughout the manuscript. Below are some examples that seem confusing. When examining whether a cell-free supernatant contains a biological active substance, serial dilutions must be examined and the dilution resulting in 50% activity is then used for chemical characterization. If the factor is highly concentrated in supernatant, loss due to temperature, for example, might not be observed. Please revise the subsection “Effect of THP-1 culture supernatants and supernatant fractionation”, as it is confusing.</p><p>14) Finally, there is an objection to the characterization of the rosetting studied here as &quot;type II&quot; rosetting and distinguishing it from &quot;type I&quot; rosetting. In the Introduction section the authors write, &quot;We further showed that IGFBP7-mediated rosetting was different from the previously described rosetting (defined here as type I rosetting), where it (we referred to as type II rosetting) required additional serum factors to occur, in addition to the interaction between the parasite-derived ligand on IRBC surface and the receptor on the surface of URBC.&quot; The requirement for serum factors in rosetting has been described previously. For example, Stevenson and colleagues have made extensive studies of α-2-macroglobulin, which can induce rosetting on its own, while other proteins need several factors together to be efficient. Would the authors reconsider this point, and simply call rosetting &quot;type II, simply, rosetting?</p><p>[Editors’ note: after receiving the revision plan, further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting a revision plan for your article entitled &quot;<italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected erythrocytes induce secretion of IGFBP7 to form type II rosettes and escape phagocytosis&quot;. We would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript, bearing the following additional comments in mind:</p><p>The comment from the authors that they have actually been using serum and not plasma, is confusing and makes me doubt the results about von Willebrand factor.</p><p>a) When serum is formed, blood is coagulated. Platelets are activated, coagulation factors activated and von Willebrand factor is used. So how much vWf is there actually left in serum? Normally, when vWf is measured in humans, it is always measured in plasma. Often in the literature, people have difficulties separating serum and plasma, as for example in Ogawa et al., 2001 where the title contains &quot;serum&quot; but when I read in the Materials and methods what has actually been used, it is plasma. Also in the paper by Kastritis et al., 2016, they talk about &quot;Serum levels of vWf&quot; in the title but when I read the Materials and methods, they have used HemosIL which requires plasma to be able to function.</p><p>The authors have in this current paper not shown that there is any vWf in their serum, they just claim that the effect seen is because an antibody against vWf has an effect. And that antibody (rabbit polyclonal 6994) recognizes both bovine and human vWf. So how do we know that the antibody is not crossreacting with something else in the assay?</p><p>b) They have been using Albumax II, which contains &lt;1% IgG. In Albumax I there is less than 0.1% IgG, which means that there is probably almost 1% IgG in Albumax II. Are there also other bigger proteins like von Willebrand factor? Albumax is made from bovine serum. If there should still be some vWf in human serum, which I from the above reasoning doubt, it could also be there in the Albumax.</p><p>So in conclusion, if the authors are going to continue to claim that there is an effect because of vWf, I would like to see it measured in their culture medium.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51546.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors’ note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><p>The following is a rather long &quot;list&quot; of key concerns with both the experimental approaches and data interpretation.</p><p>1) The observation that IGFB7, released from monocytes and monocyte cell line THP-1, mediates rosetting is based on the interpretation of the data shown in Figure 3 (neutralizing antibody) and gene knockdown experiments (Figure 8).

It is possible that the differences in Abs effect are not due to blocking of specific receptors but rather that they reflect differences in properties of Abs.</p></disp-quote><p>All the antibodies used in the work were at working concentration of 25 µg/ml, including the isotype controls as well. We apologize for overlooking this matter. We have added the information accordingly:</p><p>“…The specificity of rosette-inhibition by the antibodies was validated with experiments using antibody isotype controls at the same working concentration (25 µg/ml) (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A).”</p><p>The isotype controls were included to rule out non-specificity of antibodies. As shown in our Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, the presence of these antibody isotype controls did not affect the ability of IGFBP7 to induce more rosetting, and presence of these antibody isotypes alone exerted no significant changes on the rosetting rates as well. The usage of anti-NID1 in the experiment was also acting like an internal control for the experiment due to its negative effect.</p><p>We have added the rosetting rates without CSMT (control) in all graphs of Figure 3.</p><p>We disagree that the effect seen was not due to the specific blocking of receptors, since we have included the right types of antibody isotypes in the experiments. Kindly refer to Figure 7—figure supplement 1A for this, and the key resources table for the antibodies we used in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) IGFB7 was identified as a factor that mediates rosetting, but it is not clear whether IGFB7 exhibit similar heat sensitivities as did the activity from the supernatant (Figure 1). The authors did not conduct any experiments that would show if the concentrations of IGFB7 found in the supernatant of THP1 cells are similar to those that mediate rosetting.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments in Figure 2D (the one involved heat treatment of culture supernatant) revealed that heat treatment lowered but not completely alleviated the rosette-stimulatory effect of the supernatant, demonstrating involvement of multiple players in rosette-stimulation. We did not try to imply that IGFBP7 is heat-stable. It was a process of deciphering the players of rosette-stimulation from the scratch. We performed a heat treatment experiment (Figures 4E-F) to show that the rosette-stimulating effect of our recombinant IGFBP7 suspension is not attributed to potential non-protein contaminant of the product, which also implies that the protein is not heat-stable. This also fits the picture (Figure 2D) that there is such a big difference in rosette-stimulation (P = 0.0009) between the unheated and heated compartments, as IGFBP7 is the major player in this phenomenon.</p><p>We did perform quantitation of IGFBP7 secreted by THP-1 into culture supernatant (Figure 8B). Exposure of parasites to 1x 10<sup>5</sup> THP-1 cells for 24 hours was adequate to stimulate these cells to secrete more IGFBP7 (from baseline of ~10 ng/ml to ~20 ng/ml). The culture supernatant that we used for rosetting assay was of 1x 10<sup>6</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 B: autologous leukocytes are added. Why is it important with autologous cells? If the rosetting was as dependent as the authors try to state on IGFBP7, it should not make a difference whether it is autologous or heterologous cells?</p></disp-quote><p>At the beginning part of the experiment, we did not know about IGFBP7 at all, and tried our best to design experiments that minimized confounding factors as good as possible. Therefore, we used autologous cells. But subsequently, we used cells from healthy donors (Figure 1C), and still saw the rosette-increment. Hence, the requirement of autologous cells was dropped thereafter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C: Are these autologous cells?</p><p>Figure 1C: 3 donors and 4 parasites should give 12 data points but only 10 are plotted.</p></disp-quote><p>3 donors were used for 3 parasites (9 plots). Not long after the experiment, we received cells from another donor, and on that day, a coworker accidentally thawed a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinical isolate [RDM00036, as stated in Materials and methods] that was not usable for her vivax malaria research. Hence, we recruited the donor’s cells and the unwanted <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and had our 10<sup>th</sup> plot in the graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D lacks statistical testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We did perform Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test for this. It was too messy to plot asterisks across the bars. Hence we put the asterisks on the figure legends, since all parasites showed the similar degree of significance (within the same asterisk category) for all the comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another concern regards the second major conclusion, namely that Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin-1 are required for the effects of recombinant IGFB7 on rosetting. The involvement of these two factors must occur when they are added at saturating concentrations. Otherwise each factor might be effective through the same mechanism. Thus, a dose-response relationship needs to be demonstrated with Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin and rosetting.</p></disp-quote><p>We did perform such dose-effect experiments for VWF (Figure 7D) and TSP-1 (Figure 7F) by fixing the dose of IGFBP7 at 100 ng/ml. In fact, it was through experiment in Figure 7D that we realized that there was another serum-derived player involved in this. And via experiment Figure 7F, by fixing the working concentrations of IGFBP7 and VWF, we tested effect of TSP-1 at 10 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml. We decided the working concentrations of VWF and TSP-1 based on literature review. For healthy individuals, the serum VWF levels range from 0.48 to 1.24 IU/ml, whereas individual having underlying pathological conditions could have much higher levels of VWF (&gt; 300 IU/ml) (Terpos et al., 2013; Kasritis et al., 2016). Therefore, we set the working concentrations of VWF at 2 IU/ml. The range of reported serum TSP-1 concentrations in healthy individuals vary greatly, with one study reported a range of 0-12060 ng/ml (Rouanne et al., 2016). The reported serum TSP-1 levels in healthy individuals by another study varied according to obesity status of the individuals, where non-obese individuals recorded serum TSP-1 levels of 162.7 ± 34.5 ng/ml and obese individuals recorded serum TSP-1 levels of 220.9 ± 46.7 ng/ml (Liu et al., 2015). Prior to experiment in Figure 7F, we already found that the third serum-derived player was only required in low concentration, where even a 2% serum-enriched RPMI1640 medium was adequate to support IGFBP7-mediated rosetting. With this information, two working concentrations of TSP-1 were used in the experiment, i.e. 10 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml.</p><p><italic>Throughout the manuscript the authors talk about &quot;serum factors&quot;. But the only reference I can find when it comes to collection of blood, is lithium heparin. That means</italic> plasma<italic>, not</italic> serum<italic>. So is this paper actually about plasma factors?</italic></p><p>We collected the parasite-containing packed blood cells that should not be coagulated with lithium heparin-anticoagulant vacutainers. But for culture media (same as experiment media) preparation, we use plain tubes, which allow the blood to coagulate, then the <italic>serum</italic> is collected and used as enrichment for RPMI1640. Subsequently, when we replaced the serum with Albumax as enrichment for the media, the IGFBP7-mediated rosette-stimulation was not seen. Hence, “serum factor” is the suitable word to be used in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: In general, P. vivax generates a lot more rosetting than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. What is the explanation for this?</p></disp-quote><p>It seems like this high rosetting property is common among the <italic>P. vivax</italic> population, or at least those in Thailand. It was reported by Chotivanich et al. two decades ago (Chotivanich et al., 1998), and by our group a few years ago (Lee et al., 2014). We do not know the reason behind this. It may be a geographical origin-specific trait, but it is likely to be a common trait in <italic>P. vivax</italic>, since rosetting has been commonly found in <italic>P. vivax</italic> from the New World as well (Marin-Menendez et al., 2013, PLoS Negl Trop Dis 7:e2155).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In experiments examining enzyme sensitivity (trypsin in Figure 5 and heparinase in Figure 6), the authors do not remove the enzyme before testing for rosetting. Also, the authors report the effects of enzyme concentration rather than enzyme activity. The enzymes used are not pure and thus nonspecific effects must be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer. We mentioned about the washing steps in the Materials and methods. The rosetting assay was conducted under conditions free of these enzymes. The reporting of trypsin concentration in works associated with rosetting ligands of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. has always been done in such manner (Crabb et al., 1997, Cell 89:287). Since the enzyme solutions in market are not 100% Trypsin, presenting the values in weight/volume based on calculation after referring to the product’s information sheet should be the best way forward for presentation. We understand that there may be underlying risk of non-specificity when using trypsin solutions. Hence, we used other approaches to decipher the rosetting ligands involved as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors use a wide range of parasite lines and isolates from patients and there is a significant heterogeneity in the results obtained. The rational for the use of the different lab isolates needs to explained better. Also it should be made clear that clinical isolates most likely are clonal.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was to generate data that can represent the actual parasite population that we studied as close as possible, hence the use of clinical isolates. However, the number of cases decreased rapidly during the course of this study. Many mainstream parasite lab lines that have been cultivated for many years in Albumax-enriched media have lost their rosetting ability. Although some of them managed to show rosetting after long period of cultivation in serum-enriched media (e.g. 3D7, CS2), their rosetting rates were always on the lower end without purification of rosette-forming subpopulation (which we do not want, as such purification may not reflect the actual population dynamics of the parasites) in each cycle of cultivation. Hence, we decided to adapt as many clinical isolates that we had into the in vitro cultivation conditions, and used them for the experiments in this study.</p><p>We do not know and we cannot assume, as the reviewer does, that the clinical isolate-derived cultures are clonal since we did not assess their level of clonality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The VAR2CSA expressing parasite – can the authors confirm that it expressed VAR2CSA? What about CS2_WT?</p></disp-quote><p>For the VAR2CSA expressing parasite lines NF54 VAR2CSA_WT and NF54_T934D, sequencing was done to check the VAR2CSA integrity and the presence of expected mutations. Kindly refer to Figure 4 of a recently published paper (Dorin-Semblat et al., 2019) for more detail.</p><p>For CS2_WT, we performed a trypsin assay. The digestion pattern is the same as for Var2CSA (the antibody is anti-ATS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). As this is actually part of another study, we do not wish to include this figure as the figure or supplemental figure for this manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51546-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 5D, the clinical isolate has very low rosetting as compared to many of the other isolates used. Can the authors suggest why this may be the case?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment in Figure 5D was conducted on late ring stages, which, as explained in the manuscript, is the developmental stage where PfEMP1 is the only surface-expressed rosetting ligand. Although the surface expression is already initiated at this developmental stage, the surface expression of rosetting ligands will only reach optimal state hours later (late trophozoite stage). Hence, the rosetting rates of the IRBCs in this experiment (which used late ring stages, as compared to the rest of the experiments that used mature/late stages were lower.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The VAR2CSA expressing line is particularly poor in rosetting. This suggests that levels of rosetting may be impacted by the PfEMP1 expressed. It would be interesting if the authors could provide some insights into this. For example what is unique about FVT402 as compared to 3D7 or MK183?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important and interesting aspect, given that 3D7 is a parasite line of African origin, whereas FVT402 and MKK183 are the Thai isolates. We believe this is beyond the scope of the current study, since compiling all this information into one manuscript will be too overwhelming and will distract from the core focus of this work: IGFBP7-mediated rosetting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors propose that PfEMP1 is the parasite ligand that mediates this rosetting via TSP1. However, it is clear that the levels of rosetting varies between isolates and lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Different isolate and line may have different saturations/levels of IRBC surface-expressed PfEMP1. This may be one reason for the different rosetting rates seen. In addition, the sera that we used as media enrichment, as well as the erythrocytes that we used in cultivation were from different individuals. These may contribute to the variation seen. We tried our best to use consistent conditions and materials for the experiments through the years. However, these are the aspects that we cannot control. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that collectively, TSP-1 and VWF facilitate the IGFBP7-mediated rosetting in the isolates and lines tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 6 the authors show that rosetting is impacted of in clinical isolates and is effected by anti-CR1 me. This result is somewhat surprising, as it would suggest that all the parasites express a CR1 binding PfEMP1. Isn't so that only a subset of PfEMP1 that bind CR1? Can the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>Not all recruited <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates showed big rosette-inhibition by the anti-CR1 antibodies. However, some showed drastic rosetting rate reduction by the antibody. Collectively, the dataset showed significant difference. Non-specific inhibition such as steric hindrance may be a possible reason. However, it is rather unlikely the case here, since our data from <italic>P. vivax</italic> isolates showed that the same antibody had insignificant effect on their rosetting rates. Our dataset pattern still fits into the statement that only a subset of PfEMP1 rosette via CR1 binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 7 and subsection “Serum-derived co-factors in IGFBP7-mediated rosetting”, the authors appear to state that large proteins were removed with a 0.45 micron filter. The statement is inaccurate. It is more likely the authors are removing large protein aggregates.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this, this has been amended:</p><p>“All the experiments described above were performed using 20% human serum-enriched medium. However, serum filtration with a 0.45 μm filter abolished IGFBP7-induced rosetting (Figure 7A). These results indicated that other large-sized serum-derived protein aggregates or multimers might be needed for the IGFBP7-mediated rosetting effect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The experiment depicted in Figure 8 is missing controls. Lentiviral vector mediated knockdowns experiments require controls for off-target effects. It is necessary to have two shRNA vectors targeting different sequences on the same gene. The authors present only one. There may also be some confusion regarding the technique as subsection “Knockdown of IGFBP7 expression by THP-1 using RNAi transduction” states that siRNA was used and the correct term should be shRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been amended:</p><p>“…THP-1 cells were transduced with shRNA lentiviral vectors specific…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In an attempt to be concise and brief, the authors provide very little experimental details – particularly concerning how an experiment addresses a particular question in the main text. This makes it very difficult for someone that is not an expert in the field to understand the work. While the Materials and methods section provides all the relevant information, it is very detailed and therefore makes it difficult and cumbersome to find the relevant information. For example &quot;using Zymosan A&quot; for many readers this would not provide the relevant information to interpret the results. Other concerns arose regarding clarity throughout the manuscript. Below are some examples that seem confusing. When examining whether a cell-free supernatant contains a biological active substance, serial dilutions must be examined and the dilution resulting in 50% activity is then used for chemical characterization. If the factor is highly concentrated in supernatant, loss due to temperature, for example, might not be observed. Please revise the sentence in subsection “Effect of THP-1 culture supernatants and supernatant fractionation”, as it is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the advice and added more “bridges” to explain or justify the need for subsequent experiments that came after the previous ones.</p><p>We have added brief explanation for zymosan A:</p><p>“…We hypothesized that IGFBP7-mediated rosetting could be a strategy used by the parasites to avoid phagocytosis. To test this, we performed a control experiment using Zymosan A (a protein-carbohydrate complex prepared from yeast cell wall, commonly used in phagocytosis assays) and showed that IGFBP7 by itself did not inhibit the phagocytosis ability of THP-1 (Figure 8E).”</p><p>We have made changes:</p><p>“Fractionation of CSMT into aqueous and lipid fractions revealed that the rosette-stimulating factors were in the aqueous fraction (Figure 2A). Subsequently, we further fractionated the aqueous fraction into high and low molecular weight sub-fractions (with the cut-off of 30 kDa). Both aqueous sub-fractions induced rosetting of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (Figures 2B and 2C), demonstrating that the rosetting stimulation was mediated by multiple secreted hydrophilic factors, predominantly of sizes ≤ 30 kDa (particularly for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Finally, there is an objection to the characterization of the rosetting studied here as &quot;type II&quot; rosetting and distinguishing it from &quot;type I&quot; rosetting. In the Introduction section the authors write, &quot;We further showed that IGFBP7-mediated rosetting was different from the previously described rosetting (defined here as type I rosetting), where it (we referred to as type II rosetting) required additional serum factors to occur, in addition to the interaction between the parasite-derived ligand on IRBC surface and the receptor on the surface of URBC.&quot; The requirement for serum factors in rosetting has been described previously. For example, Stevenson and colleagues have made extensive studies of α-2-macroglobulin, which can induce rosetting on its own, while other proteins need several factors together to be efficient. Would the authors reconsider this point, and simply call rosetting &quot;type II, simply, rosetting?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason we redefine rosettes as “type I” and “type II” is that the classical type I is the rosette involving direct interaction between a rosetting ligand and a rosetting receptor. However, the type II rosette involve other factors that bring the rosetting ligand and receptor together, without which the rosetting rates would be dropped to the baseline levels contributed by the type I rosettes. We would like to stress that we are not claiming ourselves as the discoverer of this phenomenon. Indeed, as discussed in the manuscript, complement factor d, as well as the macroglobulin brought up by the reviewer are rosette stimulators as well. However, these factors are neither ligand nor receptors, which by themselves can also form stable rosettes too. Hence, we think that it is important to differentiate between the two types of rosettes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comment from the authors that they have actually been using serum and not plasma, is confusing and makes me doubt the results about von Willebrand factor.</p><p>a) When serum is formed, blood is coagulated. Platelets are activated, coagulation factors activated and von Willebrand factor is used. So how much VWF is there actually left in serum? Normally, when VWF is measured in humans, it is always measured in plasma. Often in the literature, people have difficulties separating serum and plasma, as for example in Ogawa et al., 2001 where the title contains &quot;serum&quot; but when I read in the Materials and methods what has actually been used, it is plasma. Also in the paper by Kastritis et al., 2016, they talk about &quot;Serum levels of VWF&quot; in the title but when I read the Materials and methods, they have used HemosIL which requires plasma to be able to function.</p><p>The authors have in this current paper not shown that there is any VWF in their serum, they just claim that the effect seen is because an antibody against VWF has an effect. And that antibody (rabbit polyclonal 6994) recognizes both bovine and human VWF. So how do we know that the antibody is not crossreacting with something else in the assay?</p><p>b) They have been using Albumax II, which contains &lt;1% IgG. In Albumax I there is less than 0.1% IgG, which means that there is probably almost 1% IgG in Albumax II. Are there also other bigger proteins like von Willebrand factor? Albumax is made from bovine serum. If there should still be some VWF in human serum, which I from the above reasoning doubt, it could also be there in the Albumax.</p><p>So in conclusion, if the authors are going to continue to claim that there is an effect because of VWF, I would like to see it measured in their culture medium.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantitated the VWF levels of the media used in this study. We took sera samples of two of our main serum contributing sources and prepared the culture media. The results have been included as Figure 7—figure supplement 1B. The level of VWF in our serum-enriched media was of adequate levels (higher than 0.125 IU/ml) to support the IGFBP7-mediated rosetting. Albumax-enriched medium and plain medium showed VWF level (if any) that was below the detection limit of the ELISA kit (2.56 x 10<sup>-5</sup> IU/ml). We have included this information in the text as well:</p><p>“…Lastly, we quantitated the amount of VWF needed to facilitate IGFBP7-mediated rosetting. When supplemented with IGFBP7 and TSP-1 in Albumax-supplemented medium, VWF as low as 0.125 IU/ml was sufficient to significantly increase rosetting rates, with an optimal increment attained at 0.5 IU/ml (Figure 7G). In fact, the 20% serum-enriched media that we used for this study contained VWF higher than 0.125 IU/ml (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).”</p><p>We would like to take this opportunity to disagree with the comment that serum does not have VWF. In the booklet of the ELISA kit that we used, it also acknowledged serum as one of the suitable samples for VWF. Based on the suggested dilution, serum seems to be better than plasma to recover low level of VWF.</p><p>Moreover, quantification of VWF using plasma and serum has been compared, and the levels of VWF of plasma and serum showed no significant difference (P = 0.752) (Kovacevic et al., 2019. <italic>Atherosclerosis, 290</italic>, 31-36. doi: 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2019.09.003).</p><p>Control knock experiments in THP1</p><p>As promised in the previous round of rebuttal, we have also conducted a shRNA transduction to knock down an unrelated gene (glycophorin C) on THP-1 using the same lentiviral vectors with the same molecular backbone produced by the same company (Sigma) as a control. The expression of IGFBP7 by the GlyC-KD THP-1 was not affected by the knockdown of GlyC, and the cells secreted more IGFBP7 when exposed to the parasites.</p><p>In addition, we also quantitated the level of IGFBP7 in the culture supernatant of THP-1-WT, IGFBP7-KD-THP-1, and GlyC-KD-THP-1, and used them for rosetting assay on <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, along with usage of anti-human IGFBP7 antibody in the experiment. We have rewritten the section to include this in the text:</p><p>“THP-1 cells were transduced with shRNA lentiviral vectors specific for IGFBBP7 and vectors specific for an unrelated protein, glycophorin C. Non-transduced cells served as wild types (THP-1_WT). […] Importantly, the significant difference between culture supernatant groups “THP-1_WT_URBC” and “THP-1_WT_IRBC” (P = 0.0018), as well as “GlyC-KD_THP-1_URBC” and “GlyC-KD_THP-1_IRBC” (P = 0.0013), but not between “IGFBP7-KD_THP-1_URBC” and “IGFBP7-KD THP-1_IRBC” (P = 0.6011) strongly suggests that IGFBP7 may be one of the key secreted products by the monocytic cells in response to parasite exposure, whereas other factors involved in rosette-stimulation may be secreted at baseline levels with or without presence of the parasites (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
