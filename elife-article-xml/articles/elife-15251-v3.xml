incompletely understood. In this study, we describe a novel subset of murine dermal perivascular macrophages that extend protrusions across the endothelial junctions in steady-state and capture blood-borne macromolecules. Unlike other skin-resident macrophages that are reconstituted by bone marrow-derived progenitors after a genotoxic insult, these cells are replenished by an extramedullary radio-resistant and UV-sensitive Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor. Furthermore, they possess a distinctive anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile, which cannot be polarized under inflammatory conditions, and are involved in repair and remodeling functions for which other skin-resident macrophages appear dispensable. Based on all their properties, we define these macrophages as Skin Transendothelial Radio-resistant Anti-inflammatory Macrophages (STREAM) and postulate that their preservation is important for skin homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15251.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15251.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15251.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin forms an essential barrier that defends our body from external damage. For this reason, it is important to understand the complex mechanisms involved in healing wounds and maintaining healthy skin. This could allow us to find effective treatments for skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.</p><p>Immune cells called macrophages can protect the body in different ways depending on the signals they receive. Their protective roles include killing microbes that may cause disease, and helping to repair damaged tissues. Barreiro et al. have now investigated the roles of the macrophages in the skin by means of a number of complementary techniques, including a method called intravital microscopy that can image cells in a living organism.</p><p>The experiments revealed that a division of labor exists among the macrophages that reside in the skin of mice. Some macrophages help to trigger inflammatory responses in the skin. These immune cells disappear after being exposed to ionizing radiation (such as that used to treat cancer) but can be replaced via a bone marrow transplant. Other macrophages that help to repair tissues can survive being exposed to ionizing radiation but cannot resist high levels of ultraviolet light. Both types of macrophages perform unique and essential roles, and both types are necessary for maintaining healthy skin.</p><p>Barreiro et al. also discovered that the skin macrophages that help to repair tissues have the ability to move into blood vessels and take up substances from the blood. A question for future investigation is whether the macrophages perform this scavenging process to trigger a protective immune response in the nearby skin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15251.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15251.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>intravital imaging</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008052</institution-id><institution>Fundación Alfonso Martín Escudero</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barreiro</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2011-AdG294340-GENTRIS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barreiro</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AR068383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barreiro</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>von Andrian</surname><given-names>Ulrich H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2011-25834</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cibrian</surname><given-names>Danay</given-names></name><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF 2014-55579-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name><name><surname>Cibrian</surname><given-names>Danay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2011-27330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martín</surname><given-names>Pilar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INDISNET-S2011/BMD-2332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martín</surname><given-names>Pilar</given-names></name><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Instituto Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Red Cardiovascular RD 12-0042-0056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new type of skin perivascular macrophages with extramedullary origin, access to blood and exclusive anti-inflammatory reparative properties has been characterized.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are myeloid cells highly specialized in pathogen clearance and antigen capture in lymphoid tissues, where they participate in the first line of immune defense against exogenous threats, extending a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varol et al., 2015</xref>). Homeostasis is also maintained in a number of peripheral non-lymphoid tissues by the phagocytic, anti-microbial and tissue remodeling activities of specialized resident macrophages, including alveolar macrophages in lungs, interstitial histiocytes in connective tissue, osteoclasts in bone, microglia in brain, Kupffer cells in liver, peritoneal, intestinal and adipose tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>). Likewise, macrophages contribute to the barrier function of the skin. Unlike migratory epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells, which are mobilized after topical antigen uptake to perform their tolerogenic or immunogenic role within the draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henri et al., 2010</xref>), skin-resident macrophages remain in the dermis, contributing to pathogen clearance, tissue repair and the resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasparakis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A certain degree of heterogeneity among skin-resident macrophages has been previously reported relative to their ontogeny as well as to the functional specialization of specific subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tamoutounour et al., 2013</xref>). Herein, we define for the first time a clear dichotomy among the skin-resident macrophages based on their differential sensitivity to γ-irradiation. Radio-resistant and radio-sensitive skin macrophages are distinctively polarized already in steady state as revealed by transcriptional analysis. Consequently, these two macrophage subsets are functionally specialized in a cell-autonomous manner even though both subsets are exposed to mostly shared environmental cues. In particular, the radio-resistant macrophage subset comprises a novel type of perivascular macrophages that gain access to the vascular lumen, are highly phagocytic and possess anti-inflammatory properties even in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, they are renewed from a local Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor and become outcompeted over time by bone marrow-derived resident macrophages. Finally, the preferential depletion of these skin transendothelial radio-resistant anti-inflammatory macrophages (STREAMs) using diphtheria toxin-OVA nanoparticles evidences their involvement in tissue repair and remodeling, as well as the inability of their radio-sensitive counterparts to act as functional surrogates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dermal perivascular macrophages protrude into microvessels at steady-state</title><p>To visualize the microvascular network of the skin, we performed intravital imaging of the upper dermis of the mouse ear under steady-state conditions using a minimally invasive model based on confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>). The vasculature was highlighted by injecting i.v. a non-permeable vascular tracer, high molecular weight (HMw; 2 MDa) TRITC-dextran. Remarkably, a population of perivascular cells became readily visible during the first hours after HMw dextran injection, suggesting that these mostly sessile cells were constantly taking up intravascular dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This observation was further confirmed by monitoring the uptake of two differently labeled HMw dextrans injected with a lapse of 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Dextran administration followed by the subsequent injection of a non-phagocytosable tracer (vivotag) revealed the presence of dextran<sup>+</sup> protrusions as non-stained regions in the vivotag channel projecting into the vessel lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The protrusions were flapping inside the vessels, presumably deflected by the vascular flow, and even contacting circulating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). The phenotypic characterization of the TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells identified them mostly as macrophages (i.e., they were either CD45<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>high</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD45<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>high</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> cells by FACS [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>] and CD68<sup>+</sup> cells by whole-mount immunofluorescence staining [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>]). Flow cytometry analysis of skin single-cell suspensions from 12-week-old animals showed that the 96.67% ± 1.02% of all TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> cells were CD45<sup>+</sup> and the 90.41% ± 2.06% of CD45<sup>+</sup> TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> cells corresponded to macrophages (CD64<sup>+</sup>). In addition, TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages represented 41.28% ± 5.66% of total skin macrophages. Next, we performed a mesoscopic analysis of murine ears to characterize the spatial distribution of skin macrophages. This analysis revealed their preferential localization around dermal blood microvessels rather than lymphatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Interestingly, TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages were mostly apposed to capillaries and venules, possibly because the dense smooth muscle layer wrapping arterioles prevented the access of macrophages to the arteriolar lumen (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Moreover, endothelial cells did not detectably capture dextran under our experimental conditions, ruling out the possibility of the endothelium making accessible the intravascular dextran to the perivascular macrophages by transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15251.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dermal perivascular macrophages capture intraluminal dextran.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Representative frames from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> are shown.

We detected dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages embracing vessels from outside the pericyte sheath (visualized as GFP<sup>+</sup> cells around vessels using a nestin-eGFP reporter mouse), whereas their protrusions extended across the basement membrane (stained with anti-collagen IV) and between pericytes to reach the endothelial wall (whole-mount immunofluorescence stainings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also visualized dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophage protrusions aligned with endothelial junctions in vivo by intravital microscopy by injecting i.v. an anti-CD31 antibody to stain the luminal surface of dermal microvasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Further analysis using orthogonal sectioning of whole-mount immunofluorescence stainings indicated that the macrophages insert their protrusions in the intravascular space through endothelial intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, TRITC-dextran uptake was minimal in VE-cadherin-α-catenin knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In these animals, endothelial adherens junctions are stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schulte et al., 2011</xref>), which prevents paravascular permeability and leukocyte paracellular but not transcellular diapedesis. The ability of dermal macrophages to access the intraluminal space is restricted in these animals, supporting the observation that macrophages can reach the vascular lumen crossing the endothelial junctions and excluding the possibility that their protrusions reach the vessel lumen via a transcellular route through endothelial cells. Finally, since the capture of dextran by skin myeloid cells is mediated by the mannose receptor (CD206) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wollenberg et al., 2002</xref>), we could selectively stain the intraluminal protrusions of these dermal perivascular macrophages in vivo by injecting i.v. anti-CD206 and quantified the amount of endothelial-protruding macrophages by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We first treated chimeric animals intradermally with clodronate liposomes to deplete skin macrophages. Monitoring at 24 hr after injection showed depletion of both macrophage subsets, whereas after 7d we observed selective partial recovery of host macrophages, consistent with an in situ renewal of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, we performed Ki-67 staining in the skin of host and donor macrophages from chimeric animals using LC as control cells endowed with self-renewal potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chorro et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The results point out to host macrophages as the only cell type assayed unable to proliferate by itself in steady-state. We complemented the study analysing the incorporation of BrdU administered ad libitum during 8d in these subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The results indicate that host radio-resistant macrophages have a slower turnover compared to BM-derived donor macrophages and LC. Altogether these findings suggest that skin radio-resistant macrophages are a long-lived differentiated population that originates from an in situ proliferating progenitor. Interestingly, the relative content of resident macrophages from donor and host changed dynamically over time in favor of the dominant BM-derived pool, which exhibits higher proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To identify the extramedullary source for dermal radio-resistant macrophages, we performed a fate mapping analysis in adult skin. First, we performed an analysis of the expression of a panel of stemness-related genes demonstrating that skin-resident macrophages possess no pluripotent potential per se in steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we employed a reporter mouse (<italic>Bmi1</italic>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26 YFP) driven by the promoter of <italic>Bmi1</italic>, gene involved in the maintenance of adult stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</xref>), which enabled us to trace adult stem cells and their progeny in skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Macrophages contain very low levels of the <italic>Bmi1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and are devoid of <italic>Bmi1</italic> protein in steady-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sienerth et al., 2011</xref>). However, YFP<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>high</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> macrophages were detected in the homeostatic skin of <italic>Bmi1</italic> reporter animals not earlier than 5d after i.p. injection of tamoxifen, suggesting that they are indeed derived from a Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Generation of YFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages was increased during macrophage replenishment after depletion with s.c. clodronate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Moreover, microscopy analysis of the dermis of these reporter animals detected perivascular YFP<sup>+</sup> cells protruding into vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To exclude the contribution of BM-derived hematopoietic stem cells in this system, we generated chimeric CD45.1 C57BL/6 wt//<italic>Bmi1</italic>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26 YFP CD45.2 (donor/host) mice. YFP<sup>+</sup> dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages were detected in the skin of tamoxifen-treated HMw dextran-injected chimeric mice by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>). Intravital experiments confirmed the existence of YFP<sup>+</sup> dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages under steady-state conditions in chimeras lacking tamoxifen-inducible hematopoietic cells of BM origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Together these results confirm the in situ generation of radio-resistant macrophages from a skin pluripotent progenitor independent of BM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phenotypic differences among skin-resident macrophage subsets</title><p>Our results strongly imply the coexistence of two distinct skin-resident macrophage pools in homeostasis based on their differential capacity to uptake circulating macromolecules, sensitivity to γ-irradiation and progenitor source. To further characterize these two populations, we performed a detailed phenotypic characterization of host radio-resistant and donor BM-derived macrophages in chimeric mice after 3 months of reconstitution. Both subsets were F4/80<sup>high</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup> and expressed similar levels of other myeloid markers such as Ly6C and CD115, as well as of the prototypic macrophage markers CD68 and CD64-MertK (whose combined expression is associated with mature tissue macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

OVA-coated nanoparticles (NP) adsorbed with diphtheria toxin (DT). In contrast to the i.v. administration of clodronate liposomes, which failed to eradicate skin STREAMs (<italic>data not shown</italic>), this tailored experimental strategy depleted preferentially STREAMs preserving most of the other skin macrophages that had no access to the blood-borne toxin-coated NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, the potential anti-inflammatory function of STREAMs in tissue repair was interrogated using a model of wound healing in combination with DT-OVA-NP treatment. Animals were treated either with OVA-NP or DT-OVA-NP (2.5 μl/g per dose) 1d before and 2d after wounding and were sacrificed at d5, observing a clear decrease in the macrophage population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,D</xref>). At this mid-stage of repair, macrophage depletion was associated with a significant delay in the healing process (measured as % of area of initial wound) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) and the histological analyses revealed a marked reduction in the formation of granulation tissue, concomitant reduced angiogenesis as well as delayed re-epithelialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref>). Next, we administered a sole dose (2.5 μl/g) of DT-OVA-NP 2d after wounding and monitored wound closure till d9. In this manner, the macrophage depletion was attained after the initial inflammatory phase of wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurtner et al., 2008</xref>). The Masson trichrome staining demonstrated a clear defect in collagen deposition in the animals treated with DT-OVA-NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). This defect correlated with the disordered distribution of myofibroblasts in these animals observed with the α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These results contrasted with the abundant collagen deposition and the parallel organization of myofibroblasts in OVA-NP-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–B</xref>). This noticeable phenotype observed in macrophage function-related parameters indicates that STREAMs could exert a prominent role as the macrophages involved in orchestrating tissue remodeling and repair in skin, as anticipated by their anti-inflammatory gene and protein expression profile.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15251.029</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Macrophage depletion using DT-OVA-NP hampered wound healing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Animals were first injected i.v. with either OVA-NP or DT-OVA-NP (2.5 μl/g) and, 1d later, the wound healing assay began.

The observation of this phenomenon in chimeric animals allowed us to further characterize STREAMs as a radio-resistant subset of skin macrophages, whose turnover is ensured by an extramedullary source. We could also determine that STREAMs are committed to perform anti-inflammatory functions, lacking the plasticity to be reprogrammed in the presence of a potent pro-inflammatory stimulus. Finally, the selective depletion of STREAMs highlighted their function in tissue repair and remodeling processes to regain skin homeostasis.</p><p>It is well established that specialized macrophage subtypes, such as subcapsular sinus macrophages in lymph nodes and Kupffer cells in liver, can traverse fenestrated endothelial sinusoids to capture lymph- or blood-borne particulate antigens and participate in the initiation of innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Junt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Dendritic cells are also able to extend transepithelial projections to capture foreign particulate antigens from airways and gut mucosa, or traverse the vasculature in pancreatic islets of Langerhans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calderon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farache et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rescigno et al., 2001</xref>). However, some of these specialized dendritic cells have been redefined as macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calderon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazzini et al., 2014</xref>). CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in the central nervous system could also gain access to vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkauskas et al., 2013</xref>) and mast cells were recently reported to capture blood-borne IgE, albeit the underlying mechanism remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). Herein, we report that STREAMs are unique macrophages in that they traverse the endothelial junctions of non-fenestrated dermal vasculature to take up circulating macromolecules under homeostatic conditions. STREAM’s protrusions only emerge through the endothelial cell-cell junctions and do not use a transcellular route, as illustrated using a genetic approach (the VE-cad-α-cat transgenic mouse line, which display impregnable, highly stable adherens junctions). Moreover, unlike subcapsular sinus macrophages in lymph nodes, which act like fly paper retaining lymph-borne viral particles on their surface for subsequent transfer to B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Junt et al., 2007</xref>), STREAMs internalize particulate antigens, such as OVA-FITC Fluospheres, and might play a role in their cross-presentation to tissue-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>The existence of radio-resistant dendritic cells in the skin has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogunovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merad et al., 2002</xref>), whereas the presence of radio-resistant dermal macrophages has remained elusive hitherto. This study reveals that STREAMs are a radio-resistant subset that coexists in steady state with other skin macrophages of radio-sensitive nature. In this regard, the radio-resistant macrophages described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haniffa et al., 2009</xref>) might be the human homolog of this mouse subset, extending the generality and impact of our findings. The chimerism, parabiosis and fate mapping experiments also indicate that STREAMs are maintained locally in the skin throughout adult life independently of circulatory precursors, as opposed to radio-sensitive macrophages that are renewed at a low rate from blood in steady state and replaced by donor BM progenitors after a genotoxic insult. Thus, our data further extent the previous knowledge on the minimal blood exchange experienced by tissue-resident macrophages in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The renewal potential and the lifespan of tissue-resident macrophages are still controversial. Somes studies have described the potential of macrophages to be self-perpetuated under certain conditions (for example, in the presence of IL-4 during a parasitic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>] or in a M-CSF- or GM-CSF-dependent manner after macrophage depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 2013</xref>]). STREAMs are unable to self-renew in steady-state and their turnover from a Bmi1<sup>+</sup> adult progenitor occurs at a low basal rate, becoming outcompeted over time by other skin-resident macrophages with faster turnover. Hence, our results concur with previous studies reporting a dual origin for skin macrophages with a prenatally-derived CCR2-independent subset and a postnatal BM-derived CCR2-dependent subset, being the prenatally-derived subset displaced by the BM-derived subset with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakubzick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tamoutounour et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, this dual origin has been also observed in other tissues such as heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Molawi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unraveling the ontogenetic source for tissue-resident macrophages is another complex matter. There are several landmark studies describing the existence of different macrophage precursors during development. The yolk sac-derived Myb-independent F4/80<sup>bright</sup> macrophages seeded in the embryonic skin prior to birth and renewed independently of definitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>) might correspond to the developmental precursor for STREAMs and the c-Myb dependent fetal liver monocytes that give rise to macrophages with self-renewal capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>) might be the precursors of the radiosensitive macrophages (those susceptible of replenishment by BM precursors after a genotoxic insult). However, the elucidation of skin macrophage ontogeny deserves further thorough investigation in future studies.</p><p>Regarding phenotypic characterization, a classification of the skin mononuclear phagocyte system based on phenotypic markers has recently identified heterogeneity among the skin-resident macrophages, although not related to radio-sensitivity. These authors distinguish two distinct skin-resident macrophage subsets defined both as CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> MerTK<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>low</sup> CCR2<sup>-</sup> but differing on the expression of MHC-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tamoutounour et al., 2013</xref>). They suggest that both subsets possess analogous transcriptional profiles, share functions, are radio-sensitive and equally dependent on BM supply, and could represent sequential stages of differentiation (the MHC-II<sup>low</sup> subset (P4) maturing into MHC-II<sup>high</sup> (P5) macrophages). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the expression of MHC-II in skin macrophages cannot precisely discriminate the two independent subsets of macrophages with distinct radio-sensitivity, different polarization profiles and non-overlapping functions described in our work. Therefore, the classification criteria used in this work allows better resolution of the skin macrophage subsets, compared to classifications relying on subset-defining markers that might not adequately reflect the existing heterogeneity within the skin niche.</p><p>Metabolic adaptation is a key feature in macrophage activation, instrumental for their function in homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>). In this regard, the GSEA of our RNASeq data highlight clear differences in the metabolic gene profiles of host radio-resistant and BM-derived macrophages. We found an enrichment in genes involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid and linoleic acid metabolism, as well as in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in the gene profile of radio-resistant macrophages. These results are compatible with the energetic requirements and the regulation of membrane fluidity needed for phagocytosis and are also crucial for tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas and Mantovani, 2012</xref>). Other genes enriched in this subset are related to fibrogenesis and tissue repair such as <italic>Tgfb1</italic> and genes of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, as well as genes related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, being consistent this with an antioxidant protective role. Conversely, the transcriptional profile of the BM-derived macrophages includes an over-representation of genes associated with the carbohydrate and retinol metabolisms such as the pentose phosphate pathway, with the ABC transporters and the JAK-STAT and WNT signaling pathways, in accordance with their pro-inflammatory potential. Moreover, a gene encoding a regulator of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (<italic>Trap1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>) is specifically expressed in BM-derived macrophages.</p><p>Our study in the homeostatic skin along with others describing the existence of polarized macrophages already in steady state in heart, testis and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeFalco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinto et al., 2012</xref>) help to reformulate the long-held paradigm of macrophage polarization, which defined the functional specialization of macrophages from a steady-state non polarized status mainly as a consequence of integrating external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon and Pluddemann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sica and Mantovani, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the study by Calderon and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderon et al., 2015</xref>) highlights the imprinting of distinct features in macrophages by their anatomical localization within the steady-state pancreas. The macrophages in the islets possess a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and protrude into the fenestrated vessels, whereas the stromal milieu sets the response of the macrophages in favor of the M2 phenotype. This pattern of regional specialization might not be applicable to the skin where, e.g., perivascular macrophages with pro-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abtin et al., 2014</xref>) and anti-inflammatory (STREAMs) phenotypes coexist in the same areas. However, although both subsets mostly share environmental stimuli, STREAMs can get access to the intravascular milieu and might receive selective signals that could contribute to maintain their phenotype. Therefore, the essential role of the environment in controlling tissue-specific macrophage identities cannot be dismissed as highlighted in recent epigenetics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gosselin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lavin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The preferential depletion of anti-inflammatory STREAMs has a deleterious impact in the wounded skin, indicating that they could participate in orchestrating the pro-reparative functions traditionally associated to the so-called alternatively activated (M2) macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, we observed that the rate of wound closure was neither affected in the <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals (as previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Willenborg et al., 2012</xref>) nor in chimeric <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, indicating that infiltrating monocytes and radiosensitive tissue-resident macrophages could be mostly dispensable for the reparative phase of the healing process in the skin. Thus, the coexistence of macrophage subsets performing non-redundant roles in homeostatic skin highlights the need of maintaining equilibrium between both pools to preserve the skin fitness. The lack of functional redundancy could be of clinical significance, and may contribute to better understand concomitant skin pathologies arising from radio-induced bone marrow ablation therapies and certain inflammatory skin disorders, particularly those aggravated with age.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Male either littermates or age-matched (8-to-12-week-old) mice on the C57BL/6J background were used for intravital imaging, phenotypic characterization, transcriptional analysis and functional experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior editor and three reviewers, including Klaus Ley and Satyajit Rath, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors convincingly and elegantly show a new subset of perivascular skin macrophages (&quot;STREAM&quot;) that are radio-resistant, take up high molecular weight dextran by intraluminal processes, have a gene expression profile consistent with anti-inflammatory functions, and show functional importance in wound healing. The combination of lineage origin, anatomical location and specific functionality makes this an interesting set of findings of broad interest.</p><p>It would help to have the following concerns addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be very useful to have data and clarity about the developmental origin of these cells, and the relationship of this macrophage group with other ontogenetically distinct subsets of dermal macrophages previously reported. Dual origins for skin macrophages have been previously reported as a CCR2-independent prenatally derived subset and a CCR2-dependent postnatal bone marrow-derived subset (Jakubzick et al. and Tamoutounour et al. 2013). Is the origin of these STREAM macrophages yolk-sac and/or fetal liver? Is their development c-Myb-dependent? Are these cells the same as or different from the perivascular macrophages that mediate neutrophil chemo-attraction (Abtin et al.)?</p><p>2) The authors refer to this macrophage subset as 'radio-resistant' and suggest that these cells are maintained locally. These are two separate properties though perhaps related, and require elucidation. Thus, does 'radio-resistance' refer to the differentiated perivascular cells themselves, or to some progenitor population? Can comparable numbers of STREAM cells be detected in perivascular locations at very early time points following irradiation? Since proliferation markers have not been measured, the conclusion that this population is locally self-renewing is not rigorously supported by data. A related but broader question is; how long do intravascular dextran-tagged perivascular macrophages persist in that location?</p><p>3) In light of reports that perivascular macrophages express Tie-2 and are highly pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory (see the work by de Palma et col.), and that Tie-2+ macrophages are known to be related to patrolling Cx3CR1 monocytes, it would be useful to have some further phenotypic characterization of these STREAM cells for such markers.</p><p>4) Isolating macrophages from skin requires harsh digestion. It would be useful to have evidence about how this affects cell surface phenotype, viability and other properties.</p><p>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> should be accompanied by formal demonstration of co-localization, and its insets should be at a higher resolution.</p><p>6) The authors follow the schema of classically (IFN-γ) or alternatively (IL-4) activated macrophages. However, macrophage polarization is possible without these cytokines (Mills et col., 2000). Also, there is growing opinion that there is a complex spectrum of macrophage functionality, rather than the simplified M1/M2 duality (Ginhoux et al. Nat. Immunol. (2015); Immunity (2016)). Further, the manuscript argues for a simple binary distinction between 'pro-inflammatory' and 'anti-inflammatory', which is based on a handful of genes and not quite borne out by the data. Thus, while discussing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors switch their labeling in the figures from donor/host to pro- and anti-inflammatory. It would also be important to test responses to ex vivo stimulation with IL-4 and look at transcriptional induction to complement the data on responses to LPS. It would be useful if the manuscript could be revised to reflect the complex functional landscape of macrophages.</p><p>7) The manuscript does not clearly specify the use of DTR-transgenic mice, yet DT beads are used to deplete STREAM cells. The issue should be clarified.</p><p>8) The authors interpret the data as supportive for 'cell-autonomous' programming; how is a lineage-specific cellular autonomy of programming being distinguished from micro-environmental distinctions provided by, say, exposure to intravascular-extravascular versus extravascular-alone microenvironments? In fact, what is the functional relevance of the microvascular protrusions of the STREAM cells? Is the lack of LPS-responsiveness in these 'STREAMs' related to 'training', mediated perhaps by constant exposure to intravascular content?</p><p>9) New data should not be introduced in the Discussion.</p><p>10) Do the authors have any evidence based on staining of human skin samples to show the expression of this subset there as well?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15251.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) It would be very useful to have data and clarity about the developmental origin of these cells, and the relationship of this macrophage group with other ontogenetically distinct subsets of dermal macrophages previously reported. Dual origins for skin macrophages have been previously reported as a CCR2-independent prenatally derived subset and a CCR2-dependent postnatal bone marrow-derived subset (Jakubzick et al. and Tamoutounour et al. 2013). Is the origin of these STREAM macrophages yolk-sac and/or fetal liver? Is their development c-Myb-dependent?</italic> </p><p>We agree that understanding the developmental origin of STREAMs is fundamental to establish ontogenetic relationships with other dermal macrophage subsets. However, elucidating the ontogeny of these cells and their possible dependence on c-Myb are not trivial questions. A detailed ontogenetic analysis would entail the generation of reagents (such as acquisition and breeding of mouse strains necessary for the study) and extensive additional experimentation that cannot be achieved in a reasonable time frame. We have discussed a plausible developmental origin for STREAMs in the Discussion (fifth paragraph), but we truly believe that the proposed study deserves a complete new piece of work and it is out of the scope of this paper.</p><p>Alternatively, we have worked thoroughly to understand the origin and maintenance of STREAMs in adulthood, which is also a related and very relevant question that complements the rest of the findings presented in our paper (imaging, phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional analyses) performed in adult skin. To tackle this question, we have carried out a fate mapping analysis of adult stem cells finding that STREAMs are renewed from a local progenitor not related to BM hematopoiesis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). We very much hope that the reviewers will be satisfied with this study that sheds new light on the origin of STREAMs at a post-natal stage.</p><p><italic>Are these cells the same as or different from the perivascular macrophages that mediate neutrophil chemo-attraction (Abtin et al.)?</italic></p><p>We have already addressed this question in the original version of the manuscript using the DPE-GFP strain, in which a subset of perivascular macrophages express GFP and mediate neutrophil chemo-attraction (reported by Abtin et al., Nat Immunol 2014). Combining microscopy and FACs analyses in the DPE-GFP animals treated with HMw TRITC-dextran, we reached the conclusion that STREAMs and GFP<sub>+</sub> perivascular macrophages are mostly different macrophage subsets. In addition, congenic wt BM chimerism into DPE-GFP recipients demonstrated that, conversely to STREAMs, the majority of DPE-GFP macrophages are radio-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p> <italic>2) The authors refer to this macrophage subset as 'radio-resistant' and suggest that these cells are maintained locally. These are two separate properties though perhaps related, and require elucidation. Thus, does 'radio-resistance' refer to the differentiated perivascular cells themselves, or to some progenitor population?</italic> </p><p>We now provide data demonstrating that STREAMs are renewed and maintained locally from a radio-resistant progenitor, using a lineage tracing analysis in adult tissue (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, we have generated chimeric animals using <italic>Bmi1</italic>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26YFP CD45.2 reporter animals as recipients and congenic CD45.1 C57BL/6 wt as donor mice.</p><p>The <italic>Bmi1</italic> gene is involved in the maintenance of adult stemness and is expressed by stem cells and multipotent progenitors, but is barely detectable in differentiated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). After tamoxifen treatment, we have been able to detect YFP<sup>+</sup> dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the skin of these chimeric mice, excluding the contribution of BM-derived HSC to STREAM renewal and demonstrating the existence of a skin radio-resistant pluripotent progenitor Bmi1<sup>+</sup> that gives rise to STREAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>).</p><p><italic>Can comparable numbers of STREAM cells be detected in perivascular locations at very early time points following irradiation?</italic> </p><p>To address this question, we have included new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> showing the presence of comparable numbers of dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages in a mouse ear 7d after lethal γ-irradiation by intravital imaging.</p><p><italic>Since proliferation markers have not been measured, the conclusion that this population is locally self-renewing is not rigorously supported by data.</italic> </p><p>We now provide data showing that STREAMs are unable to proliferate in steady-state using Ki-67 as proliferation marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, STREAMs experience a slow turnover observed in vivowith BrdU labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This turnover cannot be explained by self-renewal based in Ki-67 data but by the existence of a progenitor from which they are renewed (lineage tracing analysis already commented, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–I</xref>).</p><p><italic>A related but broader question is; how long do intravascular dextran-tagged perivascular macrophages persist in that location?</italic></p><p>Using intravital microscopy, we have monitored dextran<sup>+</sup> perivascular STREAMs up to 7d after dextran administration. Interestingly, long-term studies have reported the detection of dextran<sub>+</sub> macrophages in the skin 2 months after intradermal injection of 155 kDa dextran (Intravital Immunofluorescence for Visualizing the Microcirculatory and Immune Microenvironments in the Mouse Ear Dermis. Kilarski W.W., Güc E., Teo J.C., Oliver S.R., Lund A.W., Swartz M.A. PLOS One2013;8(2): e57135).</p><p><italic>3) In light of reports that perivascular macrophages express Tie-2 and are highly pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory (see the work by de Palma et col.), and that Tie-2+ macrophages are known to be related to patrolling Cx3CR1 monocytes, it would be useful to have some further phenotypic characterization of these STREAM cells for such markers.</italic></p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have analysed the expression of Tie-2 in skin BM-derived macrophages and STREAMs not finding differences (data included in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We have also performed intravital experiments using CX3CR1<italic><sup>gpf/+</sup> </italic>mice that show the lack of CX3CR1expression in dextran<sup>+</sup> STREAMs (data included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Isolating macrophages from skin requires harsh digestion. It would be useful to have evidence about how this affects cell surface phenotype, viability and other properties.</italic></p><p>We use a standard cell isolation protocol to homogenize mouse skin based on liberase TM digestion, which preserves all the cell surface markers used in this study (Preparation of Single-cell Suspensions for Cytofluorimetric Analysis from Different Mouse Skin Regions. Broggi A., Cigni C., Zanoni I., Granucci F. J Vis Exp. 2016; 110). As requested, we have included an example of the viability obtained using this protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, DAPI staining – viability ≈ 65%).</p><p><italic>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> should be accompanied by formal demonstration of co-localization, and its insets should be at a higher resolution.</italic></p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we provide a 3D colocalization mask of the green and red channels in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and enlarged insets. The complementary FACs analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref> confirms the existence of dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages containing OVA-FITC Fluospheres.</p><p><italic>6) The authors follow the schema of classically (IFN-γ) or alternatively (IL-4) activated macrophages.

It would also be important to test responses to ex vivo stimulation with IL-4 and look at transcriptional induction to complement the data on responses to LPS. It would be useful if the manuscript could be revised to reflect the complex functional landscape of macrophages.</italic></p><p>We totally agree with this reviewer on the existence of a very complex spectrum of macrophage polarization and functionality than cannot be explained by the simplified M1/M2 dichotomy. As our study has been made with macrophage subsets isolated under steady-state conditions, we have avoided the use of such M1/M2 nomenclature. The distinction of skin-resident macrophage subsets harboring pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory potential in steady-state was attained by combining not only the RNASeq analysis (metabolic programming), but the immune transcriptional profile and the expression of standard phenotypic markers. In addition, the ex vivostimulation with LPS and IL-4 was performed to evaluate the plasticity of STREAMs. In fact, following the interesting comment raised by the reviewer, we now show that STREAMs produce IL-10 after IL-4 stimulation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), demonstrating that they are responsive to an anti-inflammatory stimulus but refractory to a pro- inflammatory challenge (LPS). These results further emphasize the lack of plasticity of STREAMs and their anti-inflammatory commitment already in steady-state.</p><p>Regarding the labeling, we first termed the macrophage subsets as donor/host during the transcriptional profiling analyses and, once found their different profiles, we switched to the more intuitive pro-/anti-inflammatory terminology. Thus, we have found a binary distinction between radio-resistant anti-inflammatory and radio-sensitive pro-inflammatory macrophages, but we cannot rule out the existence of more heterogeneity and complexity within each subset. All these issues have been clarified throughout the text to better reflect the complex functional landscape of macrophages.</p><p><italic>7) The manuscript does not clearly specify the use of DTR-transgenic mice, yet DT beads are used to deplete STREAM cells. The issue should be clarified.</italic></p><p>We have not used CD11b–DTR animals or other available DTR strains to deplete macrophages after DT administration, because this strategy does not allow for a selective depletion of STREAMs (all skin-resident macrophages would be targeted). Alternatively, we have taken advantage of the specific ability of STREAMs to uptake blood-borne OVA nanoparticles. These OVA-NP were co-coated with DT (DT-OVA- NP) and administered i.v. In that manner, STREAMs were the only skin macrophages that could get access and capture circulating DT-OVA-NP, becoming poisoned after ingestion and being selectively depleted (explained in the subsection “Selective depletion of STREAMs impairs skin repair”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) The authors interpret the data as supportive for 'cell-autonomous' programming; how is a lineage-specific cellular autonomy of programming being distinguished from micro-environmental distinctions provided by, say, exposure to intravascular-extravascular versus extravascular-alone microenvironments?</italic> </p><p>The LPS and IL-4 treatments performed ex vivoin sorted macrophage populations could support the existence of a cell-autonomous programming that allows a differential polarization of anti-inflammatory STREAMs vs. pro-inflammatory skin macrophages in the absence of differential environmental cues. However, we agree with the reviewer in pointing out that the access to the intravascular milieu could provide STREAMs with unique signals that could cooperate on their programming. This fact has been now reflected in the text (Introduction, last paragraph and Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p><p><italic>In fact, what is the functional relevance of the microvascular protrusions of the STREAM cells?</italic></p><p>The ability of STREAMs to protrude across endothelial junctions and reach the vascular lumen to scavenge blood-borne fluorescent dextran allowed us to discover and characterize this subset, distinguishing them from other skin-resident macrophages. In our present study, we have focused on the relevant anti- inflammatory properties and functions of STREAMs. The analysis of the function of their intraluminal protrusions is a very interesting question and our preliminary data suggest a role for STREAMs in capturing and processing circulatory antigens to cross-present them to tissue-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, the elucidation of this function deserves much further characterization and should be considered as a complete new piece of work.</p><p><italic>Is the lack of LPS-responsiveness in these 'STREAMs' related to 'training', mediated perhaps by constant exposure to intravascular content?</italic></p><p>The amount of bioactive LPS in the blood of healthy untreated animals should be negligible and insufficient for “training”. Moreover, assuming this argument is right, circulating neutrophils and monocytes should become also “trained” and be refractory to a potent LPS stimulation, but it is well known that these cells are very responsive instead (Lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cell surface receptors and cell activation of neutrophils and monocytes in whole human blood. Gomes N.E., Brunialti M.K., Mendes M.E., Freudenberg M., Galanos C., Salomão R. Braz J Med Biol <italic>Res.</italic> 2010; 43(9):853-8).</p><p><italic>9) New data should not be introduced in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>The unpublished observations commented in the Discussion have been deleted from the text and the data not shown in are now included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.</p><p> <italic>10) Do the authors have any evidence based on staining of human skin samples to show the expression of this subset there as well?</italic></p><p>STREAMs can be distinguished from others skin macrophages due to their radio- resistant nature and their capacity to uptake blood-borne fluorescent macromolecules. Neither of these properties can be directly analyzed in a human model. Moreover, the absence of a subset-defining marker precludes a straightforward FACs analysis. For this reason, we have performed and present for the reviewers an immunofluorescence analysis of human skin sections stained for CD31 (red, vasculature) and CD163 (green, macrophage marker widely used in human samples – CD163: A Specific Marker of Macrophages in Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Samples. Lau S.K., Chu P.G., and Weiss L.M. Am J Clin Pathol2004;122:794-801). The perivascular CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages in close contact to endothelial cells, some of them even protruding with cellular projections into the endothelial layer, have been highlighted in white boxes. This is a correlation with our observations made in the mouse model, but due to the inability to perform further functional analyses in human skin we cannot unequivocally conclude that these cells are the human homologues of STREAMs.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15251.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Skin biopsies were collected, immediately embedded in OCT and frozen.</title><p>Then, the tissue was cut in 30 μm-thick criosections.
