Here, we recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while participants performed a direction discrimination task and rated their confidence on each trial. Using multivariate single-trial discriminant analysis of the EEG, we identified a stimulus-independent component encoding confidence, which appeared prior to subjects’ explicit choice and confidence report, and was consistent with a confidence measure predicted by an accumulation-to-bound model of decision-making. Importantly, trial-to-trial variability in this electrophysiologically-derived confidence signal was uniquely associated with fMRI responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a region not typically associated with confidence for perceptual decisions. Furthermore, activity in the VMPFC was functionally coupled with regions of the frontal cortex linked to perceptual decision-making and metacognition. Our results suggest that the VMPFC holds an early confidence representation arising from decision dynamics, preceding and potentially informing metacognitive evaluation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38293.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>While waiting to cross the road on a foggy morning, you see a shape in the distance that appears to be an approaching car. How do you decide if it is safe to cross? We often have to make important decisions about the world based on imperfect information. What guides our subsequent actions in these situations is a sense of accuracy, or confidence, that we associate with our initial judgments. You would not step off the kerb if you were only 10% confident the car was a safe distance away. But how, when, and where in the brain does such confidence emerge?</p><p>Gherman and Philiastides examined how brain activity relates to confidence during the early stages of decision-making, that is, before people have explicitly committed to a particular choice. Healthy volunteers were asked to judge the direction in which dots were moving across a screen. They then had to rate how confident they were in their decision. Two techniques – EEG and fMRI – tracked their brain activity during the task. EEG uses scalp electrodes to reveal when and how electrical activity is changing inside the brain, while fMRI, a type of brain scan, shows where these changes in brain activity occur. Used together, the two techniques provide a greater understanding of brain activity than either used alone.</p><p>Activity in multiple regions of the brain correlated with confidence at different stages of the task. Certain brain networks showed confidence-related activity while the volunteers tried to judge the direction of movement, and others were engaged when volunteers made their confidence ratings. However, activity in only one area reliably indicated how confident the volunteers felt before they had made their choice. This area, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, also helps process rewards. This suggests that feelings of confidence early in the decision-making process could guide our behaviour by virtue of being rewarding.</p><p>Many brain disorders – including depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease – compromise decision-making. Patients show changes in accuracy, response times, and in their ability to accurately evaluate their decisions. The methods used in the current study could help reveal the neural changes that cause these impairments. This could lead to new methods to diagnose and predict cognitive deficits, and new ways to treat them at an earlier stage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>confidence</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>single-trial</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000269</institution-id><institution>Economic and Social Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES/L012995/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philiastides</surname><given-names>Marios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000286</institution-id><institution>British Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SG121587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philiastides</surname><given-names>Marios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI reveals neural representations of decision confidence unfolding prior to explicit perceptual choices, in a region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex typically linked to reward processing and value-based decisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our everyday lives involve situations where we must make judgments based on noisy or incomplete sensory information – for example deciding whether crossing the street on a foggy morning, in poor visibility, is safe. Being able to rely on an internal estimate of whether our perceptual judgments are accurate is fundamental to adaptive behaviour and accordingly, recent years have seen a growing interest in understanding the neural basis of confidence judgments.</p><p>Within the perceptual decision making field, several studies have sought to characterise the neural correlates of confidence during metacognitive evaluation (i.e., while subjects actively judge their performance following a choice), revealing the functional involvement of frontal networks, in particular the lateral anterior and anterior cingulate prefrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hilgenstock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morales et al., 2018</xref>). Concurrently, psychophysiological work in humans and non-human primates using time-resolved measurements has shown that confidence encoding can also be observed at earlier stages, and as early as the decision process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zizlsperger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gherman and Philiastides, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In line with these latter observations, recent fMRI studies have reported confidence-related signals nearer the time of decision (e.g., during perceptual stimulation) in regions such as the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hebart et al., 2016</xref>), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heereman et al., 2015</xref>), cingulate and insular cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paul et al., 2015</xref>), and other areas of the prefrontal, parietal, and occipital cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heereman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paul et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, confidence-related processing has also been reported in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) during value-based decisions and various ratings tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Martino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>), however the extent to which this region is additionally involved in perceptual judgments relying on temporal integration of sensory evidence remains unclear.</p><p>Importantly, the studies above suggest that confidence is likely to involve a temporal progression of neural events requiring the involvement of multiple networks, as opposed to a single event or quantity. Identifying neural confidence representations that arise early in the decision process (e.g., prior to metacognitive report or as early as the choice itself) is an important prerequisite in understanding the broader confidence-related dynamics, as these signals may provide the basis for higher-order and more deliberate processes such as metacognitive appraisal. Nevertheless, efforts to characterise early confidence representations in the human brain have been limited.</p><p>One potential limitation in previous approaches to studying the neural representations of confidence is the exclusive reliance on correlations with behavioural measures, most commonly in the form of subjective ratings given by participants after the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grimaldi et al., 2015</xref>). However, theoretical and empirical work suggests that post-decisional metacognitive reports may be affected by processes occurring after termination of the initial decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Resulaj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Navajas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleming and Daw, 2017</xref>), such as integration of existing information, processing of novel information arriving post-decisionally, or decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moran et al., 2015</xref>), and may consequently be only partly reflective of early confidence-related states.</p><p>Here we aimed to derive a more faithful representation of these early confidence signals using EEG, and exploit the trial-by-trial variability in these signals to build parametric EEG-informed fMRI predictors, thus providing a starting point to a more comprehensive spatiotemporal account of decision confidence. We hypothesised that using an electrophysiologically-derived (i.e., endogenous) representation of confidence to detect associated fMRI responses would provide not only a more temporally precise, but also a more accurate spatial representation of confidence around the time of decision.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we collected simultaneous EEG-fMRI data while participants performed a random-dot direction discrimination task and rated their confidence in each choice. Using a multivariate single-trial classifier to discriminate between High vs. Low confidence trials in the EEG data, we extracted an early, stimulus-independent discriminant component appearing prior to participants’ behavioural response. These early representations of confidence correlated across subjects with measures of confidence predicted by an accumulation-to-bound model of decision making. We then used the trial-to-trial variability in the resulting confidence signal as a predictor for the fMRI response, revealing a positive correlation within a region of the VMPFC not commonly associated with confidence for perceptual decisions. Crucially, activation of this region was unique to our EEG-informed fMRI predictor (i.e., additional to those detected with a conventional fMRI regressor, which relied solely on participants’ post-decisional confidence reports). Furthermore, a functional connectivity analysis revealed a link between the activation in the VMPFC, and regions of the prefrontal cortex involved in perceptual decision making and metacognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behaviour</title><p>Subjects (N = 24) performed a speeded perceptual discrimination task whereby they were asked to judge the motion direction of random dot kinematograms (left vs. right), and rate their confidence in each choice on a 9-point scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Specifically, confidence is largely known to scale positively with decision accuracy and negatively with response time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vickers and Packer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baranski and Petrusic, 1998</xref>), though this relationship is not perfect, and is subject to individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baranski and Petrusic, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleming et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleming and Dolan, 2012</xref>). As expected, we found a positive correlation with accuracy (subject-averaged R = 0.30; one-sample t-test, t(23) = 13.9, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and a negative correlation with response time (subject-averaged R = −0.27; one-sample t-test, t(23) = −7.8, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, subjects’ confidence ratings were generally reflective of their performance on the perceptual decision task.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the observed variability in subjects’ confidence reports could be explained by sustained fluctuations in attention (i.e., spanning multiple trials). We reasoned that decreases in attention may be reflected as serial correlations in confidence ratings across trials. To test this possibility, we performed a serial autocorrelation regression analysis on a single subject basis, which predicted confidence ratings on the current trial from ratings given on the immediately preceding five trials. On average, this model accounted for only a minimal fraction of the variance in confidence ratings (subject-averaged R<sup>2</sup> = 0.07). Finally, we sought to rule out the possibility that trial-to-trial variability in confidence could be explained by potential subtle differences in low-level physical properties of the stimulus that may go beyond motion coherence (e.g., location and/or timing of individual dots). To this end, we compared subjects’ confidence reports on the two experimental blocks (consisting of identical sequences of random-dot kinematograms), and found no significant correlation between these (subject-averaged R = 0.02, one-sample t-test, p=0.44). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that subjects’ reports reflected internal fluctuations in their sense of confidence, which are largely unaccounted for by external factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EEG-derived measure of confidence</title><p>To identify confidence-related signals in the EEG data, we first separated trials into three confidence groups (Low, Medium, and High) on the basis of subjects’ confidence ratings. We then conducted a single-trial multivariate classifier analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sajda et al., 2009</xref>) on the stimulus-locked EEG data, designed to estimate linear spatial weightings of the EEG sensors (i.e., spatial projections) discriminating between Low- vs. High-confidence trials (see Materials and methods). Applying the estimated electrode weights to single-trial data produced a measurement of the discriminating component amplitudes (henceforth <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub>), which represent the distance of individual trials from the discriminating hyperplane, and which we treat as a surrogate for the neural confidence of the decision.</p><p>Note that even though participants’ post-decision ratings may not form an entirely faithful representation of earlier confidence signals, they can nevertheless be used to separate trials into broad confidence groups for training the classifier and estimating the relevant discrimination weights at the time of decision. Data from individual trials, including those not originally used in the discrimination analysis, were subsequently subjected through these electrode weights to obtain a trial-specific graded measure of internal confidence. In other words, these electrophysiologically-derived confidence measures depart from their behavioural counterparts in that they contain trial-to-trial information from the neural generator giving rise to the relevant discriminating components. As such, these estimates can potentially offer additional insight into the internal processes that underlie confidence at these early stages of the decision.</p><p>To quantify the discriminator's performance over time we used the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (i.e., <italic>Az</italic> value) with a leave-one-out trial cross validation approach to control for overfitting (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We found that discrimination performance (Az) between the two confidence trial groups peaked, on average, 708 ms after stimulus onset (SD = 162 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for Az locked to the time of rating). To visualise the spatial extent of this confidence component, we computed a forward model of the discriminating activity (Materials and methods), which can be represented as a scalp map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, both the temporal profile and electrode distribution of confidence-related discriminating activity were consistent with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gherman and Philiastides, 2015</xref>) where we used stand-alone EEG to identify time-resolved signatures of confidence during a face vs. car visual categorisation task. Together these observations are an indication that the temporal dynamics of decision confidence can be reliably captured using EEG data acquired inside the MR scanner, and that these early confidence-related signals may generalise across tasks.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38293.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neural representation of confidence in the EEG.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Classifier performance (Az) during High- vs. Low-confidence discrimination for stimulus-locked data.

In selecting these, we considered only the discrimination period ending, on average, at least 100 ms (across-subject mean 271 ± 162 ms) prior to subjects’ mean response times, to minimise potential confounds with activity related to motor execution, due to a sudden increase in corticospinal excitability in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>).

Importantly, these trials can be regarded as ‘unseen’ data, as they are independent from those used to train the classifier. We subjected these trials through the same neural generators (i.e., spatial projections) estimated during discrimination of High- vs. Low-confidence trials and, as expected from a graded quantity, found that the mean component amplitudes for Medium-confidence trials were situated between, and significantly different from, those in the High- and Low-confidence trial groups (both p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To ensure these results were not due to overfitting, we also repeated the above comparisons using fully out-of-sample discriminant component amplitudes obtained from our leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (see Materials and methods), and found that differences remained significant (both p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>)</p><p>We next examined the relationship between the confidence-discriminating component and objective performance on the perceptual discrimination task. We found that component amplitudes were positively correlated with decision accuracy (one-sample t-test on logistic regression coefficients, t(23)=8.6, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and were consistently higher for correct vs. incorrect responses across subjects (t(23)=7.58, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in line with the well-established relationship between confidence and accuracy. To rule out the possibility that the modulation of discriminant component amplitude by confidence was purely explained by objective performance, we compared component amplitudes for Medium-confidence against High-/Low-confidence using only trials associated with correct responses, and showed that differences between these trial groups remained significant (both p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The same pattern was found when repeating the analysis separately on error trials (both p&lt;0.001). These results indicate that the confidence-related neural component can be dissociated from objective performance, as might be expected from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lau and Passingham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rounis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Komura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleming and Daw, 2017</xref>).</p><p>As the duration of the visual motion stimulus varied across trials in our task (i.e., remained on until subjects made a motor response on the perceptual task) another potential concern might be that the variability in the EEG-derived confidence signatures we identified here could be explained by these stimulus-related factors. We reasoned that if that were the case, we might expect high correlation between stimulus duration and discriminant component amplitudes. However, we found that this correlation was weak (subject-averaged R = -.15), suggesting that our classification results could not have been solely driven by this factor.</p><p>Finally, we addressed the possibility that the observed variability in the confidence discriminating component could be attributed to sustained fluctuations in attention, by conducting a serial autocorrelation analysis which predicted component amplitudes on a given trial from those on the preceding five trials (separately for each subject). As before, we expected that if attentional fluctuations are driving the variability in our EEG-derived confidence measures, component amplitudes on a given trial would be reliably predicted by those observed in the immediately preceding trials. We found that this model only explained a small fraction of the variance in component amplitudes (subject-averaged R<sup>2</sup> = 0.03).</p><p>We also assessed the influence of a neural signal known to correlate with attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thut et al., 2006</xref>) and predict visual discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>), namely occipitoparietal prestimulus alpha power. To do this, we separated trials into High vs. Low alpha power groups, individually for each subject, and compared the corresponding average discriminant component amplitudes. We found that these did not differ significantly between the two groups (paired t-test, p=0.19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Note that variability in the confidence discriminant component was also independent of stimulus difficulty, as this was held constant across all trials. In line with this, discriminant component amplitudes for the two identical-stimulus experimental blocks were not significantly correlated (subject-averaged R = 0.02; one-sample t-test, p=0.39).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Confidence-dependent influences on behaviour</title><p>We next sought to identify potential influences of neural confidence signals on decision-related behaviour. In particular, there is evidence that confidence, as reflected in behavioural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2018</xref>) and physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urai et al., 2017</xref>) correlates, can play a role in the modulation of history-dependent choice biases. Here, we tested whether the strength of our EEG-derived confidence signals (i.e., confidence discriminant component amplitude <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub>) on a given trial might influence the probability to repeat a choice on the immediately subsequent trial (P<sub>REPEAT</sub>). While we observed no overall significant links between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> and subsequent choice behaviour when considering the entire data set, we found a positive relationship between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> and P<sub>REPEAT</sub> <italic>if</italic> stimulus motion on the immediately subsequent trial was in the same direction as in the current trial (F(2,46)=5.89, p=.005, with post-hoc tests showing a significant difference in P<sub>REPEAT</sub> following Low vs. High <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> trials, p=.015, Bonferroni corrected), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. Thus, stronger confidence signals were associated with an increased tendency to repeat the previous choice.</p><p>In contrast, we did not find any modulatory effect of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> on choice repetition/alternation behaviour when motion on the current trial was in the opposite direction from that of the previous trial. Thus, choices were only affected by previous confidence when no global change in motion direction had occurred from one trial to the next. Interestingly, this dependence of confidence-related repetition bias on stimulus identity points to a mechanism by which the representation of confidence interacts with a putative process of (subliminal) stimulus-consistency detection (distinguishable from the decision process itself) on the subsequent trial, to influence the decision and/or behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dynamic model of decision making</title><p>To seek preliminary insight into how our confidence-related EEG measure relates to the decision formation process, we compared our neural signals with a measure of confidence derived from a dynamic model of decision making.

This class of models describes the decision process as a stochastic accumulation of perceptual evidence over time by independent signals representing the possible choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The decision terminates when one of the accumulators reaches a fixed threshold, with choice being determined by the winning accumulator. Importantly, confidence for binary choices can be estimated in these models as the absolute distance (Δe) between the states of the two accumulators at the time of decision (i.e., ‘balance of evidence’ hypothesis).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38293.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Modelling results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the decision model for one trial.

Our approach therefore allowed us to model the fMRI response using time-resolved neural signatures of confidence, which were specific to each subject. Crucially, as these measures captured the variability in the neural representation of confidence near the time of the perceptual decision itself (i.e., prior to behavioural response), they may be better suited for spatially characterising confidence during this time window compared to the behavioural confidence reports obtained later on in the trial (as the latter may be more reflective of confidence-related information arriving post-decisionally).

More speculatively, confidence representations may be present within motor regions, in line with the idea that decision-related information 'leaks' into the motor systems that support relevant action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Song and Nakayama, 2009</xref>).

To this end, we conducted a whole-brain PPI analysis (see Materials and methods), whereby we searched for areas showing increased correlation of their BOLD response with that of a VMPFC seed, during the perceptual decision phase of the trial (i.e., defined here as the trial-by-trial time window between the onset of the motion stimulus and subject’s explicit commitment to choice).</p><p>Based on existing literature showing negative BOLD correlations with confidence ratings in regions recruited post-decisionally (e.g., during explicit metacognitive report), such as the anterior prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hilgenstock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morales et al., 2018</xref>), we expected that increased functional connectivity of such regions with the VMPFC would be reflected in stronger negative correlation in our PPI. Similarly, we hypothesised that fMRI activity in regions encoding the perceptual decision would also correlate negatively with confidence/VMPFC activation, in line with the idea that easier (and thus more confident) decisions are characterised by faster evidence accumulation to threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>) and weaker fMRI signal in reaction time tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kayser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu and Pleskac, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filimon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pisauro et al., 2017</xref>).

Our method capitalised on the unique explanatory power of time-resolved, internal measures of confidence to identify associated responses in the fMRI, allowing for a more precise spatiotemporal characterisation of confidence than if relying solely on behavioural measures. We found that BOLD response in the VMPFC was uniquely explained by the single-trial variability in an early, EEG-derived neural signature of confidence occurring prior to subjects’ behavioural expression of response. This activity was additional to what could be explained by subjects’ behavioural reports alone. Our results provide empirical support for the involvement of the VMPFC in confidence of perceptual decisions, and suggest that this region may support an early readout of confidence (i.e., at, or near, the time of decision) preceding explicit choice or metacognitive evaluation.</p><p>We first showed that our EEG results - namely the temporal and spatial profile of the confidence-discriminating activity - were consistent with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gherman and Philiastides, 2015</xref>) where we used a different perceptual task involving face vs. car visual categorisations, indicating that these confidence-related signals may generalise across a broader range of tasks. Interestingly, the spatial topography associated with this activity appears consistent with centroparietal scalp projections arising from signals culminating near the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Philiastides et al., 2014</xref>). While the spatial limitation of EEG precludes conclusive interpretations based on this similarity, this pattern could potentially reflect a mixture of decision- and confidence-related signals, in line with the evidence that suggests these quantities may unfold together around the decision process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gherman and Philiastides, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dotan et al., 2018</xref>). Signals such as the centroparietal positivity (CPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>) and/or related P300 may themselves hold information about confidence as suggested by electrophysiological work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldt and Yeung, 2015</xref>) (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urai and Pfeffer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>) for brief discussions).</p><p>Further, our fMRI data revealed activation patterns suggesting that distinct neural networks carry information about confidence during perceptual decision vs. explicit confidence reporting stages of the trial, respectively. Indeed, it seems plausible that qualitatively distinct representations of confidence may be encoded at different times relative to the decision process. In particular, activations during the decision phase of the trial such as the VMPFC or anterior cingulate cortex, are in line with a more automatic encoding of confidence, i.e., in the absence of explicit confidence report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang and Fleming, 2018</xref>). In line with this idea, we also observed activations in regions associated with the human reward/valuation system, such as the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, regions showing correlation with confidence during the confidence rating stage, in particular the anterior prefrontal cortex, have been previously associated with explicit metacognitive judgment/report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morales et al., 2018</xref>), potentially serving a role in higher-order monitoring and confidence communication.</p><p>We presented several findings that sought to further clarify the nature and role of the early confidence signals observed in the EEG data, as well as their relationship with the perceptual decision and metacognition. Our computational modelling approach provided preliminary insight into the potential decision dynamics that might inform early confidence. Namely, we showed that these neural signals were consistent with predictions from a dynamic model of decision that quantifies confidence as the difference in accumulated evidence in favour of the possible choice alternatives, at the termination of the decision process. A possible interpretation is that the early confidence representations reflect a readout of this difference (for instance, by a distinct system than the one supporting the perceptual choice itself). In other words, early confidence representations could be informed by, yet be distinct from, the quantities reflected in the model-derived confidence, in line with a dissociation between the information supporting the decision vs. confidence. Our exploratory mediation analysis is in agreement with this interpretation, suggesting that EEG-derived confidence representations can be thought of as a statistical mediator between model-derived confidence measures (reflecting the balance of accumulated evidence at the time of decision) and confidence ratings.</p><p>In another exploratory analysis that aimed to better understand the potential impact of neural confidence signals on subsequent behaviour, we found that stronger signal amplitude increased the likelihood of repeating a choice on the subsequent trial, when the motion direction of the stimulus was consistent with that of the previous trial. Interestingly however, we did not observe this effect when subsequent motion was in the opposite direction. This dependence of the confidence-related choice repetition bias on stimulus identity is counterintuitive yet intriguing, as it points to a process that detects stimulus consistency (i.e., independently of the decision process itself), which interacts with representations of previous confidence to alter decision/behaviour (e.g., through selective re-weighting of evidence). While our current decision model cannot account for this confidence-driven trial-to-trial dependence, future computational developments may help reconcile these observations with formal models of decision and confidence.</p><p>Our main fMRI finding, linking early confidence representations with VMPFC activity suggests partial independence of these signals from decision centres. Specifically, as the VMPFC is not typically known to support perceptual decision processes, it seems more plausible that the confidence signals we observe here represent a (potentially noisy) readout of confidence-related information. In line with this, computational and neurobiological accounts of confidence processing have proposed architectures by which a first-level form of confidence in a decision emerges as a natural property of the neural processes that support the decision, and in turn is read out (i.e., summarised) by separate higher-order monitoring network(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Insabato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meyniel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pouget et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The timing of our EEG-derived confidence representations arising in close temporal proximity to the decision (but prior to commitment to a motor response) further endorse the hypothesis that the VMPFC may encode an automatic readout of confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>) in decision making, or early (and automatic) ‘feeling of rightness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hebscher and Gilboa, 2016</xref>) in memory judgments. While dedicated research will be necessary to establish the functional role of these early signals, fast pre-response confidence signals could be necessary to regulate the link between decision and impending action, for example with low confidence signalling the need for additional evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desender et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with a role in providing a confidence readout, recent work suggests the VMPFC may encode confidence in a task-independent and possibly domain-general manner. Specifically, several functional neuroimaging studies have shown positive modulation of VMPFC activation by confidence, across a range of decision making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rolls et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Martino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heereman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fleming et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, one study showed that fMRI activation in the VMPFC was modulated by confidence across four different tasks involving both value-based and non-value based rating judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, evidence from memory-related decision making research appears to also implicate the VMPFC in confidence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hebscher and Gilboa, 2016</xref>).</p><p>An outstanding question is whether, and how, the early confidence signals we identified in the VMPFC might further contribute to post-decisional metacognitive signals and eventual confidence reports. It has been long proposed that metacognitive evaluation relies on additional processes taking place post-decisionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, recent evidence suggests that choice itself (and corresponding motor-related activity) affects confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gajdos et al., 2018</xref>) and may help calibrate metacognitive reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Siedlecka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleming and Daw, 2017</xref>). The early confidence signals in the VMPFC could serve as one of multiple inputs to networks supporting retrospective metacognitive processes, e.g., anterior prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, our functional connectivity analysis revealed a strengthening of the link between the VMPFC and frontal areas (notably the aPFC and dlPFC) during the perceptual decision stage of the trial. While the functional significance of these connections remains to be determined, previous involvement of these regions in perceptual decision making and metacognition makes them likely candidates for providing or receiving input to/from the VMPFC within a confidence-related network.</p><p>The observation that the VMPFC, a region known for its involvement in choice-related subjective valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Philiastides et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rangel and Hare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pisauro et al., 2017</xref>) encodes confidence signals during perceptual decisions raises an interesting possibility for interpreting our results. Our behavioural paradigm did not involve any explicit reward/feedback manipulation and accordingly, the observed confidence-related activation cannot be interpreted as an externally driven value signal. Instead, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>), a likely explanation is that as an internal measure of performance accuracy, confidence is inherently valuable. Such a signal may represent <italic>implicit</italic> reward and possibly act as a teaching signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel and Pollmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guggenmos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hebart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lak et al., 2017</xref>) to drive learning.</p><p>In line with this interpretation, recent work suggests that confidence may be used in the computation of prediction errors (i.e., the difference between expected and currently experienced reward) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref>), thus guiding a reinforcement-based learning mechanism. Relatedly, confidence prediction error (the difference between expected and experienced confidence) has been hypothesised to act as a teaching signal and guide learning in the absence of feedback. In particular, regions in the human mesolimbic dopamine system, namely the striatum and ventral tegmental area, have been shown to encode both anticipation and prediction error related to decision confidence, in the absence of feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guggenmos et al., 2016</xref>), similarly to what is typically observed during reinforcement learning tasks where feedback is explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Preuschoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fouragnan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fouragnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fouragnan et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, these effects were predictive of subjects’ perceptual learning efficiency. Thus, confidence in valuation/reward networks could be propagated back to the decision systems to optimize the dynamics of the decision process, possibly by means of a reinforcement-learning mechanism. At the neural level, this could be implemented through a mechanism of strengthening or weakening information processing pathways that result in high and low confidence, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guggenmos and Sterzer, 2017</xref>). Though testing this hypothesis extends beyond the scope of the current study, we might expect that fluctuations in expected vs. actual confidence signals observed in our data have a similar influence on learning (e.g., perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Law and Gold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that by employing a simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach, we were able to localise an early representation of confidence in the brain with higher spatiotemporal precision than allowed by fMRI alone. In doing so, we provided novel empirical evidence for the encoding of a generalised confidence readout signal in the VMPFC preceding explicit metacognitive report. Our findings provide a starting point for further investigations into the neural dynamics of confidence formation in the human brain and its interaction with other cognitive processes such as learning, and the decision itself.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty subjects participated in the simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment. Four were subsequently removed from the analysis due to near chance (n = 3) and near ceiling (n = 1) performance, respectively, on the perceptual discrimination task. Additionally, one subject was excluded whose confidence reports covered only a limited fraction of the provided rating scale, thus yielding an insufficient number of trials to be used in the EEG discrimination analysis (see below). Finally, one subject had to be removed due to poor (chance) performance of the EEG decoder. All results presented here are based on the remaining 24 subjects (age range 20 – 32 years). All were right-handed, had normal or corrected to normal vision, and reported no history of neurological problems. The study was approved by the College of Science and Engineering Ethics Committee at the University of Glasgow (CSE01355) and informed consent was obtained from all participants. While we conducted no explicit power analysis for determining sample size, note that our EEG analysis was performed on individual subjects using cross validation, such that in estimating our electrophysiologically-derived measure of confidence, each subject became their own replication unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith and Little, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimuli and task</title><p>All stimuli were created and presented using the PsychoPy software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peirce, 2007</xref>). They were displayed via an LCD projector (frame rate = 60 Hz) on a screen placed at the rear opening of the bore of the MRI scanner, and viewed through a mirror mounted on the head coil (distance to screen = 95 cm). Stimuli consisted of random dot kinematograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newsome and Pare, 1988</xref>), whereby a proportion of the dots moved coherently to one direction (left vs. right), while the remainder of the dots moved at random. Specifically, each stimulus consisted of a dynamic field of white dots (number of dots = 150; dot diameter = 0.1 degrees of visual angle, dva; dot life time = 4 frames; dot speed = 6 dva/s), displayed centrally on a grey background through a circular aperture (diameter = 6 dva). Task difficulty was controlled by manipulating the proportion of dots moving coherently in the same direction (i.e., motion coherence).</p><p>We aimed to maintain overall performance on the main perceptual decision task consistent across subjects (i.e., near perceptual threshold, at approximately 75% correct). For this reason, task difficulty was calibrated individually for each subject on the basis of a separate training session, prior to the day of the main experiment.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Training</title><p>To first familiarise subjects with the random dot stimuli and facilitate learning on the motion discrimination task, subjects first performed a short simplified version of the main task (lasting approx. 10 min), where feedback was provided on each trial. The task, which required making speeded direction discriminations of random dot stimuli (see below), began at a low-difficulty level (motion coherence = 40%) and gradually increased in difficulty in accordance with subjects’ online behavioural performance (a 3-down-1-up staircase procedure, where three consecutive correct responses resulted in a 5% decrease in motion coherence, whereas one incorrect response yielded a 5% increase). This was followed by a second, similar task, which served to determine subject-specific psychophysical thresholds. Seven motion coherence levels (5%, 8%, 12%, 18%, 28%, 44%, 70%) were equally and randomly distributed across 350 trials. The proportion of correct responses was separately computed for each motion coherence level, and a logarithmic function was fitted through the resulting values in order to estimate an optimal motion coherence yielding a mean performance of approximately 75% correct. Subjects who showed near-chance performance across all coherence levels or showed no improvement in performance with increasing motion coherence were not tested further and did not participate in the main experiment. No feedback was given for this or any of the subsequent tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Main task</title><p>On the day of the main experiment, subjects practised the main task once outside the scanner, and again inside the scanner prior to the start of the scan (a short 80 trial block each time). Subjects made left vs. right direction discriminations of random dot kinematograms and rated how confident they were in their choices, on a trial-by-trial basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each trial began with a random dot stimulus lasting for a maximum of 1.2 s, or until the subject made a behavioural response. Subjects were instructed to respond as quickly as possible, and had a time limit of 1.5 s to do so. The message ‘Oops! Too slow’ was displayed if this time limit was exceeded or no direction response was made. Once the dot stimulus disappeared, the screen remained blank until the 1.2 s stimulation period elapsed and through an additional random delay (1.5 – 4 s).</p><p>Next, subjects were presented with a rating scale for 3 s, during which they reported their confidence in the previous direction decision. The confidence scale was represented intuitively by means of a white horizontal bar of linearly varying thickness, with the thick end representing high confidence. Its orientation on the horizontal axis (thin-to-thick vs. thick-to-thin) informed subjects of the response mapping, and this was equally and randomly distributed across trials to control for motor preparation effects. To make a confidence response, subjects moved an indicator (a small white triangle) along a 9-point marked line. The indicator changed colour from white to yellow when a confidence response was selected and this remained on the screen until the 3 s elapsed). A final delay (blank screen, jittered between 1.5 – 4 s) ended the trial. The timing of the inter-stimulus jitters was optimised using a genetic algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wager and Nichols, 2003</xref>) in order to increase estimation efficiency in the fMRI analysis. Failing to provide either a direction or a confidence response within the respective allocated time limits on a given trial rendered it invalid, and this was subsequently removed from further analyses. This resulted in a total fraction of .04 (.02 and. 02, respectively) of trials being discarded.</p><p>Subjects performed two experimental blocks of 160 trials each, corresponding to two separate fMRI runs. Each block contained two short (30 s) rest breaks, during which the MR scanner continued to run. Subjects were instructed to remain still throughout the entire duration of the experiment, including during rest breaks and in between scans. Motion coherence was held constant across trials, at the subject-specific level estimated during training. The direction of the dots was equally and randomly distributed across trials. To control for confounding effects of low-level trial-to-trial variability in stimulus properties on decision confidence, an identical set of stimuli was used in the two experimental blocks. Specifically, for each subject, the random seed, which controlled dot stimulus motion parameters in the stimulus presentation software was set to a fixed value. This manipulation allowed for subsequent control comparisons between pairs of identical stimuli.</p><p>Subjects were encouraged to explore the entire scale when making their responses and to abstain from making a confidence response on a given trial if a motor mapping error had been made (for instance, a premature or accidental button press that was inconsistent with the perceptual representation). They were instructed to make their responses as quickly and accurately as possible, and provide a response on every trial. All behavioural responses were executed using the right hand, on an MR-compatible button box.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EEG data acquisition</title><p>EEG data was collected using an MR-compatible EEG amplifier system (Brain Products, Germany). Continuous EEG data was recorded using the Brain Vision Recorder software (Brain Products, Germany) at a sampling rate of 5000 Hz. We used 64 Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes positioned according to the 10 – 20 system, and one nasion electrode. Reference and ground electrodes were embedded in the EEG cap and were located along the midline, between electrodes Fpz and Fz, and between electrodes Pz and Oz, respectively. Each electrode had in-line 10 kOhm surface-mount resistors to ensure subject safety. Input impedance was adjusted to &lt; 25 kOhm for all electrodes. Acquisition of the EEG data was synchronized with the MR data acquisition (Syncbox, Brain Products, Germany), and MR-scanner triggers were collected separately to enable offline removal of MR gradient artifacts from the EEG signal. Scanner trigger pulses were lengthened to 50μs using a built-in pulse stretcher, to facilitate accurate capture by the recording software. Experimental event markers (including participants’ responses) were synchronized, and recorded simultaneously, with the EEG data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EEG data processing</title><p>Preprocessing of the EEG signals was performed using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). EEG signals recorded inside an MR scanner are contaminated with gradient artifacts and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts due to magnetic induction on the EEG leads. To correct for gradient-related artifacts, we constructed average artifact templates from sets of 80 consecutive functional volumes centred on each volume of interest, and subtracted these from the EEG signal. This process was repeated for each functional volume in our dataset. Additionally, a 12 ms median filter was applied in order to remove any residual spike artifacts. Further, we corrected for standard EEG artifacts and applied a 0.5 – 40 Hz band-pass filter in order to remove slow DC drifts and high frequency noise. All data were downsampled to 1000 Hz.</p><p>To remove eye movement artifacts, subjects performed an eye movement calibration task prior to the main experiment (with the MRI scanner turned off, to avoid gradient artifacts), during which they were instructed to blink repeatedly several times while a central fixation cross was displayed in the centre of the computer screen, and to make lateral and vertical saccades according to the position of the fixation cross. We recorded the timing of these visual cues and used principal component analysis to identify linear components associated with blinks and saccades, which were subsequently removed from the EEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parra et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Next, we corrected for cardiac-related (i.e., ballistocardiogram, BCG) artifacts. As these share frequency content with the EEG, they are more challenging to remove. To minimise loss of signal power in the underlying EEG signal, we adopted a conservative approach by only removing a small number of subject-specific BCG components, using principal component analysis. We relied on the single-trial classifiers to identify discriminating components that are likely to be orthogonal to the BCG. BCG principal components were extracted from the data after the data were first low-pass filtered at 4 Hz to extract the signal within the frequency range where BCG artifacts are observed. Subject-specific principal components were then determined (average number of components across subjects: 1.8). The sensor weightings corresponding to those components were projected onto the broadband data and subtracted out. Finally, data were baseline corrected by removing the average signal during the 100 ms prestimulus interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-trial EEG analysis</title><p>To increase statistical power of the EEG data analysis, trials were separated into three confidence groups (Low, Medium, High), on the basis of the original 9-point confidence rating scale. Specifically, we isolated High- and Low-confidence trials by pooling across each subject’s three highest and three lowest ratings, respectively. To ensure robustness of our single trial EEG analysis, we imposed a minimum limit of 50 trials per confidence trial group. For those data sets where subjects had an insufficient number of trials in the extreme ends of the confidence scale, neighbouring confidence bins were included to meet this limit.</p><p>We used a single-trial multivariate discriminant analysis, combined with a sliding window approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sajda et al., 2009</xref>) to discriminate between High- and Low-confidence trials in the stimulus-locked EEG data. This method aims to estimate, for predefined time windows of interest, an optimal combination of EEG sensor linear weights (i.e., a spatial filter) which, applied to the multichannel EEG data, yields a one-dimensional projection (i.e., a 'discriminant component') that maximally discriminates between the two conditions of interest. Importantly, unlike univariate trial-average approaches for event-related potential analysis, this method spatially integrates information across the multidimensional sensor space, thus increasing signal-to-noise ratio whilst simultaneously preserving the trial-by-trial variability in the signal, which may contain task-relevant information. In our data, we identified confidence-related discriminating components, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>(t), by applying a spatial weighting vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">w</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> to our multidimensional EEG data <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>(t), as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">x</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the number of channels, indexed by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> indicates the transpose of the matrix.

This procedure was repeated for each subject and time window. Applied to an individual trial, spatial filters (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">w</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) obtained this way produce a measurement of the discriminant component amplitude for that trial. In separating the High and Low trial groups, the discriminator was designed to map the component amplitudes for one condition to positive values and those of the other condition to negative values. Here, we mapped the High confidence trials to positive values and the Low confidence trials to negative values, however note that this mapping is arbitrary.</p><p>To quantify the performance of the discriminator for each time window, we computed the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., the Az value), using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duda et al., 2001</xref>).

In particular, we looked for brain regions where BOLD responses correlated with the confidence-discriminating component derived from the EEG analysis. Our primary motivation behind this approach was the hypothesis that endogenous trial-by-trial variability in the confidence discriminating EEG component (near the time of perceptual decision, and prior to behavioural response) would be more reflective of early internal representations of confidence at the single-trial level, compared to the metacognitive reports which are provided post-decisionally and therefore likely to be subjected to additional processes. We predicted that the simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach would enable identification of latent brain states that might remain unobserved with a conventional analysis approach. To this end, we extracted trial-by-trial amplitudes of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf67"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> (resulting from Eq. 1) at the time window of maximum confidence discrimination, and used these to build a BOLD predictor (i.e., the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf68"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> regressor). Importantly, to avoid possible confounding effects of motor preparation/response, the time of this component was determined on a subject-specific basis, by only considering the period prior to the behavioural choice (mean peak discrimination time = 708 ms from stimulus onset, SD=162 ms). Thus, on average this was selected 287ms (SD=171 ms) prior to each subject’s mean response time.

Nonetheless, an advantage of our EEG-informed fMRI predictors is that they can also reveal relevant fMRI activations within deeper structures, provided that their BOLD activity covaries with that of the cortical sources of our EEG signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>GLM analysis</title><p>We designed our GLM model to account for variance in the BOLD signal at two key stages of the trial, namely the perceptual decision period (beginning at the onset of the random dot visual stimulus) and the metacognitive evaluation/rating (beginning at the onset of the rating scale display), respectively. A total of 10 regressors were included in the model. Our primary predictor of interest was the EEG-derived endogenous measure of confidence (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf72"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> regressor). We modelled this as a stick function (duration = 0.1 s) locked to the stimulus onset, with event amplitudes parametrically modulated by the trial-to-trial variability in the confidence discriminating component<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf73"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula>. To ensure variance explained by this regressor was unique (i.e., not explained by subjects’ behavioural reports), we included a second regressor whose event amplitudes were parametrically modulated by confidence ratings, and which was otherwise identical to the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf74"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> regressor (i.e., Ratings<sub>DEC</sub> regressor, duration = 0.1 s, locked to stimulus onset). Importantly, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf75"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> amplitudes were only moderately correlated with behavioural confidence ratings, thus allowing us to exploit additional explanatory power inherent to this regressor. Other regressors of no interest for the perceptual decision stage included: one regressor parametrically modulated by prestimulus alpha power in the EEG signal (to control for potential attentional baseline effects), one categorical regressor (1/0) accounting for variability in response accuracy, and one unmodulated regressor (all event amplitudes set to (1) modelling stimulus-related visual responses of no interest across both valid and non-valid (missed) trials (all event durations = 0.1 s, locked to stimulus onset). To control for motor preparation/response, we also included a parametric regressor modulated by subjects’ reaction time on the direction discrimination task (duration = 0.1 s, locked to the time of behavioural response). Note that including an additional unmodulated regressor locked to the time of the behavioural response did not alter our results.</p><p>Additionally, locked to the onset of the metacognitive rating period, we included one parametric regressor (duration = 0.1 s) with event amplitudes modulated by subjects’ confidence ratings, one boxcar regressor with duration equivalent to subjects’ active behavioural engagement in confidence rating (to minimise effects relating to motor processes), and one unmodulated regressor (duration = 0.1 s). Lastly, we included one categorical boxcar regressor (1/0) to model non-task activation (i.e., rest breaks within each run). Motion correction parameters obtained from fMRI preprocessing were entered as additional covariates of no interest.</p><p>As we included two rating-modulated regressors in our model, which were identical except for their onset times (i.e., decision and rating phases, respectively), we sought to ensure that these were not highly correlated. We computed the correlation between the convolved regressors, separately for each subject and experimental run (mean R = -.13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, we conducted two separate control GLM analyses whereby only the regressors pertaining to one trial phase (i.e., decision or rating, respectively) were included at a time. This allowed us to further validate our results, to ensure they remained unaffected by potential correlations between regressors at the two stages of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, we also assessed the correlations between all regressors by computing the variance inflation factors (VIF) for the regressors in our model. We found that mean VIF = 3.57 (±1.83), with multicollinearity typically being considered high if VIF &gt; 5 – 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Resampling procedure for fMRI thresholding</title><p>To estimate a significance threshold for our fMRI statistical maps whilst correcting for multiple comparisons, we performed a nonparametric permutation analysis that took into account the a priori statistics of the trial-to-trial variability in our primary regressor of interest (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub>), in a way that trades off cluster size and maximum voxel Z-score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Debettencourt et al., 2011</xref>). For each resampled iteration, we maintained the onset and duration of the regressor identical, whilst shuffling amplitude values across trials, runs and subjects. Thus, the resulting regressors for each subject were different as they were constructed from a random sequence of regressor amplitude events. This procedure was repeated 200 times. For each of the 200 resampled iterations, we performed a full 3-level analysis (run, subject, and group). Our design matrix included the same regressors of non-interest used in all our GLM analysis. This allowed us to construct the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>, and establish a threshold on cluster size and Z-score based on the cluster outputs from the permuted parametric regressors. Specifically, we extracted cluster sizes from all activations exceeding a minimal cluster size (5 voxels) and Z-score (2.57 per voxel) for positive correlations with the permuted parametric regressors. Finally, we examined the distribution of cluster sizes (number of voxels) for the permuted data and found that the largest 5% of cluster sizes exceeded 162 voxels. We therefore used these results to derive a corrected threshold for our statistical maps, which we then applied to the clusters observed in the original data (that is, Z=2.57, minimum cluster size of 162 voxels, corrected at p=0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Psychophysiological interaction analysis</title><p>We conducted a psychophysiological (PPI) analysis to explore potential functional connectivity between the region of the VMPFC found to uniquely explain trial-to-trial variability in our electrophysiologically-derived measures of confidence, and the rest of the brain, during the perceptual decision phase of the trial. To carry out the PPI analysis, we first extracted the time-series data from the seed region. Specifically, we identified the cluster of interest at the group level (i.e., in standard space) by applying the cluster correction procedure described in the previous section. Using this as a template, we constructed subject-specific masks of the voxels exhibiting the strongest correlation with the VMPFC region of interest, and back-projected these into the functional space of each individual. Resulting masks were used to compute average time-series data, separately for each subject and functional run, which subsequently served as the physiological regressor(s) in the PPI model. To carry out the PPI analysis, we performed a new GLM analysis. This included the following regressors, locked to the time of stimulus onset: (1) an unmodulated regressor (all event amplitudes set to 1), (2) the physiological regressor (time course of the VMPFC seed), (3) the psychological regressor (a boxcar function with event amplitudes set to one and duration parametrically modulated by trial-specific decision times (i.e., interval between stimulus presentation and behavioural response on the perceptual task), and (4) the interaction regressor. Additionally, motion parameters estimated during registration (see preprocessing step) were included as regressors of no interest. The statistical output from the interaction regressor thus reveals regions of the brain where correlation with the BOLD signal in the VMPFC is stronger during the perceptual decision than the rest of the trial. Importantly, this represents variance additional to that explained by the psychological and physiological regressors alone. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed on the whole brain using the outcome of the resampling procedure as described earlier.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Extracting BOLD response time course</title><p>To illustrate the activation time course within the VMPFC cluster identified with our EEG-informed fMRI analysis, we first extracted the average BOLD response time-series from this region, separately for each subject and functional run (as detailed in the previous section). We aligned our data to the onset of the random-dot stimulus, by approximating to the time of the nearest fMRI volume, and defined the temporal window of interest as the -4 s to 10 s interval relative to stimulus onset. We proceeded to separate trials into three bins according to the magnitude of the confidence discriminating component <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub> (i.e., Low, Medium, and High <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf78"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>CONF</sub>), and computed the respective percent signal change as follows:<disp-formula id="equ7"><label>(6)</label><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf79"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the trial index, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf80"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the stimulus-locked data at time point <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf81"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean baseline data, with the baseline window defined as the 4 s interval prior to stimulus onset.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Human VMPFC encodes early signatures of confidence in perceptual decisions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that your study addresses an important topic, and that the simultaneous fMRI-EEG approach has high potential for doing so. However, all reviewers also raised a number of substantive concerns about the specifics of the approach, and neither of the reviewers was sufficiently convinced by the conceptual advance afforded by this study.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers identified one central issue as limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the results – the functional meaning of the discriminating component amplitude Y remains unclear. This is for a number of reasons: (i) there is no model that explains how Y is computed and links it to the elements of the decision process, which are better understood (sensory input, decision variable, internal noise); (ii) Y is only partially correlated with confidence ratings; (iii) the behaviour of Y is at odds with most current models of confidence (e.g. Y does not predict choice accuracy); (iv) no predictive effect of Y on future behaviour is established; and (v) by design, reaction times (and with it stimulus duration and time of response preparation) vary from trial to trial, raising concerns about trivial explanations for Y. In addition the reviewers were not convinced that the functional connectivity analysis adds anything of substance to the paper.</p><p>That said, most reviewers felt that an improved version of this paper which convincingly addresses the above concerns and the ones of the individual reviewers copied below might warrant another round of formal review. An essential prerequisite for this would be the presentation of a clear generative model for Y and a new version of the analysis and/or an improved experimental design that eliminates the reaction time confound from the decoding analysis. In such a case, we would need to evaluate the changes first to decide if further review is justified and therefore we would treat the paper as a new submission (but considering its full history).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and timely study into the neural basis of perceptual decision confidence behavior. The overall approach is original and state-of-the-art. The early confidence signal uncovered in VMPFC is novel and potentially important. That said, I am troubled by a number conceptual and methodological issues.</p><p>1) One conceptual limitation is that the paper does not provide any insight into how the early confidence signal is constructed in the brain – specifically, how the confidence signal relates to sensory evidence, and the internal decision variable that the brain derives from that evidence. This issue is central to current theoretical work on perceptual decision confidence. Addressing this issue would substantially raise the significance of the paper. The functional connectivity analysis might shed some light onto this issue, but the authors should take VMPFC (rather than RLPFC, as they do now) as a seed. Then, the analysis should reveal two sets of regions: those that drive the VMPC signal (regions encoding the decision variable?) and those are driven by the VMPC signal (RLPFC, as the authors speculate?).</p><p>2) A second limitation is that the functional role of the neural confidence signals is not assessed. Many influential papers (theoretical and experimental) in this field have begun to uncover the roles of confidence in controlling behaviour and learning. While the task design is not tailored to addressing this issue, the authors could test for confidence-dependent, short-term changes in choice behavior or longer-term learning effects. Again, this would raise the significance of the findings reported.</p><p>3) The logic behind the PPI analysis needs to be unpacked – it is not clear if the result provides any conceptual insight. First, the authors seem to suggest that the VMPFC confidence signal drives RLPFC – then, why should the strength of this correlation scale with confidence? Should the correlation not be the same, regardless of whether confidence is high or low? Second, the functional consequences of this coupling result are unclear. This part of the authors' conclusions is purely speculative (&quot;informing metacognitive evaluation and learning&quot;) – a meaningful link to behavior would help.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors describe a combined EEG-MRI study that links early predictors of confidence in a perceptual discrimination task to stimulus-locked activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Globally the paper is well written, with many aspects to praise in the design (notably controls for difficulty and motor confounds) and very sophisticated analyses.</p><p>To me it is not uncommon to see vmPFC activity associated with confidence in perceptual decision tasks, even if this is generally not the main message. So I think this claim is not particularly novel. However, the dataset reported here is rather unique because it allows using EEG measurements to track the neural noise that is added to perceptual evidence in the generation of confidence. This construct (called Y by the authors) can then be used as a regressor in the analysis of fMRI data.</p><p>The main issue is the circularity in the approach: the multivariate EEG decoder is trained to predict confidence ratings, and then the output of this decoder (i.e., Y) is said to represent an early predictor of confidence that is different from the rating. I am convinced that vmPFC activity indeed correlates with Y and not rating, but what is Y? That is the question. Without a precise specification of this construct, I do not think there is much information to get from the result. It remains open to uninteresting interpretations: for instance Y could represent the fact that at this time point the decision has been made or not, or the proximity of the motor response, since confidence correlates with response time.</p><p>My suggestion is to build a generative model of confidence rating, in which Y would be a factor among others. What needs to be explained is how Y is generated (possibly something like evidence plus neural noise) and then how it is transformed into choice, response time and confidence rating. If Y could be estimated independently of rating, then the circularity would be broken and the dissociation between neural representations of Y and rating would be meaningful. Computational modeling may be helpful here, perhaps a race model as that used in De Martino et al., 2013.</p><p>Another concern relates to the PPI analysis. I cannot make sense of the result that vmPFC activity reflects the interaction between confidence rating and time series in the rostrolateral PFC. If this region already signals confidence level, then the interaction regressor is something like confidence squared. Does this really tell us anything about the passage of information from vmPFC to rlPFC?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study investigates the neural mechanisms of perceptual decision confidence using a combination of EEG, fMRI and machine learning. Participants discriminate the drift direction of moving dot kinematograms. Motion coherence was varied on a per-subject basis to achieve around 75% performance in each participant. The perceptual task is speeded, meaning that the response is given as soon as the participant feels ready and then the stimulus presentation is terminated. There are three key analyses: The first links trials-wise reported confidence during the decision making stage directly to BOLD signals and finds the striatum, lateral OFC, ACC and other regions to be positively related to confidence, consistent with previous work. The second analysis links reported confidence during the rating stage to BOLD signals and finds striatum, medial temporal regions and motor cortex to be positively related to confidence. The third main analysis is based on a trial-wise EEG-classifier that classifies the confidence on each trial. This third component was related to BOLD signlas in ventromedial PFC.</p><p>The findings here are interesting and add to and extend the literature on confidence signals in the brain. However, I have a number of points that still need to be clarified.</p><p>1) The use of a speeded perceptual task means that the stimulus presentation duration is shorter for high confidence than for low confidence trials. I was wondering which effect this contamination effect has on the EEG classifier, and thus also in turn on the BOLD signals observed in the third main (i.e. EEG-based) analysis. Could it be that the classifier is partly picking up the effect of the longer stimulus duration?</p><p>2) I would be more upfront with approach used for defining and dissociating the different temporal stages (decision making, rating). I couldn't work this out until I reached the Materials and methods section, but it is vital to understanding the design.</p><p>3) I didn't understand the logic of the autocorrelation analysis that was used to control for attention. Please explain.</p><p>4) The summary of time series as &quot;delay&quot; and &quot;peak&quot; is too dense (Figure 2A). It would be better to show individual time courses to confirm that the data can be appropriately summarized by a delay and peak.</p><p>5) How can it be ensured that the EEG-derived measures are independent of difficulty, accuracy and attention? For this it would be necessary to assess the relationship between the EEG-measure and these behavioral properties explicitly (ideally to plot them as well).</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>In order to accord with requirements for reporting statistics the paper here should add a statement that &quot;No explicit power analysis was conducted for determining sample size&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors investigate the correlates of confidence using single trial multivariate analyses based on EEG signals that were concurrently recorded during fMRI. Crucially, the authors derive interesting relations between BOLD-fMRI and EEG decoded signals during the decision stage (before an actual motor action is executed), thus allowing them to elegantly show in humans with high spatial and temporal specificity the neural correlates of confidence in perceptual decisions before a motor action is observed.</p><p>Overall this study offers new insights on the origins of confidence during perceptual decisions, by showing that the vmPFC also encodes an early confidence readout for this type of choices. I am a fan of the authors' methodological strategy to study human decision-making. However, for this study, my points of criticism are mainly related to the set of statistical analyses that the authors stand on to make their conclusions, which I consider should be revised. I provide some suggestions that may help to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>1) An important concern is the statistical fMRI modelling approach. The delay between stimulus response and confidence rating is extremely short if one wants to incorporate the same parametric regressors at both the decision and confidence rating stage. I appreciate that there is a jitter of 1.5-4 s, however, given this short average duration (~2.6 s, roughly corresponding to a bit more than 1 TR), I suspect that adding the confidence rating as parametric modulator at both the rating and decision stage will be highly correlated. Even if FSL allows to run such model, highly correlated regressors (after convolution with the HRF) can have dramatic effects on the beta weights due to variance inflation (see for instance, Mumford et al., 2015).</p><p>On a related issue, the authors write: &quot;we also included a parametric regressor modulated by subjects' reaction time on the direction discrimination task (duration = 0.1 s, locked to the time of behavioural response)&quot;. First, did the authors also include the main effect regressor? This is not reported. If it wasn't included, then the model is wrongly specified. You cannot include a parametric regressor without including the main effect regressor. In any case, if this main effect regressor is indeed included, then once more, I suspect that this main effect regressor will be highly correlated with the main effect regressor that is included on trial onset. The mean response times are less than 1 s. If you convolve two stick functions that are less than 1 s apart, the resulting convolved regressors will be highly correlated.</p><p>I would like to see (and I think this should be formally included as supplementary information in the manuscript) for the current design, an example of the design and design_cov figures produced by FLS for two or three subjects (or in general that the authors report the correlation not only between original the parametric regressors, but also the correlations between all the regressors including both main effects and parametric regressors after convolution with the HRF).</p><p>Regarding the first point, I understand that the authors wanted to split explanatory variance between the decision and rating stages, but what I recommend and find more appropriate given my above-mentioned concern (if the authors insist in investigating the separation of confidence between the decision and the rating stages) is to run to separate GLMs, one with the parametric regressor on the decision stage, and one with the parametric regressor on the confidence rating stage and investigate whether the main conclusions of the authors still hold. Then, in a second level analysis the authors could investigate at which time point (decision or rating) there is a stronger relationship between the confidence ratings and BOLD responses.</p><p>2) In the results presented in Figure 2B, if I understood correctly, the authors report the y(t) out-of-sample values of the &quot;unseen&quot; data for the middle confidence level. I am not convinced that the results reported by the authors are strong evidence for their decoder's ability to generate sensible out-of-sample y(t) values as this could simply reflect regression to the mean (if the authors use the middle confidence level for reading out y(t) by using a dichotomous decoder). I do not think that this result is especially revealing nor necessary to conduct the subsequent fMRI analysis (see my next point).</p><p>3) Regarding the use of the decoded value y(t) as parametric regressor for the fMRI analysis, if I understood correctly, the authors use out of sample values of y(t) only for the middle confidence level (see my concern in the point above), whereas for the low and high confidence levels this was not the case. I think that a more appropriate analysis would be to obtain values y(t) fully out of sample. The authors can split the data in n-folds (for instance 10) and use n-1 folds to train the data and obtain the y<sub>CONF</sub> regressor using the remaining fold for decoding, and then use these y<sub>CONF</sub> values as regressors of the fMRI data (see for instance for a similar n-fold cross-validation approach: van Bergen et al., 2015 Nature Neuroscience). Given the nature of the decoder used by the authors (dichotomous predictions), it should be enough that the authors split the data in high and low confidence levels to train the decoder (and therefore it is not necessary to use three levels or more).</p><p>4) Subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, last paragraph: Maybe I missed the point, but for me it is not entirely clear why it is expected that the discriminant component amplitudes are not different for correct and incorrect answers. One of the well established statistical signatures of confidence is that confidence is markedly different for correct and incorrect responses (e.g. see Sanders, Hangya and Kepecet al., 2016; Urai, Braun and Donner, et al.2017). Why didn't the authors expect a separation (see my next point for a related concern), and if not, what the discriminant component amplitude really reflects? More discussion on this point in general would be great.</p><p>5) Subsection “Stimuli and task”, last paragraph: On a related point (and perhaps an important caveat of this study), I do not understand why the authors excluded or explicitly asked the participants to &quot;abstain from making a confidence response on a given trial if they became aware of having made an incorrect response&quot;. Again, one of the well established signatures of confidence is that confidence is markedly different for correct and incorrect responses. How the results would have been affected without such explicit instruction to the participants? In my opinion, this confidence information should not be excluded or spuriously biased via instructions to the participants. Therefore, I am afraid that what the authors are capturing with their actual confidence ratings (and therefore the decoded values y(t)) is a biased response that is not formally confidence per se. I urge the authors to report this potential caveat and make a clear case (from the beginning) of why this strategy was adopted in the first place.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Human VMPFC encodes early signatures of confidence in perceptual decisions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Tobias H Donner as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have made substantial new analyses in their revision, and I acknowledge the paper has improved on the methodological level. Again we are impressed by the technical achievement that clearly establishes a link between the EEG-derived construct and fMRI activity. However, reviewers are still concerned with the interpretation of this construct at a functional/cognitive level. The authors fitted response time distributions for correct and error trials with a race model. The reviewers appreciate the effort made to address these concerns, but are not sufficiently convinced by the insight this provides into the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) One issue is that the model makes the same predictions for every trial, as task difficulty (motion coherence) is held constant. So the authors are bound to between-subject correlations, which they found indeed between modeled sensory evidence at the bound (Δe) and EEG-derived predictor of confidence rating (Y). My understanding of the current interpretation is that Y represents evidence plus some neural noise, and then that confidence rating (R) is Y plus something else (perhaps noise again) which could be loosely defined as 'meta-cognitive reappraisal'. This is not very informative, and not even directly tested.</p><p>A more straightforward test would be a mediation analysis, assessing whether Y could indeed mediate the link from Δe to R. The alternative hypothesis to be discarded is that Δe is actually closer to R, which would take us back to the fundamental question of how Y can be specified in cognitive terms.</p><p>Yet a more informative use of the race model would be to fit trial-by-trial variations in R. This means allowing free parameters to vary across trials, and to test their potential relationship with Y. It could be for instance that Y fluctuations arise from variations in the starting point, or, within a Bayesian framework, in the prior on motion direction. Having said this, my agenda is not to bury the paper under requests for additional work. A clarified relationship between Δe, Y and R may be a reasonable limit to what can be inferred from the dataset.</p><p>2) A related issue comes with the new analysis provided to substantiate a role for confidence in behavioral control. The authors found that higher confidence predicts repetition of the same choice in the next trial, if motion direction is the same as in the current trial. This is not in line with the computational model in its present form. It could mean that confidence influences the prior on motion direction, but this would obviously not be adaptive. There is therefore a need to reconcile this finding with the generative model of choice and confidence.</p><p>3) Y is not different for correct/incorrect responses: The authors should add a figure plotting Y split for correct and incorrect responses (perhaps next to the new panel 2C) indicating the quantitative difference. Also, please add an explicit explanation (in the Results/Discussion section) about this result. This is essential, as I believe it reveals quite a lot about what type of information Y carries, namely, it is not the classical statistical signature of confidence (see Sanders and Urai work) but something different in line to the arguments that the authors give at the end of the response to this point, i.e. not the probability that the choice is correct, but something else. The authors try to describe this &quot;dissociation&quot; to some extent in other parts of the text, but should be more explicit about this point.</p><p>4) Please add the results of the neural correlates of Y at the rating stage (can be in the supplement), and briefly comment about this in the Results section. Reviewers understood that the authors did not want that to focus on this stage, but it is quite a nice result that information about Y transitions from vmPFC at the decision stage to motor related areas at the confidence rating stage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38293.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an interesting and timely study into the neural basis of perceptual decision confidence behavior. The overall approach is original and state-of-the-art. The early confidence signal uncovered in VMPFC is novel and potentially important. That said, I am troubled by a number conceptual and methodological issues.</p><p>1) One conceptual limitation is that the paper does not provide any insight into how the early confidence signal is constructed in the brain – specifically, how the confidence signal relates to sensory evidence, and the internal decision variable that the brain derives from that evidence. This issue is central to current theoretical work on perceptual decision confidence. Addressing this issue would substantially raise the significance of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these early confidence signals is essential for linking theoretical and empirical work on decision confidence. In the revised manuscript, we have employed a computational modelling approach to address this question, and provide a prospective link between observed neural confidence signals and the perceptual decision process.</p><p>Specifically, we fitted our behavioural data with a variant of the race model of decision making (Vickers, 1979; Vickers and Packer, 1982; De Martino et al., 2013) (Materials and methods, subsection “Modelling decision confidence”, first paragraph), which describes the decision process as a stochastic accumulation of perceptual evidence over time by two independent signals representing the possible choices (with confidence represented as the difference in the evidence accumulated towards the two choices at the termination of the decision process – Δe). Overall the model fitted our behavioural data well, and importantly, we found that our neural measures of confidence (EEG-derived discriminant component – Y) were able to capture patterns in the model estimates of confidence (Δe) across participants (Results, subsection “Dynamic model of decision making”, last paragraph). In particular, for each subject, we computed the mean confidence difference between correct and error trials, as reflected by the neural signals (Y) and the model estimates (Δe) and tested the extent to which these quantities were correlated across subjects. This relative measure, which captured the relationship between confidence and choice accuracy, also ensured that any potential between-subject differences in the overall magnitude of the discriminant component (e.g., due to across-subject variability in overall EEG power) were subtracted out. Indeed, we found a significant positive correlation, such that subjects who showed stronger Y difference between correct and error trials also showed higher correct vs. error difference in Δe (R=.48, p=.019, robust correlation coefficient obtained using the percentage bend correlation analysis (Wilcox, 1994); see Figure 3D), suggesting that neural confidence could arise from a race-like process similar to that implemented by the current model. In other words, it is possible that, in line with the “balance of evidence hypothesis” (Vickers et al., 1979) and the idea that confidence emerges from the process of decision formation itself (Kiani and Shadlen, 2009; Gherman and Philiastides, 2015), the observed early EEG-derived measures of confidence (Y) may reflect the difference in the evidence accumulated towards the two choices at the time of decision. Alternatively, Y could also represent a (potentially noisy) readout of this difference (e.g., by a distinct system than the one supporting the perceptual choice itself).</p><p>How these early signatures of confidence contribute to post-decisional metacognitive signals and eventual confidence reports remains an open question that might be more adequately addressed with specifically tailored experimental designs (for example, by explicitly interrogating the transfer of information between networks associated with decisional and post-decisional confidence; e.g., (Fleming et al., 2018). We now discuss this issue in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The functional connectivity analysis might shed some light onto this issue, but the authors should take VMPFC (rather than RLPFC, as they do now) as a seed. Then, the analysis should reveal two sets of regions: those that drive the VMPC signal (regions encoding the decision variable?) and those are driven by the VMPC signal (RLPFC, as the authors speculate?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We now report results from a separate PPI analysis where we examined whole-brain functional connectivity using the VMPFC as seed (Materials and methods, subsection “Psychophysiological interaction analysis”). In particular, we sought to identify regions that might increase their connectivity (i.e., show stronger signal correlation) with the VMPFC seed during the decision phase of the trial (defined as the time interval between stimulus presentation and subjects’ behavioural expression of choice), relative to baseline. Based on existing literature showing negative BOLD correlations with confidence ratings in regions recruited post-decisionally (e.g., during explicit metacognitive report), such as the anterior prefrontal cortex (Fleming et al., 2012; Hilgenstock et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2018), we expected that increased functional connectivity of such regions with the VMPFC would be reflected in stronger negative correlation in our PPI.</p><p>With respect to potential functional connectivity with regions involved in perceptual decision making, we hypothesised that fMRI activity in regions encoding the decision variable would correlate negatively with confidence, in line with the idea that easier (and thus more confident) decisions are characterised by faster evidence accumulation to threshold (Shadlen and Newsome, 2001) and weaker fMRI signal in reaction time tasks (Ho et al., 2009; Kayser et al., 2010; Liu and Pleskac, 2011; Filimon et al., 2013; Pisauro et al., 2017). Accordingly, we expected that if such regions increased their functional connectivity with the VMPFC during the decision, this would also manifest as stronger negative correlation in the PPI analysis.</p><p>We found increased negative correlations with the VMPFC signal in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left anterior PFC (aPFC), and right dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), shown in updated Figure 6. Regions of the aPFC and dlPFC, in particular, have been previously been linked to perceptual decision making (Noppeney et al., 2010; Liu and Pleskac, 2011; Filimon et al., 2013), as well as post-decisional confidence-related processes (Fleming et al., 2012; Hilgenstock et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2018) and metacognition (Fleming et al., 2010; Rounis et al., 2010; McCurdy et al., 2013). We now report these results in the subsection “Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis”, and discuss their potential involvement with decisional confidence in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second limitation is that the functional role of the neural confidence signals is not assessed. Many influential papers (theoretical and experimental) in this field have begun to uncover the roles of confidence in controlling behaviour and learning. While the task design is not tailored to addressing this issue, the authors could test for confidence-dependent, short-term changes in choice behavior or longer-term learning effects. Again, this would raise the significance of the findings reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and as suggested, we have conducted a series of additional analyses to address this matter. We discuss these below.</p><p>We first tested for potential influences of confidence signals on short-term decision-related behaviour. Two recent studies have shown that confidence, as captured by behavioural (Braun et al., 2018) or physiological (Urai et al., 2017) correlates, can play a role in modulating history-dependent choice biases. We thus asked whether the neural confidence signals derived from our EEG discrimination analysis might show a similar influence on subjects’ choices.</p><p>Specifically, we tested whether trial-to-trial fluctuations in the confidence discriminant component amplitudes (Y<sub>CONF</sub>) were predictive of the probability to repeat a choice on the immediately subsequent trial (P<sub>REPEAT</sub>). To this end, we divided Y<sub>CONF</sub> into 3 equal bins (Low, Medium, and High) and compared the associated P<sub>REPEAT</sub> across subjects. While we found no overall significant links between Y<sub>CONF</sub> and subsequent choice behaviour when considering the entire data set, we did observe a positive relationship between Y<sub>CONF</sub> and P<sub>REPEAT</sub><italic>if</italic> stimulus motion on the immediately subsequent trial was in the same direction as in the current trial (one-way repeated measures ANOVA, F(2,46)=5.89, p=.005, with post-hoc tests showing a significant difference in the probability to repeat a choice after Low vs. High Y<sub>CONF</sub> trials, p=.015, Bonferroni corrected; Figure 2F). Note that for this analysis, we first equalised the number of correct and error trials within each Y<sub>CONF</sub> bin. This ensured that any observed modulation of P<sub>REPEAT</sub> by Y<sub>CONF</sub> was independent of the correlation of Y with accuracy on the current trial(s). Specifically, for each subject, we removed either exclusively correct or error trials (depending on which of the two was in excess) via random selection from 500 permutations of the trial set. Results reported here are based on the average Y values obtained with this procedure.</p><p>We found that stronger confidence signals were associated with an increased tendency to repeat the previous choice. However, there was no modulatory effect of Y<sub>CONF</sub> on choice repetition/alternation behaviour when the direction of motion on the current trial differed from that of the previous trial.</p><p>Thus, choices were only affected by previous confidence when no change in motion direction had occurred from one trial to the next. Interestingly, this suggests that subjects might be able to detect consistency with the previous stimulus without necessarily having full conscious access to the motion direction of the current stimulus, which in turn impacts the modulatory effect of previous choice confidence on subjects’ tendency to repeat their choice. We now report this analysis in the subsection “Confidence-dependent influences on behaviour”.</p><p>In a separate set of analyses, we asked whether confidence in a choice might influence subjects’ decision times on subsequent trials. Error monitoring research indicates that individuals tend to respond more slowly after having committed an error (Dutilh et al., 2012), an effect known as “post-error slowing” and thought to indicate an increase in caution. We tested whether low confidence (as captured by both subjective ratings and EEG-derived neural signatures of confidence) might have a similar impact on response time slowing, however we found no evidence for such an effect. One reason could be that response time slowing occurs when one is more confident about having made an error than a correct response (i.e., when estimated probability of being correct is below chance), whereas our behavioural results suggest this was likely a rare occurrence (the lowest confidence ratings were on average associated with chance or above-chance performance on the perceptual choice). We note that these results may differ under stronger speed emphasis (the time response limit in current paradigm was 1.35 s, with the mean response time across subjects being 994 ± 35 ms). Should the reviewer deem it necessary, we would be happy to report these analyses in the revised manuscript.</p><p>With respect to the potential role of confidence on learning, we wish to emphasise that (as the reviewer has also pointed out) the design of our behavioural paradigm was not optimised for addressing this question. In fact, we designed our experiment to specifically minimise perceptual learning effects, to avoid potential confounds with confidence (e.g., lower confidence and higher confidence trials clustering towards the beginning and towards the end of the experiment respectively, which in turn could have resulted in trivial EEG discrimination performance of low-vs.-high confidence trials due to overall signal changes in the course of the experiment – e.g., impedance changes, signal adaptation, etc.). In particular, subjects underwent task training prior to participating in the simultaneous EEG/fMRI experiment, which partly served to allow subjects’ performance to reach a plateau. Though perceptual learning can also be assessed using paradigms that maintain performance constant through online adjustments of the stimulus difficulty, we opted against such an approach to avoid potential confounding effects of stimulus difficulty on confidence.</p><p>Thus, as expected, only small to no improvements can be observed in subjects’ behavioural performance over the course of the task (e.g., mean difference in the proportion of correct responses between the first and second halves of the task =.03). Similarly, we found no significant increase in confidence ratings or neural confidence signals (Y<sub>CONF</sub>) across trials.</p><p>Recent work suggests that confidence may act as an implicit (expected) reward signal and be used in the computation of prediction errors (i.e., the difference between expected and currently experienced reward) (Lak et al., 2017; Colizoli et al., 2018), thus guiding a reinforcement-based learning mechanism. Relatedly, confidence prediction error (the difference between expected and experienced confidence) has been hypothesised to act as a teaching signal and guide learning in the absence of feedback (Guggenmos et al., 2016). In the brain, this could potentially be implemented through a mechanism of strengthening or weakening information processing pathways that result in high and low confidence, respectively (Guggenmos and Sterzer, 2017). Though testing this hypothesis extends beyond the scope of the current study (see previous paragraph on purposely “clumping” learning effects), we might expect that fluctuations in expected vs. actual confidence signals as derived from the EEG data have a similar influence on perceptual learning. We now discuss this point in the Discussion (eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The logic behind the PPI analysis needs to be unpacked – it is not clear if the result provides any conceptual insight. First, the authors seem to suggest that the VMPFC confidence signal drives RLPFC – then, why should the strength of this correlation scale with confidence? Should the correlation not be the same, regardless of whether confidence is high or low? Second, the functional consequences of this coupling result are unclear. This part of the authors' conclusions is purely speculative (&quot;informing metacognitive evaluation and learning&quot;) – a meaningful link to behavior would help.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point and we have aimed to rectify this issue in the revised manuscript by conducting a separate PPI analysis (see Materials and methods subsection “Psychophysiological interaction analysis”, and our earlier response) where we removed the parametric modulation by confidence when searching for functional connectivity with our seed region. Specifically, we now use the VMPFC region (which showed modulation by neural confidence in our original GLM analysis) as a PPI seed, and searched instead for regions across the brain where connectivity (i.e., BOLD signal correlation) increased during the decision phase of the trial, which we defined as the interval between stimulus presentation and behavioural choice.</p><p>As we note above, we found increased negative correlations with the VMPFC signal in the OFC, left aPFC, and right dlPFC. Regions of the aPFC and dlPFC have been linked to perceptual decision making (Ho et al., 2009; Noppeney et al., 2010; Liu and Pleskac, 2011; Filimon et al., 2013; Pisauro et al., 2017), as well as post-decisional confidence-related processes (Fleming et al., 2012; Hilgenstock et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2018) and metacognition (Fleming et al., 2010; Rounis et al., 2010; McCurdy et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The main issue is the circularity in the approach: the multivariate EEG decoder is trained to predict confidence ratings, and then the output of this decoder (i.e., Y) is said to represent an early predictor of confidence that is different from the rating.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that the EEG-derived measures of confidence rely on a classification analysis between Low- and High-confidence trials as defined by subjects’ behavioural ratings. However, we wish to clarify that the EEG classifier is not trained to predict confidence ratings per se. Rather, we make use of subjects’ ratings only for the purpose of extracting the Low- and High-confidence trial groups and training the classifier, but subsequently rely only on the single-trial graded measures of “neural” confidence (Y) to make any subsequent inferences.</p><p>The underlying assumption is that, while ratings per se may not be entirely faithful representations of early confidence signals, they may carry sufficient explanatory power to reliably estimate a set of spatial weights representing the topographical contributions to confidence signals <italic>at the time of decision.</italic> Importantly, the classification output Y, obtained by subjecting the original multichannel through these neural generators, will depart from the behavioural measures of confidence in that it will contain trial-to-trial information about neural signals generated by these sources, thus potentially offering additional insight into the internal processes that underlie confidence at these early stages of the decision. We now clarify these points in the Results section (subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am convinced that vmPFC activity indeed correlates with Y and not rating, but what is Y? That is the question. Without a precise specification of this construct, I do not think there is much information to get from the result. It remains open to uninteresting interpretations: for instance Y could represent the fact that at this time point the decision has been made or not, or the proximity of the motor response, since confidence correlates with response time.</p><p>My suggestion is to build a generative model of confidence rating, in which Y would be a factor among others. What needs to be explained is how Y is generated (possibly something like evidence plus neural noise) and then how it is transformed into choice, response time and confidence rating. If Y could be estimated independently of rating, then the circularity would be broken and the dissociation between neural representations of Y and rating would be meaningful. Computational modeling may be helpful here, perhaps a race model as that used in De Martino et al., 2013.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment, which led us to the addition of a computational modelling component and inclusion of additional control analyses. We recognise the importance of providing a more concrete interpretation of the neural mechanisms that generate the observed confidence signals and have addressed this question more thoroughly as detailed below.</p><p>Firstly, with regards to the possibility that our EEG-derived measures of confidence (Y) might merely represent the termination of a decision or proximity of the motor response, we note that Y was only weakly correlated with subject’s response times (subject-averaged R=-.15; we now report this in Results, p. 11). In addition, Ys were extracted on average at least 100ms (mean 271 ± 162 ms) prior to subjects’ mean response times to minimise potential confounds with activity related to motor execution (due to increase in corticospinal excitability during this period (Chen et al., 1998)).</p><p>To control for potentially confounding effects of motor response in our fMRI analysis, we included a regressor which is parametrically modulated by subjects’ response times on the perceptual task. We reasoned that this regressor would absorb any variance related to motor planning and execution processes.</p><p>Finally, in our previous EEG work on decision confidence (Gherman and Philiastides, 2015) we used a delayed-response behavioural paradigm in which subjects were unaware of the mapping between choice and response effector whilst they made their perceptual decision. In that study we could still observe the same neural signature of confidence (i.e., consistent in terms of both timing and scalp topography). On the basis of the points above, we argue that neural measures Y are unlikely to be merely explained by motor-related processes.</p><p>Most importantly, in order to tackle the question of how confidence signals might emerge, we have used a computational modelling approach, as the reviewer suggested above. Specifically, we fitted our behavioural data with a variant of the race model of decision making (Vickers, 1979; Vickers and Packer, 1982; De Martino et al., 2013) (Materials and methods, subsection “Modelling decision confidence”, first paragraph).</p><p>This class of models describes the decision process as a stochastic accumulation of perceptual evidence over time by independent signals representing the possible choices. The decision terminates when one of the accumulators reaches a fixed threshold, with choice being determined by the winning accumulator. Importantly, confidence for binary choices can be estimated in these models as the absolute distance (Δe) between the states of the two accumulators at the time of decision (i.e., “balance of evidence” hypothesis).</p><p>In our model, the state of the accumulator is represented by two variables, L and R, which collect evidence in favour of the left and right choices, respectively (Figure 3A). At each time step of the accumulation, the two variables are updated separately with an evidence sample s(t) extracted randomly from a normal distributions with mean μ and standard deviation σ, s(t)=N(μ,σ), such that:</p><p>L(t+1) = L(t) + s<sub>L</sub>(t)</p><p>R(t+1) = R(t) + s<sub>R</sub>(t)</p><p>Here, we assumed that evidence samples for the two possible choices are drawn from distributions with identical variances but distinct means, whereby the mean of the distribution is dependent on the identity of the presented stimulus. For instance, a leftward motion stimulus will be associated with a larger distribution mean (and thus on average faster rate of evidence accumulation) in the left (stimulus-congruent) than right (stimulus-incongruent) accumulator. We defined the mean of the distribution associated with the stimulus-congruent accumulator as μ<sub>congr</sub>=0.1 (arbitrary units), and that of the stimulus-incongruent accumulator as μ<sub>incongr</sub>=μ<sub>congr</sub>/r, where r is a free parameter in the model. For each trial, evidence accumulation for the two accumulator variables begins at 0 and progresses towards a fixed decision threshold θ. Finally, response time is defined as the time taken to reach the decision threshold plus a non-decision time (nDT) which accounts for early visual encoding and motor preparation processes.</p><p>We illustrate model fits in Figure 3C (with individual subject fits shown in Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2). Response time distributions for correct and error trials are summarised separately using 5 quantile estimates of the associated cumulative distribution functions (Forstmann et al., 2008). Overall, we found that this model provided a good fit to the behavioural data (Accuracy: R=.76, p&lt;.001, Figure 3B; RT: subject-averaged R=.965, all p&lt;=.0016)</p><p>Crucially, we proceeded to inspect the relationship between our neural measures of confidence (EEG-derived discriminant component Y) and the confidence estimates predicted by the decision model (Δe) at the subject group level. Specifically, for each subject, we extracted the mean difference in confidence (as reflected by Y and Δe, respectively) between correct and error trials. We then tested the extent to which these quantities correlated across subjects. This relative measure, which captured the relationship between confidence and choice accuracy, also ensured that any potential between-subject differences in the overall magnitude of the discriminant component Y (e.g., due to across-subject variability in overall EEG power) were subtracted out. We found a significant positive correlation (i.e., subjects who showed stronger difference in Y between correct and error trials also showed a higher difference in Δe, R=.48, p=.019, see Figure 3D), opening the possibility that neural confidence signals might arise directly from a process similar to the race-like dynamic implemented by the current model.</p><p>Two possible interpretations of Y may be proposed based on our modelling results. Namely, in following the “balance of evidence hypothesis” (Vickers et al., 1979), the observed early EEG-derived measures of confidence may reflect the difference in the evidence accumulated towards the two choices at the time of decision, consistent with the idea that confidence emerges from the process of decision formation itself (Kiani and Shadlen, 2009; Gherman and Philiastides, 2015). An alternative interpretation is that Y represents a (potentially noisy) readout of this difference (i.e., by a distinct system than the one supporting the perceptual choice itself).</p><p>How these early signatures of confidence contribute to post-decisional metacognitive signals and eventual confidence reports remains an open question that might be more adequately addressed with specifically tailored experimental designs (for example, by explicitly interrogating the transfer of information between networks associated with decisional and post-decisional confidence). We discuss these interpretations in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern relates to the PPI analysis. I cannot make sense of the result that vmPFC activity reflects the interaction between confidence rating and time series in the rostrolateral PFC. If this region already signals confidence level, then the interaction regressor is something like confidence squared. Does this really tell us anything about the passage of information from vmPFC to rlPFC?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. To address this point, we have conducted a new PPI analysis (see Materials and methods subsection “Psychophysiological interaction analysis”) where we use the VMPFC region as a seed (as kindly suggested by two of the reviewers), and have removed the parametric modulation by confidence from the psychological regressor. Specifically, we searched for potential regions across the brain which may increase their connectivity with confidence-encoding VMPFC during the decision phase of the trial (defined as the interval between stimulus presentation and behavioural choice) relative to baseline, such as those involved in the formation of the decision and/or metacognition.</p><p>Based on existing literature showing negative BOLD correlations with confidence ratings in regions recruited post-decisionally (e.g., during explicit metacognitive report), such as the anterior prefrontal cortex (Fleming et al., 2012; Hilgenstock et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2018), we expected that increased functional connectivity of such regions with the VMPFC would be reflected in stronger negative correlation in our PPI.</p><p>Similarly, we hypothesised that fMRI activity in regions encoding the perceptual decision would also correlate negatively with confidence / VMPFC activation, in line with the idea that easier (and thus more confident) decisions are characterised by faster evidence accumulation to threshold (Shadlen and Newsome, 2001) and weaker fMRI signal in reaction time tasks (Ho et al., 2009; Kayser et al., 2010; Liu and Pleskac, 2011; Filimon et al., 2013; Pisauro et al., 2017). Accordingly, we expected that if such regions increased their functional connectivity with the VMPFC during the decision, this would manifest as stronger negative correlation in the PPI analysis.</p><p>We found increased negative correlations with the VMPFC signal in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left anterior PFC (aPFC), and right dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), shown in updated Figure 6. Regions in the aPFC and dlPFC have been linked to perceptual decision making (Noppeney et al., 2010; Liu and Pleskac, 2011; Filimon et al., 2013), as well as post-decisional confidence-related processes (Fleming et al., 2012; Hilgenstock et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2018) and metacognition (Fleming et al., 2010; Rounis et al., 2010; McCurdy et al., 2013)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The findings here are interesting and add to and extend the literature on confidence signals in the brain. However, I have a number of points that still need to be clarified.</p><p>1) The use of a speeded perceptual task means that the stimulus presentation duration is shorter for high confidence than for low confidence trials. I was wondering which effect this contamination effect has on the EEG classifier, and thus also in turn on the BOLD signals observed in the third main (i.e. EEG-based) analysis. Could it be that the classifier is partly picking up the effect of the longer stimulus duration?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this potential confound. We now performed additional analyses to address it more directly.</p><p>We first investigated the correlation between our EEG-derived measures of confidence (Y) and the duration of the visual stimulus (which, as the reviewer points out, is equal to subjects’ response time). We reasoned that if stimulus presentation time had an influence on the classification analysis and consequently on the estimation of Y, we might expect these two measures to be highly correlated. However, we found only a weak correlation between Y and stimulus duration (subject-averaged R=-.15), suggesting that classification results could not have been solely driven by this factor. We report this additional analysis in the revised manuscript (Results, subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, seventh paragraph). Please also note that in a previous study from our lab (Gherman and Philiastides, 2015) in which we used EEG alone to temporally characterise decision confidence, the duration of stimulus presentation was fixed at.1 s (this was followed by a forced delay of 2-2.5s prior to response, during which subjects were not aware of the mapping between stimulus and motor response). Importantly, we observed a similar temporal profile and scalp topography in a Low-vs.-High confidence discrimination.</p><p>With regards to the impact on the fMRI data, we first wish to clarify that the three sets of fMRI results we report in relation to the neural correlates of confidence were obtained using a single GLM model, which included regressors for each of our variables of interest (namely, confidence reports at the time of decision and rating, respectively, and EEG-derived confidence measures), as well as additional nuisance regressors. Crucially, we included a regressor parametrically modulated by stimulus duration (i.e., response time) which served to regress out potential variance shared with the EEG-derived regressor (note that parameter estimates obtained with standard GLM analysis in FSL reflect variability that is unique to each regressor, thus ignoring common variability, Mumford et al., 2015). We have amended the text to make the above points explicit (Results subsection “fMRI correlates of confidence”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I would be more upfront with approach used for defining and dissociating the different temporal stages (decision making, rating). I couldn't work this out until I reached the Materials and methods section, but it is vital to understanding the design.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added explicit definitions of the “decision” and “rating” phases of the trial in the Results (subsection “fMRI correlates of behavioural confidence reports”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I didn't understand the logic of the autocorrelation analysis that was used to control for attention. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of the autocorrelation analysis was to test for potential sustained fluctuations of attention that span multiple trials and might therefore be reflected in serial dependencies of either behaviour (e.g., choice) (De Martino et al., 2013) or neural signals. In particular, we were interested in ruling out the possibility that such attentional fluctuations might be the driving factor behind the variability in our EEG-derived confidence measures (Y). We expected that if that were the case, Y values on a given trial would be reliably predicted by those observed in the immediately preceding trials. However the regression model we used to test for this possibility explained only a small fraction of the variance in our Ys (subject-averaged R<sup>2</sup> =.03; Results subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, eighth paragraph). We have amended the text to clarify the autocorrelation analyses (Results, subsection “Behaviour”, last paragraph and subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The summary of time series as &quot;delay&quot; and &quot;peak&quot; is too dense (Figure 2A). It would be better to show individual time courses to confirm that the data can be appropriately summarized by a delay and peak.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our figure to contain the time course of the confidence discrimination performance (Az) for individual subjects (Figure 2A). Note that on average we only considered peaks occurring at least 250ms after stimulus onset (to avoid early visual processes) and 100ms (mean 271 ± 162 ms) prior to subjects’ average response times to minimise potential confounds with activity related to motor execution (due to a sudden increase in corticospinal excitability in this period (Chen et al., 1998)) (Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How can it be ensured that the EEG-derived measures are independent of difficulty, accuracy and attention? For this it would be necessary to assess the relationship between the EEG-measure and these behavioral properties explicitly (ideally to plot them as well).</p></disp-quote><p>To control for confounding effects of difficulty on the neural measures of confidence, we maintained the motion coherence (i.e., difficulty) of the visual stimuli constant across the entire experiment, and for each subject. In addition, each stimulus in the first half of the experiment was presented again (in an identical form) in the second half of the experiment. This enabled us to compare both behavioural and neural responses to identical stimuli and further assess whether subjects might have been sensitive to subtle differences in low-level physical properties of the stimulus that go beyond motion coherence (e.g., the motion dynamics of individual dots). Importantly, we found no correlation between the EEG-derived confidence measures (i.e., confidence-discriminating component amplitudes, Y) associated with the two sets of identical stimuli (subject-averaged R=.02) (Results subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, last paragraph). We believe these observations represent strong evidence that the EEG-derived measures of confidence are independent of objective difficulty.</p><p>We have also performed a control analysis to verify whether our EEG-derived confidence measures are independent of accuracy. Namely, Figure 2D illustrates that these neural signatures continue to show significant modulation by (reported) confidence when accuracy is constant (i.e., when only correct trials are considered).</p><p>Finally, we tested for potential attentional effects on EEG-derived confidence measures as follows. Firstly, we investigated the influence of occipitoparietal prestimulus α, a neural signal thought to correlate with attention and predict visual discrimination (Thut et al., 2006; van Dijk et al., 2008), on the EEG-derived confidence measures. We found that Y measures associated with High vs. Low prestimulus alpha power did not differ significantly (Results subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, last paragraph; Figure 2E). Nevertheless, we also included a parametric regressor modulated by prestimulus alpha power in our fMRI GLM model in order to absorb potential variability associated with this signal.</p><p>Secondly, we focused on potential effects of sustained fluctuations in subjects’ attention (i.e., across trials). Specifically, we looked for correlations in the EEG-derived measures between neighbouring trials. We found that a serial autocorrelation analysis predicting component amplitudes Y based on the immediately preceding 5 trials provided limited explanatory power (subject-averaged R<sup>2</sup> =.03) (Results, see the aforementioned paragraph). Overall, these observations suggest that our results are unlikely to be purely explained by attentional factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>In order to accord with requirements for reporting statistics the paper here should add a statement that &quot;No explicit power analysis was conducted for determining sample size&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text of the manuscript accordingly (subsection “Participants”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] Overall this study offers new insights on the origins of confidence during perceptual decisions, by showing that the vmPFC also encodes an early confidence readout for this type of choices. I am a fan of the authors' methodological strategy to study human decision-making. However, for this study, my points of criticism are mainly related to the set of statistical analyses that the authors stand on to make their conclusions, which I consider should be revised. I provide some suggestions that may help to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>1) An important concern is the statistical fMRI modelling approach. The delay between stimulus response and confidence rating is extremely short if one wants to incorporate the same parametric regressors at both the decision and confidence rating stage. I appreciate that there is a jitter of 1.5-4 s, however, given this short average duration (~2.6 s, roughly corresponding to a bit more than 1 TR), I suspect that adding the confidence rating as parametric modulator at both the rating and decision stage will be highly correlated. Even if FSL allows to run such model, highly correlated regressors (after convolution with the HRF) can have dramatic effects on the beta weights due to variance inflation (see for instance, Mumford et al., 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to clarify that the rating regressor at the time of decision (Ratings<sub>DEC</sub>) is locked to the onset of the random dot stimulus (i.e., rather than the behavioural response to the stimulus). Thus, the actual delay between the onsets of the decision-locked (Ratings<sub>DEC</sub>) and rating-locked (Ratings<sub>RAT</sub>) regressors is on average 3.84 (SD=.02) seconds. The jitter of 1.5-4 s that the reviewer is referring to spans only the time interval between the <italic>end</italic> of the response time window and onset of the rating prompt.</p><p>Relatedly, we note that in our experimental design, the timing of the inter-stimulus jitters was optimised using a genetic algorithm (Wager and Nichols, 2003) which served to increase estimation efficiency (we now report this in Materials and methods subsection “Main task”, second paragraph).</p><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now calculated the correlation between these two confidence rating regressors and show that they are only weakly correlated (mean R=-.13) (see Figure 5—figure supplement 3, top panel). To be fully transparent, we show the correlations for individual subjects and runs separately (Figure 5—figure supplement 3).</p><p>To more directly address this concern, we conducted two additional GLM analyses whereby only the regressors pertaining to one phase of the trial were included at a time (i.e. either the decision, or the rating, respectively). We found that activations for Ratings<sub>DEC</sub>, Ratings<sub>RAT</sub>, as well as Y<sub>CONF</sub> remained qualitatively and quantitatively virtually identical to the original design that including both regressors (see Figure 5—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related issue, the authors write: &quot;we also included a parametric regressor modulated by subjects' reaction time on the direction discrimination task (duration = 0.1 s, locked to the time of behavioural response)&quot;. First, did the authors also include the main effect regressor? This is not reported. If it wasn't included, then the model is wrongly specified. You cannot include a parametric regressor without including the main effect regressor. In any case, if this main effect regressor is indeed included, then once more, I suspect that this main effect regressor will be highly correlated with the main effect regressor that is included on trial onset. The mean response times are less than 1 s. If you convolve two stick functions that are less than 1 s apart, the resulting convolved regressors will be highly correlated.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model included a main effect regressor locked to the onset of the stimulus, which served to account for all parametric regressors in the decision phase of the trial, including the RT-modulated regressor (considering the short time span between RT and stimulus onset and the slow nature of the HRF).</p><p>We aimed to address the reviewer’s concern by running a separate GLM analysis which formally assessed whether including an unmodulated regressor at the time of RT would alter our results. We found that while this new regressor was indeed correlated with the unmodulated regressor at the time of stimulus onset (VSTIM<sub>DEC</sub>)(R=.73) as the reviewer speculates, activations for the Y<sub>CONF</sub> regressor remained unchanged (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38293.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38293-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>Positive parametric modulation of the BOLD signal by EEG-derived measures of confidence (during the decision phase of the trial), resulting from a GLM analysis whereby we included an additional unmodulated regressor locked to the time of response on the perceptual decision.

Results are reported at |Z|≥2.57, and cluster-corrected using a resampling procedure (minimum cluster size 162 voxels).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to see (and I think this should be formally included as supplementary information in the manuscript) for the current design, an example of the design and design_cov figures produced by FLS for two or three subjects (or in general that the authors report the correlation not only between original the parametric regressors, but also the correlations between all the regressors including both main effects and parametric regressors after convolution with the HRF).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now computed variance inflation factors for all regressors in our model and found that mean VIF = 3.57 ( ± 1.83), with multicollinearity typically being considered high if VIF &gt; 5-10. We included these results in the manuscript (Materials and methods subsection “GLM analysis.”, last paragraph). We also illustrate the correlations between the identical confidence-related parametric regressors locked to the decision vs. rating stages of the trial (please see Figure 5—figure supplement 3), separately for each subject and experimental run (see response to earlier comment above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the first point, I understand that the authors wanted to split explanatory variance between the decision and rating stages, but what I recommend and find more appropriate given my above-mentioned concern (if the authors insist in investigating the separation of confidence between the decision and the rating stages) is to run to separate GLMs, one with the parametric regressor on the decision stage, and one with the parametric regressor on the confidence rating stage and investigate whether the main conclusions of the authors still hold.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted the two suggested analyses using separate GLMs (please refer to our earlier comment). Our results remain quantitatively and qualitatively nearly identical (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then, in a second level analysis the authors could investigate at which time point (decision or rating) there is a stronger relationship between the confidence ratings and BOLD responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to clarify that our goal here was not necessarily to assess whether BOLD signals show stronger correlation with confidence ratings at one stage or the other. In fact, our results are particularly intriguing in that distinct neural networks appear to carry information about confidence during these two stages of the trial. In particular, activations during the decision phase of the trial such as the VMPFC or anterior cingulate cortex, appear consistent with a more automatic encoding of confidence, i.e., in the absence of explicit confidence report (Lebreton et al., 2015; Bang and Fleming, 2018). In line with this, we also observed activations in regions associated with the human reward/valuation system, such as the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, regions showing correlation with confidence during the confidence rating stage, in particular the anterior prefrontal cortex, have been previously associated with explicit metacognitive judgment/report (Fleming et al., 2012; Morales et al., 2018), perhaps serving a role in higher-order monitoring and confidence communication. We now address these points in the Discussion (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the results presented in Figure 2B, if I understood correctly, the authors report the y(t) out-of-sample values of the &quot;unseen&quot; data for the middle confidence level. I am not convinced that the results reported by the authors are strong evidence for their decoder's ability to generate sensible out-of-sample y(t) values as this could simply reflect regression to the mean (if the authors use the middle confidence level for reading out y(t) by using a dichotomous decoder). I do not think that this result is especially revealing nor necessary to conduct the subsequent fMRI analysis (see my next point).</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that the results we report in relation to the Low- vs. High-confidence discrimination analysis (i.e., classifier performance) were based on a cross validation procedure to ensure there was no overfitting. Specifically, classifier performance (Az) for each subject was computed on the basis of Y values obtained from a leave-one-out procedure, whereby confidence-discriminating spatial filters (w) estimated using N-1 trials at a time were applied to the remaining trial(s) to obtain out-of-sample Y values. For clarity, we now describe this procedure in more detail in the revised paper (Materials and methods subsection “Single-trial EEG analysis”, third paragraph).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we compared these out-of-sample Ys with the values of Y obtained from the original Low- vs. High-confidence discrimination, and found that they were highly correlated (mean R value across subjects:.93, now reported in the aforementioned paragraph). Further, we repeated the analyses presented in Figure 2B, and found that on average, Y values for Medium-confidence trials continued to be situated between, and significantly different from, those in the Low-confidence (t(23)=-4.37, p&lt;.001) and High-confidence (t(23)=-5.04, p&lt;.001) trials; see new Figure 2—figure supplement. 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the use of the decoded value y(t) as parametric regressor for the fMRI analysis, if I understood correctly, the authors use out of sample values of y(t) only for the middle confidence level (see my concern in the point above), whereas for the low and high confidence levels this was not the case. I think that a more appropriate analysis would be to obtain values y(t) fully out of sample. The authors can split the data in n-folds (for instance 10) and use n-1 folds to train the data and obtain the y<sub>CONF</sub> regressor using the remaining fold for decoding, and then use these y<sub>CONF</sub> values as regressors of the fMRI data (see for instance for a similar n-fold cross-validation approach: van Bergen et al., 2015 Nature Neuroscience). Given the nature of the decoder used by the authors (dichotomous predictions), it should be enough that the authors split the data in high and low confidence levels to train the decoder (and therefore it is not necessary to use three levels or more).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extracted out-of-sample values for the High- and Low-confidence levels resulting from a leave-one-trial-out procedure (please see previous point) and found that these values were highly correlated with the original Ys (mean R across subjects =.93), which we take as evidence for the generalisability of our decoder. Repeating the main GLM analysis using these values yielded nearly identical results (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Note that the use of 3 confidence bins (i.e., performing the EEG classification analysis using the extreme ends of the confidence rating scale) was done in an effort to increase sensitivity of the classification analysis and obtain more reliable discrimination weights (that is, minimise overlap between internal representations of High vs. Low confidence caused by potential within-subject inconsistency in confidence ratings), which would in turn improve the quality of our EEG-informed fMRI results. For this reason, we opted to perform the above analysis using the original trial split. Finally, please note that due to the limited number of trials per subject in the current experiment (≤320), we avoided estimating neural signals on subsets of the data in order to preserve the reliability of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, last paragraph: Maybe I missed the point, but for me it is not entirely clear why it is expected that the discriminant component amplitudes are not different for correct and incorrect answers. One of the well established statistical signatures of confidence is that confidence is markedly different for correct and incorrect responses (e.g. see Sanders, Hangya and Kepec, 2016; Urai, Braun and Donner, 2017). Why didn't the authors expect a separation (see my next point for a related concern), and if not, what the discriminant component amplitude really reflects? More discussion on this point in general would be great.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important consideration and we thank the reviewer for pointing it out. The goal here was to ensure that variability in discriminant component amplitudes were not driven solely by fluctuations in decision accuracy. For example, one could argue that the confidence discrimination patterns we observe in the EEG might be purely explained by an unbalanced proportion of correct and error responses in the confidence trial bins used for discrimination (e.g., more correct trials in the High-confidence bin than the Low-confidence bin). We wanted to demonstrate that even when accuracy is constant (i.e., when correct and error trials are considered separately) we continue to see significant effects of confidence in the discriminant amplitude Y (Figure 2D). However we agree that the lack of an effect of accuracy on Y calls for additional investigation. We ran a correlation analysis to assess this relationship and found a small but significant positive correlation between accuracy and Y (t-test on regression coefficients: t(23)=8, p&lt;.001). The original analysis might have been less sensitive to this effect due to the binning of trials by both confidence and accuracy, which meant that mean Y estimates per bin were made from only a few trials (≤10) in some cases. We report this new analysis in the revised paper (Results subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, sixth paragraph) and have also added a new panel which illustrates this relationship (Figure 2C).</p><p>More broadly, the point we wish to make is that while our EEG-derived neural measures of confidence might correlate partly with performance (i.e., choice accuracy) as would be expected from existing work and as pointed out by the reviewer, it can more importantly be decoupled from it. Indeed, much of recent work supports the idea of a dissociation between performance and confidence/metacognition (Lau and Passingham, 2006; Rounis et al., 2010; Komura et al., 2013; Lak et al., 2014; Fleming and Daw, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Stimuli and task”, last paragraph: On a related point (and perhaps an important caveat of this study), I do not understand why the authors excluded or explicitly asked the participants to &quot;abstain from making a confidence response on a given trial if they became aware of having made an incorrect response&quot;. Again, one of the well established signatures of confidence is that confidence is markedly different for correct and incorrect responses. How the results would have been affected without such explicit instruction to the participants? In my opinion, this confidence information should not be excluded or spuriously biased via instructions to the participants. Therefore, I am afraid that what the authors are capturing with their actual confidence ratings (and therefore the decoded values y(t)) is a biased response that is not formally confidence per se. I urge the authors to report this potential caveat and make a clear case (from the beginning) of why this strategy was adopted in the first place.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the ambiguity in the description of the task instructions. To clarify, subjects were instructed to refrain from making a confidence rating only if a <italic>motor mapping</italic> error had been made, for example a premature response that was accidentally initiated in favour of one motion direction despite clear perceptual representation of the opposite direction (this was reported by some subjects following practice sessions, and in previous experiments). Our motivation for wanting to exclude these trials from our analyses was that we were interested in the representations of confidence associated with the perceptual judgment/choice per se, as opposed to the physical action that accompanied it.</p><p>As there was no strong emphasis on speed in our paradigm (subjects were allowed up to 1.3s to make a response) we anticipated that this would be a relatively rare occurrence. Indeed, the number of trials in which no confidence rating was recorded following a perceptual choice was very small, on average 6.13 (SD=5.4) trials per subject, representing only 1.9% (SD=1.7%) of the total number of trials, thus suggesting that this instruction could not have had a substantial impact on our results.</p><p>We have amended the revised paper to clarify the description of the task instructions (see Materials and methods subsection “Main task”).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) One issue is that the model makes the same predictions for every trial, as task difficulty (motion coherence) is held constant. So the authors are bound to between-subject correlations, which they found indeed between modeled sensory evidence at the bound (Δe) and EEG-derived predictor of confidence rating (Y). My understanding of the current interpretation is that Y represents evidence plus some neural noise, and then that confidence rating (R) is Y plus something else (perhaps noise again) which could be loosely defined as 'meta-cognitive reappraisal'. This is not very informative, and not even directly tested.</p><p>A more straightforward test would be a mediation analysis, assessing whether Y could indeed mediate the link from Δe to R. The alternative hypothesis to be discarded is that Δe is actually closer to R, which would take us back to the fundamental question of how Y can be specified in cognitive terms.</p><p>Yet a more informative use of the race model would be to fit trial-by-trial variations in R. This means allowing free parameters to vary across trials, and to test their potential relationship with Y. It could be for instance that Y fluctuations arise from variations in the starting point, or, within a Bayesian framework, in the prior on motion direction. Having said this, my agenda is not to bury the paper under requests for additional work. A clarified relationship between Δe, Y and R may be a reasonable limit to what can be inferred from the dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive feedback. We have now carried out the suggested mediation analysis and report these results in the paper (subsection “Exploratory mediation analysis”). We have also made changes to the Discussion where we attempt to clarify the relationship between Δe, Y, and Ratings, whilst acknowledging current limitations in interpretation and highlighting some remaining open questions (Discussion, fifth to eleventh paragraphs).</p><p>Please note that as our current computational model does not provide trial-to-trial correspondence between model data (Δe) and observed data (Y/Ratings), the mediation analysis was performed at the subject group level (Materials and methods subsection “Exploratory mediation analysis”). As in our previous analysis linking Y and Δe (Figure 3D), we first computed the mean difference between correct and error trials for each of the three variables of interest, to produce measures that are comparable across subjects (i.e., by removing individual differences in the trial-averaged scores that may be due to task-irrelevant factors, e.g., rating biases). These quantities (henceforth referred to as Δe<sub>DIFF</sub>, Y<sub>DIFF</sub>, and Ratings<sub>DIFF</sub>) were then subjected to a mediation analysis testing the hypothesis that Y mediates the link between Δe and ratings. Specifically, we defined a three-variable path model (Wager et al., 2008) with delta-E<sub>DIFF</sub> as the predictor variable, Ratings<sub>DIFF</sub> as the dependent variable, and Y<sub>DIFF</sub> as the mediator. Consistent with the initial prediction, we found that: 1) delta-E<sub>DIFF</sub> was a significant predictor of Y<sub>DIFF</sub> (p=.01), 2) Y<sub>DIFF</sub> reliably predicted Ratings<sub>DIFF</sub> after accounting for the effect of predictor deltaE<sub>DIFF</sub> (p&lt;.001), and 3) the indirect effect of Y<sub>DIFF</sub>, defined as the coefficient product of effects 1) and 2), was also significant (p=.004) (Results subsection “Exploratory mediation analysis”).</p><p>Indeed, the mediator effect of the EEG-derived confidence is in agreement with the idea that Y represents a (potentially noisy) readout of decision-related balance of evidence (as modelled by Δe) by the vmPFC, which in turn serves as a basis for subjective confidence ratings. Please note, however, that given the across-subject nature of the analysis, these findings must be interpreted with some caution.</p><p>In conjunction with the observations presented in the manuscript, we interpret Y as largely relying on, though potentially distinct from, the quantity represented by Δe, in line with the idea of a dissociation between the information that supports the decision vs. confidence. Importantly, the timing of Y (i.e., which is recorded prior to commitment to a motor response), suggests that these early neural estimates of confidence arise in close temporal proximity to the decision, in line with an automatic readout of confidence (i.e., in the absence of explicit report) (Lebreton et al., 2015) and the proposal that vmPFC might encode an early and automatic “feeling of rightness” (Moscovitch and Winocur, 2002; Hebscher and Gilboa, 2016) in memory judgments. While dedicated research will be necessary to establish the functional role of this quantity, early/fast pre-response confidence signals could be necessary to regulate the link between decision and impending action, e.g. with low confidence signalling the need for additional evidence (Desender et al., 2018). We now make these points more explicit in the Discussion (eighth paragraph).</p><p>Regarding the link between Y and the neural activity leading to explicit confidence ratings, it has been long proposed that metacognitive evaluation relies on additional post-decisional processing (Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010; Moran et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015). For instance, recent evidence suggests that choice itself (and corresponding motor-related activity) impacts confidence (Fleming et al., 2015; Gajdos et al., 2018) and may help calibrate/optimise metacognitive reports (Siedlecka et al., 2016; Fleming and Daw, 2017). In this framework, Y could serve as one of multiple inputs to networks supporting retrospective metacognitive processes such as the anterior prefrontal regions (Fleming et al., 2012), which would explain both the correlation with, and dissociation from, subjects’ confidence reports (Discussion, tenth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related issue comes with the new analysis provided to substantiate a role for confidence in behavioral control. The authors found that higher confidence predicts repetition of the same choice in the next trial, if motion direction is the same as in the current trial. This is not in line with the computational model in its present form. It could mean that confidence influences the prior on motion direction, but this would obviously not be adaptive. There is therefore a need to reconcile this finding with the generative model of choice and confidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analyses investigating the influence of neural confidence signals (Y) on subsequent behaviour indicated that high Y amplitude increased the likelihood of repeating a choice only if stimulus direction was consistent with that of the previous trial. Crucially, we did not see this repetition bias when the subsequent trial showed a stimulus moving in the opposite direction. This dependence of choice repetition on stimulus identity is not straightforward to interpret/model (indeed, we are not aware of similar observations in the literature), as it suggests the existence of a potentially separate process which detects consistency between the previous and current stimulus, and which interacts with the representation of previous confidence to influence decision/behaviour (e.g., through selective re-weighting of evidence).</p><p>As such, our results cannot be explained by a direct effect of confidence on the motion prior/starting point, as this would predict a generic repetition bias impacting subsequent choices equally, regardless of whether the next presented stimulus motion is in the same or opposite direction. Indeed, we confirmed this hypothesis with a new analysis using a modified version of the model whereby starting point on a given trial was biased in the direction of the previous choice, in proportion to the magnitude of Δe associated with that choice.</p><p>If indeed stimulus congruency interacts with the representation of previous confidence to influence decision/behaviour via a separate process one might not necessarily be able to capture the choice repetition bias as observed here only by modelling the decision process itself. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, we designed our model to describe the decision process without accounting for potential trial-to-trial dependencies arising from the interaction with confidence, to offer an initial mechanistic interpretation of Y and provide a plausible link to the eventual confidence ratings. We now acknowledge this point in the Discussion (sixth paragraph) and highlight the need to reconcile our findings with formal models of decision making.</p><p>Another potential interpretation of this finding is that it is used as a means for balancing speed/accuracy demands in rapid decision tasks, even if this might inevitably lead to sub-optimal (local) behaviour. Since our task was not specifically designed to manipulate such variables (e.g. transitions in stimulus identity, speed/accuracy etc.) we cannot, at this stage, offer unequivocal support to this idea – though we have started to think carefully of possible extensions of this work and we are beginning to plan future experiments accordingly.</p><p>We hope our results will serve as a starting point for future work that will be tailored specifically towards sequential trial dependencies between neural confidence and stimulus/decision dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Y is not different for correct/incorrect responses: The authors should add a figure plotting Y split for correct and incorrect responses (perhaps next to the new panel 2C) indicating the quantitative difference. Also, please add an explicit explanation (in the Results/Discussion section) about this result. This is essential, as I believe it reveals quite a lot about what type of information Y carries, namely, it is not the classical statistical signature of confidence (see Sanders and Urai work) but something different in line to the arguments that the authors give at the end of the response to this point, i.e. not the probability that the choice is correct, but something else. The authors try to describe this &quot;dissociation&quot; to some extent in other parts of the text, but should be more explicit about this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a new panel (Figure 2D) showing the trial-averaged Y for correct and incorrect responses. We quantified this difference and found that across subjects, Y was consistently higher for correct than error responses (t(23)=7.58, p&lt;.001, Results subsection “EEG-derived measure of confidence”, sixth paragraph), in line with the assumption that these early confidence signals are at least partially informed by the same information leading to the decision. That said, the observation that effects of confidence in the discriminant amplitude Y remain significant when accuracy is kept constant (i.e., when correct and error trials are considered separately) could indicate that, as the reviewer suggests, a dissociation of the confidence-related signals from statistical confidence exists. Y may be more in line with what has been referred to as “subjective confidence” (Odegaard et al., 2018), i.e., a quantity that can largely track statistical confidence (Sanders et al., 2016) but be prone to additional discrepancy or bias. Additional work could help directly address this question, for example by explicitly manipulating perceived confidence independently of task performance (Odegaard et al., 2018). The nature of discrepancies between statistical and subjective confidence has been addressed in behavioural and modelling studies (e.g., (Zylberberg et al., 2012; Samaha et al., 2018), however it is less well understood at the neural level, and lies beyond the main scope of this paper. We have adapted the Discussion to make the above points mode explicit (sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please add the results of the neural correlates of Y at the rating stage (can be in the supplement), and briefly comment about this in the Results section. Reviewers understood that the authors did not want that to focus on this stage, but it is quite a nice result that information about Y transitions from vmPFC at the decision stage to motor related areas at the confidence rating stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included these results in the manuscript, along with the brief interpretation as suggested by the reviewer (Results subsection “fMRI correlates of EEG-derived confidence signals”, last paragraph).</p><p>References:</p><p>Dutilh G, Vandekerckhove J, Forstmann BU, Keuleers E, Brysbaert M, Wagenmakers EJ (2012) Testing theories of post-error slowing.
