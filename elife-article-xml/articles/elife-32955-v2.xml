Evolution has repeatedly recruited the Cys-protease asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) to perform their head-to-tail ligation. These macrocyclization reactions use the substrates amino terminus instead of water to deacylate, so a peptide bond is formed. How solvent-exposed plant AEPs macrocyclize is poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an active plant AEP from the common sunflower, <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>. The active site contained electron density for a tetrahedral intermediate with partial occupancy that predicted a binding mode for peptide macrocyclization. By substituting catalytic residues we could alter the ratio of cyclic to acyclic products. Moreover, we showed AEPs from other species lacking cyclic peptides can perform macrocyclization under favorable pH conditions. This structural characterization of AEP presents a logical framework for engineering superior enzymes that generate macrocyclic peptide drug leads.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32955.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most proteins are long, chain-like molecules that have two ends respectively called the N-terminus and C-terminus. However, certain proteins can close on themselves to become circular. This requires a chemical reaction between the N- and C-termini, which creates a strong bond between the two extremities.</p><p>To go through this ‘cyclization’ process, a straight protein attaches to a certain type of protease, a class of enzyme that usually cuts proteins into smaller pieces. In plants that are distantly related, the same group of enzymes – called AEPs – has been selected to perform cyclization. Here, Haywood et al. study an AEP enzyme from sunflowers: they identify what about this enzyme’s structure is important to drive the complex chemical reaction that results in the protein being cyclized rather than simply cut.</p><p>Using a technique called X-ray crystallography to see the positions of individual atoms in the enzyme, Haywood et al. caught a snapshot of the enzyme. Its structure explained how the enzyme’s shape can guide cyclization. In particular, the part of the enzyme that binds to the proteins, the active site, was relatively flat and open, but also flexible: this helped the N and C-termini react with each other and close the protein. Further experiments artificially mutated specific areas of the enzyme, which helped determine exactly which elements guide this succession of chemical reactions.</p><p>The activity of AEPs is influenced by their local environment, such as acidity. In fact, Haywood et al. showed that certain AEPs, which do not normally carry out cyclization, can start performing this role when exposed to a different level of acidity.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly interested in circular proteins, as these are stable, easily used by the body, and can be genetically customized to act only on specific targets. If the cyclization process is better understood, and then harnessed, new drug compounds could be produced.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Helianthus annuus</kwd><kwd>peptide macrocyclization</kwd><kwd>transpeptidation</kwd><kwd>protease catalysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT120100013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mylne</surname><given-names>Joshua S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP160100107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mylne</surname><given-names>Joshua S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first crystal structure of an active plant asparaginyl endopeptidase reveals a tetrahedral intermediate state in its active site, which may help to explain why these enzymes have been independently recruited to perform peptide macrocyclization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) are a group of asparagine/aspartic acid (Asx) specific proteases that have been classified as belonging to the C13 family of cysteine proteases based on the presence of a His-Gly-spacer-Ala-Cys motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hara-Nishimura et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathieu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shafee et al., 2015</xref>). First described in plants as vacuolar processing enzymes based on their propensity for processing seed proteins stored in vacuoles, AEPs have since been described in a variety of organisms and shown to be involved in a wide range of processes including, cell death antigen processing and hemoglobin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hara-Nishimura et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manoury et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hatsugai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuroyanagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sojka et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to the proteolytic function observed in these processes, AEP has become well known for its curious ligation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Min and Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheldon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mylne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dall et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ability of endoproteases to perform ligation reactions was first observed by Bergmann and Fruton in 1938 with chymotrypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann and Fruton, 1938</xref>). Later, in vitro ligation reactions were performed with AEP from jack bean (<italic>Canavalia ensiformis</italic>) seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowles et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Min and Jones, 1994</xref>). The recent discovery that evolutionarily distinct plant families have repeatedly recruited AEPs to catalyze the formation of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), through the macrocyclization of linear precursor sequences, has caught the attention of drug designers keen to overcome the current inefficiencies in native chemical ligation that limit the therapeutic use of cyclic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pattabiraman and Bode, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mylne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnison et al., 2013</xref>). Such therapeutic cyclic peptides are viewed by many to have the potential to capitalize on a niche in the current pharmaceutical market by virtue of their intermediate size between small molecule drugs and large protein structures, and their unique capacity to combine favorable bioavailability and stability characteristics with high target specificity facilitated by tolerance to site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gould et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Truman, 2016</xref>). Moreover, as computational techniques for the discovery of RiPPs improve and the number of cyclic peptides described continues to expand, an ever-wider array of scaffolds might be exploited to tailor molecules to specific drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhardwaj et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Truman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hetrick and van der Donk, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32955.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Examples of enzyme catalyzed formation of cyclic RiPPs.</title><p>Cyclic RiPPs that are enzyme catalyzed from linear peptide precursors are commonly flanked by an N-terminus leader sequence and a C-terminus follower sequence prior to cyclization.

Its biosynthesis is rather unusual as its sequence is buried within a precursor that also encodes seed storage albumin. Seed storage albumins are a major class of seed storage protein that constitute over 50% of total seed protein and become a source of nitrogen and sulfur during seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Youle and Huang, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shewry and Halford, 2002</xref>). The common sunflower (<italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>) has many genes encoding precursors for these napin-type or 2S seed storage albumins that are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum before undergoing cleavage maturation by AEP and localizing to storage vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollini and Chrispeels, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jayasena et al., 2016</xref>). Along with an adjacent albumin, SFTI-1 is post-translationally processed by AEP from within a unique seed storage albumin precursor called <underline>P</underline>repro<underline>a</underline>lbumin <underline>w</underline>ith <underline>S</underline>FTI-1 (PawS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mylne et al., 2011</xref>). SFTI-1 is a potent inhibitor of serine proteases, and its intrinsic stability and cellular penetration capabilities have led to its application as a bioactive scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">White and Craik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swedberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>AEP-catalyzed macrocyclization of SFTI-1 is hypothesized to proceed via a cleavage-coupled intramolecular transpeptidation reaction whereby catalysis begins with the deprotonation of the active site Cys by a localized His of the catalytic center, facilitating the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the Asp by the activated Cys thiol of AEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernath-Levin et al., 2015</xref>). This attack culminates in the formation of a thioacyl intermediate between the substrate and AEP, and the removal of the C-terminus. The reaction is proposed to be subsequently concluded by the nucleophilic attack of this intermediate by a Gly at the N-terminus of the substrate, resulting in the macrocyclization of SFTI-1 in a head-to-tail manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mylne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernath-Levin et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, this reaction proceeds in competition with nucleophilic attack upon the thioacyl intermediate by any nearby water molecules which would produce hydrolyzed, acyclic-SFTI. In vitro studies revealed the ratio of acyclic to cyclic SFTI-1 to be in the order of 5.8:1, with the less stable acyclic products hypothesized to be quickly degraded in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernath-Levin et al., 2015</xref>). Evidence for AEP-mediated and hydrolysis-independent transpeptidation was demonstrated through the exclusion of a heavy atom O<sup>18</sup> in the cyclic SFTI-1 product from an in vitro jack bean AEP (CeAEP1) catalyzed reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernath-Levin et al., 2015</xref>). The formation of a much larger cyclic peptide by an AEP from <italic>Oldenlandia affinis</italic> (OaAEP1) was also shown to lack O<sup>18</sup> incorporation, suggesting a conserved mechanism of macrocyclization despite differences in substrate sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). However, the suggestion that an AEP from butterfly pea (<italic>Clitoria ternatea</italic>) termed butelase one functions only as a ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>), combined with the proposal of a succinimide-driven, cleavage-independent ligation event based on the crystal structure of human AEP (hAEP) and its ability to ligate substrate in the absence of the catalytic Cys, has cast uncertainty on the mechanism of AEP-catalyzed macrocyclization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dall et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to elucidate a structural explanation why plant AEPs have been recruited by distinct plant lineages to perform macrocyclization and to understand the catalytic and structural nuances that might allow preferences towards cleavage or ligation reactions, we sought the crystal structure of a sunflower AEP.</p><p>Herein, we describe the first structure of an active plant AEP; one capable of performing peptide macrocyclization. This AEP, the most abundant AEP of five AEPs in the common sunflower (HaAEP1), displays structural similarity to previously published active AEPs from mammals, with subtle differences at residues involved in substrate recognition. Our characterization by site-directed mutagenesis of HaAEP1 residues integral to macrocyclization will facilitate the bioengineering of plant AEPs for improved macrocyclization efficiency, diversifying the scaffolds usable as cyclic therapeutic leads.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Catalytic domain of HaAEP1 purified at pH 4</title><p>AEPs are synthesized as inactive precursors that have been shown to undergo irreversible auto-activation into their mature form on exposure to a low pH environment that resembles the acidic pH in the vesicles/vacuole where these proteins are active in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dall and Brandstetter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shafee et al., 2015</xref>). In order to obtain an active form of a plant AEP, a ~51 kDa pro-HaAEP1 (residues 28–491) lacking an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence and including a N-terminal His-tag was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified by nickel affinity chromatography before being activated at pH 4.0 overnight.

Due to such topological conservation it is expected that subtle differences around the substrate binding pocket will define substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. Indeed, comparison of these three structures reveals HaAEP1 exhibits a unique flexible extension, reflected by weak electron density, in the α5-β6 loop and differences between the residues that are local to the catalytic His and Cys and those that delineate the S3-S5 pockets (following the protease nomenclature defined by Schechter and Berger where the cleavage site residue is termed P1 and residues prior to and following the cleavage site are labeled P5-P2 and P1′-P2′, respectively, and where the corresponding binding sites on the protease are described as S5-S2′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schechter and Berger, 1967</xref>). Specifically, differences in the substrate pocket include residues YGT 249–251 in HaAEP1 (hAEP: YAC 217–219, OaAEP1: WCY 246–248), a bulky Trp232 in hAEP versus Leu271 in HaAEP1 and Leu268 in OaAEP1, and the presence of an additional proline prior to the β<sub>IV</sub>-β<sub>V</sub> polyproline loop which orients E257 away from the S4 region in HaAEP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Interestingly, none of the four conserved potential N-linked glycosylation sites in hAEP and mouse AEP (mAEP) are found in HaAEP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that these glycosylation sites have been predicted to protect AEP from non-specific protease activation it is intriguing to find that the only two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in HaAEP1 (N138 and N143) are located on the opposite side of the protein to the activation peptide in mammalian AEPs, at the beginning and center of the α2 helix, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dall and Brandstetter, 2016</xref>).

Given AEPs specificity for Asx and the nature of the electron density, we built and refined a tetrahedral complex of a three-residue peptide ligand (AAN) bound to the active site Cys of HaAEP1 with partial occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Residues Ala-Ala were modeled upstream of the P1 Asn due to the weak electron density away from the peptide backbone at these residues. The AAN peptide ligand allowed characterization of interactions likely to exist between HaAEP1 and P1 Asn and main chain of residues P2-P3 during substrate recognition. Due to the high sequence conservation of the HaAEP1 active site with mammalian AEPs and conserved substrate orientation, many of the interactions with the substrate match those observed for inhibitors of hAEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dall et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The presence of this unexpected substrate in the HaAEP1 active site is likely to be a product of auto-activation. The continuous electron density between Cys220 and the P1 Asn supports the interpretation of the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate that is stabilized by the presence of an oxyanion hole formed by His178, Gly179 and the backbone amine of Cys220 that is more congruous to the electron density than an acyl intermediate or free peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the observed short distance between the tetrahedral intermediate carbon atom and catalytic cysteine sulfur atom is incompatible with the absence of a covalent interaction. Main chain amino groups of Gly residues have previously been proposed to function in the creation of an oxyanion hole stabilizing the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate with the substrate in a wide range of cysteine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dall and Brandstetter, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, previous observations of tetrahedral intermediates and enzyme-product complexes with serine proteases have been shown to exhibit a pH-dependent equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilmouth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Radisky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and James, 2008</xref>). Similarly, the trapping of this intermediate state may have been fortuitously facilitated by the activation of HaAEP1 at pH 4, followed by crystallization at pH 7. Although alternative conformations of the active site Cys in hAEP have been described previously, this tetrahedral intermediate state has not been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dall et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Modulation of pH enables HaAEP1 to perform macrocyclization</title><p>The similarity of the HaAEP1 active site to that of OaAEP1 and the revelation that it contained a reactive succinimide prompted us to test an enzyme preparation similarly taken to pH 4.0 against the modified SFTI-1 precursor substrate SFTI(D14N)-GLDN substrate.

This structure has enabled us to predict a model for SFTI-1 macrocyclization by HaAEP1 where the GLDN tail of the SFTI-1 precursor orients in a manner analogous to cystatin binding to hAEP, over the catalytic His to a hydrophobic patch on the β<sub>II</sub> region, and where the N-terminus attack occurs between the diminutive β<sub>I</sub> sheet and β5-β<sub>IV</sub> loop in a manner analogous to the attack of thioacyl intermediates by peptidoglycan precursors in sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suree et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clancy et al., 2010</xref>). This model complements the requirement for a small amino acid followed by a hydrophobic residue at P1′ and P2′ due to their orientation over the catalytic His and towards the hydrophobic β<sub>II</sub>-β<sub>III</sub> region, respectively.</p><p>For several Cys proteases, including AEPs, a minor role for a third Asx/Arg residue in catalysis has previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vernet et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dodson and Wlodawer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dall and Brandstetter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clancy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buller and Townsend, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dall and Brandstetter, 2013</xref>). This third residue has been suggested to function in stabilization and orientation of the His imidazole ring. Interestingly, functional analysis of HaAEP1 catalytic triad residue N73 revealed that an N73A mutation resulted in the production of a higher ratio of cyclic SFTI-1. The observation of potential conformational shifts in the crystal structure of HaAEP1 during catalysis suggests that the loss of an orientating N73 side chain allows for further conformational flexibility of H178. This increased flexibility of His in a relatively open pocket that might accommodate a range of rotamers could reduce steric hindrance of an N-terminus entry towards the acyl intermediate and also facilitate deprotonation of the substrate N-terminus.</p><p>The requirement for space and flexibility between the catalytic dyad favors the convergence for peptide macrocyclization upon Cys proteases over Ser proteases due to the close proximity between Ser-His residues in these proteases, an inherent requirement based upon the reduced nucleophilic properties of Ser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buller and Townsend, 2013</xref>). Indeed, a recent structure of a macrocyclizing Ser protease, PCY1, suggested that a shift in the catalytic His away from Ser is required for macrocyclization, based on a comparison to their hydrolytic relatives, and suggested a role for the catalytic His in deprotonation of the attacking peptide N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chekan et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, comparison with other Cys proteases suggests that AEPs have been converged upon for macrocyclization based on their relatively flat and open catalytic site. In contrast to a recent hypothesis for efficient macrocyclization based on a comparison of AEP structures focused on a region closer to the S4 pocket, here we suggest that differences in AEP catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity will be defined by subtle amino acid differences in the β<sub>II</sub>-β<sub>III</sub> region, β<sub>I</sub> sheet and β5-β<sub>IV</sub> loop and the S1-S5 pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, this orientation of the tail away from the β<sub>I</sub> sheet and β5-β<sub>IV</sub> loop is hindered in other caspases which exhibit a relatively straight substrate channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and thus prevent simultaneous attack of the thioacyl intermediate by the N-terminus loop upon scissile bond cleavage.</p><p>Following activation, AEP functionality has been illustrated to be dependent on a delicate balance between pH and stability, where endopeptidase activity is favored at a low pH (~pH 4) and ligase activity is favored at a higher pH (~pH 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dall et al., 2015</xref>). A pH-dependent activity has been well documented for cysteine proteases and is a function of the formation of a thiolate and imidazolium ions on the catalytic dyad of Cys and His residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dall and Brandstetter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frankel et al., 2005</xref>). Given the hypothesized role of His in deprotonating the attacking N-terminal peptide chain in peptide macrocyclization it would therefore be expected that at a low pH the catalytic His would be more readily protonated and hence this reaction might be less frequent resulting in more hydrolysis at low pH. This hypothesis is supported by the low level of endopeptidase activity observed with Ala mutations of the catalytic His in HaAEP1 and other proteases, illustrating that thiolates might form and that hydrolytic resolution of the thioacyl intermediate might occur in the absence of His (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frankel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Previous reports have also suggested that a local Gly amide backbone might facilitate catalysis via a transfer of a proton to the leaving group of the tetrahedral intermediate from a hydrogen bonded water molecule; analysis of the HaAEP1 structure reveals Gly179 could potentially perform this role in the absence of His (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brady et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, mutation of the acidic residue following the catalytic Cys to a basic residue in hAEP has previously been shown to enhance catalytic efficiency by decreasing the local pKa of the Cys residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dall and Brandstetter, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we found an equivalent mutation in HaAEP1 to result in the loss of peptide macrocyclization indicating that E221 could also aid in deprotonation of the incoming N-terminus or that the residue’s larger side chain and expected orientation in activating the catalytic Cys could impart steric hindrance upon the N-terminus attack of the thioacyl intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, given the finding that E221K mutation is unable to prevent re-ligation of the cap domain to the active core domain upon pH shift in HaAEP1, there is likely to be redundancy between the local residues in creating a nucleophilic amine group to complete a transpeptidation reaction.</p><p>The finding that AEPs from species that lack cyclic peptides may be coaxed into performing peptide macrocyclization of a linear peptide under favorable conditions significantly expands the potential use of AEPs for the production of cyclic peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, further investigation into the subtle nuances that define substrate specificity and catalytic activity between AEPs is warranted, with differences in the β<sub>II</sub>-β<sub>III</sub> region, β<sub>I</sub> sheet, β5-β<sub>IV</sub> loop and around the S1-5 pocket including the variable α5-β6 and β<sub>IV-</sub>β<sub>V</sub> loops likely to be key (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, in comparison to HaAEP1 and OaAEP1, the efficient peptide macrocyclizing AEP butelase one displays several different amino acids that could be responsible for this AEPs efficacy. These differences include shorter sidechains in the β<sub>I</sub> sheet and β5-β<sub>IV</sub> loops that may reduce steric hindrance on a peptides N-terminus during attack on a thioacyl intermediate (HaAEP1: P181, Q245, N247 OaAEP1: A178, T242, S244 Butelase-1: A168, G232, S234) and differences in the β<sub>IV-</sub>β<sub>V</sub> region that could generate substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Active HaAEP1 exhibits a succinimide at the same position as hAEP which has previously been postulated to perform a Cys-independent ligation reaction through cyclic rearrangement with the P1 Asx side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dall et al., 2015</xref>). Functional analysis reveals that HaAEP1 is able to perform peptide macrocyclization despite D177G/A mutations that cannot form a succinimide group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Moreover, these mutants continued to perform re-ligation of the cap domain when activated at pH &gt;5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), a result that has previously been shown with mAEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of a critical requirement for succinimide formation in macrocyclization the question remains as to why this relatively unstable aspartimide appears stable in AEP crystal structures and is largely conserved in the C13 proteases. Succinimides have been shown to form more readily when adjacent to His residues as the His Nδ abstracts a proton from the His backbone NH allowing the deprotonated main chain amine to attack the Asx side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennan and Clarke, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Once formed this succinimide could enhance the activity of the catalytic His by virtue of reducing stabilizing hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxyl terminus and be involved in the proper positioning of the catalytic His. A further potential role for succinimides could present upon their hydrolysis through racemization and favored formation of iso-Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger and Clarke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>). This iso-Asp could potentially represent a subtle mode of AEP regulation as the orientation of this side chain towards the S1 pocket is likely to disrupt substrate binding. Such iso-Asp residues have previously been proposed to regulate protein activity by a time-dependent molecular switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger and Clarke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ritz-Timme and Collins, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of caspases, plants have evolved a wide range of cysteine proteases to ensure functional redundancy in a myriad of highly regulated programmed cell death pathways in response to environmental and developmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fagundes et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, plants have developed a variety of strategies to control the destructive prowess of these proteases including the expression of proteases as inactive zymogens with cofactor dependency, compartmentalization and the production of protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martínez et al., 2012</xref>). Of these cysteine proteases the AEPs have recently attracted considerable interest due to their ability to carry out peptide macrocyclization and their potential application in the synthesis of pharmacoactive cyclic peptides. Herein, the structural and functional analysis of HaAEP1 has revealed residues that are able to favor the production of cyclic or acyclic products from SFTI(D14N)-GLDN. Moreover, we have modeled a binding mode for productive macrocyclization of the HaAEP1 natural ligand SFTI-1, based on a comparison with related cysteine proteases that is likely to be conserved between AEPs, where substrate specificity is defined by the amino acids around the binding site for respective AEPs. Furthermore, we have shown that AEPs from diverse species lacking cyclic peptides are able to perform macrocyclization under favorable pH conditions. These findings provide the foundation for further optimization of AEPs, potentially widening the array of peptide substrates that could be cyclized by AEPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>DNA sequence encoding residues 28–491 of HaAEP1 (accession code: KJ147147), <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> AEP (RcAEP1) residues 58–497 (accession code: D17401) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AEP (AtAEP2) residues 47–486 (accession code: Q39044) were cloned into a pQE30 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) expression vector with an N-terminal six-histidine tag and expressed in the SHuffle strain <italic>E. coli</italic> (New England Biolabs) transformed with pREP4 (QIAGEN).

Concentrations were checked by absorbance at 280 nm with a NanoDrop using the extinction coefficient of Pro-AEP and samples diluted to 0.1 mg/ml or 0.2 mg/ml. CD measurements were made in triplicate using a Jasco J-810 CD spectrometer with a 0.1 cm quartz cuvette using a 1 nm bandwidth on a 0.1 mg/ml sample. CD wavelength spectra were collected from between 200–260 nm a rate of 1 nm/sec at 20°C. Melt curves were collected using the same bandwidth at 222 nm with temperature increasing at a rate of 1 °C/min from 20–95°C on a 0.2 mg/ml sample. WT HaAEP1 melting temperature was interpolated from melt curve using a sigmoidal four parameter logistic regression fit (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein activity analysis</title><p>AEPs were activated by dialysis for four hours at room temperature in activation buffer (20 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, 5 mM DTT, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA) followed by a second dialysis into ligation buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA acid). Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at A280 using a NanoDrop (1 Abs = 1.0 mg/mL). For mass spectrometry analysis of the processing of SFTI(D14N)-GLDN or native SFTI-GLDN by WT HaAEP1, RcAEP, AtAEP2 and mutant HaAEPs, AEPs at a concentration of 40 µg/mL were incubated with 0.25 mM peptide with a diselenide bond and 25 mM native (i.e. disulfide) SFTI-1 as an internal standard in activity buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.5, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). Reactions were carried out at 37°C for 16 hr. Three independent reactions were performed for each protein tested. The reactions were stopped by dilution 100-fold in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and spotted with an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix onto a plate for analysis by MALDI-MS. Quantification of peak area by MALDI-MS was calculated using the internal standard to normalize for ionization efficiency as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernath-Levin et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, for activity probe analysis 50 µL of AEP at 10 µg/mL was incubated with 1 µM of the BODIPY probe JOPD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) at room temperature overnight and protected from light. The labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 µL of 6x SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and proteins separated using 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Labeled proteins were visualized in gel with excitation and emission wavelengths of 532 and 580 nm using a Typhoon 9500 (GE Healthcare, Paramatta, Australia).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of reversal of AEP activation</title><p>WT, D177G, N73A and E221K proteins were purified by affinity chromatography as described above and activated by overnight (4°C) dialysis at pH 4.0/5.5/6.5 in 100 mM citric acid - sodium citrate buffer containing 50 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM DTT, with pH adjusted by addition of 1.0 M Tris-HCl pH 8. Prior to pH-shift, sample aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −80°C for subsequent activity probe analysis and SDS-PAGE analysis. Remaining activated protein was then returned to the previous buffer but with pH adjusted to pH 8.0 by adding 1.0 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, as previously described, and incubated overnight at 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara-Nishimura et al., 1998</xref>). Following dialysis at pH 8.0 samples were flash frozen as described above. Proteins were then analyzed for activity, as described above, using the BODIPY activity based probe. Following in gel visualization of active protein gels were immediately fixed in Coomassie Blue stain for comparison of active and inactive protein.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dan Tawfik for critical insights during project design, Hannes Ludewig for comments on the manuscript and Renier van der Hoorn for the BODIPY probe JOPD1.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Structural basis of ribosomal peptide macrocyclization in plants&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Charles Craik, and a Senior Editor, Michael Marletta. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and Charles Craik has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The current work presents the first structure of an &quot;active&quot; cysteine protease asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) that is capable of generating a macrocycle and visualizes a tetrahedral intermediate bound at the active site. While there have been structures of other AEPs, this work directly addresses the question of how AEPs actually produce macrocyclic products. Through mutagenesis and modulation of the pH, the hydrolytic vs. the transamination activity of the human homolog of AEP was dissected suggesting that deprotonation of the α amino group facilitates the macrocyclization of the covalently bound substrate at the thioacylenzyme intermediate. The work is of general interest to chemists and biotechnologists particularly due to the current interest in the macrocyclization process for its use in generating diverse cyclopeptide scaffolds that could be used as therapeutic leads.</p><p>The manuscript is in principle within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>'s interest/mission. The reviewers raise valid points and a summary of our assessment follows:</p><p>Structural comments:</p><p>In light of the remarkable result of identifying a trapped tetrahedral intermediate, a precise justification of the presence of a tetrahedral intermediate in the active site instead of some other substrate or intermediate is justified in the text. What is it about the structural model that inspired the authors to model in a tetrahedral intermediate? Related to this, at the end of the subsection “HaAEP1 displays a tetrahedral intermediate in the active site”, Dall et al., 2015 is cited, but the evidence in the reference that &quot;this tetrahedral intermediate state has not been described before.&quot; A more precise justification could clarify.</p><p>A map showing this result should be very clear. In place of the electron density maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, a</xref> stereo view would improve the clarity of the trapped tetrahedral intermediate, and a simulated annealing omit map would be better than a 2|Fo|-|Fc| map which would make a more compelling case for alternate conformations with minimal model bias.</p><p>For part (B), although an omit map (|Fo|-|Fc|) is shown, the authors do not say whether this is a simulated annealing omit map. If it is not, check the simulated annealing omit map to ensure that model bias does not significantly influence the observed density. The atoms of C220, the conformer involved in the thioacylenzyme, should be omitted in the calculation.</p><p>The authors state that Brady et al. 1999, &quot;…suggested that a local Gly amide backbone might polarize a water molecule in the absence of His to enable peptide hydrolysis, analysis of the HaAEP1 structure reveals Gly179 could potentially perform this role.&quot; There is some confusion since it is not clear how a hydrogen bond with a backbone NH group could polarize a water molecule and Brady et al. describe a glycine-hydrogen bonded water molecule that might serve as a proton donor. It should be clarified how the authors are referring to this work.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, it is not meaningful to report thermal B factors to the hundredths place; rounding these to the tenths place, or simply rounded integer values, would be sufficient for a structure determined at 1.80 Å resolution.</p><p>Functional comments:</p><p>An appealing presentation of data on the kinetic rate constants and the substrate specificity of the enzyme is warranted. Kinetic constants should be included for at least the wild-type enzyme. Data from the literature or independently generated by the authors should be included since providing the kinetic competency of the enzyme will elevate interests from the biotechnological community.</p><p>The substrate selectivity of HaAEP1 should be addressed. What are its endogenous substrates and what is its biological role? Does it natively synthesize SFTI-1?</p><p>Provide clarity about the functional aspects of the enzyme for a broad audience, since the paper is currently challenging to follow without significant background reading. For example:</p><p>Although it is stated in the paper, it is not clear in the Introduction that HaAEP1 produces a mixture of linear and cyclic precursors until later in the Results. Is this thought to be an endogenous reaction that is relevant to its biological role? Is it known to be condition dependent?</p><p>The experiment exemplified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is not well explained in the text. What does the addition of seleno vs. wild type reveal? Is the quantitation appropriate? Are relative peak areas informative given the potential for different ionization efficiencies? See also the suggestion below regarding an additional figure for clarity.</p><p>Editorial comments:</p><p>AEPs are members of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) class of natural products. This should be noted in the Introduction and referenced appropriately.</p><p>For the benefit of non-specialist readers, a figure should be considered that introduces different macrocyclic peptides that are products of various biosynthetic enzymes (i.e. SFTI, orbitides, cyanobactins, etc.). This figure could also include a diagram depicting the AEP reaction (linear peptide cleaved into macrocyclic peptide+linear tail).</p><p>&quot;nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon&quot; should read &quot;nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon&quot;.</p><p>The fifth paragraph of the Discussion contains information that describe an essential result and should be rewritten for clarity and included in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32955.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript is in principle within the scope of eLife's interest/mission.
