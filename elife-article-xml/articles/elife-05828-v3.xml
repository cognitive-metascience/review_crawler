The evolutionary conserved AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are well-known metabolic master regulators in the low-energy response in animals, yeast and plants. They act at two different levels: by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes, and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. Here we identified the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcription factor bZIP63 as key regulator of the starvation response and direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A <italic>bzip63</italic> knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05828.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05828.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organisms need to adjust their metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions to ensure that they balance their energy intake with the demands of growth and reproduction. In plants, an enzyme called SnRK1 plays a crucial role in responses to starvation in two ways: by altering the activities of enzymes involved in metabolism and by regulating the expression of genes. To perform the second job, SnRK1 is thought to control the activity of proteins called transcription factors—which alter the expression of genes by binding to DNA—but it is not known which ones.</p><p>SnRK1 has ‘kinase’ activity, that is, it can alter the activities of other proteins by adding small molecules called phosphates to them. It has been suggested that a group of transcription factors called the bZIP proteins may be regulated by SnRK1. Two bZIP proteins work together to switch on a gene, and the combination of bZIP proteins that interact can influence which genes are switched on. Here, Mair et al. studied the role of a bZIP protein called bZIP63 during starvation in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>The experiments show that bZIP63 is involved in controlling responses to starvation. Furthermore, its activity is regulated by SnRK1, which adds phosphates to three specific locations on the protein. These phosphates alter the ability of bZIP63 to interact with other bZIP proteins, leading to changes in gene expression during starvation.</p><p>Mair et al. triggered starvation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants by keeping the plants in darkness for several days. The leaves of normal plants turn yellow in response to starvation, but the leaves of mutant plants that lacked bZIP63 remained green. In contrast, plants containing higher amounts of this bZIP protein showed the opposite effect and their leaves turned yellow much more quickly than normal plants. The mutant plants that lacked bZIP63 could be rescued by the normal protein, but not by another version of the protein that SnRK1 is unable to add phosphates to.</p><p>These data suggest that SnRK1 regulates bZIP63 activity to alter metabolism in response to starvation. Mair et al. propose a model in which the ability of bZIP63 to interact with other bZIPs is normally rather low. However, when the plants are starved, SnRK1 adds phosphates to bZIP63, which increases its ability to bind to other bZIP proteins and leads to changes in gene expression. The bZIP proteins are also found in animals; therefore a future challenge is to find out whether these proteins are also regulated in a similar way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05828.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05828.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>SnRK1 kinase</kwd><kwd>metabolic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>bZIP transcription factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P23435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mair</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurzinger</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Teige</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN MERIT GA 264474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedrotti</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name><name><surname>Simeunovic</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Nägele</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA2146/8-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirchler</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-PLA/3937/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valerio</surname><given-names>Concetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UID/Multi/0455½013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baena-González</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription factor bZIP63 is a key regulator of the starvation response in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and is directly targeted by the kinase SnRK1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexibility in the regulation of gene expression is crucial for all organisms to adjust their metabolism to changing growth conditions. Particularly under stress, available energy resources need to be balanced between defense and growth. The SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) in plants and its orthologs, the sucrose-non-fermenting 1 (Snf1) kinase in yeast and the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in mammals, are well-known and crucial master regulators of energy homeostasis. SnRK1 is involved in the regulation of plant metabolism, development, and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Polge and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-González and Sheen, 2008</xref>), Snf1 is required for the switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism in the absence of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008</xref>), and AMPK regulates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and feeding behavior in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hardie et al., 2012</xref>). They are generally activated under energy starvation conditions and trigger metabolic reprograming to slow down energy-consuming processes and turn on pathways for alternative energy production in order to survive the stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tome et al., 2014</xref>). This happens, in two ways: by direct phosphorylation and modulation of the activity of key enzymes in nitrogen, carbon, or fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kulma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harthill et al., 2006</xref>), and by massive transcriptional reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Polge and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-González and Sheen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGee and Hargreaves, 2008</xref>). Especially in plants, the latter aspect, the regulation of transcription, is still poorly understood. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts, transient overexpression of AKIN10, a catalytic subunit of the SnRK1 complex, resulted in a transcriptional profile reminiscent of various starvation conditions and led to the identification of 1021 putative SnRK1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>). However, the transcription factors mediating the transcriptional response of SnRK1 to energy starvation are still unknown. Based on reporter gene activation assays in protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>) and modelling of microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Usadel et al., 2008</xref>), some members of the C/S1 group of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs)—foremost bZIP11 and bZIP1 from the S1 group—were speculated to be involved in this process. Yet, a direct regulation of these bZIPs by SnRK1 has never been shown.</p><p>bZIP proteins form a large and highly conserved group of eukaryotic TFs. They bind the DNA as dimers and are characterized by a basic region for specific DNA binding and a leucine zipper for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deppmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinke et al., 2013</xref>). They are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, stress response, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jakoby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motohashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodrigues-Pousada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukada et al., 2011</xref>). The diversity and flexibility of transcriptional regulation by bZIP TFs can at least partially be attributed to their potential to form variable dimer combinations, which bind to different consensus target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deppmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukada et al., 2011</xref>). While the leucine zipper determines the possible dimer combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deppmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinke et al., 2013</xref>), the actual in vivo dimer composition is further influenced by factors such as protein availability, binding of regulatory proteins, or post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuetze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Since the initial discovery that the mammalian bZIP cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, many bZIP TFs were reported to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuetze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukada et al., 2011</xref>). However, particularly in plants, the functional consequences of these phosphorylation events often remained unclear. For example, it has been known for several years that abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent phosphorylation of some ABA-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) by SnRK2 kinases increases their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furihata et al., 2006</xref>), yet the underlying mechanism of this activation is still unknown. It is also surprising that, while many examples for phosphorylation-dependent regulation of bZIP activity, DNA-binding, subcellular localization, stability, and interaction with regulatory proteins are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuetze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukada et al., 2011</xref>), reports on the regulation of dimerization are scarce. So far, only three publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) showed compelling evidence for phosphorylation-dependent changes in bZIP dimerization in animals. Still, even in these cases it is often not entirely clear whether bZIP phosphorylation affects dimerization directly or indirectly by enhancing DNA binding.</p><p>bZIP63 is a member of the C-group of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> bZIPs, which was proposed to play a role in energy metabolism, seed maturation, and germination under osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jakoby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Correa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Veerabagu et al., 2014</xref>). Its transcriptional profile indicates that bZIP63 could be involved in the (energy) starvation response, as transcription and mRNA stability are repressed by sugars and ABA and mRNA levels increase in the night and even more during extended night treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matiolli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kunz et al., 2014</xref>). A small set of potential target genes for bZIP63 has been identified, including genes involved in amino acid metabolism (<italic>ASN1</italic>/<italic>DIN6</italic> = ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1, <italic>ProDH</italic> = PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE), energy starvation response (<italic>DIN10</italic> = RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE 6), and senescence (<italic>SEN1</italic> = SENESCENCE 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matiolli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Veerabagu et al., 2014</xref>). The C-group bZIPs form a dimerization network with the S1-group in plants, in which bZIP63 can interact with all members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehlert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). Three of its dimerization partners from the S1-group—bZIP1, bZIP11, and bZIP53—were shown to be important metabolic regulators, especially under energy starvation conditions, and to regulate the expression of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ProDH</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, bZIP1 was recently confirmed as a transcriptional master regulator of the rapid response to nutrient signals controlling mainly genes involved in amino acid metabolism and cell death/phosphorus metabolism as primary targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Para et al., 2014</xref>). In that study the authors also speculate about a posttranslational modification of bZIP1 or its binding partners.</p><p>Here we show that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions, and that bZIP63 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar- and energy-dependent manner. In an unbiased approach, we identified SnRK1 as one of the kinases responsible for bZIP63 phosphorylation and found that it targets three highly conserved serine residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63. Moreover, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta and propose a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>bZIP63 controls dark-induced senescence and primary metabolism</title><p>To better understand the role of bZIP63 in the plant we first tested whether bZIP63 has a similar phenotype as its dimerization partners bZIP1 and bZIP11. Prolonged darkness was shown to induce increased chlorophyll loss in plants overexpressing bZIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we incubated a bZIP63 knock-out (ko), two independent overexpressor (ox) lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and their respective wild types (wt) in the dark and determined the percentage of the green leaf area as a measure for chlorophyll content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This method was preferred over direct chlorophyll measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) as it is not affected by the water loss in senescing leaves. While no differences were observed before dark treatment, significant differences were visible after 9 days in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Similar to the bZIP1 ox, the bZIP63 ox lines (ox#2 and ox#3) had a significantly higher percentage of yellow leaf area than the wt. In contrast, <italic>bzip63</italic> plants displayed a stay-green phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). RT-qPCRs of different senescence marker genes confirmed that the phenotype is due to dark-induced and not to natural senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Transcriptional responses in dark-induced senescence show clear similarities to starvation-induced senescence in cell suspension culture, which likely results from carbon depletion in both systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore tested whether addition of sugar could rescue this phenotype by performing the dark-induced senescence experiment with seedlings grown on agar plates with and without addition of sugar.

Comparison of protein extracts from seedling cultures after 6 hr extended night in the presence or absence of sucrose or leaves harvested after 6 hr of light or extended night revealed strong differences in the phosphorylation patterns of bZIP63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to the recombinantly expressed (not phosphorylated) bZIP63-YFP, the majority of plant-expressed bZIP63-GFP appeared in several slower migrating forms, thus indicating multiple and differentially phosphorylated forms. In total, we were able to distinguish eight different forms on the Phos-tag gels, depending on the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is important to note, that not every phosphorylation event results in an equal shift. In the light, two strong bands were visible, possibly reflecting the two spots on the 2D gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, labelled as band 6 and band 7, respectively). Under extended night conditions, an additional band appeared (labelled as band 8), indicating increased phosphorylation of bZIP63. Notably, the ratio of the most phosphorylated form of bZIP63 (band 8) to the two less phosphorylated forms (band 6 and 7) was different between the ox (ox#3) and a genomic complementation line of <italic>bzip63</italic> (GY11, detailed description follows later). In the genomic complementation line, the most phosphorylated form of bZIP63 was the strongest band under extended night conditions, which might be a result of the different bZIP63 amounts in relation to the endogenous kinase(s), and likely better reflects the phosphorylation state of the endogenous protein. Interestingly, in seedlings grown in liquid culture, the extended night-triggered phosphorylation of bZIP63 could be abolished by the addition of 1% of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In fact, phosphorylation was even lower here than in the light. These data indicate that bZIP63 has a basal level of phosphorylation in the plant and undergoes hyper-phosphorylation under starvation conditions. In contrast, addition of external sugars leads to a reduced phosphorylation status of bZIP63.</p><p>In order to identify the in vivo phosphorylated residues, bZIP63-GFP was immunoprecipitated from total leaf extracts using bead-coupled anti-GFP antibodies, subjected to proteolytic digest and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To achieve maximum sequence coverage of the protein we combined proteolytic digests from four proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, LysC, and subtilisin). This approach resulted in a total sequence coverage of 93.6% and the identification of several phospho-peptides, indicating that bZIP63 is phosphorylated at up to seven serines (S29, S59, S102, S160, S261, S294, and S300) in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Two of these sites—S29 and S300—were also found in a recent phospho-proteomics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Umezawa et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, only three of the seven sites—S29, S294, and S300—were found by tryptic protein digest, underpinning the advantage of alternative proteolytic digests for phospho-peptide identification in targeted proteomics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SnRK1, CDPKs and CKII are potential upstream kinases of bZIP63</title><p>To identify potential upstream kinases of bZIP63, we performed in-gel kinase assays with plant protein extracts from roots of hydroponically grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants or root cell culture using recombinantly expressed bZIP63 as substrate. Root material was chosen because in leaf extracts the large amount of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) interfered with some of the kinase signals and poses a considerable problem during MS-based protein identification. Three strong bands of about 40, 50, and 55 kDa, respectively, were visible on the autoradiogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that at least three kinases can phosphorylate bZIP63 in vitro. These bands were not visible on a gel without substrate, excluding the possibility that they originate from kinase auto-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To reduce the sample complexity and to enrich low abundant bZIP63-binding proteins before kinase identification, we affinity purified plant protein extracts on immobilized bZIP63. The eluted fractions were tested in an in-gel kinase assay for kinase activity towards bZIP63 and loaded on a normal SDS-PAGE gel without substrate for kinase identification. Bands corresponding in molecular weight (MW) to the signal from the in-gel kinase assay were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). In total, 27 protein kinases and kinase complex subunits were identified in four independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). From those, proteins which did not match the expected MW or for which it had been shown experimentally that they are not localized in the nucleus were excluded. Only proteins which were identified in more than one sample with at least one proteotypic peptide were considered to be high confidence candidates, resulting in six protein kinases and two kinase regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). We identified the two main catalytic subunits of SnRK1, AKIN10 and AKIN11, as well as the regulatory subunit SNF4. Several members of the calcium dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family were found, but only CPK3 was identified with high confidence. In addition, two catalytic (CKA1 and CKA2) and one regulatory subunit (CKB1) of casein kinase II (CKII) were found, as well as Casein kinase 1-like protein 2 (CKL2). The SnRK1 kinases, CDPKs, and CKL2, correspond in MW to the two upper bands, while the lower band corresponds to the CKII kinase subunits. As SnRK1 was previously reported to enhance the activity of several C/S1 group bZIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>) and was suggested to be activated under energy starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-González and Sheen, 2008</xref>)—which could explain the observed hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63 in extended night—we focused our further analysis on AKIN10 and AKIN11.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Several different kinases can phosphorylate bZIP63.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In-gel kinase assay with a root protein extract from hydroponically grown wild type plants and bZIP63 as substrate.

In both root and leaf extracts of <italic>akin10</italic> plants one band at the expected MW of AKIN10 nearly disappeared (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 1–3</xref> for characterization of the <italic>akin10</italic> line). As AKIN11 has approximately the same MW as AKIN10, the remaining signal likely originates from AKIN11. In vitro kinase assays, with equal amounts of both kinases, showed that both kinases can phosphorylate bZIP63. However, AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 much stronger than AKIN11 does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Addition of the SnRK1 upstream kinase SnAK2 increased the activity of AKIN10 and AKIN11 about sevenfold (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crozet et al., 2010</xref>), but had no effect on the ratio between the signal intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In vivo interaction assays with the identified SnRK1 complex subunits supported the findings of the kinase assays. In both yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) AKIN10 and the regulatory subunit SNF4 interacted strongly with bZIP63, to a comparable level as measured for the bZIP63 homo-dimer, which was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walter et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, AKIN11 and the two regulatory subunits AKINβ1 and AKINβ2 showed almost no interaction with bZIP63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, it has to be considered that AKIN10 and AKIN11 are part of a trimeric complex including SNF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emanuelle et al., 2015</xref>), which is neglected in these two assays. It is therefore still possible that AKIN11 interacts indirectly with bZIP63 via the regulatory subunit of the SnRK1 complex and plays a minor role in bZIP63 phosphorylation in the plant.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 and interacts with bZIP63 in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In-gel kinase assay with protein extracts from wt and <italic>akin10</italic> plants and bZIP63 as a substrate (top), western blot against AKIN10 (αAKIN10, middle), and Coomassie brilliant blue stain (CBB, bottom).

This shows clearly, that AKIN10 and—to a lower extent—AKIN11 are the major kinases responsible for bZIP63 hyper-phosphorylation under starvation conditions.</p><p>Additional evidence for in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 emerges from a recent phosphoproteomics study in which one of the in vivo phosphorylation sites in bZIP63 (S300) was found to be more abundant in an AKIN10 ox line and less abundant in the ko line after extended night treatment, respectively (Nukarinen et al., unpublished).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>AKIN10 phosphorylates three conserved and functionally important serine residues in bZIP63</title><p>Next, to elucidate which of the seven in vivo phosphorylation sites can be phosphorylated by AKIN10, we performed in vitro kinase assays using the wt version of bZIP63 and different serine to alanine (S/A) mutants as substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). Differences in phosphorylation were observed for proteins with mutations in S29, S294, and S300. In detail, the signal from S29A was strongly decreased in full length bZIP63 and completely gone in the N-terminal peptides that appeared as lower MW degradation products in these assays. The S300A mutation led to an even stronger decrease of the signal, comparable to the S294/300A double mutant. Even though the S294A single mutant showed a similar signal as the wt, all three serines had to be mutated to completely abolish phosphorylation, suggesting that all of them are in vitro targets for AKIN10, with S294 being the weakest.

As the origin of SnRK1 dates back even further, to the common ancestor of plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 2014</xref>), it is likely that phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 poses an ancient and important regulatory mechanism. We therefore set out to test the functional relevance of AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP63. To this end, we tested the transcriptional activity of bZIP63 in protoplast-based promoter activation assays using the <italic>ASN1</italic> or <italic>ProDH</italic> promoter fused to the beta galactosidase (GUS) reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). In both cases, co-transformation of wt bZIP63 and AKIN10 strongly induced reporter gene expression, while transformation of bZIP63 alone was not sufficient for significant induction. Transformation of AKIN10 alone also led to a weak induction of the reporters, which could be explained by the action of endogenous bZIPs. Mutation of S29 or all three AKIN10 target sites on bZIP63 to alanine reduced the reporter activation almost to background level. In contrast, mutation of the two C-terminal serines, S294 and S300, had only a weak negative effect on <italic>ASN1</italic> and no significant effect on <italic>ProDH</italic> activation. Taken together, our data suggest that AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 at up to three conserved sites, namely S29, S294, and S300 and phosphorylation by AKIN10, especially at S29, is crucial for bZIP63 TF activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The AKIN10 target sites play an important role for bZIP63 function in planta</title><p>To determine the impact of bZIP63 phosphorylation in planta, we transformed the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant with genomic constructs of bZIP63 containing either the wt sequence (GY lines), or a S/A mutation of S29, S294, and S300, respectively (GAY lines) with a C-terminal YFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

In contrast, the S/A construct showed only weak phosphorylation (only bands 1 and 3 visible) and most importantly no difference between all tested conditions.

As we did not observe any changes in localization in the bZIP63 mutants and also no change in DNA-binding activity (of the bZIP63 homodimer) towards a C-box motif (GACGTC) as canonical bZIP target site (data not shown), we suspected that the observed effect on transcription would be due to changes in dimerization preferences of bZIP63. Therefore, we tested the effect of AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation on bZIP63 homo- and hetero-dimerization with bZIP1 and bZIP11. Both bZIP1 and bZIP11 are metabolic regulators and mediate transcription of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ProDH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>). In protoplast two-hybrid (P2H) assays, the addition of exogenous AKIN10 resulted in a clear enhancement of dimerization in all cases—homo-dimerization as well as hetero-dimerization with bZIP1 and bZIP11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Note, that the very strong effect observed with bZIP11 in these assays is misleading because bZIP11 is a much stronger activator of transcription as compared to bZIP1 and 63 (see also ‘Discussion’). From that we concluded that the phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 is required for dimerization and set out to test the effect of S/A mutations of the AKIN10 target sites on bZIP63 homo- and hetero-dimerization with bZIP11 where we had observed the strongest effect before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In both cases, the signal was reduced to about 30–40% of the signal obtained from dimerization with wt bZIP63 when S29 or all three serines were mutated to alanine. Mutation of one or two of the C-terminal sites decreased bZIP63 homo-dimerization weakly but had no visible effect on bZIP63-11 dimerization, indicating that these sites play, at most, a minor role in regulation of dimer formation.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.037</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP63 promotes its dimerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Protoplast two-hybrid (P2H) assays.

To increase the phosphorylation efficiency of AKIN10 we included SnAK2 in the reactions. In contrast to bZIP63, none of the S1 group bZIPs were phosphorylated by AKIN10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data indicate that AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP63—especially at S29—strongly enhances its ability to form homo- as well as hetero-dimers.</p><p>To further substantiate the relevance of S29 phosphorylation in vivo, we compared the phosphorylation patterns of the S29/S294/S300A mutant with a S294/S300A mutant in the light and after extended night treatments in the genomic complementation lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Compared to the triple mutant, that did not show any change in the phosphorylation pattern in response to starvation, bZIP63 phosphorylation was clearly increased in the S294/S300A double mutant in the extended night. As S29 is the only AKIN10 target site left in this version, it must indeed be S29 that is phosphorylated by AKIN10 under starvation conditions.</p><p>As we saw that AKIN10-dependent phosphorylation promotes dimerization of bZIP63 with all tested partners we wanted to analyze whether phosphorylation has an effect on the dimerization partner preference. Because protoplast two-hybrid assays only allow to analyze the effect of AKIN10 on a single dimer we set up a multicolor BiFC approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waadt et al., 2008</xref>) in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> leaves with bZIP1 and 11 as alternative interaction partners for bZIP63. For this, we expressed all three bZIPs (1, 11, and 63) from the same plasmid and co-transformed AKIN10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). bZIP11 was fused to CFP<sub>N</sub>, bZIP1 to VENUS<sub>N</sub>, and bZIP63 to CFP<sub>C</sub>. Accordingly, the bZIP63-11 hetero-dimer generates a blue (cyan) signal and the bZIP63-1 hetero-dimer a yellow signal, whereas the bZIP63 homo-dimer cannot be detected. To compare the dimerization preference of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated bZIP63 we used wt and a S29/294/300A mutant of bZIP63. Quantification of the ratio of the VENUS/CFP signal in more than 100 nuclei clearly showed a shift towards the VENUS emission when wt bZIP63 was compared to the S/A mutant. This demonstrates that phosphorylation by AKIN10 triggers the preferential formation of bZIP63-1 over bZIP63-11 dimers in a competitive in vivo assay.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.040</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of bZIP63 shifts its dimerization preferences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multi-color bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in transiently transformed <italic>N. tabacum</italic> leaves to test the effect of bZIP63 phosphorylation on its dimerization preference.

This is in accordance with the sugar/energy-dependent expression of bZIP63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matiolli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kunz et al., 2014</xref>), as well as with the fact that several of its proposed target genes are involved in the low-energy response and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matiolli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Veerabagu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, three members of the S1-group of plant bZIPs—hetero-dimerization partners of bZIP63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehlert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2010</xref>)—have also been linked to energy starvation response and metabolism. Inducible bZIP11 ox lines exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>) and a metabolic profile resembling that of carbon starved plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), while overexpression of bZIP1 and bZIP53 results in enhanced dark-induced senescence and reduced levels of proline and branched-chain amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the bZIP1 ox, bZIP63 ox plants showed increased chlorosis after 9 days of darkness, while the bZIP63 ko displayed a clear stay-green phenotype under these conditions. In contrast, neither the single, nor the double ko of bZIP1 and 53 showed reduced dark-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that other bZIPs can take over the function of bZIP1 in starvation-induced leaf yellowing, while bZIP63 plays a more unique role.</p><p>Looking at primary metabolism, we found that misregulation of bZIP63 expression has a strong effect, especially on amino acids, which was further enhanced under starvation conditions. In line with the finding that bZIP63 is a positive regulator of <italic>ProDH</italic> and <italic>ASN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matiolli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Veerabagu et al., 2014</xref>, and this work: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6C, 7G</xref>) and the changes in proline levels in <italic>bZIP63</italic> mutants reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Veerabagu et al. (2014)</xref>, we measured the strongest differences in proline and the entire glutamate family as well as in aspartate and asparagine levels in the bZIP63 ko and ox. Notably, there is a strong correlation between the amino acid profiles of the bZIP63 and the bZIP1 ox lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>). A similar accumulation of amino acids during dark-induced senescence has frequently been observed and was attributed to enhanced protein degradation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araújo et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly under low carbon conditions or during senescence, alternative energy sources need to be used in plant cells, and the important role of proline and branched-chain amino acids in this process has been highlighted in a number of studies (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabados and Savouré, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szal and Podgórska, 2012</xref>). Thus also the altered amino acid levels could contribute to the observed dark-induced senescence phenotype of the bZIP63 mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>bZIP63 function is regulated by SnRK1-dependent phosphorylation</title><p>We found that bZIP63 is highly phosphorylated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. By applying different proteolytic digests we were able to identify seven in vivo phosphorylated serine residues, distributed all over the protein. While exogenous sucrose decreased the global phosphorylation level of bZIP63, extended night treatment further increased its phosphorylation, thus supporting the idea that bZIP63 plays a role in energy signaling. Moreover, we found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10, which was proposed to be a central regulator of transcription in starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-González and Sheen, 2008</xref>), is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. Therefore, bZIP63 presents the first TF acting as direct target of SnRK1 in the transcriptional energy deprivation response. In vitro, AKIN10 phosphorylated three highly conserved and functionally important residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63—S29, S294, and S300, respectively. Reporter activation assays in protoplasts revealed that these sites—especially S29—are essential for AKIN10-dependent induction of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ProDH</italic> by bZIP63. Remarkably, the phosphorylation patterns of different bZIP63 mutants on Phos-tag gels pointed towards S29 as the main target site for AKIN10 under extended night conditions. The importance of bZIP63 phosphorylation at the SnRK1 target sites for its in planta function was further underlined by complementation of the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant with genomic bZIP63 constructs. Wt, but not a S29/S294/S300A mutant of bZIP63, could complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes. Likewise, also the strong delay in extended night-triggered induction of <italic>ASN1</italic>, <italic>DIN10</italic>, and <italic>ProDH</italic> in <italic>bzip63</italic> plants was complemented with wt bZIP63, but not the (triple) S/A mutant. The relatively small difference in <italic>ProDH</italic> expression in plants, as compared to the protoplast assay, is probably due to redundancy within the C/S1 group bZIPs, as it was shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al. (2011)</xref>, that only ko of multiple members of the C/S1 group leads to a strong reduction in <italic>ProDH</italic> and <italic>ASN1</italic> expression.</p><p>Since the discovery that AKIN10 can activate several members of the C/S1 network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>), it has been speculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-González and Sheen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Usadel et al., 2008</xref>), but never shown experimentally, that they are downstream targets of SnRK1. Our data provide compelling evidence that bZIP63, but none of the S1 group bZIPs, is a bona fide in vivo target of SnRK1 in low-energy signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phosphorylation of bZIP63 alters its dimerization preferences</title><p>Differential dimerization is a well-known mechanism for changing the target recognition site, and thereby the target genes of bZIP TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukada et al., 2011</xref>). For the S1-group bZIP1 is has been shown that dimerization with C-group bZIP10 or bZIP63 affects its in vitro binding to ACGT-based motifs differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). The notion that different C/S1 dimers have different target genes is further supported by a recent transcriptomics study in protoplasts. Overexpression of four C/S1 group bZIPs (bZIP1, bZIP10, bZIP11, and bZIP63), individually or in combination of two, revealed overlapping but distinct gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma, 2012</xref>). This means, that although they regulate a core set of common genes, such as <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ProDH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), different dimers also have distinct functions, and switching of dimerization partners can have a considerable impact on gene expression.</p><p>Our data indicate that dimerization and activity of bZIP63 strongly depend on its phosphorylation status. In general, the dimerization of bZIP63 with bZIP1, bZIP11, and bZIP63, was boosted by AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation. Like in the promoter activation assays, the main influence on dimerization came from S29 phosphorylation, while phosphorylation of S294 and S300 showed a mild effect at most. Incidentally, this enhanced dimerization with bZIP63 would explain why AKIN10 was found to activate the S1 group bZIPs (bZIP1, 2, 11, and 53) in protoplast assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>), although they do not present direct targets of AKIN10.</p><p>At first sight, the phosphorylation triggered boost of dimerization seemed to be strongest for hetero-dimerization with bZIP11. However, it has to be considered that bZIP11 is a very strong activator of transcription as it harbors an activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehlert et al., 2006</xref>) and was recently also shown to recruit the histone acetylation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiste and Droege-Laser, 2014</xref>). The same is not the case for bZIP1 and bZIP63. As the readout of the protoplast two-hybrid interaction assay is transcription-based it is therefore not possible to quantitatively compare the effect of phosphorylation on the formation of different dimers and to draw conclusions about the in vivo dimerization preference. Therefore we used a multi-color BiFC assay with bZIP1 and bZIP11 as alternative partners for bZIP63 to test the effect of bZIP63 phosphorylation by AKIN10 on its dimerization preference. The three bZIPs were co-expressed with AKIN10 in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> leaves and the formation of bZIP63-1 and bZIP63-11 dimers was quantified. Comparison of wt and S/A mutated bZIP63 revealed that, phosphorylation of bZIP63 shifts the dimerization preference from bZIP11 towards bZIP1. This trend fits well to the observation that both TFs are strongly upregulated in the night and extended night, while bZIP11 is downregulated under these conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, increased expression of bZIP63 and bZIP1 under conditions when bZIP63 is phosphorylated might further enhance the observed shift in the dimerization towards bZIP63-1 dimers.</p><p>Based on the data presented in this study, we propose a simplified model for the regulation of bZIP63 dimerization by AKIN10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). When bZIP63 is not phosphorylated, its capacity to dimerize with other bZIPs is rather low. Under starvation conditions, bZIP63 is phosphorylated at S29 by AKIN10, favoring the formation of bZIP63 homo- and specific hetero-dimers, particularly of bZIP63-1 dimers. This ultimately results in the induction of a different set of target genes and thereby mediates the transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism. However, it is clear that in the plant additional factors like bZIP expression, stability and interaction with other components add more complexity to the situation.</p><p>Surprisingly, to date only a small number of papers have reported an influence of phosphorylation on bZIP dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first time that phosphorylation outside the bZIP domain was shown to affect dimerization with different partners in a distinct way. While there are numerous reports on phosphorylation-mediated changes in bZIP activity in animals, plants, and yeast, in many cases the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We therefore believe that this novel mechanism of phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP dimerization partners could play a substantial role in the regulation of bZIP TF activity in all higher organisms, and should be further addressed in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant lines</title><p>The lines ox#2 and ox#3 are bZIP63 ox lines in the Col-0 background, expressing bZIP63.2 with a C-terminal GFP tag under the control of the 35S promoter.

For derivatization, metabolites were first dissolved in 10 µl (2) or 30 µl (7) pyridine containing 40 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride by 90 min incubation at 30°C. Then, 40 µl (2) or 120 µl (7) of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamid (MSTFA; Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany), spiked with 60 µl/ml of an Alkane Standard Mixture C<sub>10</sub>–C<sub>40</sub> (Fluka, Vienna, Austria), were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. GC–MS measurements were carried out on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a LECO Pegasus 4D GCxGC-TOF mass spectrometer (LECO, USA). Injection volume was 1 µl. In the GC step, the initial oven temperature was 70°C, which was held for 1 min, followed by a 9°C/min temperature increase until the final temperature of 350°C was reached, which was held again for 8 min. Metabolites were measured in splitless mode (2 and 7) and alternatively also in split mode with a split ratio of 5 (7). In the MS step the data acquisition rate was set to 20 spectra/s, the detector voltage to 1550 V and the mass range to 40–600 m/z. Raw data were processed with the LECO Chroma-TOF software (LECO, USA). Peak areas were normalized to the area of the internal standard and to the fresh weight before statistical analysis. Outliers, as determined by Grubb's test, were removed from the dataset. For Hierarchical clustering, log-2 transformed fold change values were imported into MeV (MultiExperimentViewer, version 4.9.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saeed et al., 2003</xref>) and clustering was done using the standard settings with gene tree optimization, Pearson correlation, and average linkage clustering. For the PCA plot, normalized data were imported into R (RStudio, version 0.98.507), missing values were replaced with the k nearest neighbor (knn) method using the ‘impute.knn()’ function and data were Z-transformed.

Bands of interest were then excised from Coomassie-stained gels and gel sections were chopped, washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC, pH 8.5), and dried with acetonitrile (ACN). Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating in 200 µl of 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 56°C. DTT was washed off and cysteines were alkylated by incubation with 100 µl of 54 mM iodoacetamide for 20 min at RT in the dark. Gel pieces were dried with ACN, then swollen in 10 ng/µl trypsin (recombinant, proteomics grade, Roche, Vienna, Austria) in 50 mM ABC and incubated over night at 37°C. For higher sequence coverage of bZIP63 alternative proteases were used: LysC (MS grade, WAKO, Neuss, Germany) at 37°C overnight, subtilisin (Sigma–Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) at 37°C for 0.5–2 hr, chymotrypsin (sequencing grade, Roche, Vienna, Austria) at 25°C for 4 hr. Digestion was stopped by adding formic acid to a final concentration of approximately 1% and peptides were extracted by sonication. Peptides were separated on an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system or on a U3000 nano HPLC (both Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Digests were loaded on a trapping column (PepMap C18, 5 µm particle size, 300 μm i.d. × 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and separated on an analytical column (PepMap C18, 3 μm, 75 μm i.d. × 150 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by applying a 60 min linear gradient from 2.5% up to 40% ACN with 0.1% formic acid, followed by a washing step with 80% ACN and 10% trifluoroethanol (TFE) on the U3000 HPLC. The UltiMate 3000 HPLC was directly coupled to a linear ion trap (LTQ, Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was operated in a data-dependent MS3 method for the phosphorylation analysis. One full scan (m/z: 450–1600) was followed by maximal 4 MS/MS scans. If in the MS/MS scan a fragment corresponding to a neutral loss from the precursor of 98, 49, or 32 Th was observed among the top 8 peaks, a MS3 scan was triggered. Fragmentation energy was set at 35%, Q-value at 0.25, and the activation time at 30 ms. High resolution measurements were acquired on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Proxeon, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The electrospray voltage was set to 1500 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode: 1 full scan (m/z: 350–1800, resolution 60,000) with lock mass enabled was followed by maximal 12 MS/MS scans. The lock mass was set at the signal of polydimethylcyclosiloxane at m/z 445.120025. Monoisotopic precursor selection was on, precursors with charge state 1 were excluded from fragmentation.

Subsequently, proteins were eluted from the column by repeated washing with 5 ml cold protein extraction buffer with increasing salt concentrations, and concentrated with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore). 8–20 µg total protein extracts and up to 40 µg affinity purified proteins were loaded on standard SDS PAGE gels containing 1 mg/ml substrate (6× His-bZIP63) in the separating gel and run at 4°C with 20 mA per gel. The gel was then incubated 3 times for 20 min, respectively, at room temperature in each of the following buffers: wash buffer I (50 mM TrisCl, 20% isopropanol, pH 8), wash buffer II (50 mM TrisCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 8), and denaturation buffer (50 mM TrisCl, 1 mM DTT, 6 M guanidinium HCl, pH 8). Subsequently, the gel was incubated in renaturation buffer (50 mM TrisCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8) at 4°C for 12–18 hr. In this period, the buffer was exchanged 10 times after at least 30 min. After renaturation, the gel was incubated 2 times for 30 min, respectively, in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 500 µM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), followed by 30 min incubation in kinase reaction solution (kinase buffer containing 50 µM ATP and 100 µCi γ-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled ATP). Finally, the gel was washed 2 times for 15 min, respectively, in 5% TCA and several times in 5% TCA containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate, until the wash solution was only weakly radioactive. The dried gels were exposed on a Storage Phosphor Screen and the signal was recorded on a Typhoon 8600 (GE Healthcare, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Y2H assay</title><p><italic>AKIN10.1/3</italic>, <italic>AKIN11.1/2</italic>, <italic>AKINβ1</italic>, <italic>AKINβ2</italic>, <italic>SNF4</italic>, and <italic>bZIP63.2</italic> were amplified from cDNA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for primers) and cloned ApaI/NotI or NcoI/NotI into pBTM117 and <italic>bZIP63.2</italic> was cloned into pACTIIJ to generate N-terminal fusions with the LexA-BD and the GAL4-AD, respectively.

The cells were resuspended in a small volume and plated on SD medium without Leu and Trp to select for successful transformation. Single colonies were inoculated in SD medium without Leu and Trp and proteins were extracted from 2 ml of an over-night culture. The yeast cells were resuspended in 200 µl enzyme lysis buffer (25 mM TrisCl, 20 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, pH 7.5), 200 µl glass beads (0.4–0.6 mm diameter) were added, the cells were frozen in N<sub>2</sub>, thawed, and broken by vigorous shaking on a Vibrax at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant after 10 min centrifugation was transferred to a fresh tube and kept on ice. The protein concentration of the extract was determined by Bradford assay.

To generate BiFC plasmids for ApaI/NotI and NcoI/NotI cloning, CPK3, harboring XbaI, NcoI, and ApaI (for plasmids with MCS [multi cloning site] 1) or ApaI and NcoI (for plasmids with MCS 2) in the terminus and NotI and SmaI in the C-terminus was generated by PCR from cDNA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for primers). It was then cloned XbaI/SmaI or ApaI/SmaI into the different BiFC casettes in pUC19 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waadt et al. (2008)</xref>.

For transformation, 5 ml agrobacterium overnight cultures were filled to 50 ml with fresh LB medium containing 50 µg/ml Kanamycin and 10 µg/ml Gentamicin and grown for 4 hr at 30°C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3500×<italic>g</italic>, resuspended in LB containing 150 µM acetosyringone, and grown for another 2 hr. The cultures were then pelleted again and resuspended in 5% sucrose solution to reach a final OD600 of 2. For co-infiltration, equal volumes of agrobacteria suspensions, containing the respective constructs, were mixed and infiltrated into the leaves of 5 week-old plants. 48 hr after infiltration equally sized leaf sections were analyzed for their CFP fluorescence signal with an LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) and the corresponding ZEN software (Zeiss). The same settings were used for each construct to allow comparison of the signal intensities. To verify that the fusion proteins were expressed and to determine the relative amount of each interaction partner, proteins were extracted from the leaf sections used for microscopy and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against the Flag (N-terminal CFP moiety) and HA (C-terminal CFP moiety) epitopes.</p><p>Multi-color BiFC was done as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waadt et al. (2008)</xref> with some modifications. bZIP11 fused to the N-terminal moiety of CFP (CFP-N), bZIP1 fused to the N-terminal moiety of VENUS (VENUS-N), and bZIP63 (wt or S29/294/300A) fused to the C-terminal moiety of CFP (CFP-C) were expressed from one plasmid to have co-expression at equal amounts in all transformed cells (for a scheme of the construct see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). To generate the construct, bZIP1 and bZIP11 were first amplified from cDNA by PCR (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for primers) and cloned ApaI/NotI into pBIN19 containing a c-terminal fusion of CFP-C and CFP-N, respectively (plasmids described above). From there, 35S::bZIP1 was cloned HindIII/NotI into pUC19 containing CPK3 with a c-terminal VENUS-N fusion (described above) to exchange the shorter 35S primer in the VENUS construct. Then, the two cassettes including the 35S promoter, bZIP1 or 11 and the VENUS-N or CFP-N tag were amplified by PCR introducing KpnI/HindII in the front and BamHI in the back of the bZIP1 cassette and BamHI in the front and HindIII in the back of the bZIP11 cassette (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for primers). The PCR products were ligated into pCRBlunt (Invitrogen, Germany) and the bZIP1 cassette was then cloned KpnI/BamHI in front of the bZIP11 cassette. Finally, the combined cassette with bZIP1 and 11 was cloned HindII into pBIN19 containing bZIP63 wt or S29/294/300A (mutated by PCR) with an n-terminal CFP-C fusion. AKIN10 was amplified from cDNA by PCR (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for primers) and cloned ApaI/NotI into pBIN19 containing a c-terminal mCherry tag. <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> (AGL1 strain) was transformed with the resulting plasmids by electroporation and further used for transient transformation of tobacco (<italic>N. tabacum</italic>) leaf <italic>epidermis</italic> as described above. 48 hr after infiltration equally sized leaf sections were analyzed for their VENUS, CFP, and mCherry fluorescence signal with a TCS SP5 DM-6000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica) and the corresponding Leica software. CFP, VENUS, and mCherry were excited with 458 nm (Ar laser), 514 nm (Ar laser), and 574 nm (white light laser), respectively. The fluorescence was detected at 461–495 nm, 520–550 nm, and 600–615 nm, respectively. To avoid bleed-through of the CFP signal into the VENUS channel CFP and VENUS were excited and detected separately. Pictures were taken with a 20× air objective and the same settings for both combinations (wt bZIP63 and S29/294/300A). The pinhole was set to 1.5. To determine the relative VENUS/CFP signal ratio, images were processed in the LasX software from Leica. Nuclei showing a CFP/VENUS as well as mCherry signal were selected and the signal intensity was determined with the histogram tool. For each nucleus a ratio of the background corrected pixel sum from VENUS and CFP was built. All values for one leaf were divided by the median of the ratio from the bZIP63 S29/294/300A construct to allow comparison between experiments. In total, six leaves from two infiltrations were analyzed with similar results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)</title><p>2 week-old GY9 plants were infiltrated (<italic>akin10/11</italic>) or not (control) with an <italic>AKIN10-AKIN11</italic> silencing construct according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Burch-Smith et al.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviews acknowledge the overall quality of your work, questions remain about the validity of one of the major tools used in your study (the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant). As the use of this mutant is crucial for major conclusions of your work, comprehensive characterization of this mutant is required before further consideration of your submission. We would welcome re-reviewing this manuscript if the major concerns listed in the reviews below were convincingly addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Plant SnRK1 kinases are structural and functional homologs of yeast Snf1 and animal AMP-activated kinases that play a central role in sensing energy depletion and maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. In this paper, a multinational consortium set out to demonstrate that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK1, carrying the AKIN10 catalytic subunit, phosphorylates in vivo the C-group bZIP63 transcription factor. bZIP63 has been identified to control transcription of some SnRK1-regulated target genes, involving ASPARGINE SYNTHASE 1 (<italic>ASN1</italic>/<italic>DIN6</italic>), PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE (<italic>PDH1</italic>/<italic>PRODH</italic>), RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE (<italic>DIN10</italic>) and SENESCENCE 1 (<italic>SEN1</italic>). To justify the statements in the Abstract and Introduction that bZIP63 is a key regulator of starvation response, the paper starts with limited characterization of a <italic>bzip63</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant, and two bZIP63-ox overexpression lines.</p><p>The authors use a phenotypic assay by placing plants for 9 days into the dark and monitoring rosette leaf senescence/bleaching by ImageJ scanning of green versus bleached/yellow leaf areas. Whereas in wild type (wt) the first two leaves (numbered 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) show bleaching, they remain greenish in the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant (defined as stay-green phenotype), and 3-5 more leaves undergo bleaching in the bZIP63-ox plants, suggesting enhanced senescence response.</p><p>When grown in the light, the <italic>bzip63</italic> and bZIP63-ox plants do not differ from wt.</p><p>Next, the authors compare metabolites entering or derived from glycolysis and citrate cycle in light-grown (L) and dark exposed (elongated night, EN) plants and find that the levels of “most” free amino acids is increased in the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant and decreased in bZIP63-ox plants, whereas sugar levels are stated to show an opposite trend of changes. Based on these data the authors conclude that bZIP63 is a key regulator of starvation responses (see Abstract and Introduction).</p><p>When inspecting the metabolite profiling data, it is clear that the discussion of the results is rather superficial. For example, raffinose levels are decreased, whereas trehalose levels are increased in both mutant and ox lines, similarly to glucose in the dark. In general, we do not learn much from the metabolomics data. The actual conclusion is that “misregulation of bZIP63” (in the subsection “bZIP63 controls dark induced senescence and primary metabolism”) has an effect on metabolism.</p><p>On the other hand, we do not find any additional data (such as quantitative measurement of chlorophyll levels, degradation products, or other senescence markers, such as enzymes or transcripts), which would provide a further insight documenting how alteration of bZIP63 levels modulate the starvation-induced and/or senescence responses. Whether 9 days of dark treatment can be considered as starvation or general stress response remains a matter of discussion.</p><p>By performing 2D and Phos-tag gel westerns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the authors detect multiple phosphorylated (lambda phosphatase sensitive) isoforms of bZIP63-GFP immunoprecipitated from overexpressing plants. On the Phos-tag gel, they show a rather weak band termed “supershift” of bZIP63, which appears in dark-treated plants, and detect somewhat weaker bZIP63-GFP bands with altered pattern plants grown with 1% sucrose. They use the latter result, without explicit explanation or demonstration, to suggest that the observed phosphorylation changes reflect inhibition of SnRK1 by 1% sucrose.</p><p>By mass spectrometry analysis, seven phosphorylated residues were then identified in the immonoprecipitated bZIP63-GFP protein. Subsequent in-gel kinase tests indicate that bZIP63 is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases showing apparent molecular masses of 50-60 and 35-38 kDa. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it should be clearly indicated that the plant extract used for in-gel kinase assays derived from hydroponic root cultures (see “Kinase assays”, third paragraph), along with the conditions used for root culture in the case of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p>To isolate the kinases detected in the in-gel assay, GST-bZIP63 was immobilized on GST-Sepharose and plant protein extracts made from root cultures or root-derived cell suspension (as the latter is maintained in the presence of sucrose, please specify which of these sample is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were subjected to affinity binding followed by NaCl elution. The eluted proteins resolved between 30 and 60 kDa were isolated from in-gel kinase PAGE (if I understood well), and identified by mass spectrometry. From 28 candidates only 7 kinases (including the SnRK1 catalytic AKIN10, AKIN11 and activating subunit SNF4, as well as casein kinase subunits CKA1, CKA2, CKB1 and CKL2) were identified by 2-9 peptides. It should be noted in the Materials and methods how the excess of His6-bZIP63 was filtrated out during the mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>In addition, it would be worth knowing whether the GST-alone matrix had retained any of these kinases.</p><p>Furthermore, αAKIN10 western showing an enrichment of AKIN10 on the GST-bZIP63 matrix versus GST would be more convincing.</p><p>From here on, the authors concentrate on the analysis of bZIP63 phosphorylation by the SnRK1 catalytic subunits AKIN10, which according to Baena-Gonzalez et al. and Jossier et al. (Plant J 59: 316, 2009), is at least 10-20 times more active/abundant compared to its homolog AKIN11 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> illustrates that GST-AKIN11 purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> also phosphorylates bZIP63 less efficiently compared to GST-AKIN10 in vitro. It is strange that no autophosphorylation of AKIN10 was ever detected by the authors either in normal or in-gel kinase assays. Any explanation?</p><p>As a key argument, the authors use the <italic>akin10</italic> GABI_579E09 T-DNA insertion mutant to demonstrate that AKIN10 is indeed responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63. Unfortunately, according to the reviewer's knowledge, this mutant has not yet been characterized by others, so, to a certain extent, this must be performed by the authors in this paper.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, they show that one of the phosphorylated bZIP63 bands around 55-57 kDa is missing in their in-gel kinase assay with <italic>akin10</italic> mutant extracts, and they fail to detect AKIN10 by western with the Agrisera αAKIN10 antibody in roots, but observe a lower Mw weakly cross-reacting protein band in leaf extracts. According to these results, the GABI_579E09 insertion mutant appears to produce no immunologically detectable AKIN10. Yet, the authors could successfully cultivate the mutant, which means that it must be fertile. If AKIN10 is a central regulator of starvation responses, and shows an order of magnitude higher activity compared to AKIN11 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, based on the published striking AKIN10 RNAi senescence phenotype by Bhaena-Gonzalez et al., one would expect a dramatic growth phenotype. Consequently, it is absolutely necessary to show the phenotype of the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant both in the light and dark that we can compare that to that of the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant.</p><p>Furthermore, the analysis of transcription of bZIP63 target genes should provide further clear evidence that post-translational regulation of bZIP63 is indeed impaired in the GABI_579E09 T-DNA insertion mutant. This is because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> does not really show a very convincing change in the Phos-tag pattern of phosphorylated bZIP63 despite a lower level of “supershift” indicated by asterisks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and Figure 4–figure supplement 3).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C to D</xref> show yeast 2-hybrid and Agrobacterium infiltrated <italic>N. tabacum</italic> protein-protein interaction assays indicating that that unlike AKIN11, the AKIN10 catalytic and SNF4 activating subunits of SnRK1 interact with bZIP63. Given the high level of amino acid homology between AKIN10 and AKIN11, it is surprising that bZIP63 fails to bind AKIN11 and provide a possible hint about the location of possible interaction sites. Did you map these?</p><p>On the other hand, it is remarkable that the kinase-substrate interaction is so strong that this can be clearly detected by both assays. However, as these are heterologous assays based on overexpression of proteins, it is absolutely necessary to present co-immunoprecipitation data using the later described bZIP63 GENE construct (and not 35S ox lines) and αAKIN10 western from wt and <italic>akin10</italic> mutant plants.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, the putative upstream activating kinase SnAK2 enhances the activity of AKIN10 (and may be that of AKIN11). SnAK2 is supposed to phosphorylate the T-loop of both AKIN10 and AKIN11. Yet, we do not see enhanced phosphorylation of GST-AKIN10/11 in this figure. Any explanation?</p><p>As GST-AKIN10/11, GST-bZIP63 and GST-SnAK2 have closely similar masses, it would be necessary to resolve them in a lower % of SDS-PAGE.</p><p>In vitro phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 and AKIN11 looks convincing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>, so this approach should have provided a simple means to determine both AKIN10 and AKIN11 phosphorylation sites comparatively in bZIP63 by mass spectrometry. Yet, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, a complicated intuitive combination of alanine replacements of in vivo observed seven serine phosphorylation sites is used for demonstration that GST-AKIN10 probably phosphorylates only S29, S294 and S300 residues of bZIP63.</p><p>The referred “consensus SnRK1 sites” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> require a corresponding reference either in the text or figure legend.</p><p>The promoter activation assays in protoplast support the conclusion that S29 is the critical AKIN10 phosphorylation site, but in combination with the S294A and S300A amino acid exchanges, AKIN10-S29A shows lower transactivation of <italic>ASN1</italic>/<italic>DIN6-GUS</italic> and <italic>ProDH-GUS</italic> reporters. Whereas sequential phosphorylation might indeed trigger threshold-dependent conformational change of TFs, it is premature to conclude anything about possible order of phosphorylation sites (in the subsection “AKIN10 phosphorylates three conserved and functionally important serine residues in bZIP63”).</p><p>In the subsection “The AKIN10 target sites play an important role for bZIP63 function in planta” it is stated that: “The phosphorylation status of the wt construct after 6h of light and extended night and in the presence or absence of sugar was similar to the one observed in ox#3 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1E</xref>).” Concerning the reproducibility and similarity of Phos-tag gels, would it be possible to run on the same gel the reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and/or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, as well as Figure 4–figure supplement 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1E</xref>, to have an idea about the identity/mobility of phosphorylated bands in the respective reactions? Probably, it would also be beneficial to compare the Phos-tag assays on the same gel with the reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>. This would be necessary because the Phos-tag gel depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> looks dramatically different for the GY11 line in L and EN compared to the 35S:bZIP63-GFP line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (i.e., despite the authors' statement).</p><p>In the same subsection, I do not understand the logic of the following sentence: “Notably, hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63 in the extended night was even stronger in the GY lines than in ox#3, probably due to lower bZIP63 expression.” Do the authors suggest that AKIN10 activity is limiting in terms of bZIP63 phosphorylation even if AKIN10 was supposed to be activated by extended night?</p><p>With the limitations mentioned above concerning the necessary parameters of <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant characterization, the lack of complementation by the triple S/A <italic>bZIP63</italic> mutant gene is documented. As the mutant gene constructs were generated by PCR of 2+xkb genomic DNA fragments, the Materials and methods should mention that all constructs were verified by sequencing.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, it is rather surprising that the GY11 wt complementing line shows significantly higher induction of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>DIN10</italic>. In the fold-induction curve and column diagram to the right, the standard error of Ws-2 is huge at 4h of EN, thus no significant difference between wt and <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant can be claimed. In this figure part, either the curves shown to the left should include all four samples (Ws-2, <italic>bzip63</italic>, GY11 and GAY14) or all samples at the four time points should be presented as column diagrams. Given the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, I wonder why did the authors use the low expressing GY11 line for comparison with GAY14. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1C</xref> it is also apparent that the GAY4 line shows no expression of triple S/A mutant bZIP63-YFP, so only one <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant transformed with the triple phosphor-site mutant of bZIP63 was analysed.</p><p>Ehlert et al. reported that, when overexpressed in plant protoplasts, bZIP63 can heterodimerize with members of the S-group, and in those assays bZIP63 homodimers were barely detectable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al. (2010)</xref> reported later that bZIP63 also interacts with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> response regulator ARR18 involved in cytokinin signaling, whereas alone (i.e. by interacting with S-group partners in heterodimers), bZIP63 functions as negative regulator of osmotic stress responses and seed germination.</p><p>Several heterodimerization partners of bZIP63 are well characterized in terms of their transcription regulatory targets. Therefore, it is apparent that their regulatory functions might be modified by bZIP63, where heterodimerization capability of bZIP63 could be controlled post-translationally, e.g. by phosphorylation through SnRK1 and potentially other protein kinases. This idea should be introduced clearly, with some necessary references to the functions of suspected bZIP63 dimerization partners at the beginning of the manuscript and discussed in this term at the end. For example, the observed effect of bzip63 mutation on the levels of free amino acids could be related to the function of its heterodimerization partner bZIP1. So, probably citing a recent paper from Para et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 111: 10371, 2014) may be helpful for discussion of metabolite changes observed in the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant.</p><p>Evidently, the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutation could influence the function of bZIP1, i.e. if we assumed that the bZIP1 functions as heterodimer with bZIP63. It is therefore interesting that overexpression of AKIN10 in protoplasts has only a slight effect on heterodimerization of overexpressed Gal-AD-bZIP1 and Gal-BD-bZIP63. While this artificial protoplast dimerization assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicates over 60-fold enhancement of Gal-AD-bZIP11+Gal-BD-bZIP63 dimerization, at the level of GAL-UAS4:GUS reporter, about 15-fold increase is observed, which is reduced to about 2-3-fold by triple mutation of the identified S29/S294/S300 bZIP63 phoshorylation sites. In case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C, I</xref> could not fully understand why the authors used two different (i.e. GAL-UAS4:GUS and GAL-UAS4:LUC) reporters in the dimerization and reporter activation assays. This correlative evidence between the dimerization and reporter activation assay should definitely be strengthened by performing similar dimerization assays with bZIP63 carrying the S29A/S294/S300 phospho-site replacements. This appears to be obligatory.</p><p>Although the Discussion takes care to announce that “to our knowledge this is the first time that phosphorylation outside the bZIP domain was shown to affect dimerization with different partners in a distinct way”, it is rather flat. Somewhere, it should mention that the current study did not answer the question of whether the observed phosphorylation sites would modify the cellular location (i.e. nuclear import) and stability of bZIP63, in addition to its heterodimerization, which should be anyhow confirmed by co-IP studies using native gene constructs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the majority of the Discussion includes high-flying general statements, such as, “Here we show that bZIP63 plays an important role in the energy starvation response and metabolic regulation…”. If this is so, the reader will ask whether transcription of bZIP63 and its heterodimerization partners is controlled by AKIN10 and is altered in the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant (i.e. a necessary but missing control).</p><p>Can the enhanced senescence caused by bZIP63-ox compensated by glucose or sucrose supply? Is there any evidence for enhanced ROS production in the bZIP63-ox lines or change or red-ox regulation in the <italic>bzip63</italic> mutant?</p><p>“We measured strong differences in proline and asparagine levels in the bZIP63 ko and ox […] like altered carbon or nitrogen assimilation or protein turnover” (in the subsection “bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator in the starvation response”). So, how would bZIP63 control these mechanisms? Through controlling genes involved in N or C signaling or uptake?</p><p>You say: “We found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10, which was proposed to be a central regulator of transcription in starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-Gonzalez and Sheen, 2008</xref>), is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. Therefore, bZIP63 presents the first TF acting as direct target of SnRK1 in the transcriptional energy deprivation response” (in subsection “bZIP63 function is regulated by SnRK1-dependent phosphorylation”). Yes, but the hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63 under extended night (called “starvation”, though it was 9 days of dark treatment) caused the appearance of only a weak band marked by asterisks on the images of Phos-tag gels, which represents the only evidence supporting this statement.</p><p>In the same subsection, you state: “Reporter activation assays in protoplasts revealed that these (i.e., AKIN10 phosophorylation) sites are essential for AKIN10-dependent induction of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ProDH</italic> by bZIP63”. This may be, but AKIN10 alone also activates these reporter genes, probably through other factors, which according to this paper are probably not the S-group bZIPs (i.e. as they appear not to be phosphorylated by AKIN10). It would be fair to mention this somewhere.</p><p>Still in the same subsection, the authors say: “The relatively small difference in <italic>ProDH</italic> expression in plants, as compared to the protoplast assay, is probably due to redundancy within the C/S1 group bZIPs…”. Does this sentence predict that other C-group bZIPs could be SnRK1 substrates? Would it be not necessary to discuss potential conservation of observed AKIN10 sites in other bZIPs?</p><p>In the same part of the text, the authors state: “Our data provide compelling evidence that bZIP63, but none of the S1 group bZIPs, is a bona fide in vivo target of SnRK1 in low energy signaling.” This should clearly be demonstrated by identical Phos-tag gel patterns of bZIP63 isolated from sucrose-treated or <italic>akin10</italic> mutant plants and that of the bZIP63 S29A/S294A/S300A protein obtained from <italic>bzip63</italic> plus/minus sugar or the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Mair et al. report the function of bZIP63 as a key regulator in plant starvation response. Furthermore, using a combination of biochemical and omics approaches, the authors demonstrate that bZIP63 is regulated by protein phosphorylation and the kinase involved is AKIN10, an AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 member. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 changed its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately plant primary metabolism.</p><p>This report identifies a missing link between energy sensing and transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism in plants under starvation conditions. The topic is of interest to a wide audience. The data are of high quality, clearly laid out, and mostly convincing. I only have one suggestion that should clarify the Phos-tag results and further enhance the quality of the paper:</p><p>Phos-tag analysis of in vitro phosphorylated bZIP63 samples allows the attribution of each shifted band to the phosphorylation of a specific Ser residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the same analyses of in vivo samples showed variable banding patterns that are not easy to reconcile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, Figure 4–figure supplement 3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This could be a result of phosphorylation of bZIP63 by other kinase(s) on S59, S102, S160, and S261, four sites that are not phosphorylatable by AKIN10. I would suggest the authors to determine whether the mutation of these four Ser residues to Ala will affect the function of bZIP63. If it does, the data would reveal that bZIP63 is regulated by multiple kinase pathways to carry out its function in the energy transition response. If it does not, the data would demonstrate that AKIN10-phosphorylation on S29, S294 and S300 is the major phosphorylation event that controls the activity of bZIP63. By performing Phos-tag analysis of bZIP63-S59A/S102A/S160A/S261A, the authors can provide more convincing results about the in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 kinase.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors demonstrate low energy stress-dependent SnRK-catalyzed direct phosphorylation of bZIP63 transcription factor as prerequisite for differential bZIP homo/hetero dimerization. Their comprehensive clear data provide for the first time mechanistic insight in how transcriptional reprogramming of gene subsets in a given pathway is driven by a conditional differential hetero/homodimerization of key transcriptional regulators.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, clear in its argumentation, and statements are well backed by an almost overly thorough analysis and a large amount of data of high quality. I would like to comment on two aspects:</p><p>1) Because SnRK and bZIP are well known proteins in plant biology, and because phosphorylation of bZIPs has been reported before, the true novelty in the manuscript is in my opinion the phosphorylation-dependent differential dimerization leading potentially to a change in transcriptional specificity plus activity toward distinct target genes (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> – model). Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> rely on a protoplast two-hybrid assay, allowing a transcriptional readout (equal protein amount in transfected cells has not been included here). To more prominently support the key message of the manuscript will have to address:</p><p>i) Differential dimerization on protein level: conducting for example transient co-localization studies based on (multi-color) fluorescent proteins/BiFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waadt et al., 2008</xref>), or using biochemical means to compare phosphorylation-dependent bZPI63/bZIP63 with bZIP63/bZIP11 formation, and in case even include bZIP S29D (or other) phospho-mimic constructs.</p><p>ii) Show differential target gene specificity: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> contains as marker for transcriptional activity a gene which is target to all three bZIPs (1, 11, 63). Even more convincing will be phosphorylation/heterodimerization-dependent activity toward a distinct bZIP11- or bZIP63-controlled gene, respectively.</p><p>2) The primary identification of “in vivo” phosphorylation sites is conducted on bZIP-GFP overexpressing lines on material harvested in both light and prolonged dark. Therefore, basic constitutive bZIP phosphorylation (and the involvement of other kinases than AKIN10) cannot be excluded. Ideally, one may ask for the degree of conditional in vivo phosphorylation (in particular at S29 of endogenous bZIP) performing MRM/SRM phosphoproteomics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We have carefully read the reviewer’s comments and found that although some points that are mentioned are valid and we agree that these have to be addressed, we also saw that some parts of our manuscript were not written clearly enough and have been misunderstood.

This was tested by PCR using gene‐specific primers against the flanking region of the second insertion but no insertion could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1D</xref>).</p><p>We checked the expression level of AKIN10 protein by Western blotting using two antibodies: firstly the AKIN10 specific antibody from Agrisera (AS 10919), and secondly an antibody against the phosphorylated T‐loop threonine (T172) of AMPKα, the mammalian AKIN10 ortholog (Cell Signaling #2531), that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated T‐loop threonine in AKIN10 and AKIN11 (T175 and T176, respectively; Baena‐González et al., 2007). The position of the peptide recognized by each antibody is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response 1A</xref>.

The anti Thr 172 antibody detects a double band of 61 and 58 kDa in the wt, and only the lower band (58 kDa = AKIN11) in the <italic>akin10</italic> line. These data were completely independently obtained in the Baena‐ Gonzalez lab as well as in our lab.</p><p>As reviewer 1 raised also concerns regarding a potential growth phenotype of the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant, we include here also a phenotypical growth analysis of the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response 1F and 1G</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1F</xref> shows that the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant displays normal growth with respect to leaf number, fresh and dry weight as well as water content.

As reviewer 1 pointed out, so far no transcription factor has rigorously been shown to represent a direct phosphorylation target of SnRK1 in plants. Therefore, we think that the phos‐tag data, which show the in vivo phosphorylation status of bZIP63, are crucial for this manuscript and we feel that we need to explain these better in different conditions, treatments and of AKIN10.</p><p>In order to better illustrate the different phosphorylation status and to allow a better comparison of the different experiments, we prepared a figure that shows a direct comparison of all phos‐tag gels from the different experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><p>As control for the non‐phosphorylated bZIP63, the recombinant protein is shown in the very left panel. For all other samples we have now labelled the bands from 1‐7 according to an increase in their phosphorylation status. This is the maximum of different isoforms we could identify on different phos‐tag gels and corresponds to the seven identified in vivo phosphorylation sites from the combined MS analyses. Of course, not all isoforms are always visible on the gel as they depend on the phosphorylation level, and furthermore, the phosphorylation status is also highly dynamic, which complicates the picture. Nevertheless, the main point we want to make in the manuscript – and we think this is clearly evident from the figures – is that the level of bZIP63 phosphorylation changes in response to the different treatments and is furthermore depending on AKIN10.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05828.046</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p>Comparison of bZIP63 phosphorylation on phos‐tag gels in response to different treatments and in different genetic backgrounds.

Recombinant bZIP63‐YFP is shown as a control for non‐phosphorylated bZIP63. On the left, phosphorylation of bZIP63 after 6h of light (L) or extended night (EN) is shown. Proteins were extracted from whole rosettes of 5 week‐old plants grown on soil in a 12h/12h light/dark cycle. On the right, phosphorylation of bZIP63 in response to sugar treatment is depicted. Seedlings were grown for 1 week in liquid ½ MS in the presence of 0.5% sucrose, followed by 1 week without sucrose. They were then treated with 6h of EN in the presence (+) or absence (‐) of 1% sucrose and harvested.

However, the majority of bZIP63 is present in bands 5 and 6. In response to starvation (6 hrs extended night EN), band 7 appears as higher phosphorylated form. This new band 7 is barely detectable in the EN samples from the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant. This might be considered as a small difference but these data should be seen in the overall context. In the genomic complementation, lines bZIP63 are almost exclusively detected in bands 5 and 6 in the light (so the same as before), and now most of the bZIP63 protein is shifted to the most phosphorylated form in band 7 in the extended night (EN). Strikingly, in the line complemented with the version of bZIP63 in which all three AKIN10 target sites are mutated to an alanine (S/A), ZIP63 is detected only in the bands 1 and 2 (so almost non‐phosphorylated) under all conditions. This makes clear that 1) the 3 mutated sites are the main in vivo phosphorylation sites and 2) the increased phosphorylation in EN happens at one of these sites.</p><p>As reviewer 1 pointed out, the band pattern in this line (GAY14) is not the same as in the <italic>akin10</italic> line. This is indeed true, however, considering again that we identified more than one kinase as potential upstream regulators of bZIP63 this is not surprising and does <italic>not</italic> mean that AKIN10 does not phosphorylate bZIP63 in vivo. As mentioned before, one likely explanation for the differences in phosphorylation is that AKIN11 might take over part of the function of AKIN10 in the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant. This would also explain the lack of a strong phenotype in the <italic>akin10</italic> line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Baena-González et al., 2007) compared to the <italic>akin10 akin11</italic> double ko. Although AKIN11 does not interact well with bZIP63 in the Y2H and BiFC assays, it might still interact with bZIP63 via SNF4 and form a stable complex in vivo. Moreover, other kinases (like the identified CKII or CDPKs) could also phosphorylate one or more of the three target sites of AKIN10. We will discuss this aspect more clearly in a revised version.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Plant SnRK1 kinases are structural and functional homologs of yeast Snf1 and animal AMP-activated kinases that play a central role in sensing energy depletion and maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. In this paper a multinational consortium set out to demonstrate that Arabidopsis SnRK1, carrying the AKIN10 catalytic subunit, phosphorylates in vivo the C-group bZIP63 transcription factor. bZIP63 has been identified to control transcription of some SnRK1-regulated target genes, involving ASPARGINE SYNTHASE 1 (ASN1/DIN6), PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE (PDH1/PRODH), RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE (DIN10) and SENESCENCE 1 (SEN1). To justify the statements in the Abstract and Introduction that bZIP63 is a key regulator of starvation response, the paper starts with limited characterization of a bzip63 T-DNA insertion mutant, and two bZIP63-ox overexpression lines.</italic></p><p>Molecular characterization and description of the <italic>bZIP63</italic> ko and ox lines was provided in Figure 6–figure supplement 6A-C as well as in the Methods section on plant lines in the previous version of the manuscript. To make the information more accessible, we moved the characterization of the plant lines to a new figure in the beginning of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) and included some additional information on the characterization of the <italic>bzip63</italic> line, as well as some plant pictures.</p><p>Furthermore, we have now also included a number of different assays to clearly show, that the observed phenotype is indeed dark-induced senescence (DIS) caused by energy depletion (see qPCR data) and that this phenotype can be rescued by addition of sugar.</p><p><italic>The authors use a phenotypic assay by placing plants for 9 days into the dark and monitoring rosette leaf senescence/bleaching by ImageJ scanning of green versus bleached/yellow leaf areas.

As indicated in the text, all leaves used for senescence analysis were <italic>true</italic> leaves. Cotyledons were not included. Therefore the leaves numbered with 3 and 4 are not leaf 1 and 2 but really leaves 3 and 4.</p><p><italic>When grown in the light, the</italic> bzip63 <italic>and bZIP63-ox plants do not differ from wt</italic>.</p><p><italic>Next, the authors compare metabolites entering or derived from glycolysis and citrate cycle in light-grown (L) and dark exposed (elongated night, EN) plants and find that the levels of</italic> “<italic>most</italic>” <italic>free amino acids is increased in the</italic> bzip63 <italic>mutant and decreased in bZIP63-ox plants, whereas sugar levels are stated to show an opposite trend of changes. Based on these data the authors conclude that bZIP63 is a key regulator of starvation responses (see Abstract and Introduction)</italic>.</p><p><italic>When inspecting the metabolite profiling data, it is clear that the discussion of the results is rather superficial. For example, raffinose levels are decreased, whereas trehalose levels are increased in both mutant and ox lines, similarly to glucose in the dark. In general, we do not learn much from the metabolomics data. The actual conclusion is that</italic> “<italic>misregulation of bZIP63</italic>” <italic>(in the subsection “bZIP63 controls dark induced senescence and primary metabolism”) has an effect on metabolism</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this and have intensively studied the literature and found a number of relevant links of our metabolite data to starvation and senescence. We have therefore completely re-written this part and are fully confident that the data now do clearly support the DIS phenotype and the role of the AKIN10-bZIP63 module in regulating primary metabolism in the low-energy response.</p><p><italic>On the other hand, we do not find any additional data (such as quantitative measurement of chlorophyll levels, degradation products, or other senescence markers, such as enzymes or transcripts), which would provide a further insight documenting how alteration of bZIP63 levels modulate the starvation-induced and/or senescence responses</italic>.</p><p>We now include quantitative chlorophyll measurements of plants before and after 9 days in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>). Results are similar to the “green leaf area” data presented throughout our manuscript, which justifies the use of green leaf area as a crude measure for chlorophyll content. In this context we would like to mention that senescing leaves often have reduced water content. Therefore, when normalizing the chlorophyll content to fresh weight this can lead to overestimation of the chlorophyll content in strongly senescing plants. We thus believe that the “green leaf area” method produces more reliable data for estimating the chlorophyll content during dark-induced senescence.</p><p>Further, to confirm that the phenotype we observe is related to dark-induced and not age-induced senescence we did RT-qPCR of marker genes for dark-induced and natural senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). Early time points up to day 4 were chosen as transcriptional response to darkness is faster than visible chlorophyll loss. CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 2 (<italic>CAB2</italic>), as a marker for active photosynthesis was quickly downregulated, while SENESCENCE 1 (<italic>SEN1</italic>) and SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED GENE 103 (<italic>SAG103</italic>), were strongly upregulated. Both genes are known to be regulated by dark-induced senescence. In contrast, YELLOW-LEAF-SPECIFIC 3 (<italic>YLS3</italic>), which is induced by natural senescence, was not increased. We could not observe any strong differences in expression of these genes between wt and <italic>bzip63</italic> plants, indicating that bZIP63 is not involved in the signaling pathways upstream of these senescence markers.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned above, the delayed senescence in the <italic>bzip63</italic> plants could be related to the metabolic phenotype we observed. Amino acids can serve as alternative energy under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabados and Savouré, 2010</xref>, Proline: a multifunctional amino acid; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szal and Podgórska, 2012</xref>, The role of mitochondria in leaf nitrogen metabolism). Therefore, the increased amount of total amino acids in the bZIP63 ko could lead to a delayed onset of visible senescence effects. We have discussed this possibility in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>Whether 9 days of dark treatment can be considered as starvation or general stress response remains a matter of discussion</italic>.</p><p>Dark induced senescence was suggested to be a result of sugar/carbon depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005</xref>, Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences in gene expression and signalling pathways between developmental and dark/starvation-induced senescence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>). We therefore tested whether the dark-induced senescence phenotype is energy related and could be complemented by the addition of sugars. We found that glucose can indeed almost completely rescue the dark-induced senescence phenotype of bZIP63 mutant in seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). This points towards an involvement of bZIP63 in sugar/starvation signaling. Also, seedlings grown on plates with sugar showed enhanced growth and reduced or no chlorophyll loss as compared to the control plates without sugar, indicating that energy/carbon depletion is the major reason for senescence under these conditions.</p><p><italic>By performing 2D and Phos-tag gel westerns (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>), the authors detect multiple phosphorylated (lambda phosphatase sensitive) isoforms of bZIP63-GFP immunoprecipitated from overexpressing plants. On the Phos-tag gel, they show a rather weak band termed</italic> “<italic>supershift</italic>” <italic>of bZIP63, which appears in dark-treated plants, and detect somewhat weaker bZIP63-GFP bands with altered pattern plants grown with 1% sucrose. They use the latter result, without explicit explanation or demonstration, to suggest that the observed phosphorylation changes reflect inhibition of SnRK1 by 1% sucrose</italic>.</p><p>Although it is tempting to suggest a connection between the reduced phosphorylation of bZIP63 in the presence of sucrose and the activity of SnRK1, we do <italic>not</italic> claim at any point in the text that this is the case. We merely suggest that sugar feeding counters the starvation resulting from cultivation in extended dark conditions.</p><p>However, it is possible that some of the difference in bZIP63 phosphorylation between seedlings incubated in the presence and absence of sucrose is due to altered SnRK1 activity. T6P levels increase and decrease in parallel to sucrose levels and are rapidly depleted in the presence of sucrose (Smeekens et al., 2010, Sugar signals and molecular networks controlling plant growth; Lunn et al., 2014, Trehalose metabolism in plants) and it has been shown that in seedlings and young leaves T6P has an inhibitory effect on SnRK1 activity (Zhang et al., 2009, Inhibition of SNF1-related protein kinase 1 activity and regulation of metabolic pathways by trehalose-6-phosphate).</p><p><italic>By mass spectrometry analysis, seven phosphorylated residues were then identified in the immonoprecipitated bZIP63-GFP protein.

In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>, it should be clearly indicated that the plant extract used for in-gel kinase assays derived from hydroponic root cultures (see “Kinase assays”, third paragraph), along with the conditions used for root culture in the case of the experiment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref>.</p><p>We assume the reviewer means 3A in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in the revised manuscript). We have specified the use of roots and root cell culture in the figure legend as well as in the main text. The growth conditions are described in the Methods section under “plant growth”. We further added more detailed information on the plant material used in each of the four affinity purification/kinase identification experiments that were conducted in the excel spreadsheet containing information on which kinase was identified in which sample (first tab of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4–source data 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>To isolate the kinases detected in the in-gel assay, GST-bZIP63 was immobilized on GST-Sepharose and plant protein extracts made from root cultures or root-derived cell suspension (as the latter is maintained in the presence of sucrose, please specify which of these sample is shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) were subjected to affinity binding followed by NaCl elution. The eluted proteins resolved between 30 and 60 kDa were isolated from in-gel kinase PAGE (if I understood well), and identified by mass spectrometry. From 28 candidates only 7 kinases (including the SnRK1 catalytic AKIN10, AKIN11 and activating subunit SNF4, as well as casein kinase subunits CKA1, CKA2, CKB1 and CKL2) were identified by 2-9 peptides. It should be noted in the Materials and methods how the excess of His6-bZIP63 was filtrated out during the mass spectrometry analysis</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer misunderstood the use of in-gel PAGE for protein identification. Proteins were isolated from a non-substrate gel. This is shown in the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and described in the Methods subsection “Identification of proteins and in vivo phosphorylation sites by LC-MS/MS”. As this seems not to be clear enough, we clarified the use of a normal SDS PAGE gel for MS analysis in the main text. As the reviewer pointed out correctly, using a gel with substrate would indeed strongly hamper identification of other proteins by MS/MS, if not prevent it completely.</p><p><italic>In addition, it would be worth knowing whether the GST-alone matrix had retained any of these kinases</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately, we never tested whether any of the kinases phosphorylating bZIP63 binds to a GST-coupled column. Affinity purification was employed in the first place to reduce the complexity of the sample and at the same time enrich for bZIP63 binding proteins before MS analysis. For kinase identification we cut out only those regions giving a signal in the in-gel kinase assay and considered only kinases with the correct molecular weight as a further restrictive step.</p><p>It is possible that one of the kinases identified by MS binds to GST and not bZIP63. However, for the “hot candidates” among the kinases we conducted additional assays (Y2H, BiFC) to confirm their interaction with bZIP63 and we tested phosphorylation of bZIP63 by these kinases. Results for SnRK1 subunits can be found (among others) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4 fig5s5">Figure 5–figure supplement 4 and 5</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>). We are therefore confident that AKIN10 and AKIN11 were not retained by GST, but by bZIP63.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, αAKIN10 western showing an enrichment of AKIN10 on the GST-bZIP63 matrix versus GST would be more convincing</italic>.</p><p>We did not do a western blot as we did not have an antibody against AKIN10 at the time we undertook the affinity purifications (2008). However, we are routinely doing proteomics analysis in our department and SnRK1 peptides are usually not detected in total protein extracts with shotgun proteomics. As we repeatedly found a large number of peptides for AKIN10 and AKIN11 in our affinity purification samples, this is a very good indication that these kinases have been enriched.</p><p><italic>From here on, the authors concentrate on the analysis of bZIP63 phosphorylation by the SnRK1 catalytic subunits AKIN10, which according to Baena-Gonzalez et al. and Jossier et al. (Plant J 59: 316, 2009), is at least 10-20 times more active/abundant compared to its homolog AKIN11 in</italic> Arabidopsis<italic>.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>illustrates that GST-AKIN11 purified from</italic> E. coli <italic>also phosphorylates bZIP63 less efficiently compared to GST-AKIN10 in vitro. It is strange that no autophosphorylation of AKIN10 was ever detected by the authors either in normal or in-gel kinase assays. Any explanation?</italic></p><p>We assume the reviewer means 4B in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><p>In fact, auto-phosphorylation was detected. However, it is quite weak compared to substrate phosphorylation and can therefore not be seen well on the autoradiography.</p><p><italic>As a key argument, the authors use the</italic> akin10 <italic>GABI_579E09 T-DNA insertion mutant to demonstrate that AKIN10 is indeed responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63. Unfortunately, according to the reviewer's knowledge, this mutant has not yet been characterized by others, so, to a certain extent, this must be performed by the authors in this paper</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately we were not aware of the fact that this mutant had never been described before. We had of course characterized the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant line before use. We added a detailed molecular characterization of the mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. Additionally we show some data on the phenotypic appearance of the mutant and expression of selected AKIN10 target genes in the mutant in light and extended night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, they show that one of the phosphorylated bZIP63 bands around 55-57 kDa is missing in their in-gel kinase assay with</italic> akin10 <italic>mutant extracts, and they fail to detect AKIN10 by western with the Agrisera αAKIN10 antibody in roots, but observe a lower Mw weakly cross-reacting protein band in leaf extracts. According to these results, the GABI_579E09 insertion mutant appears to produce no immunologically detectable AKIN10. Yet, the authors could successfully cultivate the mutant, which means that it must be fertile. If AKIN10 is a central regulator of starvation responses, and shows an order of magnitude higher activity compared to AKIN11 in</italic> Arabidopsis<italic>, based on the published striking AKIN10 RNAi senescence phenotype by Bhaena-Gonzalez et al., one would expect a dramatic growth phenotype. Consequently, it is absolutely necessary to show the phenotype of the</italic> akin10 <italic>mutant both in the light and dark that we can compare that to that of the</italic> bzip63 <italic>mutant</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer confuses the plant lines described in Baena-Gonzalez et al. (2007, A central integrator of transcription networks in plant stress and energy signaling). The mutant showing the strong phenotype in the Baena-Gonzalez paper is an <italic>akin10/akin11</italic> double mutant (VIGS of <italic>AKIN11</italic> in <italic>AKIN10</italic> RNAi background). They also showed <italic>akin10</italic> and <italic>akin11</italic> single mutants, which did not have a striking phenotype. Single mutants of <italic>AKIN10</italic> (RNAi) were not smaller than wt and flowered normally, which is probably due to the action of AKIN11. Therefore, the lack of a strong phenotype in our <italic>akin10</italic> T-DNA insertion line is not in contrast to the data published in Baena-Gonzalez, but rather supports the findings described there. A molecular and phenotypic characterization of the GABI-KAT <italic>akin10</italic> line can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 1-2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the analysis of transcription of bZIP63 target genes should provide further clear evidence that post-translational regulation of bZIP63 is indeed impaired in the GABI_579E09 T-DNA insertion mutant</italic>.</p><p>Not many bZIP63 target genes are known. We tested the expression of <italic>ASN1</italic>, <italic>DIN10</italic>, and <italic>ProDH</italic> in the <italic>akin10</italic> line after 6h of light and extended night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2C</xref>). <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ProDH</italic> showed reduced expression under both conditions and in extended night, respectively. Expression of the genes is not completely abolished, but this is not surprising considering that AKIN11 seems to have redundant functions (as can be seen from the phenotype of single and double mutants).</p><p><italic>This is because</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref> <italic>does not really show a very convincing change in the Phos-tag pattern of phosphorylated bZIP63 despite a lower level of</italic> “<italic>supershift</italic>” <italic>indicated by asterisks (see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref> <italic>and Figure 4–figure supplement 3)</italic>.</p><p>It is true that there is no difference in bZIP63 phosphorylation in wt and <italic>akin10</italic> background in the light and in extended night. Only the upper band is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, left) and we can see how this may seem disappointing at first sight. However, we identified more than one kinase and it can therefore not be expected that the phosphorylation of bZIP63 vanishes completely when one kinase is missing. We do see a clear reduction in the phosphorylation of bZIP63 under extended night conditions in the <italic>akin10</italic> mutant line, which tells us that AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 only under specific conditions. The fact that only one band is vanishing and not all means that probably only one site is less phosphorylated, while others, which are targeted by other kinases, are not.</p><p>As it is possible that AKIN11 phosphorylates bZIP63 stronger in the absence of AKIN10, we now knocked down both AKIN10 and AKIN11 using VIGS and looked at the bZIP63 phosphorylation pattern. We saw that again in light there was no difference but the reduction of the “supershift” band in extended night was even stronger in these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, right). In our eyes, this confirms that both SnRK1 kinases phosphorylate bZIP63 under extended night conditions. Thus, we are fully confident that with the additional Phos-tag data, particularly those from the genomic constructs and the VIGS experiment, the effect is absolutely convincing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C to D</italic></xref> <italic>show yeast 2-hybrid and Agrobacterium infiltrated N. tabacum protein-protein interaction assays indicating that that unlike AKIN11, the AKIN10 catalytic and SNF4 activating subunits of SnRK1 interact with bZIP63</italic>. <italic>Given the high level of amino acid homology between AKIN10 and AKIN11, it is surprising that bZIP63 fails to bind AKIN11 and provide a possible hint about the location of possible interaction sites. Did you map these?</italic></p><p>No, we did not map the interaction sites. We observed a very weak interaction with AKIN11 in tobacco and no detectable interaction in yeast. This probably reflects the affinity of the kinase subunit alone to the bZIP and fits to the observed reduction in phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN11. However, in vivo AKIN11 probably still plays a role in bZIP63 phosphorylation. SnRK1 forms a trimeric complex, which always includes SNF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emanuelle et al., 2015</xref>, SnRK1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is an atypical AMPK). As SNF4 interacts strongly with bZIP63, it might act as a link to bring bZIP63 and AKIN11 together.</p><p><italic>On the other hand, it is remarkable that the kinase-substrate interaction is so strong that this can be clearly detected by both assays. However, as these are heterologous assays based on overexpression of proteins, it is absolutely necessary to present co-immunoprecipitation data using the later described bZIP63 GENE construct (and not 35S ox lines) and αAKIN10 western from wt and akin10 mutant plants</italic>.</p><p>We tried co-IPs from the genomic complementation lines. However, we could not successfully pull down AKIN10. One possible explanation for this is that, as the reviewer stated above, interactions between a kinase and its substrate are mostly not very strong and often not very long lived. We can therefore expect that only a fraction of bZIP63 is bound to AKIN10 at any given time and that there is not enough bound AKIN10 to be detected in the western blot. This analysis is furthermore complicated because bZIP63 is expressed at very low levels and very hard to detect (already in plant extracts), therefore it is again not surprising that we could not detect it in a co-IP where most likely only a fraction will bind very transiently to the kinase.</p><p><italic>According to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, the putative upstream activating kinase SnAK2 enhances the activity of AKIN10 (and may be that of AKIN11). SnAK2 is supposed to phosphorylate the T-loop of both AKIN10 and AKIN11. Yet, we do not see enhanced phosphorylation of GST-AKIN10/11 in this figure. Any explanation?</italic></p><p>The phosphorylation of AKIN10 and AKIN11 in the presence of SnAK2 is enhanced, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4C</xref>. However, the amount of AKIN10 and SnAK2 used in this kinase assay is much lower than the amount of bZIP63. Therefore, the phosphorylation band of AKIN10 is weak in relation to the bZIP63 band and cannot be seen very well on the gel. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4A</xref> AKIN10 and AKIN11 are always together with SnAK2, so the increased AKIN10 phosphorylation cannot be seen in this figure. Comparing phosphorylation intensities between figures is not possible.</p><p><italic>As GST-AKIN10/11, GST-bZIP63 and GST-SnAK2 have closely similar masses, it would be necessary to resolve them in a lower % of SDS-PAGE</italic>.</p><p>The bands are close together, but still distinguishable. Only SnAK2 is very close in size to bZIP63. We provide all controls to show that the substrate, and not the kinases, is highly phosphorylated.</p><p>To better separate the bands, it would be necessary to run the gels longer, which we would like to avoid as otherwise radioactive nucleotides run into the running buffer.</p><p><italic>In vitro phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 and AKIN11 looks convincing in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</italic></xref><italic>, so this approach should have provided a simple means to determine both AKIN10 and AKIN11 phosphorylation sites comparatively in bZIP63 by mass spectrometry. Yet, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, a complicated intuitive combination of alanine replacements of in vivo observed seven serine phosphorylation sites is used for demonstration that GST-AKIN10 probably phosphorylates only S29, S294 and S300 residues of bZIP63</italic>.</p><p>Kinase assays with non-phosphorylatable mutants of potential kinase target sites are a standard technique to pin down the likely kinase target sites.

This is the maximum of different isoforms we could identify on different Phos-tag gels and corresponds to the nonphosphorylated form plus the seven identified in vivo phosphorylation sites from the combined MS analyses. Of course, not all isoforms are always visible on the gel as they depend on the phosphorylation level and, furthermore, the phosphorylation status is also highly dynamic, and not every phosphorylation causes a similar strong shift, which complicates the picture. Nevertheless, the main point we want to make in the manuscript – and we think this is clearly evident from the figures – is that the level of bZIP63 phosphorylation changes in response to the different treatments and is furthermore depending on AKIN10.</p><p><italic>In the same subsection, I do not understand the logic of the following sentence:</italic> “<italic>Notably, hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63 in the extended night was even stronger in the GY lines than in ox#3, probably due to lower bZIP63 expression.</italic>” <italic>Do the authors suggest that AKIN10 activity is limiting in terms of bZIP63 phosphorylation even if AKIN10 was supposed to be activated by extended night?</italic></p><p>The expression of bZIP63 in the genomic line is of course lower than in the ox lines.

The signal in the western blot is therefore also weaker and can only be seen in the extended night sample.</p><p><italic>Ehlert et al. reported that, when overexpressed in plant protoplasts, bZIP63 can heterodimerize with members of the S-group, and in those assays bZIP63 homodimers were barely detectable.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"><italic>Kang et al. (2010)</italic></xref> <italic>reported later that bZIP63 also interacts with the Arabidopsis response regulator ARR18 involved in cytokinin signaling, whereas alone (i.e. by interacting with S-group partners in heterodimers), bZIP63 functions as negative regulator of osmotic stress responses and seed germination</italic>.</p><p>This was reported by Veerabagu et al. (2014, The Interaction of the <italic>Arabidopsi</italic>s Response Regulator ARR18 with bZIP63 Mediates the Regulation of PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE Expression).</p><p><italic>Several heterodimerization partners of bZIP63 are well characterized in terms of their transcription regulatory targets. Therefore, it is apparent that their regulatory functions might be modified by bZIP63, where heterodimerization capability of bZIP63 could be controlled post-translationally, e.g. by phosphorylation through SnRK1 and potentially other protein kinases. This idea should be introduced clearly, with some necessary references to the functions of suspected bZIP63 dimerization partners at the beginning of the manuscript and discussed in this term at the end. For example, the observed effect of bzip63 mutation on the levels of free amino acids could be related to the function of its heterodimerization partner bZIP1. So, probably citing a recent paper from Para et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 111: 10371, 2014) may be helpful for discussion of metabolite changes observed in the bzip63 mutant</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and have introduced that reference in the Introduction and indeed re-written the entire discussion of the metabolite data and highlighted the similarities and complementary aspects with bZIP1. We are confident that in the revised version the entire story is indeed much more stringent and fits nicely together also with respect to the other published data on bZIP1.</p><p><italic>Evidently, the bzip63 mutation could influence the function of bZIP1, i.e. if we assumed that the bZIP1 functions as heterodimer with bZIP63. It is therefore interesting that overexpression of AKIN10 in protoplasts has only a slight effect on heterodimerization of overexpressed Gal-AD-bZIP1 and Gal-BD-bZIP63. While this artificial protoplast dimerization assay in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>indicates over 60-fold enhancement of Gal-AD-bZIP11+Gal-BD-bZIP63 dimerization, at the level of GAL-UAS4:GUS reporter, about 15-fold increase is observed, which is reduced to about 2-3-fold by triple mutation of the identified S29/S294/S300 bZIP63 phoshorylation sites. In case of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B and C, I</italic></xref> <italic>could not fully understand why the authors used two different (i.e. GAL-UAS4:GUS and GAL-UAS4:LUC) reporters in the dimerization and reporter activation assays. This correlative evidence between the dimerization and reporter activation assay should definitely be strengthened by performing similar dimerization assays with bZIP63 carrying the S29A/S294/S300 phospho-site replacements. This appears to be obligatory</italic>.</p><p>We agree that mixing the LUC and GUS system is not optimal and have therefore repeated the P2H assays of bZIP63 with bZIP1, 11, and 63 as interaction partners in the GUS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>While the general trend (addition of AKIN10 leads to stronger dimerization) remained the same, the magnitude of the change – especially for bZIP11 – is lower and fits better to the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. It could be that the LUC system is more sensitive than the GUS system, which led to the discrepancies in the fold change between interaction in the absence and presence of AKIN10. Moreover, we have also noticed that in the previous version we have been mistaken by the strong effect on the interaction with bZIP11. As we discuss now, bZIP11 is a strong activator of transcription and bZIP1 and 63 not, which makes of course a big difference in these assays. This has been corrected and we did also include the requested point mutations, which confirm the strong effect of S29 on the dimerization.</p><p><italic>Although the Discussion takes care to announce that</italic> “<italic>to our knowledge this is the first time that phosphorylation outside the bZIP domain was shown to affect dimerization with different partners in a distinct way</italic>”<italic>, it is rather flat. Somewhere, it should mention that the current study did not answer the question of whether the observed phosphorylation sites would modify the cellular location (i.e. nuclear import) and stability of bZIP63, in addition to its heterodimerization, which should be anyhow confirmed by co-IP studies using native gene constructs</italic>.</p><p>We did not observe an effect of S/A mutation on the localization of bZIP63 (also not with other serines than 29, 294, and 300). It is therefore not likely that phosphorylation alters the subcellular localization of bZIP63. We have stated this now clearly in the manuscript.</p><p>Concerning DNA binding, we tested whether S/A or S/D mutation of the N- and C-terminal serines would have an effect on binding to the C-box consensus motif as it was shown for S160, 164, and 168 in the DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirchler et al., 2010</xref>, The role of phosphorylatable serine residues in the DNA-binding domain of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> bZIP transcription factors). Again, we did not see any difference between wt and mutant bZP63 in these assays, which we also mention in the text.</p><p><italic>Unfortunately, the majority of the Discussion includes high-flying general statements, such as,</italic> “<italic>Here we show that bZIP63 plays an important role in the energy starvation response and metabolic regulation…”. If this is so, the reader will ask whether transcription of bZIP63 and its heterodimerization partners is controlled by AKIN10 and is altered in the akin10 mutant (i.e. a necessary but missing control)</italic>.</p><p>We tested whether <italic>bZIP63</italic>, <italic>bZIP1</italic>, and <italic>bZIP11 are</italic> differentially expressed in wt and <italic>akin10</italic> plants by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>).

This may be, but AKIN10 alone also activates these reporter genes, probably through other factors, which according to this paper are probably not the S-group bZIPs (i.e. as they appear not to be phosphorylated by AKIN10).

I would suggest the authors to determine whether the mutation of these four Ser residues to Ala will affect the function of bZIP63. If it does, the data would reveal that bZIP63 is regulated by multiple kinase pathways to carry out its function in the energy transition response. If it does not, the data would demonstrate that AKIN10-phosphorylation on S29, S294 and S300 is the major phosphorylation event that controls the activity of bZIP63</italic>.</p><p>We do believe, as the reviewer suggested, that other kinases also phosphorylate bZIP63. However, as we focused on SnRK1 regulation of bZIP63 in this manuscript, we have not analyzed the functionality of these other sites. This would be a time-consuming process and is well beyond the focus of this manuscript. We have therefore not included additional data on the non-AKIN10 target sites.</p><p>For S160 it has been shown that it can potentially reduce DNA binding of bZIP63 when phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirchler et al., 2010</xref>, The role of phosphorylatable serine residues in the DNA-binding domain of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> bZIP transcription factors), but for the other sites, no data on functionality are available.</p><p><italic>By performing Phos-tag analysis of bZIP63-S59A/S102A/S160A/S261A, the authors can provide more convincing results about the in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 kinase</italic>.</p><p>We feel that the relatively low gain of information for this line does not justify the large amount of work and time needed to create this line (∼ 1 year). It would be wrong to conclude that only AKIN10 would phosphorylate the remaining three sites in this mutant, which would again complicate the interpretation of the results. This is based on the fact, that AKIN10 ko leads to the vanishing of only one band, while mutation of the three sites leads to a strong reduction in phosphorylation. In fact, in the S29/294/300A mutant, only two bands remain (the non-phosphorylated form and a presumably single phosphorylated form). Therefore, the phosphorylation pattern of S29+294+300 would again be a combined effect from more than one kinase.</p><p>To further analyze the phosphorylation of bZIP63 in an <italic>akin10/akin11</italic> background, we added Phos-tag gels from VIGS ko of these two kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Also here, the only difference to wt plants was the vanishing of the hyper-phosphorylation in extended night. We therefore believe that the major phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 happens in extended night and that maybe only one site is strongly phosphorylated by AKIN10 in vivo. This could be S29, as we showed with a new S294/300A mutant that S29 is phosphorylated in extended night, but not in the light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) Because SnRK and bZIP are well known proteins in plant biology, and because phosphorylation of bZIPs has been reported before, the true novelty in the manuscript is in my opinion the phosphorylation-dependent differential dimerization leading potentially to a change in transcriptional specificity plus activity toward distinct target genes (summarized in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref> <italic>– model). Data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>rely on a protoplast two-hybrid assay, allowing a transcriptional readout (equal protein amount in transfected cells has not been included here)</italic>.</p><p>We have added a western blot to show the amounts of bZIP1, bZIP11, bZIP63, and AKIN10 in the P2H assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>To more prominently support the key message of the manuscript will have to address:</italic></p><p><italic>i) Differential dimerization on protein level: conducting for example transient co-localization studies based on (multi-color) fluorescent proteins/BiFC (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60"><italic>Waadt et al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>), or using biochemical means to compare phosphorylation-dependent bZPI63/bZIP63 with bZIP63/bZIP11 formation, and in case even include bZIP S29D (or other) phospho-mimic constructs</italic>.</p><p>We did pick up this suggestion by the reviewer, particularly as we noticed that the protoplast two-hybrid data do not allow a conclusion on preferred dimerization of different dimers because that assay is based on a transcriptional readout and leads to over-estimation of the effect on bZIP11 as mentioned before and also discussed in the revised manuscript. Therefore – as suggested by the reviewer – we have conducted a multi-color BiFC experiment to analyze the dimerization preferences of bZIP63 in a comparative in vivo assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>As exemplary dimerization partners for bZIP63, we have chosen bZIP1 and bZIP11. It is important to note here that of course many other bZIPs will also affect dimerization under the ‘real’ conditions in the wt. All three dimerization partners (bZIP1, bZIP11, and bZIP63) were expressed under control of the 35S promoter from the same plasmid to ensure that all transformed cells express all three partners. A scheme of the BiFC experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>.</p><p>Dimerization of bZIP63 with bZIP1 reconstructs the VENUS construct and leads to ‘yellow’ fluorescence. Dimerization of bZIP63 with bZIP11 reconstructs the CFP construct and leads to ‘cyan’ fluorescence. Homo-dimerization of bZIP63 or dimerization of any of the three partners with an endogenous (untagged) bZIP does not lead to a signal.</p><p>To see if there is a difference between bZIP63 dimerization with bZIP1 and 11, we co-transformed AKIN10 and compared the resulting signals obtained with the wt and the S29/294/300A version of bZIP63. This experiment allowed us to study the dimerization preference of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated bZIP63. Accordingly, the bZIP63-11 hetero-dimer will generate a blue (cyan) signal and the bZIP63-1 hetero-dimer a yellow signal, whereas the bZIP63 homo-dimer cannot be detected. A quantification of the ratio of the VENUS/CFP signal obtained from more than 100 nuclei did clearly show that the co-transformation of AKIN10 did shift the signal towards the VENUS emission, thus showing that AKIN10 does preferentially trigger the formation of bZIP63-1 hetero-dimers in a competitive in vivo assay.</p><p>At first glance, this seems to stand in contrast to the data obtained in the protoplast two-hybrid assays, but as already pointed out, these assays cannot be compared. As we have been mistaken by not realizing this problem before, we had also to revise our model accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). However, we would like to emphasize that the multicolor BiFC experiment is indeed a first in vivo evidence for the proposed phosphorylation triggered shift in dimerization, mediated by AKIN10. We are well aware that other factors (protein stability, expression levels etc.) will also strongly influence this process, but in our view there is currently no experimental possibility to address these points as well in one assay.</p><p><italic>ii) Show differential target gene specificity:</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>contains as marker for transcriptional activity a gene which is target to all three bZIPs (1, 11, 63). Even more convincing will be phosphorylation/heterodimerization-dependent activity toward a distinct bZIP11- or bZIP63-controlled gene, respectively</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we agree, this would indeed be a nice experiment and we would like to do that. Unfortunately, we do not know yet any target gene, which would be specific for only one of the different bZIP dimers. Microarray data are available for bZIP1 and bZIP11, but not for bZIP63. Moreover, also from these data, such genes cannot be deduced as the other different dimerization partners are still present. Maybe ChIP experiments would be a solution here, but that would clearly be beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>2) The primary identification of</italic> “<italic>in vivo</italic>” <italic>phosphorylation sites is conducted on bZIP-GFP overexpressing lines on material harvested in both light and prolonged dark. Therefore, basic constitutive bZIP phosphorylation (and the involvement of other kinases than AKIN10) cannot be excluded. Ideally, one may ask for the degree of conditional in vivo phosphorylation (in particular at S29 of endogenous bZIP) performing MRM/SRM phosphoproteomics</italic>.</p><p>To address this question we generated a genomic complementation line expressing the S294/300A version of bZIP63 in the ko background. In this line, S29 can be phosphorylated, but none of the other potential AKIN10 target sites. Due to the short time we had for the revision, this plant line is still heterozygous and cannot be used for phenotypic analysis at this point. However, we could use the line for Phos-tag gels and we here we saw indeed a striking effect: Compared to the triple mutant, that did not show any change in the phosphorylation pattern in response to starvation, the S294/S300 double mutant did still show a strong shift in the extended night. As S29 is the only AKIN10 target site left in this version, it must indeed be S29 that is phosphorylated by AKIN10 under starvation conditions. We think therefore we did add really significant novel information, and more is simply not possible in the few months we had for the revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
