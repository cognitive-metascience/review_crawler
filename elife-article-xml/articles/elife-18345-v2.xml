How dendrites are guided to specific targets is less understood. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD sensory neuron innervates muscle-skin interface with its elaborate dendritic branches. Here, we found that LECT-2, the ortholog of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2), is secreted from the muscles and required for muscle innervation by PVD. Mosaic analyses showed that LECT-2 acted locally to guide the growth of terminal branches. Ectopic expression of LECT-2 from seam cells is sufficient to redirect the PVD dendrites onto seam cells. LECT-2 functions in a multi-protein receptor-ligand complex that also contains two transmembrane ligands on the skin, SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1, and the neuronal transmembrane receptor DMA-1. LECT-2 greatly enhances the binding between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. The activation of DMA-1 strictly requires all three ligands, which establishes a combinatorial code to precisely target and pattern dendritic arbors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18345.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18345.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dendrite guidance</kwd><kwd>ligand-receptor interaction</kwd><kwd>cell-cell adhesion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xintong</given-names></name><name><surname>Tugizova</surname><given-names>Madina</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS082208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xintong</given-names></name><name><surname>Tugizova</surname><given-names>Madina</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL127764-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Ao</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Yang K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Ao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LECT-2 guides dendrite growth and branching via a unique ligand-receptor complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuit assembly requires precise guidance of both axons and dendrites. Several families of secreted proteins, such as netrin/UNC-6 and Slit, have been extensively studied for their functions as axon guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>). Region-specific expression of these cues establishes gradients or borders that guide axonal navigation through receptor molecules on the growth cone. To date, most of the receptor-ligand interactions involve one ligand and its cognate receptor or receptor-coreceptor pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu and Bargmann, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Dendritic growth and branching is often cell-type specific and follows a stereotyped trajectory, suggestive of precise dendrite guidance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>). However, the molecular nature of these mechanisms remains to be fully understood. Studies in model organisms have begun to shed light on what guides dendrites. Dendritic targeting of <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons is regulated by midline signaling molecules, including Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauss et al., 2009</xref>). A recent study showed that homotypic interactions between the Dscam2 and Dscam4 genes are required for the precise targeting of the L4 dendrites in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tadros et al., 2016</xref>). For fly olfactory projection neurons, dendritic targeting is regulated by cell-autonomous function of graded expression of Sema-1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Komiyama et al., 2007</xref>). Interaction between integrin on the dendrite and laminin on the basement membrane restricts the two dimensional structure of dendritic arbors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> class IV dendritic arborization neurons and ensures dendritic self-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Notably, there is considerable overlap between axon and dendrite guidance cues, as the above-mentioned molecules are also well characterized axon guidance cues. Still, dendrite morphogenesis is distinct from axon morphogenesis in several waysâdendrites often exhibit specific branching patterns, can self-avoid and form specialized sensory dendrite-peripheral tissue interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>) â so it is likely that there are distinct mechanisms for dendrite morphogenesis. Indeed, the highly unusual <italic>Drosophila</italic> DSCAM gene generates numerous alternatively spliced variants that mediate self-avoidance of dendrites through stringent isoform-specific homophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soba et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, accumulating evidence suggests that the mammalian protocadherin genes can also create a large number of splice variants and mediate self-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Maniatis, 1999</xref>). In order to uncover additional dendrite-specific guidance mechanisms, we use the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neuron to study cell-cell interactions that precisely pattern complex dendrites.</p><p>The two <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neurons develop highly-branched yet stereotyped dendritic arbors, one on each side of the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>). They first develop anterior-posteriorly oriented primary (1Â°) dendrites. During the larval 2 (L2) stage to L3 stage, 2Â° dendrites emerge and mostly grow along the ventral-dorsal axis. When 2Â° dendrites reach the border of the outer body wall muscles, they start to form T-shaped 3Â° dendrites. Finally, during the L3 to L4 stage, 4Â° dendrites branch out from the 3Â° dendrites and grow along the ventral-dorsal axis. All the dendrites grow along the surface of the skin, or epidermis. Importantly, the numerous 4Â°Â dendrites are sandwiched between the epidermis and body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>). Functional studies suggest that one of PVDâs functions is to regulate body posture similar to a vertebrate proprioceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the stringent muscle innervation by the PVD dendrites is likely to have functional importance. Previous studies showed that SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1/Menorin form a co-ligand complex on the epidermis to regulate the patterning of PVD dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). On the PVD dendritic membrane, the leucine-rich repeat protein DMA-1 acts as the cognate receptor that physically interacts with SAX-7 and MNR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Shen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). SAX-7 forms stripes on the epidermis where 3Â° and 4Â° dendrites develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18345.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>wy953</italic> mutants show severe dendritic guidance defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon showing the morphology of part of a PVD dendritic tree and its growth environment (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>). 1Â°: primary dendrites; 2Â°: secondary dendrites; 3Â°: tertiary dendrites; 4Â°: quaternary dendrites; Note that tertiary dendrites grow along the border of outer body wall muscles, and quaternary dendrites are sandwiched between epidermis and body wall muscles.

Loss of <italic>lect-2</italic> severely affects the dendritic patterning in the PVD neurons. LECT-2 is mainly secreted from the muscles, and acts as both a short-range cue to guide the growth of 4Â° dendrites and a long-range cue to direct the growth of 2Â° and 3Â° dendrites. Seam cell expressed LECT-2 causes mistargeting of PVD dendrites onto seam cells. We also found that LECT-2 directly interacts with SAX-7, and it dramatically increases the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. Together, LECT-2, SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 form a multiprotein ligand-receptor complex. Because the activation of DMA-1 strictly requires the presence of all three ligands, the PVD dendrites receives a combinatorial code from the environment to precisely guide their morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>lect-2</italic> is required for dendritic patterning of the PVD neurons</title><p>To visualize the morphology of PVD dendritic arbors, we utilized a membrane targeted GFP marker driven by a PVD neuron specific promoter (<italic>ser2prom3</italic>&gt;<italic>myr-gfp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsalik et al., ï»¿2003</xref>). We also labeled body wall muscles and seam cells using cytosolic mCherry expressed under tissue-specific promoters (<italic>Pmyo-3</italic>&gt;<italic>mcherry</italic> and <italic>Pnhr-81</italic>&gt;<italic>mcherry</italic>, respectively) as they are part of the growth environment of the PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâE</xref>). In wild-type animals, most of the 2Â° dendrites grow perpendicularly from the 1Â° dendrites and form âT-shapedâ 3Â° dendrites. PVD also elaborates orderly 4Â° dendrites that are sandwiched between the epidermis and the body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâEÂ andÂ IâK</xref>). To identify novel factors important for PVD dendrite morphogenesis, we carried out an unbiased forward genetic screen and identified two mutants, <italic>wy935</italic> and <italic>wy953</italic>, in which the patterning of PVD dendrites were severely affected in 100% of animals. Compared with wild type PVD, these mutants contained more numerous and disorganized 2Â° dendrites, which completely failed to form âTâ shaped 3Â° dendrites. In addition, no 4Â° dendrites formed in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâK</xref>). These two alleles failed to complement each other, suggesting that they affected the same gene. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping and transgene rescue experiments, we identified the causative point mutations in a novel gene <italic>K05F1.5</italic>, which we named <italic>lect-2</italic> (worm homolog of the human leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2). Both <italic>wy935</italic> and <italic>wy953</italic> contained G to A mutations, resulting in glycine to glutamic acid mutations at amino acids 259 and 103 in the LECT-2 protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When placed over <italic>maDf4</italic> (a deficiency allele that covers the entire <italic>lect-2</italic> genomic locus), <italic>wy935</italic> showed a similar PVD dendritic morphogenesis defect to that of <italic>wy935</italic> homozygous animals, suggesting that <italic>wy935</italic> is likely to be a null allele. We also analyzed <italic>ok2617</italic>, a deletion allele of <italic>lect-2</italic>, in which a large portion of intron #2, the entirety of exon #3 and intron #3, and a small part of exon #4 are deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that <italic>ok2617</italic> caused an indistinguishable PVD dendritic morphogenesis defect as that of <italic>wy935</italic> and <italic>wy953</italic>, suggesting that all three alleles are likely to be nulls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Each muscle cell is innervated by 4Â° dendrites from a single or a few adjacent menorahs (the dendritic arbor unit that consists of all the 4Â° branches from the same 3Â° dendrite). To further understand how muscle secreted LECT-2 promotes 4Â° dendrites growth, we created another mosaic transgenic strain in which only a single muscle or a few muscles produced functional LECT-2 in the <italic>lect-2</italic>(<italic>ok2617</italic>) mutant background. The LECT-2 -expressing muscles were also labeled by mCherry. Interestingly, we found that the transgene was able to robustly restore the innervation of 4Â° dendrites selectively onto <italic>lect-2</italic>(+) muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC and F</xref>). On average, 11.4 dendrites were found to innervate a single <italic>lect-2</italic>(+) muscle (a single muscle in L4/young adult worms is roughly 100 Âµm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In striking contrast, few terminal dendrites were found growing on the <italic>lect-2</italic>(-) muscles (1.7 dendrites per non-transgenic muscle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC and F</xref>).

These results argue strongly that muscle derived LECT-2 functions as a short ranged guidance cue to ensure that each muscle is innervated by 4Â° dendrites. As the mean time, it functions as a long-range cue to pattern the 2Â° and 3Â° dendrites. We suspect that LECT-2 might be easily diffusible in the body cavity where 2Â° and 3Â° dendrites reside, but much less diffusible in the narrow space between the epidermis and body wall muscles where 4Â° dendrites form. Consistent with this idea, when we over-expressed LECT-2 in <italic>lect-2</italic> mutants using high-copy transgenes and strong promoters from several tissues, including the PVD neurons, epidermis, body wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles, not only the patterning of 2Â° dendrites and 3Â° dendrites but also that of 4Â° dendrites were robustly rescued in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that overexpression of LECT-2 can overcome the putative diffusion barrier into the muscle-epidermis interspace and promote theÂ 4Â° dendrite formation.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18345.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Muscle mosaic analysis.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Confocal images showing PVD dendritic arbors, body wall muscles (arrow, labeled in magenta using transgene <italic>Phlh-1&gt;lect-2::SL2::mcherry</italic>) and seam cells in a <italic>lect-2(ok2617</italic>) mutant animal which carried muscle-expressed LECT-2 transgene.

When expressed alone in a wild-type background, YFP::LECT-2 was detected along the 3Â° dendrites as well as many neuropils and commissures, which was reminiscent of the pattern of SAX-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). When we co-expressed LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mcherry under their endogenous promoters, we found the GFP and mCherry formed co-localized stripes where 3Â° and 4Â° dendrites grew along, suggesting that LECT-2 is recruited to SAX-7 stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâC</xref>). Supporting this idea, the SAX-7-like staining of YFP::LECT-2 was completely abolished in <italic>sax-7</italic> but not <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutants, while the coelomocyte staining was not affected in either of mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8DâG</xref>). In addition to the normal coelomocyte staining, the transcription of <italic>lect-2</italic> was not obviously affected in <italic>sax-7</italic> mutants, suggesting that the loss of SAX-7-like staining is unlikely due to defects in the transcription, translation or secretion of LECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that SAX-7 but not MNR-1 is required to localize LECT-2 through a potentially direct link. To test if SAX-7 and LECT-2 physically interact with each other, we expressed GFP-tagged SAX-7 and HA-tagged LECT-2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. The SAX-7::GFP was detected both as full length protein (SAX-7 FL) and a truncated protein product (SAX-7 CTF1). This is consistent with existing literature that SAX-7 is cleaved by a protease in its third FNIII domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hadwiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiefel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pocock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sasakura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Both SAX-7 FL and SAX-7 CTF1 robustly co-precipitated with LECT-2::HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8HâI</xref>). To further narrow down the binding region, we performed co-IP experiments using the SAX-7 extracellular domains (ECD). We generated both the naturally existing truncated SAX-7 ECD containing the last two FnIII domains, as well as a full length ECD by mutating the cleavage site. We observed robust co-precipitation of LECT-2 with both truncated protein and the full length ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H,JâK</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

In one control strain, <italic>dma-1::flag</italic> was replaced with untagged endogenous wild-type <italic>dma-1</italic> locus, while the rest of the genotypes were identical to those of the test strain. In the second control strain, all three transgenes were present in a <italic>mnr-1</italic> null mutant background. As expected, the expression level of LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mCherry were comparable among the three samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In the control sample without the <italic>dma-1::flag</italic>, no fluorescence signals above the background were detected, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9BâD and K</xref>). In the test sample, we detected colocalized LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mCherry fluorescence spots, indicating that LECT-2, SAX-7 and DMA-1 likely exist in the same protein complex. The number of fluorescent spots in mCherry and GFP channels was similar, suggestive of a roughly one-to-one association between SAX-7 and LECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9EâG and K</xref>). About 55% of LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mCherry signals co-localized with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9EâG and L</xref>). The incomplete colocalization in the assay arises mainly from inactive fluorophores. At single molecule level, protein fluorophores such as GFP are subject to misfolding or incomplete maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). It was estimated that about 75% GFP molecules are fluorescently active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jain et al., 2011</xref>). Assuming this ratio, after correction of inactive fluorophores, theoretically, more than 92% LECT-2 and SAX-7 would co-localized at single molecule level. Notably, both the SAX-7 and LECT-2 signals were lost in the <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutant background suggesting the complex formation is dependent on endogenous MNR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9HâK</xref>). Together with the previous results in the SAX-7/DMA-1/MNR-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>), our results suggest that LECT-2, SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 likely exist as a single protein complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>LECT-2 dramatically increases the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1</title><p>Previous studies showed that SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 form a complex to promote dendritic stabilization and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). To study how LECT-2 acts together with SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 to guide PVD dendritic growth, we sought to determine whether LECT-2 facilitates the formation of the receptor-ligand complex by increasing the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. First, we utilized the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell aggregation assay to test this idea. Consistent with our previous observation, DMA-1::RFP-expressing cells aggregated with cells co-expressing SAX-7::GFP and MNR-1::GFP after mixing and incubation in conditioned medium collected from untransfected control cells for more than 40 min, but not at earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>). However, when these two groups of cells were incubated in LECT-2-containing S2 cell medium, we observed robust cell aggregate formation after only 10 min, suggesting that LECT-2 likely increased the binding efficiency between DMA-1, SAX-7 and MNR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test this idea more directly, we expressed MNR-1::GFP, DMA-1::RFP, SAX-7::HA and LECT-2::FLAG in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and detected protein interactions at single molecule level with SiMPull experiments. After cell lysis, SAX-7::HA was pulled down using biotinylated anti-HA antibody. Co-expressed DMA-1::RFP and MNR-1::GFP were directly visualized through their fused fluorescent tags. Consistent with our previous results, we found that MNR-1::GFP and DMA-1::RFP were pull-downed by SAX-7::HA without adding LECT-2::FLAG. The interactions were specific as theÂ very low number of MNR-1::ï»¿GFP and DMA-1::RFP were pull-downed in the control group in the absence of SAX-7::HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of LECT-2::FLAG, SAX-7::HA required 40-folds less input than the sample without LECT-2 to pull down aÂ similar amount of MNR-1 and DMA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10AâB</xref>). The expression amount of DMA-1::RFP or MNR-1::GFP were comparable between two samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Our result suggests that LECT-2 increases the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 by roughly 40-folds in this experimental setup. Together, our evidence strongly suggests that LECT-2 promotes the formation of the receptor-ligand complex by increasing the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18345.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>LECT-2 enhances the binding among SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>AâB</bold>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells expressing DMA-1::RFP and MNR-1::GFP, with or without co-expression of SAX-7::HA and LECT-2::FLAG, were used to detect protein interactions by SiMPull.

However, the PVD dendrites do not simply follow wherever SAX-7 levels are high. For example, SAX-7 is enriched on the epidermal-seam cell junctions near the primary dendrite of the PVD neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>), yet PVD dendrites largely ignore the SAX-7 there and extend towards the muscle cells. Thus, additional factors likely guide the PVD innervation of dendrites toward the muscles. Our results support that LECT-2 acts locally to promote the formation of the terminal branches of PVD on muscles. First, loss of <italic>lect-2</italic> completely abolishes the muscle targeting of PVD dendrites. Second, <italic>lect-2</italic> is expressed in muscles and functions as a local-acting guidance cue to guide the growth of terminal branches. Third, seam cell expressed LECT-2 fails to restore muscle targeting, but instead targets PVD dendrites onto seam cells in <italic>lect-2</italic> mutants.</p><p>While LECT-2 acts locally to promote 4Â° dendrites formation, our data also showed that it could diffuse in the body cavity and act as a permissive cue for the patterning of 2Â° and 3Â° dendrites. Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>lect-2</italic> from several different tissues resulted in theÂ near complete rescue of the mutant phenotype in dendrite shape. These results argue that when overexpressed, the cellular source of <italic>lect-2</italic> is not critical for shaping the dendritic arbors, suggestive of a permissive function of <italic>lect-2</italic>. While the interpretation of these experiments should be cautioned due to overexpression, they do suggest that additional unidentified mechanisms exist to specify the muscles rather than the seam cells as the innervating targets of PVD dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LECT-2 acts together with co-ligands SAX-7 and MNR-1 to activate the neuronal receptor DMA-1</title><p>Both genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrates that LECT-2 functions together with SAX-7 and MNR-1 on the epidermis to activate the dendritic receptor DMA-1. First, loss of <italic>lect-2</italic> causes dendritic targeting and patterning defects indistinguishable from those of <italic>sax-7</italic> and <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutants. Second, the PVD dendritic targeting and patterning defects in the double mutants between <italic>lect-2</italic> and <italic>sax-7/mnr-1/dma-1</italic> are not further enhanced, suggesting that all four genes function in the same genetic pathway. Third, LECT-2 interacts with SAX-7, and forms a multi-protein complex that likely includes SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. Fourth, LECT-2 greatly enhances the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. These results are consistent with a model in which every component of this signaling receptor complex is essential for its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>LECT-2, SAX-7 and MNR-1 generate a novel combinatorial dendritic guidance code</title><p>In contrast to known axon guidance receptors that are often activated by a single ligand, the activation of the DMA-1 receptor appears to require the presence of all three ligandsâSAX-7, MNR-1 and LECT-2. It is interesting to note that the three extrinsic ligands are made by two different tissues: muscles and epidermis, and that PVD dendrite arborizes precisely between these tissues. The exclusive expression of MNR-1 by the epidermal cells ensures that PVD dendrites grow along the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, SAX-7 forms specific patterns on the epidermis to specify the location of 3Â° dendrites and determine the regular spacing of 4Â° dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we showed that muscle secreted LECT-2 acts locally to ensure muscle innervation by the terminal branches of PVD neurons. DMA-1 acts as a coincidence detector, which is only activated when LECT-2, SAX-7 and MNR-1 are all present. This combinatorial code results in the precise targeting and patterning of PVD dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>During development, guidance decisions are often made by a combination of molecular cues. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic CNS neurons use two semaphorins to establish specific connectivity. Sema-2a acts as a repulsive cue, while Sema-2b functions as an attractive cue. Both secreted semaphorins act through the same neuronal receptor PlexB, suggesting that different axon guidance cues can converge on the same receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the same guidance cue can also elicit different responses by activating different receptors. The classic example is netrin/UNC-6, which can attract growth cones through UNC-40/DCC and repel neurons expressing UNC-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonardo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wadsworth et al., 1996</xref>). In the above-mentioned cases, a single ligand is sufficient to bind to and activate its receptor. The integration of guidance information from multiple cues or the differential response to a single cue likely occurs downstream of guidance receptors. In contrast to these published examples, LECT-2, SAX-7 and MNR-1 converge at the level of the DMA-1 receptor and form an âandâ gate for the activation of the receptor. Thus, the combinatorial dendritic guidance code reported here represents a new type of mechanism to integrate diverse cues for morphogenesis decisions.</p><p>The PVD neuron responds to multiple sensory modalities including harsh touch, cold, elevated temperature, hyperosmolarity and possibly muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohammadi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). It is conceivable that the PVD dendriteâs attachment to the epidermis is required for touch related functions. It is likely that the precise location of PVD dendrites between epidermis and muscle cells is essential for its function as a proprioceptive sensory neuron. Therefore, the elaborate developmental program achieves specific dendrite morphogenesis at desired locations to facilitate PVDâs sensory functions. In mammals, there are many examples of precise patterning of dendritic morphogenesis in the central and peripheral nervous system, including the precise innervation of specialized peripheral sensory organs by sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheret et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine whether a similar coding mechanism is used to achieve precise dendrite innervation in mammals. LECT2, the vertebrate homolog of LECT-2, was discovered based on its activity as a neutrophil chemotactic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamagoe et al., 1996</xref>). Known neuronal guidance molecules such as Slit have been shown to regulate leukocyte chemotaxis through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, the acquired immune system utilized ancient molecules from the developmental nervous system to coordinate the polarization and movement of cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and genetics</title><p>N2 Bristol was used as the wild-type strain.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Graeme W Davis (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David M Miller III (Reviewer #2); Joshua M Kaplan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a novel role for a diffusible cue in dendritic morphogenesis. The authors performed a forward genetic screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for mutations that disrupt the precise, repetitious pattern of dendrite arborization in the body wall of this organism. The authors found two mutations in a single gene, both genetically behaving like the gene deletion, indicative of these being loss of function or null mutations. Dendrites are severely disrupted. The authors perform a formal genetic analysis, proving that the DMA2 gene is causal for the observed phenotype. DMA2 encoded the worm homologue of LECT2. Further genetic analyses implicate this gene is a previously established signaling system that includes the worm homologue of L1CAM. A strength of the paper is the magnitude and penetrance of the phenotype and the genetic analyses inclusive of rescue. More specifically, the authors show that DMA-2 is secreted from body muscle cells to promote the outgrowth of terminal (&quot;quaternary&quot;) branches in a region sandwiched between muscle and overlying epidermis. A combination of biochemical and cell aggregation experiments are consistent with a model in which DMA-2 enhances the interaction of 3 additional components, SAX-7/L1, MNR-1 and DMA-1 which the authors have previously shown are required for promoting adherence of PVD dendrites to the epidermis. The results reported firmly establish DMA-2 as a new guidance molecule for PVD dendrite development. However, there are remaining concerns that should be addressed, including a more quantitative and thorough analysis of the dendritic arborization phenotype to more precisely define the nature and effects of the signal that has been identified and a more careful interpretation of the data that are being currently presented.</p><p>Major Revision:</p><p>1) The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> suggest that DMA-2 might also function as a permissive signal to promote outgrowth of secondary and tertiary branches. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, targeted ablation of DMA-2 expression in muscle (with a muscle-specific cre driver) significantly reduces the number of quaternary branches but secondary and tertiary branches appear largely normal. This result stands in contrast to the <italic>dma-2</italic> mutant phenotype which shows highly aberrant secondary and tertiary branch defects in addition to the absence of quaternary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Although PVD quaternary branch outgrowth is selectively rescued in a <italic>dma-2</italic> mutant for a single DMA-2-expressing body muscle cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth in other regions is also apparently restored. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows aberrant innervation of lateral seam cells with local over expression of DMA-2 but again, secondary and tertiary branch morphology is also partially rescued in this case despite the lack of DMA-2 expression in muscle. One possibility is that ectopic expression of DMA-2 in other cell types (i.e., non-muscle) may rescue secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth but not the quaternary branch defect in <italic>dma-2</italic> mutants. Indeed, it would be straightforward to test the idea that DMA-2 could also function as a permissive cue by expressing it in another cell type (e.g., ventral cord motor neurons). Importantly, but not the only experiment that should be performed, does seam cell expressed DMA-2 rescue 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch defects? These experiments should be conducted.</p><p>2) Prior papers showed that <italic>dma-1, mnr-1</italic>, and <italic>sax-7</italic> mutants have defects in 2<sup>o</sup>, 3<sup>o</sup>, and 4<sup>o</sup> dendrite branches. Do <italic>dma-2</italic> mutants also have 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branching defects? The authors should quantify these effects rigorously and the authors should modify the text and discussion to describe these results and interpretations more clearly. This should be inclusive of the mutant phenotype, rescue and overexpression experiments.</p><p>3) The distribution of the DMA-2/GFP (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C-H) and its rescuing activity (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B) should be quantified. Is DMA-2/GFP's localization significantly altered in <italic>sax-7</italic> or <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutants?</p><p>4) Many results were not quantified, and sample sizes were only summarized (e.g. &quot;at least 12 animals&quot;) for those that were quantified. Please quantify all reported results and please indicate specific sample sizes for every genotype in each figure.</p><p>5) The coIP data are nice but do not document a single complex of all 4 proteins. The coIPs also do not convincingly show that DMA-2 alters the affinity of the complex for the other proteins. More specifically, there is a failure to replicate a previous result showing that the receptor complex can form in the absence of DMA-2. The results shown here suggest that DMA-2 is required (and in that sense clearly &quot;enhances&quot; interaction). It should be possible to show a quantitative dependence on DMA-2. Beyond this, the interpretation of the biochemistry should be more circumspect.</p><p>6) The Discussion says: &quot;It is interesting to note that the three ligands from two tissues contain distinct information for PVD dendrite patterning.&quot; If the mutants have identical phenotypes, this can't be true or, at a minimum, is very confusing to the reader. The authors should address this issue experimentally or through modification of the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have performed a forward genetic screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for mutations that disrupt the precise, repetitious pattern of dendrite arborization in the body wall of this organism. The authors found two mutations in a single gene, both genetically behaving like the gene deletion, indicative of these being loss of function or null mutations. Dendrites are severely disrupted. The authors perform a formal genetic analysis, proving that the DMA2 gene is causal for the observed phenotype. DMA2 encoded the worm homologue of LECT2. Further genetic analyses implicate this gene is a previously established signaling system that includes the worm homologue of L1CAM. The phenotypes being described are extremely strong, robust and all rescue experiments are equally clean and clear. The remaining genetic analyses are performed to a very high standard, characteristic of the Shen laboratory. The weakest link in the paper is the final figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) regarding the biochemical analyses. However, in my view, these data are reasonably interpreted and help provide a conceptual model upon which future experiments can be performed. My only substantive criticism is that the paper is written for <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurobiologists and less for a general reader. It would be nice to have gene names linked to the mammalian orthologues throughout the paper, and for the text to touch base, routinely with the larger literature, not just the emerging signaling system in this organism. This should be an easy fix that would make the paper more generally accessible and would make the findings more clearly relevant to the biology of other systems, which it certainly is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper reports a novel role for a diffusible cue in dendritic morphogenesis. The authors exploited the stereotypically branched architecture of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD sensory neuron to detect mutations in a conserved protein, (named DMA-2 here), in a forward genetic screen. The authors show that DMA-2 is secreted from body muscle cells to promote the outgrowth of terminal (&quot;quaternary&quot;) branches in a region sandwiched between muscle and overlying epidermis. A combination of biochemical and cell aggregation experiments are consistent with a model in which DMA-2 enhances the interaction of 3 additional components, SAX-7/L1, MNR-1 and DMA-1 which the authors have previously shown are required for promoting adherence of PVD dendrites to the epidermis. The authors conclude that DMA-2 functions strictly as an instructional cue to promote quaternary branch outgrowth. Although experiments reported here strongly support this hypothesis, additional results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> suggest that DMA-2 might also function as a permissive signal to promote outgrowth of secondary and tertiary branches. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, targeted ablation of DMA-2 expression in muscle (with a muscle-specific cre driver) significantly reduces the number of quaternary branches but secondary and tertiary branches appear largely normal. This result stands in contrast to the <italic>dma-2</italic> mutant phenotype which shows highly aberrant secondary and tertiary branch defects in addition to the absence of quaternary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Perdurance seems to be an unlikely explanation since the cre driver (<italic>hlh-1</italic>) is expressed in embryonic muscle whereas the PVD phenotype is scored much later in development at the L4 larval stage. A similar result is also evident in a mosaic expression experiment reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Although PVD quaternary branch outgrowth is selectively rescued in a <italic>dma-2</italic> mutant for a single DMA-2-expressing body muscle cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth in other regions is also apparently restored. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows aberrant innervation of lateral seam cells with local over expression of DMA-2 but again, secondary and tertiary branch morphology is also partially rescued in this case despite the lack of DMA-2 expression in muscle. The authors need to address potential permissive role of DMA-2 with additional experiments (see below). Otherwise, experiments reported here are convincing, the writing is clear, images are compelling and the findings offer a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive dendrite morphogenesis.</p><p>1) As noted above, results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, point to a potential dual role for DMA-2 as both a permissive cue (for secondary and tertiary branches) and instructive signal (for quaternary branches). If this model is correct, then ectopic expression of DMA-2 in other cell types (i.e., non-muscle) should rescue secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth but not the quaternary branch defect in <italic>dma-2</italic> mutants. This experiment should be conducted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neurons have elaborate dendritic processes that tile the body wall, contacting the hypodermis and body muscles. Prior studies identified 3 cell surface molecules that shapes the elaborate PVD dendritic arbors. DMA-1 functions in PVD neurons while MNR-1 and SAX-7 function in the hypodermis, and all three proteins bind to each other. Here the authors identify a fourth guidance molecule (DMA-2) that is secreted from body muscles, binds directly to the DMA-1/MNR-1/SAX-7 complex, and is also required for patterning PVD dendrites. The phenotypes of mutants lacking MNR-1, SAX-7, and DMA-2 are very similar and additive effects are not observed in double mutants. The authors provide some biochemical data suggesting that DMA-2 strengthens the binding interactions between DMA-1, SAX-7, and MNR-1. Based on these findings, the authors propose that proper PVD dendrite morphogenesis requires DMA-1 receptors to interact simultaneously with 3 distinct ligands (MNR-1/SAX-7/DMA-2), with each ligand controlling distinct aspects of dendrite growth.</p><p>The results reported firmly establish DMA-2 as a new guidance molecule for PVD dendrite development. This alone could justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>; however, I would be more enthusiastic about publication if the author's provided more mechanistic insights into how DMA-2 (and the other guidance molecules) shape dendrite development. The evidence supporting DMA-2's proposed mechanism of action (enhancing formation of the MNR-1/SAX-7/DMA-2 complex) is not fully convincing. How these molecules alter PVD dendrite outgrowth during development (e.g. by time lapse recordings) is not known. These and other concerns are detailed below.</p><p>1) The co-IP experiments could be explained by binary interactions between DMA-2/MNR-1/SAX-7/DMA-2. Why do the authors conclude that a complex of all four proteins exists, and that such a complex is required for PVD dendrite development?</p><p>2) The effect of DMA-2 on DMA-1 coIP with SAX-7/MNR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) should be quantified (% DMA-1 input that is recovered by coIP). The manuscript would be improved if more biochemical experiments were added to convincingly demonstrate a change in binding affinity produced by adding DMA-2.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, how are the MNR-1 and DMA-2 bands distinguished (as they both carry the FLAG tag)?</p><p>4) This paper focuses on DMA-2's role in promoting PVD &quot;innervation&quot; of body muscles (which I assume means the 4o dendrite branches). Prior papers showed that <italic>dma-1, mnr-1</italic>, and <italic>sax-7</italic> mutants have defects in 2<sup>o</sup>, 3<sup>o</sup>, and 4<sup>o</sup> dendrite branches. Do <italic>dma-2</italic> mutants also have 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branching defects? If this is the case, the authors should modify the text and discussion to describe these results and interpretations more clearly.</p><p>5) Do PVD dendrites form specialized contacts with body muscles, as would be expected if they mediate sensation of muscle contraction (and as implied by use of the term &quot;innervation&quot;). The authors should check to see if the Worm Atlas repository of electron micrographs contains useful images of PVD/body muscle contacts.</p><p>6) The image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> suggests that muscle specific dma-2 knockout (using muscle CRE drivers) produces a weaker phenotype than the constitutive <italic>dma-2</italic> null mutant (maybe less 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch defects). Is this the case? Does that imply that DMA-2 expression in other tissues is required for PVD development?</p><p>7) Does muscle expression of DMA-2 rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) rescue 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch defects? If so, the authors should modify the Discussion to indicate that DMA-2 secreted from muscles acts at a distance to promote 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branches in PVD dendrites.</p><p>8) The distribution of the DMA-2/GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> S2 C-H) and its rescuing activity (Figure 3âFigure supplement 2B) should be quantified. Is DMA-2/GFP's localization significantly altered in <italic>sax-7</italic> or <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutants?</p><p>9) Is expression of the <italic>dma-2</italic> promoter altered in <italic>sax-7</italic> and <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutants? This control is necessary to interpret the experiments shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2.</p><p>10) The authors conclude that DMA-2 is an instructive cue because a transgene expressing DMA-2 in seam cells increases PVD dendrite contact with seam cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). But Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 shows that wild type DMA-2/GFP (expressed with its native promoter) stains seam cells. So, why don't wild type PVD neurons innervate seam cells?</p><p>11) Does seam cell expressed DMA-2 rescue 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch defects?</p><p>12) Could coIP of DMA-1 with the SAX-7/CTF1 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) be mediated by an interaction between the FL and CTF1 SAX-7 proteins? If so, one cannot exclude that Nterminal Ig domains are not required for the binding (subsection âDMA-2 physically interacts with SAX-7â).</p><p>13) Discussion refers to DMA-1 signaling and DMA-1 &quot;activation&quot; by its ligands. Is it possible that these molecules mediate only adhesive interactions, and may not activate cytoplasmic signaling pathways?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18345.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>Major Revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> suggest that DMA-2 might also function as a permissive signal to promote outgrowth of secondary and tertiary branches.

One possibility is that ectopic expression of DMA-2 in other cell types (i.e., non-muscle) may rescue secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth but not the quaternary branch defect in dma-2 mutants. Indeed, it would be straightforward to test the idea that DMA-2 could also function as a permissive cue by expressing it in another cell type (e.g., ventral cord motor neurons). Importantly, but not the only experiment that should be performed, does seam cell expressed DMA-2 rescue 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch defects? These experiments should be conducted.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the insightful comments. We agree that LECT-2 (named as DMA-2 in the previous version of our manuscript) functions as a long-range guidance cue for dendrite morphogenesis of the 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branches, and a short-range cue to instruct the growth of 4<sup>o</sup> dendrites in vivo. We have performed new experiments including the ones suggested by the reviewers in the revised manuscript to support these conclusions. We want to emphasize that LECT-2 acts as a co-ligand together with SAX-7 and MNR-1 for the DMA-1 receptor in both the âlong-rangeâ and âshort-rangeâ functions. The distinction between the ranges is likely due to the different extracellular environments where the 2<sup>o</sup> /3<sup>o</sup> and 4<sup>o</sup> dendrites branches form. The 2<sup>o</sup> /3<sup>o</sup> branches form against the surface of the body cavity, through which secreted molecules diffuse easily up and down the worm body. In contrast, the 4<sup>o</sup> branches locate within the narrow space between body wall muscles and skin/epidermal cells. We suspect that endogenous LECT-2 secreted from muscles has very limited mobility in the skin-muscle interface and therefore acts as a short-range cue for the 4<sup>o</sup> branches. Below are the experiments that we added on this issue.</p><p>1) We have added quantification for the number of 2<sup>o</sup> dendrites and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites for the muscle-specific conditional knock-out (cKO) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-5D</xref>). Compared to the <italic>lect-2</italic> null mutants, muscle cKO animals contained similar number of 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites, suggesting that 3<sup>o</sup> dendrite formation does not strictly rely on muscle secreted LECT-2. Interestingly, in the muscle cKO animals, the number of 2<sup>o</sup> dendrites was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), However, significant portion of 2<sup>o</sup> dendrites were short, misguided and did not reach the muscle border. Hence the number of 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites was not significantly different from wild type in one line and subtly increased in another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that the muscle secreted LECT-2 is absolutely required for 4<sup>o</sup> but not for 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch formation. The muscle secreted LECT-2 might have a function in reducing ectopic 2<sup>o</sup> branches. One implication of these results is that there might be other cells that express LECT-2 in addition to the body wall muscles. After carefully examining the transcriptional reporter of <italic>lect-2</italic>, we identified a small number of head neurons and ventral nerve cord neurons as <italic>lect-2</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We suspect that the rescue of 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites in muscle cKO animals was due to LECT-2 expression from these neurons.</p><p>2) To more directly test the idea of local and long-range activity, we utilized the mosaic nature of the muscle promoter-driven transgene in transgenic animals in which only a single or a few muscle cells express <italic>lect-2</italic>. In the original submission, we showed that single cell expression of <italic>lect-2</italic> rescued the 4<sup>o</sup> branches innervating the same muscles but not adjacent or distant muscles. Following the reviewersâ suggestion, we now quantified the number of 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites for the <italic>lect-2</italic>(+) zone and <italic>lect-2(-)</italic> zone. We found that different from the 4<sup>o</sup> branches, the 3<sup>o</sup> branches were significantly rescued in both zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The quantification of the 2<sup>o</sup> branches in these experiments were confounded by the large number of disorganized 2<sup>o</sup> branches in the <italic>lect-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, it is clear that the number of 2<sup>o</sup> branches that gave rise to 3<sup>o</sup> branches was dramatically increased in both the <italic>lect-2</italic>(+) region and nearby regions. Consistent with the cKO results, these results demonstrate that LECT-2 expressed from a single muscle cell, can function over long distance to form 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites but act locally to instruct the innervation of 4<sup>o</sup> branches to individual muscles.</p><p>3) Similarly, seam cell-expressed LECT-2 completely rescued the 3<sup>o</sup> but not 4<sup>o</sup> dendrites. We have added quantification for the rescue experiment by expressing LECT-2 in the seam cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>4) We found that over-expressing LECT-2 from multiple tissues, including PVD neurons, epidermal cells (skin), body wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles robustly rescued the dendrite patterning of 2<sup>o</sup>, 3<sup>o</sup> and 4<sup>o</sup> dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In these experiments, high level of LECT-2 was likely generated from the transgene overexpression, which might lead to sufficient LECT-2 to diffuse into the space between skin and body wall muscle cells and rescue the formation of 4<sup>o</sup> dendrite. These results also argue that the muscle expressed LECT-2 cannot be the only âinstructive cueâ to pattern the dendrites because expression of <italic>lect-2</italic> from different tissues (presumably forming different LECT-2 patterns) can rescue the dendrite morphology. We discussed these results in the Discussion (subsection âLECT-2 acts both locally and globally to guide and pattern PVD dendritesâ, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Prior papers showed that dma-1, mnr-1, and sax-7 mutants have defects in 2<sup>o</sup>, 3<sup>o</sup>, and 4<sup>o</sup> dendrite branches. Do dma-2 mutants also have 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branching defects? The authors should quantify these effects rigorously and the authors should modify the text and discussion to describe these results and interpretations more clearly. This should be inclusive of the mutant phenotype, rescue and overexpression experiments.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. <italic>lect-2/dma-2</italic> mutants also showed fully penetrant 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branching defects. In the original submission, we described the <italic>lect-2</italic> phenotype as âindistinguishable from those of <italic>sax-7</italic> and <italic>mnr-1</italic>â. Our previous papers have shown that <italic>sax-7</italic> and <italic>mnr-1</italic> both have fully penetrant defects in 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites. We have added the quantification for the defects of 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I-1J</xref> for mutant phenotype, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-6E</xref> for rescue and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> for overexpression experiments). We also modified the text and Discussion to describe these results and interpretations.</p><p><italic>3) The distribution of the DMA-2/GFP (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C-H) and its rescuing activity (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B) should be quantified. Is DMA-2/GFP's localization significantly altered in sax-7 or mnr-1 mutants?</italic> </p><p>To stringently characterize the expression of <italic>lect-2</italic>, we have generated a yfp knock-in strain to tag the endogenously expressed LECT-2 using CRIPSR/Cas9 method. This knock-in strain generated similar results as the transgene that we used in the original submission. Nevertheless, we replaced the expression data with this knock-in line. The endogenously-expressed YFP::LECT-2 was likely to be largely functional as the animals of the knock-in line showed normal menorah structures with slightly increased 4<sup>o</sup> branch numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-4F</xref>). The expression pattern was very similar to what we observed using the LECT-2::GFP high-copy transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition to the coelomocyte staining, YFP::LECT-2 labeled stripe patterns, which was completely lost in the <italic>sax-7</italic> mutant, but not changed in <italic>mnr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E-8G</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Many results were not quantified, and sample sizes were only summarized (e.g. &quot;at least 12 animals&quot;) for those that were quantified. Please quantify all reported results and please indicate specific sample sizes for every genotype in each figure.</italic> </p><p>We have added quantification for most of the results we reported in the revised manuscript. We also indicated specific sample sizes for every genotype in each figure.</p><p><italic>5) The coIP data are nice but do not document a single complex of all 4 proteins. The coIPs also do not convincingly show that DMA-2 alters the affinity of the complex for the other proteins. More specifically, there is a failure to replicate a previous result showing that the receptor complex can form in the absence of DMA-2. The results shown here suggest that DMA-2 is required (and in that sense clearly &quot;enhances&quot; interaction). It should be possible to show a quantitative dependence on DMA-2. Beyond this, the interpretation of the biochemistry should be more circumspect.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers to point these out. To test whether LECT-2/DMA-2 forms a four-protein complex with DMA-1, SAX-7 and MNR-1 in vivo, we collaborated with Dr. Kevin Xiangâs group and performed quantitative, single molecule pull-down experiments using worm extracts. In these experiments, endogenous DMA-1 was tagged with FLAG using CRISPR/Cas9 method. LECT-2 and SAX-7 were tagged with GFP and mCherry, respectively. Our new results clearly showed that DMA-1, LECT-2 and SAX-7 form a multi-protein complex. Due to technical difficulty, we were not able to also label MNR-1 with a third fluorescent tag. However, we found that the formation of DMA-1-LECT-2-SAX-7 complex was completely MNR-1-dependent, which strongly suggests that MNR-1 is also an essential component of the multi-protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>To quantitatively test whether inclusion of LECT-2 enhances the binding efficiency between DMA-1, SAX-7 and MNR-1, we performed single molecule pull-down experiments using S2 cell lysates with or without adding LECT-2. We found that DMA-1 interacted with SAX-7 and MNR-1, even in the absence of LECT-2, confirming the published results. Importantly, adding LECT-2 dramatically enhances the binding efficiency between DMA-1, SAX-7 and MNR-1 by roughly 40 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The Discussion says: &quot;It is interesting to note that the three ligands from two tissues contain distinct information for PVD dendrite patterning.&quot; If the mutants have identical phenotypes, this can't be true or, at a minimum, is very confusing to the reader.
