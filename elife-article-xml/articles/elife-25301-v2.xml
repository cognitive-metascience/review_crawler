Ommatidia (unit eyes) are classified into two subtypes, known as ‘pale’ or ‘yellow’, depending on Rhodopsin expression in R7 and R8. Subtype specification is controlled by a stochastic decision in R7 and instructed to the underlying R8. We find that the Activin receptor Baboon is required in R8 to receive non-redundant signaling from the three Activin ligands, activating the transcription factor dSmad2. Concomitantly, two BMP ligands activate their receptor, Thickveins, and the transcriptional effector, Mad. The Amon TGFβ processing factor appears to regulate components of the TGFβ pathway specifically in pale R7. Mad and dSmad2 cooperate to modulate the Hippo pathway kinase Warts and the growth regulator Melted; two opposing factors of a bi-stable loop regulating R8 Rhodopsin expression. Therefore, TGFβ and growth pathways interact in postmitotic cells to precisely coordinate cell-specific output.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>visual system development</kwd><kwd>cell fate determination</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>activin</kwd><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022843-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Brent S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY13012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desplan</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 506-2002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pistillo</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TGFβ family members instruct a cell fate decision downstream of stochastic signaling in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina to ensure correct pairing between different color photoreceptors for color vision.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, cells make both autonomous and non-autonomous decisions to give rise to functional organs. The compound eye of <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a beautiful example of how these processes are integrated. It is composed of approximately 800 units, the ommatidia, each consisting of eight photoreceptor cells (R1 to R8), as well as accessory cone and pigment cells (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafen, 1991</xref>]). Photoreceptors express one of six different types of photosensitive Rhodopsins (Rh). The six outer photoreceptors R1-R6 all express Rh1 and are involved in motion detection and image formation in dim light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisenberg and Buchner, 1977</xref>). In function, they resemble vertebrate rods. Their six rhabdomeres, which are made up of widely expanded membranes that contain the light-sensitive Rhs, are arranged in a trapezoid. They surround the rhabdomeres of the two inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are located on top of one another, thus sharing the same optic path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). R7 and R8 are involved in color vision and can be considered the equivalent of the vertebrate cones. Two primary ommatidial subtypes specialized in color vision can be identified in the main part of the retina, based on their Rh content in R7 and R8. They coordinately express UV-sensitive Rh3 in R7 with blue-Rh5 in R8 (pale ommatidia), or UV-Rh4 in R7 with green-Rh6 in R8 (yellow ommatidia). These two subtypes are stochastically distributed with a conserved ratio of 35% pale and 65% yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rister et al., 2013</xref>]). Tight coupling of Rh expression in R7 with R8 likely allows flies to distinguish colors by comparing outputs from R7 and R8 cells belonging to the same ommatidium. Comparison between pale and yellow ommatidia also likely occurs, as several classes of neurons contact axons from both subtypes in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ommatidia architecture and the mechanisms of TGFβ pathway signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The six outer photoreceptors R1-R6 all express Rh1 and are involved in motion detection and image formation in dim light. They surround the rhabdomeres of the two inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are located on top of each other, thus sharing the same optic path. (<bold>B</bold>) The transcription factor Ss is expressed in 65% of R7 cells (<bold>yellow</bold> cells), activating Rh4 and repressing Rh3. Ss inhibits the instructive signal from R7 to R8, allowing for the default phosphorylation and activation of Wts in R8 and subsequent expression of Rh6 and repression of Rh5. Wts makes up one half of a double-negative feedback loop that establishes and maintains R8 subtypes. The other half of the loop, Melt, is expressed in R8s downstream of the other 35% of R7 cells (<bold>pale</bold> cells). These pale R7 cells lack Ss expression, allowing for expression of Rh3 and instructive signaling to R8 (red arrow). The instructive signal likely activates Melt, which represses Wts, allowing for Rh5 expression. (<bold>C</bold>) TGFβ superfamily ligands induce oligomerization of Type I and Type II serine-threonine kinase receptors. Binding of the ligand dimer to the Type II receptor initiates its kinase activity, phosphorylating residues on the Type I receptor, which becomes activated. Type I receptors then phosphorylate members of the receptor regulated (R)-SMAD family of transcription factors, allowing them to bind co-SMADs, translocate to the nucleus and activate or repress transcription of downstream target genes. (<bold>D</bold>) The TGFβ pathway in Drosophila contains both BMP and Activin subfamilies. The BMP subfamily is composed of three ligands, Dpp, Gbb and Scw, two Type I receptors, Tkv and Sax and one R-SMAD, Mad. The Activin subfamily also contains three ligands, dActβ, Daw and Myo, but only one Type I receptor, Babo and one R-SMAD, dSmad2. Both subfamilies share the Type II receptors Punt and Wit as well as the Co-SMAD, Med.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25301-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>The decision to adopt the pale or the yellow subtype is originally made in R7: In the absence of R7 cells (i.e. in a <italic>sevenless</italic> (<italic>sev</italic>) mutant), most R8 cells express Rh6, suggesting the loss of an Rh5 signal from 35% of R7 cells. In contrast, R7 cells still express Rh3 or Rh4 in the correct 35%:65% ratio when R8s are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papatsenko et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, a stepwise mechanism appears to be responsible for the specific expression of the different Rhs in R7 and R8: Stochastic expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss) in about 65% of R7 cells induces the yellow R7 subtype and represses the pale R7 subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wernet et al., 2006</xref>). Pale R7 cells that do not express Ss activate Rh3 and signal to the underlying R8 to induce the pale subtype (Rh5). Signaling affects a bi-stable loop between the gene encoding the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the human LATS tumor suppressor, Warts (Wts), which is expressed in Rh6-positive yellow R8 cells, and the cell growth regulator Melted (Melt), which is co-expressed in pale R8 cells with Rh5, ensuring that the decision communicated by R7 to R8 is unequivocally fixed in R8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikeladze-Dvali et al., 2005</xref>). The molecular nature of the signal from R7 to R8 has so far remained elusive. Mutations in this signaling pathway are expected to modify the expression of R8 Rhs (Rh5 and Rh6) but not R7 Rhs (Rh3 and Rh4).</p><p>We report here that signaling from R7 to R8 is mediated by both arms of the TGFβ superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> each arm (BMP and Activin) utilizes different ligands, Type I receptors and downstream R-SMADs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng and Derynck, 2005</xref>]): BMP homologues Decapentaplegic (Dpp), Glass Bottom Boat (Gbb), and Screw (Scw) signal through Type I receptors Thickveins (Tkv) and Saxophone (Sax) to induce phosphorylation of Mad. In the Activin branch, Activinβ (dActβ), the Activin-like protein Dawdle (Daw), and Myoglianin (Myo) signal through Type I receptor Baboon (Babo) to induce phosphorylation of dSmad2. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smad4 homologue, Medea (Med), serves as the co-SMAD for both branches of the pathway. Type II receptors Punt (Put) and Wishful Thinking (Wit) can bind to both BMP and Activin Type I receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Little is known about an additional orphan ligand, Maverick (Mav), which has not been assigned to either the Activin or BMP pathway (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peterson and O'Connor, 2014</xref>]).</p><p>We find that both arms of the TFGβ signaling pathways specifically instruct the pale photoreceptor subset in R8. The Activin arm utilizes the three ligands dActβ, Daw, and Myo non-redundantly to activate Babo and downstream dSmad2 in R8, while the BMP arm signals by way of Dpp and Gbb to Tkv and Mad. Removing either <italic>babo</italic> or <italic>tkv</italic> leads to a dramatic increase in the yellow R8 subtype, without affecting R7 subtype. This is also true for removing pathway ligands and R-SMADs. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively activated forms of Babo or Tkv gives the opposite phenotype of high pale R8 subtypes. We show that most of the ligands are expressed in all R7 cells while regulation of their processing by the processing factor Amon appears to control their pale-specific function. We also demonstrate that both Activin and BMP signaling determine the R8 subtype by regulating the Wts/Melt bi-stable loop in pale R8 cells, revealing the presence of a crosstalk between the Hippo/Wts tumor suppressor and TGFβ pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Type I receptors Babo and Tkv and their multiple TGFβ ligands are required to specify pale R8 subtype</title><p>To reveal factors involved in the specification of R8 subtypes, we performed an RNAi screen of transcription factors (described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>]) and membrane-associated factors for severe deviations from the wild type (WT) 35/65 ratio of pale/yellow ommatidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>). We uncovered the Activin Type I receptor Babo, which when removed with RNAi, dramatically reduced the percentage of pale R8 cells from 38% in controls to 5%. This residual Rh5 expression is very similar to the low pale R8 phenotype seen in the absence of R7 in <italic>sev</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papatsenko et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and suggests that Babo is necessary for pale R8 subtypes. To determine whether Babo was also sufficient to drive the pale R8 subtype, we used the lGMR-Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wernet et al., 2006</xref>) to overexpress an activated form of Babo (Babo*) in all photoreceptors R1-8. This increased pale R8 subtypes to 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). To ensure that Babo’s role on R8 subtypes was not a secondary consequence of changing the R7 subtype, we examined Rh expression in R7 cells in retinas where we expressed Babo*. The ratio of Rh3/Rh4 expression in R7 was normal (35%/65%), leading to Rh4/Rh5 mispairing between R7 and R8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which is never observed in WT retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Many TGFβ ligands and receptors are required non-redundantly to specify R8 subtypes.</title><p>Graph Legend: Red is the percentage of R8 photoreceptors that expressed Rh6, Blue is the percentage that expressed Rh5 and Purple is Co-expression of Rh5 + Rh6.

To determine whether these Activin ligands were involved in specifying R8 subtype, we removed each using the lGMR driver to express RNAi. To our surprise, we found an independent requirement for all three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). Testing additional RNAi constructs with different target regions for these same genes yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>babo</italic> gene produces three distinct isoforms that vary in their ligand-binding domains: Babo-a, -b, and -c. Babo-a and Babo-b have redundant activity in specific developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>), although only Babo-a has been shown to specifically bind both Myo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>) and dActβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Babo-c has been shown to bind Daw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate whether one or more isoforms are involved in specifying pale subtype, we drove isoform-specific RNAi and overexpression lines using lGMR-Gal4. Removing Babo-a eliminated all pale fate (0%) while overexpressing it significantly increased pale fate (64%). Likewise, removing or overexpressing Babo-b significantly reduced (16%) and increased (65%) pale fate, respectively. Neither removal nor overexpression of Babo-c affected pale fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–I</xref>). These results suggest that Babo-a and -b are each required non-redundantly for pale fate. However, Babo-a appeared to be critical for all pale fates, while removing Babo-b was far less effective. It is possible that RNAi for Babo-b might be weak and insufficient in fully knocking down endogenous activity. Indeed, overexpressing Babo-b increased pale fates similarly to Babo-a. The potential implications of these results on ligand usage are described below.</p><p>We also examined the role of Type II-receptor-binding partners, Put and Wit. We used RNAi to remove them under the control of lGMR-Gal4. We could show that Put but not Wit is required for R8 subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is not unexpected as Put but not Wit has been described as the binding partner for Babo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to Babo, the BMP Type I receptor Tkv is also a binding partner of Put (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruberte et al., 1995</xref>). To examine the role of Tkv in determining R8 subtype, we expressed TkvRNAi using lGMR-Gal4, and observed a dramatic reduction in pale R8 photoreceptors to 3%. However, removal (or overexpression) of the other BMP Type I receptor, <italic>sax</italic>, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,M</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To determine whether Tkv was also sufficient to induce pale R8 subtypes, we overexpressed an activated form (Tkv*) in all photoreceptors, which increased Rh5 expression to 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,M</xref>). Similar to Babo, manipulation of Tkv altered R8 subtype but not the R7 subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). It should be noted that expressing Tkv* also resulted in co-expression of Rh5 and Rh6 in 36% of R8 cells. This appears to be due to derepression of Rh5 into yellow R8 photoreceptors since the percentage of R8 photoreceptors expressing Rh5 nearly doubled while the percentage of yellow R8s remained similar to controls.</p><p>We next tested the three BMP pathway ligands. We found roles for both Dpp and Gbb but not Scw in the specification of R8 subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N–P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Furin 1 (Fur1) and Furin 2 (Fur2) have been shown to cleave redundantly at FSII and FSIII sites.

As an alternative approach to verify the role of TGFβ ligands in R8 subtype specification, we knocked down factors required for their processing. Using RNAi, we found roles for Amon and Fur2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R–S,W</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, overexpressing Fur2 in all photoreceptors increased pale R8 subtypes to 64%, an effect that was eliminated by concomitantly removing <italic>babo</italic> using RNAi (13% Rh5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2T–U,W</xref>). This is consistent with Babo acting downstream of Fur2-processed Activin ligands in specifying pale R8. We did not find a role for Fur1, which is expected as evidence suggests Fur2 is sufficient for cleavage at all FS sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The fact that Amon was also required suggests that it is not redundant with Fur2 and that each may be responsible for processing distinct TGFβ ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Künnapuu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to Furin-type convertases, the Tolloid (Tld) metalloprotease is also required for TGFβ signaling. Tld promotes signaling by cleaving Short Gastrulation (Sog), which dimerizes with Twisted Gastrulation (Tsg) to bind to and inhibit mature BMP ligands in the intercellular space. Cleavage of Sog disrupts the Sog/Tsg complex, releasing the ligand, which is then free to activate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decotto and Ferguson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimmi and O'Connor, 2003</xref>).

Considering the involvement of ligands and receptors from both BMP and Activin families, we asked whether BMP ligands were specifically signaling through Tkv while Activin ligands were signaling through Babo.

If Babo is downstream of Activin ligands, overexpressing Babo* should significantly rescue the loss in pale subtypes seen when removing <italic>dActβ</italic>, <italic>daw</italic>, or <italic>myo</italic>.

We then overexpressed Tkv* while removing each of the Activin ligands individually and found that Tkv* was unable to rescue the decreased pale R8 subtypes induced by dActβRNAi and MyoRNAi. Tkv* did, however, induce enough co-expression in dawRNAi retinas to achieve a statistically significant rescue (28% Rh5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>).

Therefore, Dpp and Gbb may form a heteromeric complex to activate Tkv for pale R8 subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). For Babo activation, dActβ, Daw, and Myo would need to form at least two dimers. A trimer would represent the first example of such a complex in TGFβ signaling.</p><p>Therefore, activating Babo in R8 might require tightly regulated levels of heterodimeric Activin ligand signaling. To explore this, we asked whether removing combinations of Activin ligands could further reduce pale subtypes in retinas. Removing either <italic>dActβ</italic> or <italic>myo</italic> in combination with <italic>daw</italic> did not exacerbate the decreased pale phenotype, but they did when combined with each other (1% Rh5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). Taken together, we suggest that Babo is activated in the retina by the combined signaling of dActβ/Daw <italic>and</italic> Myo/Daw dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). This is based on the following evidence: (1) Removing <italic>daw</italic> resulted in a higher percentage of yellow R8 cells than when either <italic>dActβ</italic> or <italic>myo</italic> were removed, presumably because it disrupts both potential heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>).

(3) Babo-a and Babo-b isoforms were required for pale subtypes while Babo-c is dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–I</xref>). Since Daw normally utilizes the Babo-c isoform for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>), heterodimerization with dActβ or Myo may be required to enable its signaling in pale subtype specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Babo instructs R8 subtype through dSmad2 while Tkv does so through Mad</title><p>Mad represents the R-SMAD downstream of Tkv activity while dSmad2 acts downstream of Babo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peterson and O'Connor, 2014</xref>).

Removing <italic>melt</italic> while expressing Babo* resulted in yellow R8 subtypes in 100% of ommatidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,T</xref>). Similar to Babo*, expressing Tkv* also activated Melt and Rh5 with corresponding loss of Wts. In some photoreceptors that co-expressed Rh5 +Rh6, Wts expression was reduced but not completely lost and, in these ommatidia, Melt was not induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> – yellow arrowheads).

Together, these results suggest that Babo, Tkv, Mad, and dSmad2 are required in R8 cells to induce the expression of Rh5.</p><p>We then asked where the signaling ligands were being expressed. We examined ligand reporter constructs between 45 and 55 hr after pupation (APF), when subtype decisions are thought to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jukam and Desplan, 2011</xref>). A protein reporter for dActβ was strongly expressed in R7 photoreceptors, showing overlap with the transcription factor R7 marker, Prospero (Pros), as well as in some R3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–H”</xref>). To further examine whether dActβ was expressed in pale or yellow R7 cells, we co-stained with Ss, which is expressed specifically in yellow R7s at this stage of their development. Here we found that dActβ was expressed in all R7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–I’</xref> - Ss-positive cells circled in purple, Ss-negative cells circled in red). Since pale R8 subtype is dependent upon the signaling of multiple ligands, another ligand might be uniquely expressed in pale R7 cells. To this end, we investigated additional reporter constructs for Myo, Dpp and Daw. We found that Myo was expressed in all R4 and R7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–J”</xref>) and that Dpp was expressed weakly in all photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K’</xref>, arrows). A Daw transcriptional reporter did not yield conclusive results and may be expressed at levels too low to detect or it might report on an enhancer region unused in the retina.</p><p>Given that ligand expression was promiscuous amongst ommatidia subtypes, we hypothesized that ligand activation by processing factors could provide a subtype-specific signaling mechanism. To explore this, we examined a reporter for the processing factor Amon, which, when removed, resulted in decreased pale subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R,W</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that Amon was expressed almost exclusively in pale R7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–L”</xref> – circled in purple) and very rarely overlapped with Ss-positive yellow R7 cells (1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–L”</xref> – circled in red).</p><p>However, many pale R7 cells were also not positive for Amon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–L”</xref> – circled in white). This may be due to transient expression of Amon in activating ligands to instruct pale subtype in R8 cells. Pupal retinas expressed Amon non-uniformly: Some regions expressed Amon in a percentage of R7 cells similar to what is observed for pale R7s in WT retinas and some in many fewer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M–M’</xref> – compare 23% with 4% in the same retina). This could be due to temporally distinct activation of Amon within regions of the retina coupled with its transient nature. Consistent with this, some pupal retina (45–55 hr APF) exhibited high Amon expression (&gt;30%) in pale R7s, which was completely absent in slightly older pupae. However, even across expanded developmental time, Amon expression in pale R7s averaged 9%, which is highly significant compared to 1% in yellow cells (9.9E-06 using a paired t-test). Amon was also expressed in outer photoreceptors where it may be required for processing ligands that are expressed in those cells for a different function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–L”</xref> – circled in blue). Rare expression of Amon in yellow R7 cells may represent a signaling mistake, which would result in Rh4/Rh5 mispairing in adults, although this is almost never observed. This would lend reason for non-redundant signaling by multiple TGFβ ligands; alternative regulation of other ligands would prevent the propagation of such a mistake.</p><p>We also examined a transcriptional reporter for the processing factor Fur2, which was required for pale subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S–U,W</xref>), but found no expression in photoreceptors. This may be due to the nature of the Gal4 insertion, which may miss an important enhancer. Taken together, these results provide a mechanism for ligand activation specific to pale ommatidia, capable of driving R8 subtype downstream of Ss-negative pale R7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tkv and Babo signal in parallel to establish a ‘double-checked’ pathway, ensuring correct R7/R8 pairing.</title><p>Graph Legend: Red is the percentage of R8 photoreceptors that expressed Rh6, Blue is the percentage that expressed Rh5 and Purple is Co-expression of Rh5 + Rh6.

In most developmental contexts, only one TGFβ pathway – either BMP or Activin – is utilized. Why then is there a requirement for both in R8 specification? To examine this question, we asked how each pathway depended upon the other. Expression of Tkv*+BaboRNAi resulted in loss of pale subtypes similar to BaboRNAi alone (8% vs 5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,E</xref>), while expression of TkvRNAi + Babo* resulted in a gain of pale subtypes similar to Babo* alone (77% vs 80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>). These results suggest that Babo is epistatic to Tkv, presumably: Tkv→Mad→Babo→dSmad2. If this were true, Babo* should be sufficient to rescue MadRNAi-induced yellow R8 subtypes (Babo* + MadRNAi). However, this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>). Alternatively, Tkv might activate Babo, which then activates both Mad and dSmad2 to drive pale R8 subtypes. This would be consistent with ours and other’s data showing activation of Mad by Babo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bickel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gesualdi and Haerry, 2007</xref>). If this were true, simultaneously expressing activated forms of Tkv* and Babo* (Tkv* + Babo*) should be identical to Babo* alone. However, we observed a significant increase in pale subtypes above what was seen when either Babo* or Tkv* were expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Therefore, parallel activity of both Babo/dSmad2 and Tkv/Mad appears to be required for specification of pale subtypes. Perceived epistasis between Babo and Tkv is likely due to the ability of Babo to activate some levels of Mad independent of Tkv, allowing for necessary signaling by both dSmad2 and Mad. In contrast, Tkv signaling in the absence of Babo (Tkv* + BaboRNAi) would only activate Mad and fail to specify pale subtypes without dSmad2 activity. We propose a model where pale R7-specific ligand processing by Amon and possibly additional factors instructs non-redundant signaling by two arms of the TGFβ family to specify pale R8 subtypes as part of a ‘double-check’ mechanism, ensuring correct R7/R8 photoreceptor pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>dSmad2 and Mad may work as part of a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grönroos et al., 2012</xref>), or independently, to bind enhancers of the <italic>wts</italic> or <italic>melt</italic> genes and regulate their expression. In this case, the stoichiometry of Babo and Tkv activity could be important. Retinas that lack both Melt and Wts exhibit the <italic>wts</italic> mutant phenotype, suggesting that Wts is downstream of Melt regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikeladze-Dvali et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the specification of pale subtypes may occur through positive regulation of Melt rather than negative regulation of Wts by Mad and dSmad2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we describe the long-sought signaling mechanisms that ensure correct pairing of yellow R7 with yellow R8, and pale R7 with pale R8 during <italic>Drosophila</italic> retinal development. Our results describe non-redundant, parallel signaling from both Activin and BMP pathways that converge to activate Melt, thereby inhibiting Wts and instructing the pale subtype in R8 photoreceptors. In one arm of a double-checked mechanism for subtype specification, Activin pathway ligands dActβ, Daw, and Myo induce Babo activation of dSmad2. A second arm utilizes BMP ligands Dpp and Gbb to instruct Tkv activation of Mad. Repression of Hippo signaling in R8 cells then allows for Yki to mediate, along with Sd, the expression of Rh5 and repression of Rh6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Our results provide the first evidence for interaction between TGFβ signaling and Melt in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, although it has been recently shown in mouse cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shathasivam et al., 2015</xref>), and therefore may represent a conserved interaction across species.</p><p>Furthermore, we find that cell fate may be regulated through pale-localized processing of widely expressed TGFβ ligands. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, localized furin-type proprotein convertases have been shown to dictate gradients of BMP ligands in the developing embryo and imaginal discs, regulating critical developmental boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Künnapuu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sopory et al., 2010</xref>). However, to our knowledge, this would be the first example in which the specific localization of a convertase is being utilized to specify fate. Many convertases have previously been shown to be broadly expressed in specific tissue types, though some, including furin-type Class one convertases are ubiquitous and widespread (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seidah et al., 1998</xref>]). Few mechanisms for such tight regulation of convertases have been observed and include localized convertase inhibitory signals such as Emilin-1 and ESL-1, described in mice, alternative convertase motifs within the same ligand; and distinctions in convertase recognition motifs and flanking sequences (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Constam, 2014</xref>]). Here, we describe ligand regulation by a convertase on a very precise scale. This suggests that widespread transcription of ligands could be fine-tuned post-transcriptionally to specify fate in close-knit groups of cells making up complex organs. More work is necessary to determine how this process is regulated upstream of convertases and specifically how Ss might be preventing expression of Amon, and possibly Fur2, in yellow R7s.</p><p>Ligands of the TGFβ superfamily have been implicated in numerous morphogenetic developmental processes that depend on long-range diffusion to instruct regional patterning over a distance of many cell diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gurdon and Bourillot, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawrence et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolpert, 1989</xref>). While it may not be surprising to see the reuse of patterning systems already utilized in early eye morphogenesis and axonal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heberlein et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ting et al., 2014</xref>), it is unclear why or how such long-range signals are deployed for one R7 cell to instruct only the underlying R8 and how that signal is confined to a single ommatidial cartridge, and even from R7 to R8, without accidental activation from an outer photoreceptor, where several signals are expressed. Use of a long-range signaling mechanism would require insulation of ommatidial arrays and photoreceptors to prevent ligand ‘leakage’ to internal and surrounding R8 cells, which would result in mispairing and large, non-stochastic ‘clumps’ of similar subtype. Indeed, confinement of cell signaling may reflect a need for the intact boundaries observed between ommatidia throughout pupal development (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Treisman, 2013</xref>]). There are many described mechanisms for limiting the diffusion of morphogens (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>]). One possible mechanism for limiting the action of morphogens to single-cell resolution has been described in the ovarian niche: here BMP molecules are required to specify adjacent germline stem cells (GSC). This is achieved through expression of the glypican, Dally, in cap cells, which binds and stabilizes BMPs on the surface of the contacting cell. Signaling is then mediated through physical contact of cap cell and GSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dejima et al., 2011</xref>). A similar mechanism may exist in inner R7 and R8 cells, which sit adjacently, to help facilitate TGFβ signaling specifically in the pale subtype.</p><p>Previous work from our lab outlined an intricate network of factors necessary for post-mitotic control of R8 subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikeladze-Dvali et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jukam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jukam and Desplan, 2011</xref>). There, the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway has been repurposed to regulate R8 Rh expression. We find that TGFβ signaling can switch off the Hippo pathway to establish pale fate, which is maintained by further Wts/Melt feedback. Though there are several examples of signaling that regulate the Hippo pathway during growth (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grusche et al., 2010</xref>]), few have been shown to have a capacity for specification of cell fate. Our work suggests that many roles of Hippo signaling may remain uncovered.</p><p>Why use two signaling pathways to activate pale fate? One possibility is that combinatorial signaling results in synergistic activation of Rh5 and repression of Rh6. Indeed, activating either Babo* or Tkv* resulted in ~80% pale subtypes while Babo*+Tkv* resulted in 98%. Synergistic activation between cAMP and Arachidonic Acid signaling pathways has been described in vertebrate steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stocco et al., 2005</xref>) and suggests that the stoichiometry of each signaling pathway is critical. Stoichiometry would ultimately impact the level of dSmad2 and Mad and may play a role in binding site affinity or in formation of a transcriptional complex. Alternatively, Rh5 expression may require a temporal series of events: Babo and dSmad2 might first inactivate Wts, followed by Tkv/Mad activation of Melt, again requiring both for robust activation. This may explain the observed Rh5 + Rh6/Wts co-expression when we drive Tkv*: If an R8 cell is first specified as yellow (lack of <italic>babo</italic>), subsequent activation of Tkv* could induce expression of Rh5 without completely eliminating Wts or Rh6 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, yellow arrowheads). Authentication of a signaling event by using two pathways would also help to prevent misexpression of pale fate target genes in a yellow ommatidium, that is Rh4 in R7 coupled with Rh5 in R8, which is never observed in the WT.</p><p>In general, removing components of either Activin or BMP signaling pathways reduces the ratio of pale subtypes to levels observed when genetically ablating all R7 cells in <italic>sev</italic> mutants (4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that they account for the entire instructive signal. But what accounts for the remaining 4% pale subtypes in <italic>sev</italic> mutant retinas? This could represent an ancestral pathway that allowed for an autonomous subtype choice in R8 before the divergence of pale and yellow R7 cell types. Indeed, the UV Rhs duplicated early in the dipteran lineage while R8 expressing Blue or Green Rhs are more ancient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pichaud et al., 1999</xref>). Yet, local cell-cell interactions are a conserved mechanism for photoreceptor pairing across evolutionarily distant species. In the butterfly, <italic>P. xuthus</italic>, stochastic Ss expression directs the specification of additional types of photoreceptors through the addition of a second R7 cell per ommatidium, thus generating a third ommatidial subtype. The choice made in each of the two R7s dictates which Rhs are expressed in surrounding photoreceptors, similarly to the way R7 dictates R8 subtype in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Interestingly, photoreceptors homologous to the outer photoreceptors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> also differentially express color-sensitive Rhs in the three butterfly ommatidial types, suggesting that the R7 signal also influences outer photoreceptor fate in butterflies. It is likely that honeybees use similar mechanisms for producing three ommatidial types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perry et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to see if the TGFβ pathways affect photoreceptor subtype specification in the visual systems of other insect species. Alternatively, residual pale cells could exist in <italic>sev</italic> mutants since removing signaling factors from R7 (<italic>sev</italic> mutant) would leave ligands in other photoreceptors intact, which may be permissive for a small amount of signaling. Indeed, we find expression of dActβ, Myo, Dpp and Amon in some outer photoreceptors. This may explain the difficulty in achieving fully penetrant phenotypes. In fact, Myo signals redundantly from astrocyte-like <italic>and</italic> larval cortex glia via Babo to remodel neurons of the mushroom body γ lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>). Further, dActβ signaling via Babo from both R7 <italic>and</italic> R8 cells is required in restricting arborizations of photoreceptor target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ting et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>The following transgenic and mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains were used in this study:</p><p><italic>UAS-babo* (<bold>9B3</bold>); dppRNAi (8A3); dppRNAi (8D2); dppRNAi (9B2-9B3); UAS-saxQD (HA1A); UAS-saxQD (HA3X); UAS-saxQD (HA5D3); tsgRNAi; sogRNAi; sogY121; UAS-babo-A; UAS-babo-B; UAS-babo-C; and sogY506</italic> were generated in the M.

The Gal4 driver line contained both eyeless-Gal4 and lGMR-Gal4 drivers recombined on chromosome 2. Eyeless-Gal4 is expressed early in the entire eye disc, whereas lGMR-Gal4 is expressed only after the morphogenetic furrow and maintained in adults. Together, these two drivers induce RNAi expression in the whole eye from the time the eye is specified until adulthood. In addition, the RNAi driver stock carries UAS-Dicer2 to enhance the efficiency of generating small interfering RNA. Rh5-GFP, which is expressed only in pale R8 photoreceptors, was used as a readout in the screen. UAS-RNAi lines were crossed to the driver line (eyeless &gt;Gal4, lGMR &gt;Gal4; UAS-Dicer2; Rh5-GFP) at 25°C. The F1 progeny were analyzed under water immersion for a change in Rh5-GFP reporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pichaud and Desplan, 2001</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Parallel Activin and BMP signaling coordinates R7/R8 photoreceptor subtype pairing in the stochastic <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael O'Connor (Reviewer #1); Lee Tzumin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A well-studied example of coordination of cell fate in the service of physiological function is the pairing of the R7 and R8 photoreceptors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina. Randomly fated R7 cells confer the correct matching fate (Rh expression) to its paired R8 cell by setting the state of a bistable switch. The nature of the signal(s) between R7 and R8 is unknown. Here, expanding on a lead from an RNAi screen for altered R8 specification, the authors show that the TGFβ superfamily is required for pale R7+R8 ommatidia, and argue that multiple ligands form this signaling family act as the &quot;signal&quot; between R7 and R8. Notably, both Activin- and BMP-dependent TGF-β signaling pathways are involved with minimal redundancy. This finding is very interesting and the main conclusions are well documented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers commented that the primary issue is how the multitude of TGF-β ligands implicated are expressed, and how they would implement the binary cell fate decision. The reviewers would like to know which cell types express the various ligands, and also requested further data confirming the accuracy of the RNAi and mutant results for the ligands. Some details from their comments follow below. In this case, a satisfactory revision should contain additional data and discussion pertaining to the question of the TGF-β ligand activities.</p><p>1) &quot;Although it is a bit buried in the literature, neither daw nor myo have been shown to be expressed in neurons (at least in larval brains) but both are expressed in glia. There are promoter/enhancer gal4 lines available for all three ligands and these should be checked for expression in the adult retina to determine if the myo and daw signals come from the R7 or glia. If neither of these ligands is really expressed in Rh7 or 8, then the RNAi results are quite questionable. Likewise there is available a dpp GFP line that can be used to examine the source of dpp.&quot;</p><p>2) &quot;One should confirm the Spineless-negative R7s as the site of production for all, or just some, of the required TGF-β ligands. This is critical to substantiate TGF-β signaling as the instructive signal from R7. It could be done easily via targeted RNAi using the mentioned R7-specific drivers.&quot;</p><p>3) &quot;The source of the ligands is relevant for two other issues. The authors suggest that heterodimers may be may account for some odd results, especially for myo and act β. However heterodimer formation requires expression in the same cell. So again determining which cells are the source of which ligands can identify which of several possible heterodimers might be relevant. The ligand source issue is also relevant to the authors’ final discussion point concerning how short range interactions are achieved.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers commented that the primary issue is how the multitude of TGF-β ligands implicated are expressed, and how they would implement the binary cell fate decision.

We first examined a dActβ protein reporter. Consistent with our prediction, dActβ was present in all R7 cells around 45-55hrs APF, which is when R8 subtype specification is thought to occur. It was also present in many R3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(A) dActβ co-localized with the R7 marker Prospero (Pros) (circled in purple).</title><p>It also weakly labeled some R3 cells.

A transcriptional reporter for Dpp was expressed in all PRs (see manuscript). We could not detect expression from a transcriptional reporter for Daw, possibly due to the molecular nature of the Gal4 insertion obscuring a necessary enhancer for retina expression. We were also unable to obtain cellular localization data for a Gbb reporter. Of note, the reporters that did work were all expressed in the R7 cell where we predict dimerization is necessary for signaling to the underlying R8 cell. These results support our hypothesis of an instructive signal for pale fate coming from R7 cells and not from outer PRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;One should confirm the Spineless-negative R7s as the site of production for all, or just some, of the required TGF-β ligands.

We found that dActβ was expressed in both pale and yellow R7s.</p><p>The other ligands, Myo and Dpp, were also expressed in all R7 cells, both pale and yellow. Therefore, we investigated whether a processing factor of TGFβ ligands was specific to pale cells, resulting in activation of downstream components specifically in the pale subtype.</p><p>To examine this, we tested a transcriptional reporter for the processing factor Amon, which gave an increased yellow phenotype when removed using RNAi. We found that Amon was expressed in a subset of R7 PRs. Strikingly, when Amon was expressed in R7 cells, it was almost exclusively in pale R7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We found that the expression of Amon was temporally regulated and was expressed in up to 33% of pale R7s, then tapered off drastically as the retina reached approximately 55hrs APF. However, even across an expanded temporal window, Amon was expressed in an average of 9% of pale R7 cells while it was only observed in less than 1% of yellow R7 cells (N = &gt;2600 ommatidia). Therefore, Amon was expressed for a short period of time when R8 specification occurs with a very strong bias for pale R7 cells.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.016</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>(A) Amon was expressed in pale R7 cells (circled in purple) but not in yellow R7s (circled in red).</title><p>It was also expressed in some outer PRs (circled in blue) and absent from other pale R7 cells (circled in white).

This would explain the fact that Amon was never seen in all pale R7s and varied greatly across retinas and developmental age.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25301.017</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Across a single pupal retina, Amon expression varied, including in R7 cells.</title><p>Dotted blue box represents 23% co-expression with Pros in R7, while the dotted white box represents 4% co-expression in another part of the retina.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25301-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>We also set out to test Fur2 and Tld reporters. A Fur2 transcriptional reporter showed no expression, possibly due to timing or lack of necessary enhancer regions for expression in the retina. We were unable to obtain and investigate a Tld reporter in a reasonable timeframe. It remains possible that either of these processing factors is expressed in pale-specific R7 PRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;The source of the ligands is relevant for two other issues.
