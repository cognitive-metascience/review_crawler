Here we examine the ecological consequences of cooperation by quantifying the fitness of cooperative (large groups) and non-cooperative (small groups) phenotypes in burying beetles (<italic>Nicrophorus nepalensis</italic>) along an elevational and temperature gradient. We experimentally created large and small groups along the gradient and manipulated interspecific competition with flies by heating carcasses. We show that cooperative groups performed as thermal generalists with similarly high breeding success at all temperatures and elevations, whereas non-cooperative groups performed as thermal specialists with higher breeding success only at intermediate temperatures and elevations. Studying the ecological consequences of cooperation may not only help us to understand why so many species of social insects have conquered the earth, but also to determine how climate change will affect the success of these and other social species, including our own.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02440.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02440.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ability to live and work together in groups likely helped the earliest humans to leave their savannah homes in Africa and successfully settle around the globe. In doing so, humans shifted from being savannah specialists to generalists able to cope with a range of different environments. Cooperation is also believed to be a key to the global success of social insects like bees and ants. However, testing the idea that cooperation allows animals to become generalists that thrive in diverse environments—an idea referred to as the ‘social conquest hypothesis’—is difficult.</p><p>Climate change has added a new sense of urgency to understanding how species adapt to changing environments, and some studies of humans and other animals have suggested that cooperation may increase or decrease in changing environments. Living in social groups has both benefits and drawbacks: it helps some animals to avoid being eaten by predators, but it also creates more competition for mates, food or other resources. As such, predicting how climate change will impact human and animal societies has also been difficult to test.</p><p>Sun et al. have now tested the social conquest hypothesis by looking at how changes in environmental conditions affect the social behavior of the burying beetle. These insects find dead animals and then bury them to be eaten by their larvae. Burying beetles often fight each other to ensure that their own young get exclusive access to a food source. However, working together allows the beetles to bury a carcass before flies and other competitors discover it. Sun et al. compared how much the beetles cooperated at different elevations in the mountains of Taiwan. At each elevation the beetles faced different challenges: higher elevations were colder but had fewer flies, while lower elevations were warmer but had more flies.</p><p>Although burying beetles tended to work together more at warmer elevations, where the competition from flies was the most intense, beetles that cooperated with each other were able to successfully breed at all elevations. On the other hand, beetles that were less cooperative were best adapted to raising their young at more moderate elevations, where the climate and competition were less harsh. Similar results were seen when Sun et al. created non-cooperative and cooperative groups of beetles at different elevations and provided each group with a rat carcass. Further experiments that used heaters to artificially warm the carcasses directly proved that cooperation among beetles was indeed encouraged by higher temperatures.</p><p>Many studies have suggested that global warming might cause higher levels of conflict in human societies. But by studying how changes in an environment impact cooperation in burying beetles, Sun et al. provide new insights into how climate change may affect the future success of other social animals, including humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02440.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02440.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>social conquest</kwd><kwd>social conflict</kwd><kwd>grouping benefit</kwd><kwd>burying beetle</kwd><kwd>generalist-specialist</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001869</institution-id><institution>Academia Sinica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Sheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001868</institution-id><institution>National Science Council of Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSC101-2313-B001-008-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Sheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1121435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubenstein</surname><given-names>Dustin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1257530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubenstein</surname><given-names>Dustin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cooperation enables burying beetles to outcompete flies and adapt to a wider range of temperatures as thermal generalists.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social animals, including humans and many insects, have come to dominate the earth, possibly because of their ability to form complex societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laland et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucky et al., 2013</xref>). While studies of animal social evolution often emphasize the environment drivers of group-living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emlen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rubenstein and Lovette, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jetz and Rubenstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>), the ecological consequences of sociality have received less attention. A rare exception comes from our own species, where cooperation is thought to have played a critical role in allowing modern humans to expand rapidly across the earth to exploit a more diverse range of environments than the African savannas in which our ancestors evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laland et al., 2001</xref>). This shift from being a habitat specialist to generalist, and the subsequent ecological dominance by social species, has been termed the social conquest hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson, 2012</xref>). Although this idea has drawn attention from a variety of disciplines, it has proven difficult to test empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richerson and Boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Animals derive a variety of cooperative benefits from living in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Identifying the specific type of benefit individuals receive may help determine the ecological consequences of sociality. If the primary benefit of grouping is to cope with environmental challenges (e.g., predation risk, fluctuating climates, or interspecific competition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korb and Foster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jetz and Rubenstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celiker and Gore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>), cooperation should translate into individuals adopting a generalist strategy that allows them to live in a broad range of conditions and cope with a variety of environmental challenges. In contrast, when species form groups as an adaptation to intraspecific challenges (e.g., competition with conspecific groups or with members of their own group over a lack of breeding vacancies or critical resources; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emlen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">West et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reeve and Hölldobler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsiang et al., 2013</xref>), cooperation should enable individuals to specialize in a single environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of two different causes of sociality, and their ecological consequences (i.e., niche breadth).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) If cooperation is for coping with harsh environments or interspecific competition, cooperative phenotypes (i.e., forming groups; orange lines) will have higher fitness than non-cooperative phenotypes in poor environments or when the pressure of interspecific competition is high. However, non-cooperative phenotypes (i.e., being solitary; blue lines) could have higher fitness in favorable environments because there are few benefits of cooperating. (<bold>B</bold>) Under such a scenario, a species' total niche breadth (black lines) is expanded due to the cooperative phenotype because a social species' total niche breadth equals to the sum of the cooperative and non-cooperative phenotypes. (<bold>C</bold>) In contrast, if cooperation is the best-of-a-bad-job strategy as a response to intraspecific challenges, the per capita reproductive success will be lower in groups than solitary pairs. This scenario often occurs when grouping occurs because of a lack of critical resources, such as when breeding territories are limited in many cooperatively breeding birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emlen, 1982</xref>). Therefore, cooperative phenotypes do not necessarily have higher fitness than non-cooperative phenotypes in either poor or favorable environments. (<bold>D</bold>) As a consequence, cooperative phenotypes will have little influence on the total niche breadth of a species when cooperation is a response to intraspecific challenges. Note that the trade-offs between specialist and generalist strategies occur only in the case of coping with environmental challenges or interspecific competition, and not in the case of adaptation to intraspecific competition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02440.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02440.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02440-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The contrast between habitat specialist and generalist strategies derives from ecological niche theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levins, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Futuyma and Moreno, 1988</xref>). Although niche theory has been used to investigate a range of ecological phenomena including species interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kassen, 2002</xref>), geographic distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>) and the ecological consequences of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clavel et al., 2010</xref>), to our knowledge it has not yet been applied to social evolution. To understand how sociality influences niche breadth evolution, social and non-social populations from the same species need to be examined in a variety of different environments. That is, rather than focusing upon the ecological interactions of a species as a whole, one could separate a species’ total niche into different phenotypic components and then determine how these phenotypes influence fitness in varying environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roughgarden, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolnick et al., 2010</xref>). For social species, total niche breadth can be partitioned into the ‘cooperative’ and ‘non-cooperative’ phenotypes, which correspond to generalist and specialist strategies, respectively if the grouping benefit is to cope with harsh environments or severe interspecific competition.</p><p>Here we examine how group-living impacts the generalist-specialist behavioral tradeoff and its subsequent effect on niche breadth (defined as a thermal performance that influences elevational distribution) in the facultative cooperatively breeding burying beetle (<italic>Nicrophorus nepalensis</italic>). The primary benefit of cooperative breeding behavior in burying beetles is to jointly prepare and bury carcasses more rapidly than their primary competitor, carrion-feeding flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggert and Müller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Trumbo, 1995</xref>). We consider how intraspecific cooperation drives the evolution of thermal specialist vs generalist strategies along an elevational gradient where the degree of temperature-mediated interspecific competition with flies for resources (carcasses) varies with elevation. To determine how temperature influences the degree of interspecific competition, which in turn mediates the cooperative and competitive strategies of <italic>N. nepalensis</italic>, we first documented the natural patterns of group size, cooperation, breeding success, and the degree of interspecific competition with flies along the elevational gradient. We then experimentally manipulated the group size of <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> and the degree of interspecific competition with flies to determine the mechanisms underlying the fitness patterns along the elevational gradient.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Identification and abundance of carrion-feeding insects collected on rat carcasses from June to August 2011.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02440.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02440.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Order</th><th>Percentage (%)</th><th>Family</th><th>Frequency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">Coleoptera</td><td rowspan="4">6.18</td><td>Hydraenidae</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Leiodidae</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Ptiliidae</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Silphidae</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="12">Diptera</td><td rowspan="12">91.89</td><td>Anthomyiidae</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Calliphoridae</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Carnidae</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Drosophilidae</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Fanniidae</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Muscidae</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Mycetophilidae</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Phoridae</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Psychodidae</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Sarcophagidae</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Sciaridae</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Sphaeroceridae</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Hymenoptera</td><td rowspan="2">1.74</td><td>Formicidae</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Vespidae</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Lepidoptera</td><td>0.19</td><td>Tortricidae</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>100</td><td>19 families</td><td>518</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We began by quantifying the natural patterns of group size, cooperative behavior, and breeding success along an elevational gradient in central Taiwan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) where daily minimum air temperature decreased with increasing elevation (χ²<sub>1</sub> = 222.50, p&lt;0.001, <italic>n =</italic> 116).

We found no relationship between cooperative carcass processing and elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or air temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) in small groups. However, investment in cooperative carcass processing in large groups increased with decreasing elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and increasing air temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), presumably because carcasses decompose more quickly at lower elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) where fly abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) is highest. Experimental exclusion of flies from carcasses confirmed that flies indeed enhance carcass decomposition rates; the mean dry weight of carcasses from which flies were excluded was more than two times heavier than carcasses for which flies had access (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our data further showed that in large groups, per capita social conflict (‘Materials and methods’) varied unimodally with a peak at intermediate elevations and air temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Importantly, only investment in cooperative carcass processing, and not social conflict, increased with increasing temperature in large groups. Together these results indicate that an individual’s cooperative and competitive strategies are not influenced directly by temperature-dependent physiological constraints per se because higher ambient temperatures typically reduce the cost of activity for ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Instead, our experiments suggest that an individual's cooperative and competitive strategies are influenced by temperature-mediated interspecific competition for resources, which increases with increasing temperature.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Investment in cooperative carcass processing along the elevational and temperature gradients.</title><p>Investment (minutes, min) in large (closed orange circles, solid line) and small groups (closed blue circles, successful trials; open blue circles, failed trials; dashed line) varied along the (<bold>A</bold>) elevational (group size × elevation interaction, χ²<sub>1</sub> = 7.65, p=0.006, <italic>n =</italic> 45) and (<bold>B</bold>) daily minimum air temperature gradients (group size × temperature interaction, χ²<sub>1</sub> = 9.90, p=0.002, <italic>n =</italic> 45) such that investment in large groups decreased with (<bold>A</bold>) increasing elevation (χ²<sub>1</sub> = 10.30, p=0.001, <italic>n =</italic> 14) and (<bold>B</bold>) decreasing daily minimum temperature (χ²<sub>1</sub> = 9.93, p=0.002, <italic>n =</italic> 14).

To determine if temperature mediates this competition, we simultaneously manipulated group size and the degree of competition with flies along the portion of the elevational range where small groups had higher breeding success.

This generalist-specialist behavioral tradeoff along the elevational gradient in <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> is generated by the tension between an individual's share of the grouping benefit and the group's productivity. At low elevations where the pressure of interspecific competition with flies is highest, individuals in large groups were not only more cooperative at handling carcasses, but they also engaged in lower levels of social conflict, both of which enabled them to outcompete flies. As a consequence, cooperation enables burying beetles to expand their thermal niche to a warmer region where competitors are more abundant. In contrast, we found that the ‘tragedy of the commons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rankin et al., 2007</xref>)—that is the degree of social conflict was higher in large groups, which led to a reduction in breeding success relative to small groups—occurred at intermediate elevations where the pressure of interspecific competition with flies was lower. At these intermediate elevations, non-cooperative groups have marginally higher breeding success than cooperative groups because intraspecific social conflict increased in the absence of interspecific conflict. Nonetheless, this within-group conflict has relatively little influence on the ecological dominance of burying beetles because breeding success is still relatively high in large groups in favorable environments, compared with those at elevations where environments are less favorable. We found a similar pattern in the natural populations (i.e., those without group size manipulations) where breeding success was highest at intermediate elevations even though there are many naturally occurring large groups in this region.</p><p>This study provides the first experimental evidence consistent with the social conquest hypothesis, which argues that cooperation promotes the evolution of generalist strategies when the primary benefit of living in groups is to cope with environmental challenges, including climate-mediated interspecific competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson, 2012</xref>). Preliminary support for this hypothesis comes from a recent comparative study of sponge-dwelling snapping shrimp (<italic>Synalpheus</italic> spp.), showing that eusocial species were more abundant and occupied a broader range of host sponge species than non-social sister species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duffy and Macdonald, 2010</xref>). We have shown experimentally in burying beetles that cooperative groups performed as thermal generalists, but non-cooperative groups performed as thermal specialists. Being cooperative enables burying beetles to extend their range to lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and where competitors are more abundant because individuals in large groups were more cooperative at handling carcasses, which enabled them to outcompete flies. Thus, cooperation allows burying beetles to expand their thermal niche into an environment from which they would otherwise be competitively excluded. Ultimately, studying the ecological consequences of cooperation may not only help us to understand why so many species of social insects have conquered the earth, but also to determine how climate change will affect the success of these and other social species, including our own.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study area</title><p>The elevational gradient in central Taiwan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) covers broadleaf forest at lower elevations and mixed conifer-broadleaf forest at higher elevations.

Investment was quantified as the duration of cumulative time sampled for a 10 min observation period in each hour (100 min in total).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-02440-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.016</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Social investment, Large group, August 15, 2011.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02440.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02440.016</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-02440-media2.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.017</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Social conflict, Large group, July 3 2013.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02440.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02440.017</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Multivariate analyses were performed using generalized linear models (GLMs). If the random effects of repeated sampling of study sites were required, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used. To test for the differences in the probability of breeding successfully between the two group sizes and carcass heating treatments along the elevational and temperature gradients, the outcome of breeding success (1 = Success, 0 = Failure) was fitted as a binomial response term. The environmental factors (elevation and daily minimum air temperature), group size treatments, and carcass heating treatments were fitted as covariates of interest. For the carcass heating treatments, the fitted value of the probability of breeding successfully was compared between heated carcass and control treatments. All statistic analyses were performed in the R statistical software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">R Core Team, 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Yen-Cheng Lin, Tzu-Neng Yuan, Ching-Fu Lin, and Yu-Ching Liu for their great support in the field.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Your study addresses an interesting question, i.e., whether cooperative behaviour allows a species that experiences environmental challenges such as interspecific competition to occupy a wider range of niches than when cooperative behaviour is not exhibited. It includes both natural history elements documenting the actual situation along an elevation (and temperature) gradient followed by directed manipulative experiments. Overall the manuscript is well presented, but at some instances, clarity can be enhanced. The reviewers have also raised some concerns, especially relating to two figures that are central for the main conclusion of the study. In addition there is a concern about the statistical analysis to compare groups. This is explained below. The response to the concerns will be crucial in the decision on your manuscript.</p><p>Two figures that are central for the main conclusion: your study looks at group size and reproductive success in burying beetles as a function of a temperature/elevation gradient. Correlation data shows that burying beetle groups are larger at low elevation/high temperature, which may be due to factors like carcasses decomposing more quickly or that there are more beetles at low elevation. In addition you performed impressive field manipulations where you vary the group size (small and large) of semi natural beetle groups and follow how they perform across the gradient. This shows differences between the two groups sizes in success along the gradient.</p><p>You interpret this in light of the idea that social life allows organisms to invade new habitats where they would fail without sociality. Overall these are interesting data and an interesting idea but there are some concerns. The manipulation experiment data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref> are key to concluding that the large groups are more tolerant to environmental variation than small groups. However, looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it looks like the large groups are doing worse in the intermediate values (and p=0.06 for the chi squared suggests that this is likely real). But you have drawn a straight line through things for large groups and one reviewer is worried that this is missing an important detail: small groups are best at intermediate temperatures and elevations. Moving to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it is argued that there is no trend for the small groups but also, there are no small groups at all at low elevations/high temperature and if one removed the large groups at these points, one would lose the correlation for large groups I expect (was this done?). Without this, it is hard to know whether the correlation is a direct effect or the large groups or just down to the fact that small groups cannot make it for the key ranges where temperature effects would be seen.</p><p>To remove the concerns we would like to see more analyses that follow up on the above 1) Are small groups better under some conditions, 2) What does a mean success plot look like for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (it looks like large groups plummet in the middle) and do the two mean plots differ in shape between small and large groups? 3) What happens if one compares data over the same temperature/elevation ranges in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>?</p><p>Moreover, there is an additional ‘statistical concern’: there are several places in the text where a non-significant result is compared to a significant result and this is used to imply that one is biologically different to the other: e.g., temperature does not affect small groups (non significant) but it does effect large groups (significant). However, this is not the way to analyse this. Rather, these should be tested against each other to compare them. Finally, the practice of drawing a straight line through non-significant results that have high variance intuitively seems off: please reconsider.</p><p>It seems that small groups are good for some ranges and large ones for others and the beetles appear to be responding to this. If correct, then this suggests that the ability to be socially <italic>plastic</italic> allows them to tolerate more of a range in climate. This is a bit different to what you are suggesting: the large groups are no longer generalist but the species range is likely increased by being able to make large or small groups when needed. So, dependent on the additional analyses, the narrative of the paper would need to be reworked in response to this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02440.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Looking at</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, it looks like the large groups are doing worse in the intermediate values (and p=0.06 for the chi squared suggests that this is likely real). But you have drawn a straight line through things for large groups and one reviewer is worried that this is missing an important detail: small groups are best at intermediate temperatures and elevations</italic>.</p><p>This is a very important point, and one that we apparently failed to make clear in the original manuscript. As you suggest, we now also interpret the result more clearly as small groups have marginally higher reproductive success than large groups at intermediate temperatures and elevations. These changes make the results fit even better in our generalist-specialist trade-off framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). That is, small groups perform as thermal specialists and do best at intermediate temperatures and elevations, whereas as large groups are generalists with wider thermal niches, but lower reproductive success. The detailed discussion of this result is now added in the text and the figure legend of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>Moving to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, it is argued that there is no trend for the small groups but also, there are no small groups at all at low elevations/high temperature and if one removed the large groups at these points, one would lose the correlation for large groups I expect (was this done?).

We actually did perform our experiments for both large and small groups at all elevations, but since all small group breeding attempts failed at low elevations, we did not show these data in the original figure. In other words, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> originally only showed total investment of <italic>successful</italic> breeding events to avoid the potential complications of including failed breeding events. We now realize this may have been misleading, so we have added the investment data of failed breeding events to the figure and analyses. Importantly, adding these points has no effect on the analyses, and the original pattern of investment for small groups remains the same (in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>To remove the concerns we would like to see more analyses that follow up on the above 1) Are small groups better under some conditions, 2) What does a mean success plot look like for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>(it looks like large groups plummet in the middle) and do the two mean plots differ in shape between small and</italic> <italic>large groups?</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have added these new analyses.

We agree that this is a more appropriate way to analyze our data. We have added the analyses for every comparison, as suggested.
