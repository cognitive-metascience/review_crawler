How these molecules are delivered to the sensory cilium and whether they rely on one another for specific transport remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether the visual pigment, rhodopsin, is critical for delivering other signaling proteins to the sensory cilium of photoreceptor cells, the outer segment. Rhodopsin is the most abundant outer segment protein and its proper transport is essential for formation of this organelle, suggesting that such a dependency might exist. Indeed, we demonstrated that guanylate cyclase-1, producing the cGMP second messenger in photoreceptors, requires rhodopsin for intracellular stability and outer segment delivery. We elucidated this dependency by showing that guanylate cyclase-1 is a novel rhodopsin-binding protein. These findings expand rhodopsin’s role in vision from being a visual pigment and major outer segment building block to directing trafficking of another key signaling protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12058.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12058.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12058.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our vision begins with light being captured by the rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina at the back of the eye. Photoreceptors have large antennae, termed outer segments, which contain specialized proteins that produce electrical signals when stimulated by light. However, it remains mostly unknown how these signaling proteins are delivered specifically to this part of the cell.</p><p>A light-capturing receptor called rhodopsin is by far the most abundant component of the outer segment and the only one whose transport route through the cell has been well mapped. By examining mice that had been genetically modified to lack rhodopsin, Pearring et al. have now investigated whether the rhodopsin transport pathway also delivers other signaling proteins to the outer segment.</p><p>These studies revealed that a protein called guanylate cyclase 1, which makes a messenger molecule inside rod and cone cells, is the only outer segment protein whose delivery to the outer segment and stability inside the cell rely on rhodopsin. Guanylate cyclase literally ‘piggybacks’ on rhodopsin on its route to the outer segment, as these proteins bind to one another . Therefore, rhodopsin is not just a light-sensing receptor protein; it also serves as a “trafficking guide” for another key protein in the same signaling pathway.</p><p>As Pearring et al. have shown that the majority of outer segment proteins are delivered independently of rhodopsin, future studies will need to search for alternative protein transport pathways in photoreceptor cells. Whether receptor molecules other than rhodopsin stabilize and deliver fellow members of their signaling pathways to specific cell structures also remains to be discovered.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12058.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12058.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>membrane protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>sensory cilium</kwd><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>guanylate cyclase</kwd><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY22508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearring</surname><given-names>Jillian N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Non-restricted grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Nelson Trust Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY025732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearring</surname><given-names>Jillian N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY12859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY5722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY025558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spencer</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rather than relying on intrinsic intracellular targeting information, the key phototransduction enzyme guanylate cyclase 1 is delivered to the photosensory cilium with the visual pigment rhodopsin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Photoreceptor cells transform information entering the eye as photons into patterns of neuronal electrical activity. This transformation takes place in the sensory cilium organelle, the outer segment. Outer segments are built from a relatively small set of structural and signaling proteins, including components of the classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phototransduction cascade. Such a distinct functional and morphological specialization allow outer segments to serve as a nearly unmatched model system for studying general principles of GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arshavsky et al., 2002</xref>) and, in more recent years, a model for ciliary trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nemet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pearring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and Deretic, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite our deep understanding of visual signal transduction, little is known about how the outer segment is populated by proteins performing this function. Indeed, nearly all mechanistic studies of outer segment protein trafficking have been devoted to rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nemet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and Deretic, 2014</xref>), which is a GPCR visual pigment comprising the majority of the outer segment membrane protein mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palczewski, 2006</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for outer segment delivery of other transmembrane proteins remain essentially unknown. Some of them contain short outer segment targeting signals, which can be identified through site-specific mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deretic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pearring et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salinas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sung et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2004</xref>). A documented exception is retinal guanylate cyclase 1 (GC-1), whose exhaustive mutagenesis did not yield a distinct outer segment targeting motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>GC-1 is a critical component of the phototransduction machinery responsible for synthesizing the second messenger, cGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). GC-1 is the only guanylate cyclase isoform expressed in the outer segments of cones and the predominant isoform in rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baehr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). GC-1 knockout in mice is characterized by severe degeneration of cones and abnormal light-response recovery kinetics in rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, a very large number of GC-1 mutations found in human patients causes one of the most severe forms of early onset retinal dystrophy, called Leber’s congenital amaurosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kitiratschky et al., 2008</xref>). Many of these mutations are located outside the catalytic site of GC-1, which raises great interest in understanding the mechanisms of its intracellular processing and trafficking.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that, rather than relying on its own targeting motif, GC-1 is transported to the outer segment in a complex with rhodopsin. We conducted a comprehensive screen of outer segment protein localization in rod photoreceptors of rhodopsin knockout (<italic>Rho<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice and found that GC-1 was the only protein severely affected by this knockout. Next, we showed that this unique property of GC-1 is explained by its interaction with rhodopsin, which likely initiates in the biosynthetic membranes and supports both intracellular stability and outer segment delivery of this enzyme. These findings explain how GC-1 reaches its specific intracellular destination and also expand the role of rhodopsin in supporting normal vision by showing that it guides trafficking of another key phototransduction protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GC-1 is the outer segment-resident protein severely down-regulated in rhodopsin knockout rods</title><p>This study was initiated by testing the hypothesis that rhodopsin, by far the most abundant outer segment protein whose proper transport is essential for formation of this organelle, may affect trafficking and abundance of outer segment membrane proteins.

All experiments were performed with animals sacrificed on postnatal day 21 when the rudimentary outer segments of <italic>Rho<sup>-/-</sup></italic> rods are fully formed, but photoreceptor degeneration that eventually occurs in these mice remains minimal.</p><p>Remarkably, nine out of ten proteins were localized specifically to the ciliary extensions of the <italic>Rho<sup>-/-</sup></italic> rods.

Two chimeras were generated by exchanging the seven-helical cores and C-terminal sequences between rhodopsin and another GPCR, serotonin receptor Htr6, whose topology is close to rhodopsin.

Therefore, both intracellular stability and outer segment delivery of GC-1 rely directly on rhodopsin and not on the activity of the ciliary trafficking pathway driven by rhodopsin’s C-terminus. The most straightforward explanation of this finding is that stability and trafficking of GC-1 are being supported by its binding to rhodopsin – a hypothesis tested in the next set of experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GC-1 is a rhodopsin-interacting protein</title><p>We investigated whether GC-1 and rhodopsin interact with one another by co-precipitating them from mouse retinal membranes solubilized in a mild detergent, dodecyl maltoside. The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> demonstrates that a large fraction of GC-1 can be co-precipitated with rhodopsin using the monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody 1D4. The specificity of this co-precipitation was established by replacing 1D4 with non-immune mouse IgG and by performing the experiment in the presence of the 1D4 epitope-blocking peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hodges et al., 1988</xref>). Neither rhodopsin nor GC-1 was precipitated under these conditions. We also probed the 1D4 precipitate for the chaperone protein, DnaJB6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which was previously shown to link GC-1 to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) particle for ciliary transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas a strong DnaJB6 staining was identified in the retinal lysate, it did not precipitate with the rhodopsin-GC-1 complex. This suggests that, unlike the interaction with rhodopsin, the GC-1 interaction with DnaJB6 is transient. Following a recent report that another rhodopsin-binding protein is peripherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becirovic et al., 2014</xref>), we also probed the rhodopsin precipitate for peripherin. However, no appreciable fraction of peripherin was found in precipitate, both under our experimental conditions and in membranes dissolved in Triton X-100 as in their study. Given that these authors did not show what fraction of total peripherin was precipitating with rhodopsin in their assays, it is hard to fully reconcile these observations, although it is highly unlikely that rhodopsin’s interaction with peripherin could be as prominent as that with GC-1.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12058.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Guanylate cyclase 1 (GC-1) co-precipitation with rhodopsin from mouse retinal lysate. </title> <p>(<bold>A</bold>) GC-1 and rhodopsin co-precipitation by monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody 1D4.

The co-precipitated fraction of GC-1 diminished when we increased the concentration of dodecyl maltoside, or used Triton X-100 instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Such instability of membrane protein complexes in detergent solutions is a common phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prive, 2007</xref>), and we believe that this likely hindered identification of GC-1’s interaction with rhodopsin in the past.</p><p>The reciprocal co-precipitation of rhodopsin by the monoclonal anti-GC-1 antibody 1S4 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. The challenge of this experiment was that rhodopsin in mouse rods is expressed at a 1400-fold molar excess over GC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peshenko et al., 2011b</xref>). Therefore, the theoretical limit of rhodopsin bound to GC-1 is only 0.07% of its total amount, and its detection requires special measures to reduce non-specific rhodopsin binding to the beads. We addressed this issue by employing two strategies. First, we improved the molar ratio between GC-1 and rhodopsin by using retinal lysates from <italic>Rho<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, which express twice less rhodopsin without affecting the amounts of other outer segment proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calvert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2004</xref>). Second, we used a minimal amount of beads fully saturated with anti-GC-1 antibodies, just sufficient to precipitate the majority of GC-1 in the lysate. Under these conditions, rhodopsin precipitation with anti-GC-1 antibody exceeded non-specific background with non-immune IgG by over six-fold (6.5 ± 1.7, n=3).</p><p>Taken together and combined with our finding that the intracellular stability of GC-1 is critically dependent on the presence of rhodopsin, these data demonstrate that rhodopsin and GC-1 form a complex in photoreceptor cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings reported in this study expand our understanding of how the photoreceptor’s sensory cilium is populated by its specific membrane proteins. We have found that rhodopsin serves as an interacting partner and a vehicle for ciliary delivery of a key phototransduction protein, GC-1. This previously unknown function adds to the well-established roles of rhodopsin as a GPCR visual pigment and a major building block of photoreceptor membranes. We further showed that GC-1 is unique in its reliance on rhodopsin, as the other nine proteins tested in this study were expressed in significant amounts and faithfully localized to rod outer segments in the absence of rhodopsin.</p><p>Our data consolidate a number of previously published observations, including a major puzzle related to GC-1: the lack of a distinct ciliary targeting motif encoded in its sequence. The shortest recombinant fragment of GC-1 which localized specifically to the outer segment was found to be very large and contain both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karan et al., 2011</xref>). Our study shows that GC-1 delivery requires rhodopsin and, therefore, can rely on specific targeting information encoded in the rhodopsin molecule. Interestingly, we also found that this information can be replaced by an alternative ciliary targeting sequence from a GPCR not endogenous to photoreceptors. This suggests that the functions of binding/stabilization of GC-1 and ciliary targeting are performed by different parts of the rhodopsin molecule.</p><p>Our findings also shed new light on the report that both rhodopsin and GC-1 utilize IFT for their ciliary trafficking and co-precipitate with IFT proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2009</xref>). The authors hypothesized that GC-1 plays a primary role in assembling cargo for the IFT particle bound for ciliary delivery. Our data suggest that it is rhodopsin that drives this complex, at least in photoreceptor cells where these proteins are specifically expressed. Unlike GC-1’s reliance on rhodopsin for its intracellular stability or outer segment trafficking, rhodopsin does not require GC-1 as its expression level and localization remain normal in rods of GC-1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baehr et al., 2007</xref>; and this study). The outer segment trafficking of cone opsins is not affected by the lack of GC-1 either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baehr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karan et al., 2008</xref>), although GC-1 knockout cones undergo rapid degeneration, likely because they do not express GC-2 – an enzyme with redundant function. The primary role of rhodopsin in guiding GC-1 to the outer segment is further consistent with rhodopsin directly interacting with IFT20, a mobile component of the IFT complex responsible for recruiting IFT cargo at the Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keady et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It was also reported that GC-1 trafficking requires participation of chaperone proteins, most importantly DnaJB6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2009</xref>). Our data suggest that GC-1 interaction with DnaJB6 is transient, most likely in route to the outer segment, since we were not able to co-precipitate DnaJB6 with GC-1 from whole retina lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, the majority of GC-1 co-precipitates with rhodopsin from these same lysates, suggesting that these proteins remain in a complex after being delivered to the outer segment. Although our data do not exclude that the mature GC-1-rhodopsin complex may contain additional protein component(s), our attempts to identify such components by mass spectrometry have not yielded potential candidates.</p><p>Interestingly, GC-1 was previously shown to stably express in cell culture where it localizes to either ciliary or intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peshenko et al., 2015</xref>). This strikes at the difference between the composition of cellular components supporting membrane protein stabilization and transport in cell culture models versus functional photoreceptors. The goal of future experiments is to determine whether these protein localization patterns would be affected by co-expressing GC-1 with rhodopsin, thereby gaining further insight into the underlying intracellular trafficking mechanisms.</p><p>Finally, GC-1 trafficking was reported to depend on the small protein RD3, which is thought to stabilize both guanylate cyclase isoforms, GC-1 and GC-2, in biosynthetic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zulliger et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of GC-1, this stabilization would be complementary to that by rhodopsin and potentially could take place at different stages of GC-1 maturation and trafficking in photoreceptors. Another proposed function of RD3 is to inhibit the activity of guanylate cyclase isoforms outside the outer segment in order to prevent undesirable cGMP synthesis in other cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peshenko et al., 2011a</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study explains how GC-1 reaches its intracellular destination without containing a dedicated targeting motif, expands our understanding of the role of rhodopsin in photoreceptor biology and extends the diversity of signaling proteins found in GPCR complexes to a member of the guanylate cyclase family. Provided that the cilium is a critical site of GPCR signaling in numerous cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schou et al., 2015</xref>), it would be interesting to learn whether other ciliary GPCRs share rhodopsin’s ability to stabilize and deliver fellow members of their signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>WT C57BL/6J mice were from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME), WT CD-1 mice were from Charles River, <italic>Rho <sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lem et al., 1999</xref>) were kindly provided by Janis Lem (Tufts University), and fixed eyecups from <italic>Gucy2e<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 1999</xref>) were kindly provided by Shannon Boye (University of Florida).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Primary antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies (with corresponding figures indicated) were generously provided by: David Garbers, University of Texas Southwestern (pAb L670, anti-GC2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); Alexander Dizhoor, Salus University (pAb KHD, anti-RetGC1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); Wolfgang Baehr, University of Utah (mAb 1S4, anti-RetGC1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); Robert Molday, University of British Columbia (mAb 1D1 PMC, anti-CNGα1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); Steven Pittler, University of Alabama at Birmingham (pAb, anti-CNGβ1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>); Gabriel Travis, University of California Los Angeles (pAb, anti-peripherin residues 296–346; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>); Jeremy Nathans, Johns Hopkins University (pAb, anti-protocadherin 21 C-terminus; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>); Stefan Heller, Stanford University (pAb, anti-R9AP residues 144–223; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>The polyclonal antibody against Rom-1 was generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gospe et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two expert peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The experts' comments together with the Reviewing Editor's assessment form the basis of this letter, and their reviews are included at the end. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nikolai Artemyev (Reviewer #1) and Theodore Wensel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers and the editor were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. The only suggestion, and it is just that – a suggestion – is to consider looking at GC1 and rhodopsin co-localization in transfected cells. We look forward to receiving the revised version of your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study by Pearring et al. is interesting and well executed. The authors investigated which of the outer segment membrane resident proteins depend on rhodopsin for proper localization using Rho KO mice. Out of the ten examined proteins, only GC1 failed to traffic to the OS in the absence rhodopsin and was severely downregulated. Moreover, GC1 was found to directly interact with rhodopsin, thus suggesting the mechanism for rhodopsin in the transport of GC1. The conclusion is that GC1 is delivered to the OS in the complex with rhodopsin seems as the most probable, but not exclusive, interpretation of the findings. Hypothetically, rhodopsin may stabilize or chaperone GC1, but then mature GC1 can traffic to the OS independent of rhodopsin. Co-immunoprecipitation of GC1 and rhodopsin does not rule out the latter possibility if the binding is induced by mild destabilization of GC1 by detergent. A few additional experiments could bolster the authors' conclusions. In transfected HEK293 cells, rhodopsin localizes to the plasma membrane even in the absence of the C-terminal targeting signal, whereas GC1 is restricted to the ER. The authors can test if co-transfection with rhodopsin will target GC1 to the plasma membrane. Also, it would be helpful to confirm the binding of rhodopsin to GC1 in the OS by means other than IP (proximity ligation assay, FRET, etc.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and well-executed study revealing that binding to rhodopsin is essential for guanylate cyclase isoform GC-1 trafficking to rod outer segments. Although this appears to be a one-of-a-kind interaction in rods, it has potential implications for disease mechanisms, and there may be analogous mechanisms in other ciliated cells. The quality of the data is excellent, with quantitative comparisons being carried out by MS and by carefully calibrated immunoblotting. The comparison of IP efficiencies in different detergents is an important procedure that should be used more often for membrane protein complexes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12058.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers and the editor were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.

It might be a better idea to address it in a separate investigation, in collaboration with one of the laboratories currently conducting this cell culture work and also performing functional assays of expressed GC1. Or, perhaps, our study will inspire them to pursue such a follow-up study, whereas our focus would remain on elucidating ciliary trafficking pathways in photoreceptors. We hope the reviewer understands; we certainly do not mean to just dismiss this thoughtful comment.</p><p>Regarding the second point of Reviewer #1, we cannot completely dismiss the hypothetic possibility that rhodopsin may stabilize or chaperone GC1, but then mature GC1 can traffic to the OS independent of rhodopsin. We think, however, that our detergent result argues that rhodopsin-GC1 complex is de-stabilized rather than stabilized by detergent, as the complex was readily breaking apart when the concentration of a very mild detergent, dodecyl maltoside, was increased from a low value (0.1%) to the levels at which this detergent is used in the majority of published studies. We addressed this concern by replacing “indicating” with “suggesting” in the paragraph outlining this logic. Regarding FRET or proximity ligation assay, we thought about these options, but unfortunately they do not apply to the conditions of outer segment membranes containing 6 mM rhodopsin. This concentration is so high that rhodopsin is always within the FRET or PLA distance to other proteins populating these membranes, regardless of whether they are in a proper complex.</p></body></sub-article></article>
