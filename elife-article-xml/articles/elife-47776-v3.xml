Here, we identify a subset of lymphoid organ sinus lining macrophage (SMs) that provide a cell-cell contact portal, which facilitates the uptake of HIV-1 viral-like particles (VLPs) by FDCs and B cells in mouse lymph node. Central for portal function is the bridging glycoprotein MFG-E8. Using a phosphatidylserine binding domain and an RGD motif, MFG-E8 helps target HIV-1 VLPs to αv integrin bearing SMs. Lack of MFG-E8 or integrin blockade severely limits HIV-1 VLP spread onto FDC networks. Direct SM-FDC virion transfer also depends upon short-lived FDC network abutment, likely triggered by SCSM antigen uptake. This provides a mechanism for rapid FDC loading broadening the opportunity for rare, antigen reactive follicular B cells to acquire antigen, and a means for HIV virions to accumulate on the FDC network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>milk fat globule-EGF factor 8</kwd><kwd>alpha v beta 3 integrin</kwd><kwd>subcapsular sinus macrophage</kwd><kwd>follicular dendritic cell</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Chung</given-names></name><name><surname>Kehrl</surname><given-names>John H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intravital imaging with HIV-1 viral-like particle in mouse model reveals a mechanism for HIV-1 uptake by subcapsular sinus macrophages that facilitates HIV-1 spreading tofollicular dendritic and B cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Afferent lymphatics deliver local infectious agents and subcutaneously administered antigens via the lymph to nearby lymph nodes (LNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friedlaender and Baer, 1972</xref>). As the lymph flows through the subcapsular sinus, macrophages that line the sinus floor (SCSMs) can actively uptake antigenic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco and Batista, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fossum, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nossal et al., 1965</xref>). For example, locally injected ultraviolet-light inactivated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) rapidly appeared in the lymph and accumulated at discrete sites on SCSMs. While the mechanism responsible for VSV capture and accumulation on the SCSM was not identified, it did not depend upon natural antibody and complement C3 fixation as no defect in SCSM VSV retention occurred in animals that lacked C3. Furthermore, the capture mechanism was not unique to VSV as SCSMs also retained locally injected adenovirus and vaccinia virus as well as HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus like particles (VLPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junt et al., 2007</xref>). Implicating the SCSM scavenger receptor CD169/sialoadhesin in HIV-1 and MLV-VLPs uptake, antibodies directed against CD169 reduced VLP capture. A known CD169 target sialyllactose is found on gangliosides embedded in the HIV-1 and MLV lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). Besides CD169 SCSM likely employ multiple other receptors to capture material flowing in the lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Once bound to an SCSM, a virus such as VSV rapidly translocate along the SCSM membrane penetrating the SCS floor. SCSM membrane processes bearing virus project into the underlying B cell follicle. This allows migrating virus-specific B cells access to the viral particles. In VSV infection, SCSM macrophage depletion compromised viral retention, worsened viremia, and impaired B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junt et al., 2007</xref>). Somewhat analogously, captured murine leukemia virus VLPs translocated along the SCSM membrane becoming available to B1 B cells, a target of MLV infection. Once infected the B1 cells migrated to other lymph nodes to spread the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). Neither the VSV or the MLV-VLP studies identified the mechanism that transports viral particles across the SCS floor facilitating their delivery to B cells in the lymph node follicle. Furthermore, neither study examined the transfer of the virions or VLPs to the underlying FDC network. FDCs are critical for humoral immunity as they serve as a long-term repository for unprocessed antigens and form a framework for the germinal center and B cell memory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mandels et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>In patients infected with HIV-1 the ability of FDCs to retain HIV-1 virion for prolonged durations poses a significant challenge to the eradication of the infection. The FDC HIV-1-reservoir contributes to low level viremia. It also provides a potential source of infectious virus for the viral resurgence that typically occurs following treatment interruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heath et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schacker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). Important for FDC retention of virions is the complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21). FDCs prominently express CR2, which binds the complement components C3d and iC3b. FDCs also express a related protein termed CR1 (CD35), which binds C3b, iC3b, C4b, and iC4b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll, 1998</xref>). Virions become associated with complement components due to their recognition by natural and specific antibodies that fix complement. This allows FDC complement receptors to retain the HIV-1 virions as immune complexes (IC) on lymphoid organ FDC networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Antibodies that recognize CD21/CD35 are used to identify FDCs in tissue sections. While follicular B cells also express CR2, they can be distinguished from FDCs based on their morphology and lower CR2 expression level. Another marker used to recognize FDCs in tissue sections is FDC-M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haley et al., 1995</xref>). The FDC-M1 antibody binds MFG-E8, a bridging molecule that possesses a phosphatidylserine (PS) binding domain and a second domain that contains an RGD motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kranich et al., 2008</xref>). Human and mouse MFG-E8 have two PS binding domains termed C1 and C2. Human MFG-E8 has a single RGD motif binding domain while the mouse has a short and an extended version, which possesses a solitary, or two RGD motif binding domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanayama et al., 2002</xref>). In lymphoid organs, MFG-E8 binds PS bearing apoptotic cells delivering them to αvβ3 integrin bearing tingible body macrophages (TBM). Engagement of αvβ3 integrins promotes the phagocytosis and eventual destruction of the apoptotic cell by the macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano et al., 2004</xref>). Besides, binding apoptotic cells, MFG-E8 and related proteins can bind PS present in viral envelopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morizono and Chen, 2014</xref>). As HIV-1 viral particles bud from the host cell, the viral envelope can selectively acquire proteins and lipids from host membranes. While PS is normally located on the plasma membrane inner leaflet during viral budding the PS becomes exposed on the HIV-1 envelope potentially serving as a target for MFG-E8 and related PS binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morizono and Chen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Shroff, 2018</xref>). Because MFG-E8 is widely expressed and found at substantial concentrations in blood and potentially the lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kishi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>); most HIV-1 virions likely bear MFG-E8. This would target HIV-1 virions to monocytes and macrophages that express αvβ3/5 integrins. This would also provide another mechanism in addition to CD169 for SCSMs to capture HIV-1 virions from the lymph.</p><p>In this study, we examined the delivery of HIV-1 VLPs to subcapsular sinus macrophages and the underlying FDC network. In addition, we assessed the uptake of HIV-1 VLPs by naïve lymph node B cells and by gp120- specific transgenic B cells expressing b12 heavy and light chains. During these studies, we found that HIV-1 VLPs accumulated at distinct sites on SCSMs, which co-localized with MFG-E8 and αvβ3 integrins. Integrin blockade markedly decreased HIV-1 VLP uptake and the appearance of the VLPs on the FDC network. Our results indicate that SCSMs can capture MFG-E8 bound material including HIV-1 VLPs from the lymph, and that entrance into an MFG-E8 enriched compartment facilitates the transfer of this material to the underlying FDC network. Finally, we show a more dynamic FDC network than previously appreciated, which can directly contact the overlying SCSMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) VLPs accumulate on discrete site on SMs enriched for MFG-E8 prior to translocation to the FDC network</title><p>The HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 injected near the inguinal LN accumulated on SCSMs located between the LN follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2015</xref>). To check the localization of HIV-VLPs following subcutaneous injection near the inguinal LN, we used intravital 2-photon imaging to collect large image stacks from the SCS deep into the LN follicle at 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) post injection. Suggesting that gp120 does not direct HIV-1 virion uptake, the HIV-1 VLPs (NL4.3-GFP) rapidly localized (1 hr) on the SCSMs that overlie the LN follicle rather than those over the interfollicular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To clarify the uptake patterns, we co-injected differentially labeled gp120 and HIV-1 VLPs. Both intravital imaging and thick lymph node section imaging (SIGN-R1 immunostained to delineate the interfollicular channels) confirmed the differential uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B &amp;C</xref>). At the 6 hr time point some of the VLPs had moved inside the lymph node consistent with early FDC loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). By 20 hr post injection many of the VLPs had transited deep into the B cell follicle, consistent with extensive FDC loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). To begin to assess the mechanism of the FDC loading, we first asked whether another viral particle behaved similarly to the HIV-1 VLPs. We co-injected Murine leukemia virus (MLV) VLPs and 3 hr later prepared thick LN slices, which we immunostained for CD21/35 and CD169 to outline FDCs and SCSMs, respectively. Following injection of the VLPs, both VLP sets appeared on overlapping sites on the SCSMs (~88% colocalization index, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). SCSMs have previously been reported to capture these VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). We also noted that both sets of VLPs localized on lymph node FDCs that had directly contacted the overlying SCSMs. These contacts persisted as they were readily observed at 8 hr post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VLPs accumulated in MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment in SCSM and on the FDC network.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) LN TP-LSM thick volume micrographs of NL4.3-GFP (green) 6 hr (<bold>A</bold>) and 20 hr (<bold>B</bold>) post VLPs injection.

This antibody is known to recognizes MFG-E8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gray et al., 1991</xref>). Again, we co-injected NL4.3-GFP and MLV-RFP and made lymph node sections. Surprisingly, we found that besides identifying the lymph node FDCs, the FDC-M1 antibody precisely delineated the SCSM membrane sites where the VLPs had localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is more evident in zoomed images. The FDC-M1 immunostaining often encased the VLPs, and when not confluent appeared vesicular. These FDC-M1 SCSM defined sites extended into the underlying follicle directly abutting FDCs processes. Intensity mapping of the three signals on SCSMs shows the strong overlap between MFG-E8 and the two VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, far right). 3D-reconstruction of thick section confocal images also shows NL4.3-GFP overlying the SCSM MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> sites, which we termed the MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

To check whether blood-borne HIV-1 VLPs would be captured by marginal zone macrophages and transferred to the splenic white pulp FDC networks, we injected NL4-3-GFP into the blood. After 6 hr we collected the spleens of the injected animals and made thick splenic sections for immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We found a similar scenario as we had noted in the lymph nodes, the accumulation of HIV-1 VLPs on marginal zone macrophages at MFG-E8 rich sites and the appearance of VLPs on the underlying FDC networks. Thus, sinus lining macrophages in contact with the blood or the lymph collect HIV-1 VLPs at sites on the macrophages enriched for MFG-E8. This raised several questions. How does the MFG-E8 become co-localized with the VLPs on the SCSM and the marginal zone macrophages? Are the HIV-1 VLPs coated with MFG-E8? If so, does MFG-E8 target the VLPs to αvβ3 integrins present on the macrophages?</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HIV-1 VLPs bind MFG-E8, which can interact with αvβ3 integrins</title><p>First, we tested whether the HIV-1 VLPs could bind MFG-E8. HIV-1 envelopes are known to expose PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aloia et al., 1993</xref>) providing a potential mechanism for MFG-E8 binding. To determine whether MFG-E8 can bind the HIV-1 VLPs, we used stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to examine NL4.3-GFP VLPs incubated with directly labeled recombinant MFG-E8. The images show MFG-E8 encasing the VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). As expected MFG-E8 bound PS, but not phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Signal intensity analysis showed MFG-E8 surrounding the NL4.3-GFP core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right panels). Due to their strong, condensed GFP signal, we could detect the VLPs by flow cytometry. This provided another method to test whether NL4.3-GFP VLPs bound MFG-E8. We confirmed that the VLPs expressed gp120 by incubating them with the gp120-specific antibody VRC01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> Histogram). Next, we incubated the VLPs with unlabeled MFG-E8 and detected bound MFG-E8 with an MFG-E8-specific antibody. A low level MFG-E8 antibody signal in the absence of added MFG-E8 suggests that the VLPs may have bound some MFG-E8 during their preparation. However, the addition of recombinant MFG-E8 to the VLPs resulted in a strong shift in the intensity of the MFG-E8 antibody staining (~90% of VLPs were MFG-E8<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and directly labeled recombinant MFG-E8 bound HIV-1 VLPs in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). PS containing, but not PC liposomes competed for the VLP MFG-E8 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When we injected mice with labeled PS enriched liposomes the lymph node exhibited an SCSM uptake pattern much like NL4.3-GFP, while inter-follicular and medullary SMs predominately gathered injected PC liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).

Again, many of the NL4.3-GFPs bound the MFG-E8 antibody indicating that had sufficient bound MFG-E8 to allow their detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

To test whether EDIL-3 might substitute for MFG-E8 we tested whether recombinant EDIL-3 competed for the binding of MFG-E8 to human monocytes. Adding a 1:1 molar ratio of EDIL-3 to MFG-E8 reduced MFG-E8 binding to human monocytes by approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Presumably, the SCSMs use different mechanisms for capture, but both types of antigens may move through the MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment. Previous studies have not reported direct SCSM-FDCs contact perhaps due to their fleeting nature. Intravital imaging the FDC network beginning 45 min after injection of ICPE showed a dynamic FDC network shift towards SCSMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).

In this study we used HIV-1 VLPs and mice as a model system to visualize the likely early events in the uptake of HIV-1 virions transiting the lymph and blood by sinus lining macrophages and their subsequent transfer to underlying FDC networks. We identified a mechanism by which an αvβ3 integrin/MFG-E8 shuttle transfers lymph born HIV-1 from SCSM onto FDCs. Furthermore, we suggest that the SCSM MFG-E8 enriched compartment functions as a general antigen transfer portal for B cells and the underlying FDCs. In this paradigm FDCs dynamically react to the delivery of antigen to the overlying SCSMs.</p><p>The afferent lymphatics carry lymph from distal sites to the SCS. The lymph flows through the sinus eventually entering the medullary sinuses before exiting the lymph node via the efferent lymphatics. Some lymph-borne material enters the lymph node by exiting the SCS via the conduits. The molecular mass of antigen is a critical factor for how the microarchitecture handles and distributes the antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerner et al., 2017</xref>). Lymph-borne viral particles and ICs are too large to enter the conduits. They can be captured by the SCSMs that overlie the lymph node follicle for delivery to underlying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco and Batista, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fossum, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friedlaender and Baer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nossal et al., 1965</xref>). Fc and complement receptors assist SCSM in IC capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junt et al., 2007</xref>). CD169 expression helps SCSM capture of HIV-1 and MLV VLPs. Treating mice with an anti-CD169 antibody significantly reduced VLP capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). The later study found the captured VLPs had accumulated in a virus containing compartment (VCC) contiguous with the SCSM plasma membranes. Consistently, our study found that lymph and blood borne VLPs accumulated on SC and MZ sinus macrophages, respectively, at sites enriched for MFG-E8. This finding contrasts with our previous report that locally injected gp120 preferentially localized on SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2015</xref>) and indicates that the VLP gp120 expression does not mediate their uptake by SCSMs. Confirming that VLP gp120 expression does not affect their SCSM uptake, NL4.3-GFP VLPs lacking gp120 exhibited a similar uptake pattern as did the gp120 expressing VLPs (data not shown). This also agrees with the above study, which noted HIV-1 VLP SCSM acquisition did not depend upon gp120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, a study using human genetic diversity found that natural CD169 null individuals infected with HIV-1 had no measurable impact on HIV-1 acquisition and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez-Picado et al., 2016</xref>). This argues that early myeloid HIV-1 capture can likely occur by other mechanisms. Together these studies indicate that SCSMs employ a variety of strategies to capture viral particles and that CD169 and MFG-E8 have overlapping roles perhaps functioning at different stages of the capture process.</p><p>Ultrastructural studies using electron microscopy to study HIV-1-infected macrophages revealed immature and mature virions seemingly in intracellular vesicles, which resembled late endosomes (LEs) or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gendelman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Shroff, 2018</xref>). These correspond to the VCC described above and despite their similarity to LEs and MVBs, they are distinct structures that have a complex three-dimensional form, a unique set of protein markers, and several identifying features including a near-neutral pH and the presence of connections to the extracellular milieu. While initially described in response to HIV-1 infection, VCC-like compartments exist in uninfected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan and Sattentau, 2013</xref>). They often contain other vesicular structures including exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Shroff, 2018</xref>). The MFG-E8 enriched compartment described in this study likely correspond to the macrophage VCC. While additional studies are needed to confirm their identity, the SCSM MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment functioned as a niche for VLP accumulation. Our findings also suggest a constitutive, ongoing transport of MFG-E8 bound material from the lymph through this compartment. Supporting this supposition, MFG-E8 bearing SCSMs are evident in the absence of exogenous immune stimulus. The direct transfer of MFG-E8 bearing VLPs to FDCs occurred. The local injection of recombinant MFG-E8 into Mfg-e8<sup>-/-</sup> animals led to the accumulation of MFG-E8 on SCSMs and the eventual appearance of MFG-E8 on the FDC network. MFG-E8 may also be transported in a retrograde fashion from FDCs to the SCSM. Charging the SCSM αvβ3 receptors with MFG-E8 would provide a mechanism to capture HIV-1 virions that lacked bound MFG-E8.</p><p>In infected patients, HIV-1 virions accumulate and persist on FDCs for months often as ICs. FDCs endocytose HIV-1 ICs into non-degradative compartments, thereby contributing to the persistence of the virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hart et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heesters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith-Franklin et al., 2002</xref>). An established mechanism to deliver SCSM captured ICs to the underlying central FDC network is via the trafficking of noncognate B cell, which capture the ICs using complement receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phan et al., 2007</xref>). However, early in the infection prior to IC complex formation other mechanisms likely exist to help transfer antigens from the SCSMs to FDCs. Furthermore, B cell-mediated IC transfer may be inadequate to transfer large particulate antigens such as a virion. In our studies we failed to observe non-cognate B cell uptake and transfer of HIV-1 VLPs to the FDC network (Park, unpublished observation). Rather we consistently observed an early, but transient abutment of the FDC network to the overlying SCSMs, thereby allowing the direct transfer of HIV-1 VLPs to FDCs. Within 24 hr the FDC network had retracted back to its usual location in the center of the follicle accompanied by the captured VLPs. Notably, interfering with the SCSM/FDC abutment by pre-injecting pertussis toxin severely reduced the rapid VLP loading on the FDCs. The reduced SCSM/FDC abutment by pertussis toxin argues that heterotrimeric Gi protein-mediated signaling contributes to the FDC movement. The most intriguing possibility is a chemoattractant directed movement of the FDC network towards the SCSMs triggered by VLP uptake. However, since the local pertussis toxin injection will affect all the LN cells near the SCS, we cannot conclude that the FDC movement and severe reduction in FDC/VLP loading results solely from reducing the SCSM/FDC abutment. Interestingly, a similar transient FDC-SCSM abutment occurred following the administration of ICs. Identification of the mechanisms underpinning the FDC network movements may provide a means to control the loading of antigen onto FDCs.</p><p>In contrast to our observations, a study using bacteriophage Qβ VLPs demonstrated that non-cognate B cells captured the VLPs and transported them to splenic FDCs. B cell uptake depended upon natural IgM antibody and complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Link et al., 2012</xref>). The authors did not examine macrophage uptake and confined their analysis to the spleen 24 hr after VLP injection. Bacteriophage Qβ VLPs are composed of a T = 3 icosahedral lattice of coat proteins assembled with genomic RNA in absent of lipid membrane with a diameter of 28 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorzelnik et al., 2016</xref>). These VLPs differ substantially from HIV-1 VLPs as they lack lipid components, are unlikely to bind MFG-E8, and are much smaller (150–200 nm versus 28 nm). These differences likely result in alternative mechanisms of VLP capture and transfer to FDCs. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to determine whether the Qβ VLPs are captured by LN SCSMs and to visualize how they are transported to LN FDCs.</p><p>While SCSM use different strategies to capture ICs and the HIV-1 VLPs, both entered the MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment on SCSM. This raised the possibility that this compartment functions as a portal for the transfer of SCSM captured antigens to FDCs and cognate B cells. That MFG-E8 may have a role in the transfer is supported by the poor loading of VLPs on to FDCs in the MFG-E8 deficient mice despite the adequate capture by the SCSMs. Our imaging data clearly shows the direct transfer of both ICs and VLPs from SCSMs to FDCs. An obvious question is how the FDCs acquire the ICs and VLPs from the SCSMs. In the case of ICs FDC complement receptors likely contribute, however, for VLPs the answer is unknown. Still to be determined is whether the VLPs remains MFG-E8 bound and what the role of the αvβ3 integrins play in the MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment. Since αvβ3 integrins support macrophage phagocytosis the SCSM VLPs may internalize the VLPs prior to delivery to the VCC much like exosomes are delivered to the VCC. Furthermore, the binding of the MFG-E8 virion complex to the SCSM αvβ3 integrins may signal the cells via its known role in triggering Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mao and Finnemann, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Cognate B cells with gp120 reactive B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) readily acquired NL4.3-GFP VLPs directly from the SCSMs. We found b12 B cells extending filopodia to directly contact MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> SCSM bearing NL4.3-GFP VLPs. Eventually, the b12 B cells reversed direction pulling the VLP away from the macrophage. Individual gp120 reactive B cells could acquire and simultaneously transported multiple HIV-1 VLPs on their uropod. This indicates that VLPs in MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment retain gp120 recognizable by the b12 B cell BCR. Our in vitro studies suggest that the b12 B cell BCRs can recognize gp120 even when the VLPs are MGF-E8 bound. Yet whether the binding of MFG-E8 to the HIV-1 virions can shape the viral epitopes available to trigger a humoral response remains an open question. While non-cognate B cells transiently interacted with SCSMs bearing NL4.3-GFP VLPs, they rarely extracted VLPs from them. BCR triggered F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility are known to contribute to the traction force generation needed for antigen extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). BCR engagement and antigen acquisition likely altered the behavior of the cognate B cells as they slowed and focused their interest on the SCSM bearing VLPs as compared to B cells that lacked gp120 reactive BCRs. Beside engaging the gp120-specific BCRs the MFG-E8 bound VLPs are likely also recognized by αvβ3 integrins expressed by B cells. The engagement of these integrin receptors can be immunosuppressive. The deletion of αv or β3 in B cells enhances the humoral response to antigens containing TLR ligands and to the influenza virus. The enhancement results from the loss of an integrin-mediated negative regulatory signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>VLPs have been employed as a vaccine strategy in the hope that could advance the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 envelope proteins. Multiple reports have demonstrated that HIV-1 VLPs can induce strong antibody responses in small animal models and macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tong et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonaguro et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, expertise in the generation and usage of VLPs is evolving towards the goal of producing a safe mimic of real HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonelli et al., 2019</xref>). However, care in the evaluation of HIV-1 VLPs vaccine studies is needed. Variation in packaging cell lines and animal models chosen may result in significant variation and cross-species-specific immune responses. Our study utilized non cell-associated VLPs as a mimic of the early stages of HIV-1 virion dissemination in lymphoid organs. While plasma contains significant levels of cell free virus there is little information on the amount of free virus or cell associated virus in the lymph. Yet as much of the plasma virus is derived from tissue sources, it seems likely that it has transited through the lymph and lymph nodes. Limitations of our study include a reliance on a non-replicating VLP rather than a replicating virus. As such to mimic the transit of infectious virions in the blood and lymph, we had to directly inject the VLPs. Another limitation was the choice of a mouse model. Yet this also provided us with enhanced imaging capability and the ability to use B cells with a defined antigen receptor specificity.</p><p>Based on our observations, we propose that MFG-E8 blood levels and lymphoid organ sources of MFG-E8 ensure that most cell-free HIV-1 virus in infected individuals is exposed to MFG-E8. HIV-1 envelope PS provides a means for MFG-E8 binding and MFG-E8 links the virions to αv integrins on host cells. Whether this MFG-E8 opsonization benefits the host or the virus needs further study. MFG-E8 opsonization does promote the delivery of fluid borne virions to SMs resulting in their accumulation in an MFG-E8<sup>+</sup> compartment. This compartment is accessible to antigen-reactive B cells and transiently to FDC processes. Direct SM-FDC virion transfer depends upon a short-lived FDC network abutment, likely triggered by SCSM antigen uptake. Subsequently, the FDCs network contracts toward the follicle center along with its acquired antigens. This provides a mechanism for rapid FDC loading broadening the opportunity for rare, antigen reactive follicular B cells to acquire antigen, but also a means for HIV-1 virions to accumulate on the FDC network.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td>Igh<sup>tm1.1(b12)Nemz</sup></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ota et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td>Available in The Jackson Laboratory <break/>23065</td><td>A floxed neomycin resistance cassette replaced the DQ52-JH cluster in the Igh locus with HIV antibody b12 variable region coding sequence.

Inguinal LN was intravitally imaged from the capsule over a range of depths (10–220 μm). All two-photon imaging was performed with a Leica SP8 inverted five channels confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with 25 × water dipping objective, 0.95 NA (immersion medium used distilled water). Two-photon excitation was provided by a Mai Tai Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics) with a 10 W pump, tuned wavelength ranges from 820 to 920 nm. Emitted fluorescence was collected using a four channel non-descanned detector. Wavelength separation was through a dichroic mirror at 560 nm and then separated again through a dichroic mirror at 495 nm followed by 525/50 emission filter for GFP or Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific); and the eFluor450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or second harmonic signal was collected by 460/50 nm emission filter; a dichroic mirror at 650 nm followed by 610/60 nm emission filter for CMTMR, PE or Alexa Fluor 594; and the Evans blue, Allophycocyanin (APC) or Alexa Fluor 647 signal was collected by 680/50 nm emission filter. For four-dimensional analysis of cell behavior, stacks of various numbers of section (z step = 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 μm) were acquired every 5–30 s to provide an imaging volume of 20–120 μm in depth. Sequences of image stacks were transformed into volume-rendered four-dimensional videos using Imaris software v.9.0.1 64× (Oxford Instruments plc), and the tracks analysis was used for semi-automated tracking of cell motility in three dimensions by using the following parameters: autoregressive motion algorithm, estimated diameter 10 μm, background subtraction true, maximum distance 20 μm, and maximum gap size 3. Tracks acquired that could be tracked for at least 20% of total imaging duration were used for analysis. Some tracks were manually examined and verified. Calculations of the cell motility parameters (speed, track length, displacement, straightness and speed variability) were performed using the Imaris software v.9.0.1 64× (Oxford Instruments plc). Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). 3D-reconstructions from original images from TP-LSM were generated by the surfaces function of the Surpass view in Imaris software v.9.0.1 64× (Oxford Instruments plc), performed with semi-automated creation wizard. The intensities of fluorescent signals in regions of interests (ROI) were measured by LSA AF Lite software (Leica Microsystem). Annotations on videos and video editing were performed using Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 (Adobe Systems Incorporated). Video files were converted to MPEG4 format with ImToo Video Converter Ultimate (v. 7.8.19) (ImToo Software Studio).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Visualization of microanatomy in LN for intravital imaging</title><p>Microanatomy of LN delineated by direct antibody injection before live imaging. To outline blood vessels 50 μl of Evans Blue solution (0.5 μg/ ml in PBS) was injected into orbital or tail vein prior to imaging. To visualize SCSMs in the subcapsular sinuses, purified rat anti-mouse CD169 (3D6.112, BioLegend) was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647. 0.5 μg of Alex Fluor 647 conjugated CD169 antibody in 50 μl of PBS was injected into tail base 1 hr prior to imaging. To visualize FDCs in the B cell follicles, 5 μg of PE conjugated rat anti-mouse CD21/35 (7E9, BioLegend) or anti-CD35 (8C12, BD Biosciences) was injected into tail base 1 hr prior to imaging. Intravital imaging was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>STED microscopy</title><p>STED microscope imaging for VLPs using modified protocol from previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chojnacki et al., 2012</xref>). Labeled recombinant MFG-E8-Alexa Fluor 594 (250 ng) was incubated with NL4.3-GFP VLPs (0.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> of GFP positive particles) at 4°C for 30 min. Ten micro liters of MFG-E8/NL4.3-GFP mixture mixed with 40 μl of mounting solution (ProLong Gold, Life Technologies). Ten micro liters of final mixture was mounted on a slide covered with #1 coverslip. All STED imaging was performed with a Leica DMI6000 SP8X CW gated STED system with a 775 nm depletion laser (STED dichroic slider) and an HC PL APO CS2 100× (NA, 1.40) oil objective. Pixel size was set to 19 nm. Images were acquired with Leica LAS AF software (Leica Microsystem, Inc) and processed Imaris software v.9.0.1 64× (Oxford Instruments plc).

loads HIV-1 viral like particles onto follicular dendritic cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ziv Shulman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers found the work exciting. In particular, the notion that integrins are involved in the trapping and presentation of VLPs was noted as an important and novel finding. However, as you will see from their comments attached below, they raised several issues that will need attention in the revised version of the manuscript. In particular, and most importantly, reviewers were unconvinced about the claim on &quot;FDC chemotaxis&quot;. All three found these observations interesting but felt that the tone of the claims would need to be tuned down or better substantiated experimentally. A possibility that must be considered in addressing this is that these observations could be the result of &quot;B cell pushing FDC dendrites&quot;. Using CD35 stainings will be an important addition. While it appears to be a consensus about this being the main major point, we will encourage you to carefully go through the reviewer's comments to address as much as you can the other points raised. This will help to improve the manuscript as a whole.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Park and Kehrl reports on an analysis of pathways governing the capture of viral particles, particularly HIV-mimetic VLPs, in the lymph nodes, and the mechanisms governing transfer of viral particles to antigen-specific B cells and the FDC network in follicles. They find that HIV virus-like particles and murine leukemia virus VLPs are captured by a subset of subcapsular sinus macrophages with enriched surface localization of the innate immune protein MFG-E8. They present evidence that MFG-E8 binds to phosphatidyl serine exposed on the VLP membranes, bridging the particles to αvβ3 integrins expressed by the macrophages, and facilitating transfer to the FDC network in underlying follicles as well as antigen-specific B cells. The work is detailed and nicely encompasses in vivo experiments supplemented by more controlled in vitro analysis of binding interactions with cells/proteins and purified viral particles. The visualization of a dynamic remodelling of the FDC network to bring FDCs in contact with the overlying macrophage layer shortly following VLP administration is a striking finding. Overall, these findings provide a number of interesting new insights into how viral particles may be recognized and trafficked in lymphoid tissues.</p><p>There are some points that should be discussed and/or addressed through experimental clarification:</p><p>1) It is unclear how the authors view their findings fit in with the studies from the Sewald et al., 2015 study cited in the manuscript, where CD169 was shown to be important for HIV VLP capture; blockade or CD169 KO animals showed greatly reduced HIV VLP capture. In contrast, here the authors show greatly reduced VLP capture by blocking αv integrins (Figure 4A). How does one reconcile these distinct observations?</p><p>2) The authors show in Figure 2D data indicating that substantial αvβ3 binding to the HIV VLPs even in the absence of MFG-E8 (this is noted as &quot;low level&quot; binding in the text but it is more than a log over background). This seems to be consistent with the observations in vivo in Mfg-e8<sup>-/-</sup> mice where VLP capture does not appear to be disrupted. Is the interpretation that MFG-E8 is really mainly important in the transfer to FDCs/B cells and not initial capture?</p><p>3) Some of the flow cytometry binding experiments (e.g., Figure 1G, Figure 2D, Figure 3D/E) are presented as single sample examples, but mean binding results from repeat experiments should be shown, particularly for the human PBMC binding experiments in Figure 3. Particularly in light of the authors' comments about variability in donor monocyte binding, which is not shown.</p><p>4) The closing results statement, that antigen-specific B cells were attracted to and in contact with VLP-bearing SCSMs is not clearly supported by the quantification data in Figure 7E. It's not clear that speed, displacement, or track length are indicative of interactions with the SCSMs. (What is the definition of &quot;straightness&quot;? Is this a permutation of persistence length?). It is also unclear why the antigen-specific cells would be attracted toward the SCSMs but not the wild type cells, if this behavior is driven by some type of chemoattractant before specific antigen encounter.</p><p>5) The study focuses on the trafficking behavior of free virions but cell-associated viral dissemination is thought to be important during real infection. What is the evidence for a role of free virus in dissemination during the early stages of live infection? This would be valuable to discuss either in the Introduction to motivate the study or the Discussion to provide context for the results.</p><p>6) In the in vitro analysis of binding of VLPs to immune cells, it was noted that VLPs did not bind to T cells or B cells, but the Discussion suggests that MFG-E8-bound VLPs could be engaged by αvβ3 integrins expressed by B cells. Do B cells express αvβ3 or not? This discrepancy should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Park and Kehrl examined how virus-like particles are captured by subcapsular macrophages in lymph nodes and deliver them to follicular dendritic cells. The authors inject NL4.3-GFP and then track its localization in vivo. They find an accumulation of these VLP in subscapular macrophages and at a later time point, they detect this protein on FDC network. Similar results were obtained with MLV. Using the FDC-M1 antibody, the authors detected a signal on SCSM which indicates that MFG-E8 is expressed on these cells and this signal localized with the VLP particles by microscopy assay. The authors provide additional evidence for VLP binding on MFG-E8-expressing cells by flow cytometry. A similar phenomenon was observed when VLP were injected intravenously and marginal zone macrophages were examined. The authors show in vitro experiments that prove the binding of VLPs to MFG-E8 and αvβ3integrins. These complexes were also detected in the histology section made from mouse lymph nodes and observed on human monocytes. in vivo, the uptake of NL4.3-GFP by monocytes and FDC was inhibited by αvβ3 blockage. The authors show that MFG-E3 is required for uptake of VLP by FDCs but not by SCSM. The authors demonstrate that EDIL-3 can compensate for MFG-E3 binding. VLP binding to SCSM overlapped with the immune complex bindings. In response to VLP, the FDC network interacts with SCSM in Gai dependent manner. Antigen-specific B cells interact with SCSM bearing VLP and capture antigen from these cells.</p><p>The study shows nicely the location of VLP particles and the mechanism that control its dissemination to the FDC network. The study used imaging techniques that address the question in an elegant way. One major issue is whether the NL4.3-GFP represent a virus without GFP and whether the local or intravenous injection of many VLP represents a physiological condition. Nonetheless, the model shed light on unknown mechanism that most likely plays a role in viral infection. Furthermore, the authors examine FDCs using an antibody which is not very specific for these cells. In order to make solid claims, the authors should use the anti-CD35 antibody at least in some of the experiments.</p><p>Overall, in my opinion, with some additional improvements, the study would be a nice fit to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The interaction between the FDC and SCSM makes a lot of sense and this is a very important point in the study. In Figure 1D, the authors should use a more specific antibody for the FDC. Anti-CD35-biotin is available and should be simple to stain with, and help to precisely prove their point about interaction between the SCSM and FDCs. It would also be nice to show CD35 in inflamed lymph node as well.</p><p>2) The video that shows movement of the FDC network is stunning. However, it is very unlikely that these cells can move at such a speed. These are not lymphocytes or immune cells. To me, it seems that movement of B cells, in a Gai-dependent manner, push the network and therefore it seems to move. Without additional proof, the authors can only state that network comes closer to the lymph node cortex, rather than claiming that FDC actually moves.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>While studying capture HIV and MLV virus particles by SCS macrophages authors made the probably serendipitous (using the anti-MFG-E8 Ab FDC-M1 to stain FDC), but nevertheless very interesting observation that enveloped viral like particles co-localize with MFG-E8, and following up with experiment that indicate a potential role for MFG-E8 on VLP capture by SCS macrophages and transfer to FDCs. Using an array of in vivo and sophisticated in vitro assays they convincingly demonstrate the interaction between PS on VLP and MFG-E8 and that these complexes can bind to αv integrins. The strongest aspects of the study are to me the demonstration of MPG-E8-VLP co-localization in vivo and the pronounced reduction of SCS deposition of VLPs upon αv-combination blockade with antibodies and RGD peptide. However, the data showing the chemoattractant driven shift of FDC network toward the SCS macrophages and extraction of VLPs by B cells are not convincing.</p><p>My suggestion is that the authors tighten up the interesting in vivo demonstration of the αv and MFG-E8-dependent viral capture mechanism, and remove the studies on FDC chemotaxis towards the SCS and cognate B cell capture of VLPs.</p><p>1) One obvious question is why the authors decided to study HIV and not a relevant murine pathogen? They insert some nice human data on monocytes expressing αvβ3, but overall the disconnect between a strictly human pathogen and mouse hosts are a concern. While some mechanistic studies are of course only possible in the mouse system, additional human validation would be helpful to make this a strong HIV paper.</p><p>It was a bit surprising that authors did not followed up on their initial MLV observations. Did they consider species-specific differences for MFG-E8 functions (one vs. two RGD motif binding domains)? Is the αv expression pattern on mouse vs. human immune cells comparable?</p><p>2) Immuno-staining for αv integrin on LN section isn't fully convincing (Figure 3A). Do the authors have positive or negative controls to validate their staining? αv integrins are widely expressed, e.g. on inflamed epithelium, on fibroblasts (αvβ6), or on dendritic cells (αvβ3 and αvβ5, αvβ8).</p><p>Maybe β3 or β5 (which only pair with αv) are better targets for fluorescence imaging?</p><p>Based on the data shown I am not convinced that the conclusion of co-localization of αv with MFG-E8 and HIV VLPs in vivo is justified (even though it appears intuitive, given prior reports on MFG-E8-αvβ3/5 integrin-interactions).</p><p>3) A conceptual problem with the in vivo imaging studies is that reagents (e.g. fluorescent immune complexes and antibodies against CD169 and CD21/35) that may go through the same Ag transport pathway through tissues as VLPs are used to delineate the cells involved in that pathway. How can it be ascertained that these reagents do not also partially stain adjacent cells.</p><p>4) There is not effort to confirm an effect of PTX on the motility of the FDC network. PTX will predictably affect B cell motility and thereby also impair any B cell-dependent FDC loading mechanism.</p><p>Looking at the videos that are claimed to illustrate FDC chemotaxis, I can't help but suspect that the FDC movement is caused by phototoxic effects, most obviously at time 00:20 min:sec of Video 5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47776.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Park and Kehrl reports on an analysis of pathways governing the capture of viral particles, particularly HIV-mimetic VLPs, in the lymph nodes, and the mechanisms governing transfer of viral particles to antigen-specific B cells and the FDC network in follicles.

As the reviewer noted it is likely that some MFG-E8 is already associated with VLPs prep, which can promote αv integrin mediated SCSM capture. Also, in the absence of MFG-E8, Edil-3 may compensate for its loss. Lastly the decreased release of the captured VLPs by the MFG-E8<sup>-/-</sup> SCSM gives the impression that the MFG-E8<sup>-/-</sup> SCSM can efficiently capture the VLPs. While we suspect that MFG-E8 promotes SCSM uptake, our data only allows us to conclude that integrin blockade inhibits SCSM VLP uptake and that MFG-E8 functions in the transfer of the VLPs to the FDC network. We have clarified our conclusions in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the flow cytometry binding experiments (e.g., Figure 1G, Figure 2D, Figure 3D/E) are presented as single sample examples, but mean binding results from repeat experiments should be shown, particularly for the human PBMC binding experiments in Figure 3.

Both the wild type and b12 B cells are attracted to and make contacts with VLP bearing SCSMs. Our tracking data examined the behavior patterns of all the B cell tracks from the intravital imaging space. Although WT and b12 B cell tracks did not have significantly different displacements in whole area of imaging field, the b12 B cells had a reduced mean speed, turned more frequently (moved less straight). When we focused on those tracks that interacted with the SCSMs, we found that the b12 B cell contacted the VLP bearing SCSMs for significantly longer durations than did the WT B cells (Figure 7F). We added the contact data and better explained the motility parameters in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The study focuses on the trafficking behavior of free virions but cell-associated viral dissemination is thought to be important during real infection. What is the evidence for a role of free virus in dissemination during the early stages of live infection?

Yet it is well established that there are significant levels of cell free virus in plasma during acute and chronic infection. Surprisingly there is a paucity of information on the amount of free virus in the lymph. However, as much of the plasma virus is derived from tissue sources, it seems likely that it has transited through the lymph. Furthermore, as lymph nodes are linked in chains, the efferent lymph of primary lymph nodes serves as afferent lymph for the secondary nodes. Viral replication in the primary lymph node likely result in the transit of free-virus to the next node in the chain. Our study was directed at understanding how lymph and blood borne viral particles are delivered and accumulate upon FDCs. We believe our data is relevant not only for HIV infection, but also for the use of viral like particles as vaccine candidates. While the number of VLPs we locally inoculated (0.5 million) likely exceeds the numbers present in lymph some patients have plasma free virus levels in that range. Also arguing that cell free virus transits the lymph, large amounts of free virus accumulate on FDCs in patients. We have added some discussion relevant to this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the in vitro analysis of binding of VLPs to immune cells, it was noted that VLPs did not bind to T cells or B cells, but the Discussion suggests that MFG-E8-bound VLPs could be engaged by αvβ3 integrins expressed by B cells.

Human blood B cells lack αvβ3 integrins, but human lymphoblastoid B cell lines can express αvβ3 integrins. As far as we know human GC B cell expression has not been reported. In human blood only monocytes are likely to capture MFG-E8 bound virions. Interestingly, a recent study indicates that murine CD4 follicular helper T cells can also express αv (Schrock DC et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Feb 15) providing another potential mechanism by which HIV viral particles can bind to CD4 T cells in lymph nodes. In our study the resting lymph node lymphocytes did not express αvβ3 integrins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The study by Park and Kehrl examined how virus-like particles are captured by subcapsular macrophages in lymph nodes and deliver them to follicular dendritic cells.

The study used imaging techniques that address the question in an elegant way. One major issue is whether the NL4.3-GFP represent a virus without GFP and whether the local or intravenous injection of many VLP represents a physiological condition. Nonetheless, the model shed light on unknown mechanism that most likely plays a role in viral infection. Furthermore, the authors examine FDCs using an antibody which is not very specific for these cells. In order to make solid claims, the authors should use the anti-CD35 antibody at least in some of the experiments.</p><p>Overall, in my opinion, with some additional improvements, the study would be a nice fit to eLife.</p><p>1) The interaction between the FDC and SCSM makes a lot of sense and this is a very important point in the study. In Figure 1D, the authors should use a more specific antibody for the FDC. Anti-CD35-biotin is available and should be simple to stain with, and help to precisely prove their point about interaction between the SCSM and FDCs. It would also be nice to show CD35 in inflamed lymph node as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We added data for CD35 stain in Figure 4—figure supplement 3. In this study we already indicated that VLPs strongly initiated FDC abutment on SCSMs. In this new supplementary figure we indicated that CD35 visualized FDC abutments on SCSMs in VLP injected LN. As a follow up to this study we are trying to identify the signals that trigger SCSM/FDCs abutment and to uncover the mechanism of FDC movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The video that shows movement of the FDC network is stunning. However, it is very unlikely that these cells can move at such a speed. These are not lymphocytes or immune cells. To me, it seems that movement of B cells, in a Gai-dependent manner, push the network and therefore it seems to move. Without additional proof, the authors can only state that network comes closer to the lymph node cortex, rather than claiming that FDC actually moves.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot state that the FDC network movement does not depend upon the movement of the B cells as they are intimately associated. Since pertussis toxin will inactivate Gα<sub>i</sub> signaling in both B cells and FDCs, the loss of FDC/SMSM abutment could be dependent on either cell type or both. Assessing the FDC network in relation to the transferred B cells did suggest that the FDC network movement occurred independent of pressure from the B cells, yet this is by no means proof. By confirming the FDC/SCSM abutment by section imaging we can conclude that this phenomenon was not secondary to photo toxicity or secondary to surgically generated disturbance of the vasculature. Further studies will be needed to deactivate Gα<sub>i</sub> signaling in the FDCs without simultaneously inhibiting B cell Gα<sub>i</sub> signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>While studying capture HIV and MLV virus particles by SCS macrophages authors made the probably serendipitous (using the anti-MFG-E8 Ab FDC-M1 to stain FDC), but nevertheless very interesting observation that enveloped viral like particles co-localize with MFG-E8, and following up with experiment that indicate a potential role for MFG-E8 on VLP capture by SCS macrophages and transfer to FDCs. Using an array of in vivo and sophisticated in vitro assays they convincingly demonstrate the interaction between PS on VLP and MFG-E8 and that these complexes can bind to αv-integrins. The strongest aspects of the study are to me the demonstration of MPG-E8-VLP co-localization in vivo and the pronounced reduction of SCS deposition of VLPs upon αv-combination blockade with antibodies and RGD peptide. However, the data showing the chemoattractant driven shift of FDC network toward the SCS macrophages and extraction of VLPs by B cells are not convincing.</p><p>My suggestion is that the authors tighten up the interesting in vivo demonstration of the αv and MFG-E8-dependent viral capture mechanism, and remove the studies on FDC chemotaxis towards the SCS and cognate B cell capture of VLPs.</p><p>1) One obvious question is why the authors decided to study HIV and not a relevant murine pathogen? They insert some nice human data on monocytes expressing αvβ3, but overall the disconnect between a strictly human pathogen and mouse hosts are a concern. While some mechanistic studies are of course only possible in the mouse system, additional human validation would be helpful to make this a strong HIV paper.</p><p>It was a bit surprising that authors did not followed up on their initial MLV observations. Did they consider species-specific differences for MFG-E8 functions (1 vs. two RGD motif binding domains)? Is the αv expression pattern on mouse vs. human immune cells comparable?</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agreed with the reviewer that the mouse immune system cannot fully replicate the mechanisms underlying HIV dissemination in humans. But, the major focus of this study was how and when HIV viral particles becomes located on FDCs in lymphoid organ during the early stage of HIV infection. We chose to use HIV-1 VLPs and the mouse lymphatics and lymph node, as we can readily observe them using intravital microscopy. We initially compared MLV-VLPs and HIV-1 VLPs to determine whether there were any apparent differences in their SCSM uptake and their delivery to FDCs. Since we found no critical difference, it supported our usage HIV-1 VLPs in the mouse system. We did compare human and mouse MFG-E8 and found both could efficiently bound to HIV-1 VLPs and both bound αv integrins of either human or mouse origin. Here is our response to reviewer 1 who also asked about human versus murein αv expression- Murine germinal center B cells express αvβ3 integrins, while non-GC B cells do not. Human blood B cells lack αvβ3 integrins, but human lymphoblastoid B cell lines can express αvβ3 integrins. As far as we know human GC B cell expression has not been reported. In human blood only monocytes are likely to capture MFG-E8 bound virions. Interestingly, a recent study indicates that murine CD4 follicular helper T cells can also express αv (Schrock DC et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Feb 15) providing another potential mechanism by which HIV viral particles can bind to CD4 T cells in lymph nodes. In our study the resting lymph node lymphocytes did express αvβ3 integrins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Immuno-staining for αv integrin on LN section isn't fully convincing (Figure 3A). Do the authors have positive or negative controls to validate their staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for isotype control stain and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D for negative controls. And we also used an internal positive or negative control (VLP signal only, CD51 signal only) to verify CD51 staining signal (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 for isotype control stain).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>αv integrins are widely expressed, e.g. on inflamed epithelium, on fibroblasts (αvβ6), or on dendritic cells (αvβ3 and αvβ5, αvβ8).</p><p>Maybe β3 or β5 (which only pair with aV) are better targets for fluorescence imaging?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer states αv is a partner for several β chains (β1, β3, β5, β6 and β8). Unfortunately, we could not find β3 and β5 antibodies that gave reliable staining with our methods, therefore we had to rely on αv antibodies. Since MFG-E8 binds αvβ3 and αvβ5, the MFG-E8 co-localization with αv antibodies is likely with those integrins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the data shown I am not convinced that the conclusion of co-localization of αv with MFG-E8 and HIV VLPs in vivo is justified (even though it appears intuitive, given prior reports on MFG-E8- αvβ3/5 integrin-interactions).</p></disp-quote><p>To provide more evidence that supports this issue, we added Figure 3—figure supplement 2. And we consider that the FACS data (Figure 2D) strongly supports the direct binding of αvβ3 integrins and MFG-E8 bound VLPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A conceptual problem with the in vivo imaging studies is that reagents (e.g. fluorescent immune complexes and antibodies against CD169 and CD21/35) that may go through the same Ag transport pathway through tissues as VLPs are used to delineate the cells involved in that pathway. How can it be ascertained that these reagents do not also partially stain adjacent cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this could be a concern. So, we verified our intravital imaging data with section staining and confocal microscopy, which does not require in vivo antibody transfer. All the data was consistent with the intravital in vivo observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is not effort to confirm an effect of PTX on the motility of the FDC network. PTX will predictably affect B cell motility and thereby also impair any B cell-dependent FDC loading mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that PTX treatment will affect all the cells in LN. However, in our study we have not observed any non-cognate B cells, which have bound VLPs. We readily observed direct transfer of the VLPs from the SCSMs to FDCs. Thus, we have concluded B cell mediated FDC loading is not the major mechanism by which the VLPs are transferred from SCSMs to FDCs and that the most likely mechanism by which PTX treatment disrupts VLP delivery is by disconnection FDC abutment on SDSM. Nevertheless, we have revised the manuscript and added several sentences to the Discussion tempering our conclusions.</p><p>“interfering with the SCSM/FDC abutment by pre-injecting pertussis toxin severely reduced the rapid VLP loading on the FDCs. The reduced SCSM/FDC abutment by pertussis toxin argues that heterotrimeric Gi protein-mediated signaling contributes to the FDC movement. The most intriguing possibility is a chemoattractant directed movement of the FDC network towards the SCSMs triggered by VLP uptake. However, since the local pertussis toxin injection will affect all the LN cells near the SCS, we cannot conclude that the FDC movement and severe reduction in FDC/VLP loading results solely from reducing the SCSM/FDC abutment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Looking at the videos that are claimed to illustrate FDC chemotaxis, I can't help but suspect that the FDC movement is caused by phototoxic effects, most obviously at time 00:20 min:sec of Video 5.</p></disp-quote><p>This is similar comment with major comment 2 of reviewer #2. We provide the same response:</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot state that the FDC network movement does not depend upon the movement of the B cells as they are intimately associated.
