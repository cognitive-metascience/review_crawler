RNAs and for exploring inherent features of ribosome function. The intergenic region (IGR) IRESs from the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family of viruses are structured RNAs that bind directly to the ribosome and initiate translation by co-opting the translation elongation cycle. These IRESs require an RNA pseudoknot that mimics a codon-anticodon interaction and contains a conformationally dynamic loop. We explored the role of this loop and found that both the length and sequence are essential for translation in different types of IGR IRESs and from diverse viruses. We found that loop 3 affects two discrete elongation factor-dependent steps in the IRES initiation mechanism. Our results show how the IRES directs multiple steps after 80S ribosome placement and highlights the often underappreciated significance of discrete conformationally dynamic elements within the context of structured RNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08146.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08146.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08146.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many viruses store their genetic information in the form of strands of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which contain building blocks called nucleotides.

This loop is flexible, and interacts with the ribosome to enable the IRES to move through the ribosome. Mutations that shorten the loop or alter the sequence of nucleotides in the loop prevent the occurrence of two of the steps that need to occur for the cell to make viral proteins. Both of these steps depend on elongation factors. Determining how the entire IRES might change shape as it moves through the ribosome is an important next step, since the ribosome is exquisitely sensitive to the shape and motions of its binding partners.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08146.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08146.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>IGR IRES RNA</kwd><kwd>translation initiation</kwd><kwd>pseudotranslocation</kwd><kwd>pseudoknot</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kieft</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12PRE11900057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruehle</surname><given-names>Marisa D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Scientist Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kieft</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-080376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooperman</surname><given-names>Barry S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CABS 1004856</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ruben L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-084288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ruben L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001082</institution-id><institution>Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Teacher-Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ruben L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Grant GM-008730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruehle</surname><given-names>Marisa D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000869</institution-id><institution>Susan G.

Many RNA viruses initiate translation using internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which are <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements that recruit the host cell’s translation machinery in a cap- and end-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doudna and Sarnow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plank and Kieft, 2012</xref>). Most viral IRESs use a subset of the canonical initiation factor proteins to recruit and position the ribosome, but the intergenic region (IGR) IRESs of the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family of viruses use a more streamlined mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, the ~200 nucleotide long, compactly folded IRES RNA interacts directly with both ribosomal subunits to assemble 80S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pfingsten et al., 2006</xref>), eliminating the requirement for initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sarnow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jan, 2006</xref>). The IRES binds between the two subunits and, akin to a tRNA, must translocate through the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schüler et al., 2006</xref>), the only known non-tRNA molecule to do so. In addition, an IGR IRES was recently shown to be able to facilitate translation initiation in live bacteria, although the mechanism in bacteria is very different from the mechanism in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colussi et al., 2015</xref>). Current mechanistic models for how the IGR IRESs operate in eukaryotes suggest that after the IGR IRES assembles an 80S ribosome, eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2 catalyzes an initial pseudotranslocation event (translocation without peptide bond formation) which positions the first codon of the open reading frame in the A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). This is followed by eEF1A-catalyzed delivery of the first cognate ac-tRNA to the A site and a second eEF2-driven pseudotranslocation event that vacates the A site, allowing delivery of another ac-tRNA, subsequent peptide bond formation, and assumption of the normal translation elongation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sasaki and Nakashima, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestova, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pestova et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, initiation by this RNA structure-driven process has evolved to use the catalytic action of two GTPase elongation factors. The IGR IRESs have been studied using ribosomes, tRNA, elongation factors, lysate, and cells from sources as diverse as yeast, human, rabbit, shrimp, and wheat germ, often employed in combinations (representative references: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestova, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pestova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cevallos and Sarnow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masoumi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamoshita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Landry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukushi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hertz and Thompson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deniz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfingsten et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">, 2007</xref>). The mechanism that has emerged is consistent across these systems. This reflects the streamlined IGR IRES mechanism that depends on an RNA structure that manipulates conserved features of the eukaryotic translation machinery. In addition, this feature allows the use of diverse convenient reagents to study the IGR IRESs, a characteristic we took advantage of in this study.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08146.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intergenic region (IGR) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mechanism and loop 3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the IGR IRES initiation factor-independent translation initiation mechanism.

Locally, the IRES mimics tRNA using a pseudoknot-containing domain (pseudoknot I [PKI] in domain III) that structurally mimics the mRNA-tRNA codon–anticodon interaction located just upstream of the translation start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jan et al., 2003</xref>). Previous biochemical and structural studies show that domain III is not needed for initial subunit recruitment and 80S ribosome formation but is essential for establishing the reading frame by docking precisely in the ribosome’s decoding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>). However, domain III has features that suggest additional roles. Specifically, x-ray crystal structures of domain III in both the unbound form and bound to ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>), and chemical probing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfingsten et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">, 2007</xref>), revealed that the single-stranded loop of RNA (‘loop 3’) that links the anticodon-like hairpin to the mRNA-like sequence is conformationally dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutation or elimination of some bases in loop 3 affects IRES function, purportedly by impairing ribosome positioning, although other effects are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2012</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions provide structural models for loop 3 but the electron density corresponding to this loop is generally weaker than in other parts of the IRES, not continuous, or of low resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schüler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>), again suggesting conformational dynamics or structural heterogeneity. These observations are surprising, as domain III comprises an H-type pseudoknot in which the analogous loop usually forms a stable structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staple and Butcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aalberts, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Westhof and Jaeger, 1992</xref>). Comparing the sequences of IGR IRESs from different species reveals conservation in terms of the length range and base composition, in particular a high adenosine content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). Adenosine residues in pseudoknot loops often form stable tertiary contacts that are not observed in domain III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staple and Butcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aalberts, 2005</xref>). These features, combined with our previous work showing that conformationally dynamic structural elements in the IGR IRES can play important roles in IRES function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfingsten et al., 2010</xref>), led us to analyze the mechanistic role of loop 3, focusing on the poorly characterized events following 80S ribosome recruitment.</p><p>We discovered that conformationally dynamic loop 3 operates within the context of the highly structured IRES RNA to influence the activity of elongation factors co-opted to drive initiation. We found that both the length and sequence of loop 3 are essential for efficient translation initiation in IGR IRESs from diverse members of the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family. Using the IGR IRES from Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), we demonstrate that loop 3 affects multiple eEF-directed steps, including both pseudotranslocation events. Our findings provide an example of how RNAs can use dynamic regions within the context of a globally stable structure to facilitate function. Because loop 3 is unlikely to interact directly with elongation factors and translocation is a process that depends on ribosome conformational dynamics, our data also suggest a hypothesis in which loop 3 affects ribosome conformations to assist in non-canonical translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loop 3 is important for translation in both IGR IRES classes</title><p>We assessed the functional importance of loop 3 in IGR IRES-driven translation using a dual luciferase (LUC) reporter construct in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). RRL was chosen as it has proven to be a consistent system for examining the activity of most IGR IRESs. First, we measured the relative translation initiation efficiencies of several IGR IRES RNAs in RRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Based on this, we chose representative IRESs with differing activities, including Class I and II IGR IRESs (from the <italic>Cripa-</italic> and <italic>Apara-virus</italic> subfamilies), to study the role of loop 3. We made several mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>): (1) we shortened loop 3 by three nucleotides, reasoning this would reduce flexibility that may be important for function (△3 mutants); (2) noting the loops’ high adenosine content, we replaced several adenosines with guanosines (G-rich mutants); (3) because sequence alignment from various IRESs suggested the presence of conserved bases in loop 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2012</xref>), we replaced a single conserved adenosine with a guanosine in the highly active Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) IRES. These mutants are similar to those studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., (2012</xref>), but are more aggressive in the sense that we deleted more nucleotides (three) and substituted more bases (three). Each mutation had a substantial impact on IRES activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).

Several more mutants were designed to assess the importance of loop 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Shortening loop 3 in the CrPV IGR IRES by just one nucleotide (△1) had a small effect on function while deleting two nucleotides (△2) caused a significant loss of activity; this agrees with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2012</xref>). The △3 mutant’s activity is even more substantially reduced, matching the activity of the negative control PKI/III knockout mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, CrPV IRES mutants analogous to the aforementioned G-rich mutants and another mutant in which three conserved bases were mutated (GGC mutant) were substantially decreased in their abilities to initiate translation. Because these differences in measured IRES activity could be due to different amounts of input reporter mRNA or rates of mRNA degradation, we controlled for this in two ways. First, the presence of the upstream Renilla LUC (not under IRES control) provides an internal normalization control for small differences in the amount of RNA in the reaction. Second, we measured the rates of degradation of all reporter mRNAs in the RRL translation reaction, finding that all were equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that both loop 3 base composition and length are important for CrPV IGR IRES function, and the mutants now provide a set of tools for querying the specific mechanistic role of loop 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loop 3 affects an early step in the initiation mechanism, after 80S assembly</title><p>Numerous direct ribosome binding studies have shown that domain III can be completely removed or the PKI interaction abrogated without decreasing the IRES’s affinity for the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>). This suggests that the effects we observe when loop 3 is mutated are not due to alterations in 80S ribosome binding, but rather in events downstream of initial ribosome recruitment. To test this prediction, we used radiolabeled IRES RNAs in RRL to generate IRES–ribosome complexes and resolved them by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose gradient, using an antibiotic to halt the complexes after initial formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All loop 3 mutants robustly assemble 80S–ribosome complexes in RRL. Although there is some variability in the amount of 80S complexes produced in this assay, the amounts do not correlate with the translation activity levels. As a second test for ribosome binding, we measured the approximate on- and off-rates of two mutant IRESs with purified ribosomes from yeast and shrimp sources using filter binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We chose yeast and shrimp ribosomes to complement the RRL and also to test a different source of ribosomes to enable their use in subsequent assays. The measured rates are the same for wild type (WT) and mutant IRES RNAs. Taken together, these data are consistent with the conclusion that the functional effects of mutating loop 3 cannot be accounted for by defects in initial ribosome association with the IRES.</p><p>To explore events after initial ribosome binding, we used toeprinting assays to determine if the mutant IRESs are properly positioned within the decoding groove of 80S ribosomes and if they are competent to pseudotranslocate. We chose RRL to match the translation activity assays. Since rabbit and yeast ribosomes produce an identical pretranslocation (PRE) toeprint at the +14/15 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we used yeast 80S ribosomes as a marker for the initial IRES location in the ‘pretranslocated’ state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> lanes 2 and 18). Toeprinting of the WT CrPV IGR IRES in RRL supplemented with the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) reveals that the IRES translocates twice (+20/21 toeprint, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> lanes 3 and 19) as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>). Without CHX no strong toeprints are seen, indicating that the antibiotic traps IRES–ribosome complexes that can be observed in this assay.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08146.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ribosome docking, translocation, and reading frame maintenance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Toeprinting analysis of Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV) wild-type (WT) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and loop 3 mutants in the free (f) and yeast 80S ribosome-bound (80S) forms, and in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) with or without 3 mg/ml cycloheximide (+/- CHX).

However, in RRL the loop 3 length mutants retain the +14/15 toeprint both with and without CHX to a degree that is roughly inversely correlated with their translation activities, showing that pseudotranslocation is inhibited (lanes 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16). A mutation that abrogates codon–anticodon base pairing in PKI does not generate a PRE toeprint at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>); the fact that each mutant IRES still exhibited a PRE toeprint indicates that the mutations tested here probably do not disrupt pseudoknot formation. Furthermore, the +20/21 toeprint is decreased in the △2 mutant and is completely missing in the △3 mutant. The decreases in the +20/21 toeprint are accompanied by an increase in the pretranslocated toeprint, consistent with a decrease in the ability to undergo the first two rounds of pseudotranslocation.</p><p>Our experience with the toeprinting method leads us to take great care not to use toeprinting as a quantitative assay of the amount of ribosome binding, given the nature of the assay (not at equilibrium conditions, detected indirectly by reverse transcription, etc.). In general, we conservatively use toeprinting as a robust way to assess the position of ribosomes that are bound, and their movements. After normalization of the signal and with analysis of many replicates, we determined the change in toeprint band intensities at the +14/15 and +20/21 positions to get a semi-quantitative measure of the percent of ribosomes that successfully perform two pseudotranslocations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast to the measurements of 80S ribosome binding, these data show that shortening loop 3 inhibits the first two steps of pseudotranslocation in a way that correlates very well with the measured translation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and 2E</xref>). Like the length mutants, the G-rich and GGC sequence mutants also form 80S complexes that are properly positioned at the +14/15 location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> lanes 22 and 26). However, these sequence mutants match WT’s ability to generate a strong +20/21 band (lanes 23 and 27), suggesting they assemble 80S complexes that can translocate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To verify the results with CHX, we performed toeprinting in RRL with the translocation inhibitor hygromycin B, which binds the ribosome in a different location and has a different mechanism of action than CHX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borovinskaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The WT, G-rich, and GGC mutants pseudotranslocate once (+17/18 toeprint), but the length mutants show a decreased ability to execute the first pseudotranslocation event.

Dilute hygromycin B was added to RRL after addition of IRES RNA (in the experiments described above, RRL was pretreated with high concentrations of hygromycin B or CHX). By altering the concentration of hygromycin B and the time when it was added, we were able to empirically capture the positions of ribosomes after they had loaded and started elongation. WT IRES toeprinting shows four–five rounds of translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 2). As expected, △1 behaved similarity to WT while the △2 and △3 mutants did not proceed past the initial binding location (lanes 6 and 8). Surprisingly, the sequence mutants displayed toeprinting patterns similar to WT (lanes 10 and 12), although the bands generated from the first few rounds of translocation are less intense, assessed after careful normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right). Thus, the G-rich and GGC mutants can translocate at least four–five times in RRL, and the source of their reduced translation initiation activity must be more subtle than a complete failure to translocate. Although all of the mutants showed defects in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the toeprinting data indicate that the reasons differ between the length and sequence mutants. The G-rich and GGC mutants do not completely block translocation while the length mutants do, indicating loop 3 has two independent roles in IGR IRES- driven translation initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loop 3 mutants do not alter the reading frame</title><p>The ability of the G-rich and GGC mutants to translocate in the toeprinting assays suggests they disrupt a different process than do the length mutants. Domain III is essential for establishing the proper reading frame, so the mutations could induce the ribosome to initiate out-of-frame. To test this, we measured translation in RRL using dual LUC constructs with one or two additional nucleotides inserted immediately before the AUG of the firefly LUC open reading frame (+1 and +2 frames), which could rescue out-of-frame initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Neither alternate frame rescues IRES activity in the G-rich or GGC loop 3 mutants, indicating the G-rich and GGC mutants do not induce out-of-frame initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Peptide synthesis is affected by loop 3</title><p>If the G-rich and GGC mutants initiate in-frame and can translocate at least four times as indicated by the toeprinting assay, why is their translation activity decreased? It is unlikely that loop 3 acts after the IRES no longer interacts with the ribosome, the presumed situation after four translocation events. Alternatively, decreased toeprint band intensity in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> lanes 10 and 12) suggested there could be subtle changes in kinetics of the translocation events. Because toeprinting is not an ideal assay to examine this, we directly explored differences in the rate of peptide synthesis between the WT and the sequence mutants in an in vitro reconstituted translation system by quench-flow (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For these experiments, we used ribosomes from yeast or shrimp eggs, reflecting &quot;one of&quot; the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic>’s natural arthropod hosts, elongation factors from yeast, and tRNAs of either bacterial or yeast origin. As mentioned above, the use of convenient and high-activity heterologous systems is prevalent in IGR IRES research, and is justified because IGR IRESs appear to function identically in all tested eukaryotic systems. Where appropriate, we indicate the source of each component of the reconstituted system.</p><p>Because toeprinting suggested at least four rounds of translocation on the G-rich and GGC mutants in RRL, we first assayed the rate of conversion of tripeptide to tetrapeptide on shrimp ribosomes with the coding sequence for the peptide &quot;Phenylalanine-Valine-Lysine-Methionine&quot; (FVKM) placed downstream of the IRES. Compared to WT, both the G-rich and GGC mutants displayed substantially decreased abilities to convert tripeptide to tetrapeptide, at levels that reflected their relative translation activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These data suggest that the loss of translation activity in the loop 3 sequence mutants is imparted by at least one defective elongation step at or preceding tetrapeptide formation.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08146.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Characterization of early steps in intergenic region (IGR) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) initiation in a reconstituted translation system, using purified shrimp ribosomes and yeast elongation factors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of tetrapeptide formation from tripeptide.

To measure the efficiency of this step, we delivered [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> to WT and mutant 80S–IRES (coding for FVKM) shrimp ribosome complexes in the presence of eEF1A-GTP (which forms a ternary complex, TC, with ac-tRNA) and eEF2-GTP and collected these complexes by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, ac-tRNA delivered by eEF1A and translocated to the P site by eEF2 bound stably enough to survive this purification, whereas A-site associated ac-tRNA did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, ac-tRNA delivery and binding to the P site depended on a cognate codon–tRNA anticodon interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This latter control is important as it shows that the delivery and binding event we observe in this experiment depends on the presence of the IRES and the placement of the correct codon directly downstream of the IRES within the A site. Therefore, this assay measures the efficiency of completion of all three eEF-dependent steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, stable [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> binding was observed with WT IRES with eEF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). When mutants △1, △2, and △3 were assayed, they showed a progressive decrease in bound [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. Interestingly, the G-rich and GGC mutants also showed decreased P-site ac-tRNA association with IRES–80S ribosome complexes at levels that mirror their relative translation activities. Therefore, mutations to loop 3 length and base composition cause decreased association of the first ac-tRNA in the P site.</p><p>Because eEF2-GTP was included in the above experiment, we could not distinguish whether decreased ac-tRNA association in the P site resulted from reduced eEF2-driven pseudotranslocation of domain III from the A site to the P site, subsequent ac-tRNA delivery to the A site, or the second pseudotranslocation that moves ac-tRNA from the A site to the P site. To discriminate between these possibilities, we employed a fluorescence anisotropy experiment in which proflavin-labeled Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> [Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(prf)] TC was delivered to WT and mutant IGR IRES–80S ribosome complexes (shrimp ribosomes) in the absence of eEF2 (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The measured anisotropy of unbound Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(prf) was 0.205 +/- 0.002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). As expected, addition of eEF1A-GTP to the ac-tRNA resulted in an increase in measured anisotropy to 0.210 +/- 0.003, consistent with formation of the eEF1A+GTP+Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(prf) TC. Addition of empty 80S ribosomes (lacking an mRNA or IRES, indicated as ‘no IRES’) resulted in only a slight increase in change in anisotropy relative to the TC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, when a complex of CrPV IGR IRES bound to 80S ribosomes was added to the TC, we observed a much larger increase in anisotropy, to 0.272 +/- 0.006. This change in anisotropy between TC alone and in the presence of 80S ribosomes+IRES (0.061 +/- 0.003) is consistent with delivery of ac-tRNA to the A site of the IRES–80S ribosome complex by the TC.</p><p>To verify that IRES-dependent delivery of tRNA was specific for the first codon following the IRES, we delivered ac-tRNA to an IRES–80S ribosome complex in which the UUC codon for tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> was replaced by the non-cognate GCU codon (‘non-cognate’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This resulted in a smaller increase in anisotropy compared to the IRES with a cognate Phe codon, but larger than the ‘no IRES’ control. Importantly, the observation that eEF2-independent ac-tRNA binding to the ribosome requires a cognate codon is consistent with the idea that the first codon enters the A site and is queried by the ac-tRNA anticodon. This supports the idea that domain III can spontaneously move to the P site to some degree, perhaps akin to the observed ability of tRNAs to undergo slow spontaneous translocation on bacterial ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gavrilova et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gavrilova and Spirin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pestka, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Southworth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fredrick and Noller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robertson and Wintermeyer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Semenkov et al., 1992</xref>). The nature of the ac-tRNA’s association with the ribosome likely differs depending on whether an IRES RNA with a non-cognate or cognate codon is present; the former probably represents transient TC interaction with the tRNA in a A/T state during a decoding step, the latter likely represents full and longer-lived accommodation of the tRNA into the A/A state.</p><p>The results outlined above validate the use of this assay to explore the effect of loop 3 mutations on ac-tRNA association with the IRES–ribosome complex independent of eEF2 activity. Mutants △1, △2, and △3 showed a progressive decrease in anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), following the trend established by the translation initiation and pseudotranslocation data. These data indicate that these mutants have a defect in initial ac-tRNA binding; in the case of △3, this defect is more severe than the effect of a non-cognate codon. This may be because the movement of the first codon into the A site has been compromised. ac-tRNA delivery to IRES–80S ribosome complexes with the △1 and △2 mutants was less than to WT, but equal to or greater than to the IRES with a non-cognate codon. To approximate the percentage of these A-site ac-tRNAs that successfully translocated to the P site, we normalized their P site binding levels to the A site interaction levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). For △1, the percentage is ~80% while for △2 it is ~25%. When we consider these data in light of the proposed mechanism of IGR IRES-driven initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), they suggest that these mutants have defects in both pseudotranslocation events and these defects become progressively worse as loop 3 is shortened. In contrast, the G-rich and GGC mutants display ac-tRNA binding similar to the WT IRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the defect in these sequence mutants is restricted to the second pseudotranslocation event which moves ac-tRNA from the A site to the P site, and domain III from the P site to the E site. Taken together, the data from all mutants suggest that loop 3 has two independent functions to facilitate two elongation factor-driven steps, which depend on loop 3 length and base composition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Loop 3 facilitates eEF2’s ability to translocate ac-tRNA on IGR IRES–80S ribosome complexes</title><p>The anisotropy data show that loop 3 is important for initial ac-tRNA association with the ribosome, but do not directly address eEF2’s role in this process. The decreased ac-tRNA association in mutant IRES–80S ribosome complexes observed in the anisotropy experiment could result from a decrease in spontaneous vacating of the A site, or from decreased TC association even if the A site is available. To address this, we used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize the colocalization of Cy5 fluorophore-labeled Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> with Cy3 fluorophore-labeled IRES–80S ribosome complexes (from yeast) that had been tethered (via the IRES RNA) to the surface of a microfluidic observation flowcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This colocalization data reports on the ac-tRNA occupancy of the 80S–IRES ribosome complexes. We chose WT and △3 IRESs to study as they exhibited the most differing behaviors in the previous experiments. As expected, addition of just Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5)+GTP (without eEFs) to 80S–IRES ribosome complexes, followed by incubation and subsequent flushing of the flowcell to remove unbound ac-tRNA, revealed very low ac-tRNA occupancies for both WT and △3 IRESs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When GTP+eEF2 was included with the Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) (but no eEF1A) the ac-tRNA occupancy of the IRES–80S ribosome complexes formed with WT IRES increased to 9.7 ± 2.5%, consistent with a low, but enhanced level of eEF1A-independent ac-tRNA binding. When this experiment was repeated with the △3 IRES, we observed a lower ac-tRNA occupancy (1.5 ± 1.1%) compared to the WT IRES. Higher eEF1A-independent, but eEF2-dependent, ac-tRNA occupancy on WT IRES complexes compared to △3 IRES complexes suggests that the difference between these two IRESs in the anisotropy experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is not due to altering eIF1A function. Rather, those data may indicate a decrease in clearing of the A site by the △3 mutant, suggesting the △3 mutant’s main defect is in the first pseudotranslocation and not in the A-site ac-tRNA binding event itself.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08146.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) on colocalization of Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) with individual 80S ribosome–internal ribosome entry site (IRES) complexes formed with either wild type (WT) (Cy3) IRES or △3(Cy3) IRES.</title><p>Addition of elongation factors and Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) (tRNA(Cy5)) to 80S ribosome–IRES complexes formed with either (<bold>A</bold>) WT(Cy3) IRES (black bars) or (<bold>B</bold>) △3(Cy3) IRES (gray bars) are depicted as percent Cy3-Cy5 colocalized spots.

Compared to the reactions lacking eEF1A, both IRESs show increased and similar ac-tRNA occupancies (WT: 17.9 ± 4.8%, △3: 20.8 ± 5.4%). These data initially seem at odds with the anisotropy data in which eEF2-independent ac-tRNA association with 80S–WT IRES ribosome complexes is much greater than complexes with △3. This apparent discrepancy is likely due to the fact that anisotropy data are obtained under equilibrium conditions where transient interactions are observed, whereas the single-molecule fluorescence data are collected after the flowcell is flushed and thus only show stable long-lived association. Combining the data from both experiments reveals that eEF2-independent ac-tRNA association to WT IRES–80S ribosomes is transient and is inhibited by the △3 mutation.</p><p>Finally, when eEF2+GTP+TC was delivered to the tethered 80S–IRES ribosome complexes, we observed a dramatic increase in the ac-tRNA occupancy on complexes formed with the WT IRES (82.8 ± 15.7%), but not with the △3 IRES (26.6 ± 10.9%). This demonstrates that the △3 mutation inhibits the IRES–ribosome complex from using eEF2 to facilitate stable ac-tRNA delivery. Overall, our data suggest that loop 3 is important for eEF2’s ability to catalyze both pseudotranslocations, the first of which moves domain III to clear the A site for ac-tRNA binding and the second which moves the first ac-tRNA to the P site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Comparison of results in lysate and reconstituted systems</title><p>Our toeprinting experiments performed in RRL and experiments conducted with reconstituted systems show some differences. Specifically, toeprinting with the G-rich and GGC mutants in RRL+CHX shows at least two rounds of translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and at least four in RRL+ hygromycin B at low concentrations and post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, in the reconstituted assays these mutants fail before two rounds of pseudotranslocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We consider it unlikely that this discrepancy is due to differences in the species of ribosomes used (purified subunits were made from yeast and shrimp sources, versus rabbit subunits in RRL) because IGR IRESs function in diverse systems and contact highly conserved ribosome features. A more likely possibility is that the presence or effective concentrations of various components (ribosomes, ac-tRNAs, GTP, or unidentified factors) is different in the lysate as compared to the reconstituted system, which may alter the kinetics of the translocation reactions. In addition, the presence of antibiotics such as CHX or hygromycin B (which we only used in RRL-based experiments) may suppress the effects of sequence mutation to loop 3 by altering ribosome conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson, 2014</xref>). Despite this uncertainty, taken together our data clearly identify loop 3 as important in more than one round of pseudotranslocation and also illustrate the importance of employing multiple experimental approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To function, IGR IRESs must have affinity for the ribosome, promote subunit joining, manipulate elongation factor action, and move through the tRNA binding sites. In this study we show that conformationally dynamic loop 3 in the tRNA-mimicking domain controls two independent, non-canonical translocation events, demonstrating how a viral RNA can carry out intricate ribosome manipulation using dynamic RNA structure. This strengthens the previously postulated idea that structured regions are important for overall IRES architecture and ribosome positioning, whereas conformationally dynamic regions help drive the IRES through the ribosome in elongation factor-dependent steps to initiate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfingsten et al., 2010</xref>). The strategy of using a combination of conformationally flexible elements with stably structured domains is likely a strategy used by many RNAs that control dynamic cellular machines.</p><p>Our data show that the length and sequence of loop 3 are both important for function. A previous study also examined the effect of loop 3 length and sequence on IGR IRES translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2012</xref>). The mutants in that complementary study showed modest defects in translation activity. However, toeprinting results showed that the position of domain III within the ribosome is similar, although differences in toeprint band intensity were sometimes observed. Overall, toeprint band intensity did not correlate well with translation activity, suggesting that something else regulates the modest defects that were identified in that study. Because we discovered mutants with more pronounced translation defects, and whose toeprint intensities did not correlate with translation activity, we could use this to more deeply dissect the specific mechanistic role of loop 3 in more depth using a battery of quantitative analyses. Our data indicate that domain III’s loop 3 is involved in the two non-canonical pseudotranslocation events following initial IGR IRES recruitment of the 80S ribosome.</p><p>Although domain III was originally proposed to first bind in the P site, the most recent structural and mechanistic models, based on both additional structural information and reexamination of earlier published biochemical data, places domain III in the A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). In this mechanistic model, initial pseudotranslocation by eEF2 is needed to clear the A site before ac-tRNA can bind the ribosome. Consistent with this, our data and other studies show that stable association of ac-tRNA with the IRES–ribosome complex depends on eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) only binds in the A site of IRES–80S ribosome complexes (and induces a change in the toeprint) in the presence of eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). However, no pseudotranslocation is observed with pure WT IGR IRES–80S ribosome complexes treated with eEF2 only (assayed by toeprinting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestova, 2003</xref>). A mechanistic model that reconciles this observation posits that eEF2 first moves domain III from the A site to the P site, but this is a transient state and without immediate ac-tRNA delivery domain III spontaneously reverse-translocates to the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>). This is validated by the toeprinting experiment demonstrating one round of translocation in high concentrations of hygromycin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which has been shown to potently inhibit reverse translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borovinskaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szaflarski et al., 2008</xref>). If this explanation is true, the transient position of domain III in the P site would preclude detection of this state by traditional biochemical approaches; possibly, the toeprinting assay itself may facilitate reverse-translocation. This mechanistic model is supported by our data and agrees with all previously published data.</p><p>Assuming domain III begins in the A site, shortening loop 3 appears to inhibit movement of domain III to the P site before any ac-tRNA is bound. Given that domain III and loop 3 are positioned to interact with components of the 40S subunit head known to be involved in translocation (ribosomal protein uS13 when domain III is in the A site, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cukras et al., 2003</xref>]), our data favor a mechanistic model where the loop 3 length mutants fail to efficiently execute the first pseudotranslocation event and this blocks access of ac-tRNA to the A site. This is supported by the anisotropy data with the non-cognate RNA which show an increase above background levels established by the no-IRES control. This likely indicates the transient binding of the ac-tRNA TC to the A site and subsequent rejection. In comparison, the fact that the △3 mutant yields even lower anisotropy levels than the non-cognate RNA suggests that the TC can never bind the △3 IRES–ribosome complex even transiently. This is consistent with the idea that the initial movement of domain III does not occur with this mutant, either spontaneously or with eEF2, and domain III remains in the A site. Given that our sequence mutants (G-rich and GGC) inhibit the second pseudotranslocation, this interpretation makes loop 3, despite being a short and apparently conformationally dynamic element, a key player in non-canonical translocation events that move the IGR IRES through all three tRNA binding sites.</p><p>There is no obvious analogous structure to loop 3 in tRNA, raising the question of how this loop exerts its effects. One possibility is that loop 3 interacts directly with the ribosome in ways not yet clearly observed using structural methods. Recent cryoEM reconstructions of CrPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>) and Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2014</xref>) IGR IRESs bound to 80S ribosomes in the pretranslocated (PRE) state (domain III in the A site) at resolutions of 3.8 and 6 Å respectively and of CrPV–80S–eRF complexes in the post-translocation (POST) state (domain III in the P site) at 8.7 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>) provide structural models for loop 3. However, the local resolution for loop 3 is low in all structures, consistent with conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Interestingly, in the class I (CrPV) versus class II (TSV) IRESs, loop 3 spans somewhat different space when domain III is in the A site. In both structures, the 3’ ends of loop 3 terminate in the decoding center of the A site where they may interact with elements of the decoding groove. In contrast, the 5’ ends of loop 3 differ in these structural models. In CrPV the 5’ nucleotides of loop 3 wrap around the 5’ terminal nucleotides of the PKI stem in the A site. In the TSV structural model, loop 3 interacts with the apical loop of rRNA helix 24, part of a constriction between the P and E sites. In bacterial ribosomes this constriction is essential for maintaining the P-site tRNA in its proper place to prevent slipping of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schuwirth, 2005</xref>), and must be remodeled by 30S subunit head swiveling for tRNA to translocate from the P to the E site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ratje et al., 2010</xref>). If loop 3 contacts this constriction, it could affect a known structural regulator of translocation, affecting the conformation of the ribosome in a way that favors eEF2 function. In the POST structure with eRFs, loop 3 is modeled to interact with uS7, a key frame-maintenance and translocation regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devaraj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Galkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robert and Brakier-Gingras, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, the HCV IRES is also thought to communicate with uS7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukushi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filbin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boehringer et al., 2005</xref>), pointing to this ribosomal protein as an important ‘gatekeeper’ to ribosome function that is exploited by viral IRES RNAs. Precisely what loop 3 interacts with, how and when it makes these interactions, and how these interactions affect the conformation of the IRES–ribosome complex remains to be determined, as does the question of whether loop 3 functions differently in the two classes of IGR IRESs.</p><p>In addition to making contacts to the ribosome, loop 3 could also affect pseudotranslocation by altering the conformational landscape of domain III, which comprises an H-type pseudoknot. Many H-type pseudoknots use adenosines in loop 3 to make minor groove interactions with an adjacent helix. Although no minor groove interactions have been identified in domain III, most IGR IRES loop 3s have adenosine content greater than 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); this may be an important feature of loop 3. Indeed, the G-rich and GGC mutations (22% and 33% adenosine, respectively) show substantially decreased translation activity. Transient or dynamic interactions between the loop and the rest of domain III may be important for altering the conformation of the pseudoknot as it moves through the ribosome. tRNAs are known to undergo substantial conformational changes as they transit through the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunkle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fei et al., 2011</xref>); loop 3 could help domain III do the same. Alternatively, it may be important for loop 3 to remain unstructured. Indeed, structural probing of these mutants in the unbound form show decreases in loop 3 accessibility to single-stranded ribonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence and importance of these changes within the ribosome are unknown, although it is tempting to speculate that a decrease in flexibility may drive the defects observed in this study.</p><p>There is growing evidence that molecular mimicry is a common tool viruses use to infect their host cells; indeed, several plant viruses display tRNA mimicry in their 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) to enhance viral protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dreher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simon and Miller, 2013</xref>). Yet, molecular mimicry is not limited to structural similarity; the binding partners of these mimics must also be fooled by conformational dynamics and overall molecular interactions. Our work suggests that the flexible elements of the IGR IRES facilitate these additional aspects of mimicry that remain understudied. This discovery that IRES RNA flexibility rather than defined structure is important for function may be particularly important in the context of ribosome manipulation since the ribosome has been suggested to act as a Brownian machine that fluctuates between conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frank and Gonzalez, 2010</xref>), and thus this and other elements of the translation machinery are highly tuned to respond to and exploit the dynamics of their ligands.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction and cloning</title><p>The pCrPV1-1 dual LUC vector was a gift from Dr Eric Jan.

Finally, the entire reaction was diluted fivefold in 1X EPB and the diluted reaction was delivered into the polyethylene glycol-, biotin-polyethylene glycol-, and streptavidin-derivatized quartz microfluidic observation flowcell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>). The 80S–IRES ribosome complex was incubated in the flowcell for 5 min and components that remained untethered to the surface of the microfluidic flowcell at the conclusion of the 5 min were washed out of the flowcell using an imaging buffer composed of 1X EPB and a protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase based oxygen scavenging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitken et al., 2008</xref>). Cyclooctatetraene (COT, Sigma) and 0.012% v/v 3-Nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA, Sigma) were included as triplet state quenchers in these experiments.</p><p>Surface-tethered, Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5)-bound 80S–IRES ribosome complexes were imaged using a custom-built, prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores were excited with a 532 nm laser and a 640 nm laser, respectively, with their powers attenuated such that the laser beams measured ~8 mW when they hit the prism. Emission data were directed to the image sensor of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera that records the fluorescence emission as a ~2 min movie with a frame rate of 100 msec. Prior to striking the image sensor of the EMCCD camera, the fluorescence emission from Cy3 and Cy5 are wavelength-separated using dichroic beamsplitters such that they could be directed onto the two separate halves of the image sensor. Colocalization data were analyzed from the imaged frames, using the standard software MetaMorph, as follows: the 256 pixel x 256 pixel imaged frames were split into the green and red halves, each half being 128 pixel x 256 pixel. Spots were picked from the red frame, using automated features in MetaMorph® and designated as ‘Areas’. The red frames were then stacked on the green frames and the ‘areas’ were transferred from the red to the green frames. Automated algorithms set thresholds to the intensities, assigned geometric coordinates to the spots, calculated the spread of each spot intensity over an average of four adjacent pixels, superimposed each Cy5 frame on the corresponding Cy3 frame and calculated the number of spots that showed significant spatial overlap. This analysis is performed on every frame of the movie captured for a given reaction condition.</p><p>For the experiments designed to test the effect that the absence of eEF2, prior to addition of the TC, had on the colocalization, the first 10-min incubation step of the IRES–80S complex with eEF2-GTP was omitted. For these experiments, after imaging the IRES–80S complexes with Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) delivered by eEF1A, the same channel was washed three times with 1X EPB to remove all unbound components, and a fresh mix of pre-incubated eEF2-eEF1A-GTP-Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) was delivered to the flowcell prior to a second round of imaging aimed at monitoring the rescue of colocalization by addition of eEF2. Similarly, in experiments targeted to detect the effect of eEF1A on colocalization, eEF1A was not added to the initial reaction tube in which the TC was set up. In this case, after imaging the IRES–80S complexes with Cy5-Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, the channel was washed with 1X EPB, and a fresh mix of pre-incubated TC containing eEF2-eEF1A-GTP-Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) was delivered to the flowcell to detect restoration of colocalization. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate and data from at least five movies for each experiment were averaged to calculate the colocalization percentage under a given set of conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Assembly assays</title><p>In 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5 and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1000 cpm of 5’ end-labeled CrPV3 RNAs (IRES alone, no coding sequence) were folded by heat-cooling. Folded RNAs were incubated at 37°C in 30 μL RRL containing 1.2 mg/mL hygromycin B for 20 min. All samples were diluted in 500 μl ribosome association dilution buffer (RADB, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) and separated by 15–30% sucrose gradient density fractionation in an SW41 rotor for 3 hr at 36,000 rpm, 4°C.

The RNAs were diluted to 100 cpm/μl in RNase-free water, which resulted in RNA concentrations in the attomolar range; 100 cpm of RNA was used per 50 μL reaction. RNAs were heated at 85°C for 1 min in 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5 and removed from heat. To 10 mM final concentration, MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added and the RNAs were allowed to cool on the benchtop for 5 min. Pure shrimp ribosomes were added to the RNA at room temperature to a final concentration of 30 nM, and then 50 μL aliquots were removed from the reaction at defined time points out to 12 min and immediately pipetted through a membrane sandwich of nitrocellulose (BioRad) (on the top), Hybond nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) (middle), and Whatman filter paper (VWR, Radnor, PA) (bottom), on a dot-blot vacuum manifold. Membranes were air-dried then exposed to a phosphorscreen. The screens were imaged on a Typhoon phosphorimager scanner. The data were analyzed by drawing equal sized circles around each dot using ImageQuant software and obtaining a volume/intensity report for each circle.

RNase T1 (Roche) digestion was performed by adding 0.1 U of enzyme and incubating at 37°C for 2 min. RNAs were ethanol precipitated overnight and resuspended to equal counts per microliter in 1X TBE + 9M urea loading buffer. RNase T1 (G) (denaturing) ladders for each RNA and a hydrolysis ladder of the WT CrPV11 RNA were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kieft et al., 1999</xref>). Samples were loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel (0.4 mm gel thickness) and run for 2 hr at 65 W. For analysis, data were normalized to total amount of radiation in each lane before subtracting the appropriate non-native T1 cleavage signal (G ladders) from the native T1 cleavage signal.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Eric Jan, Nobuhiko Nakashima, Sunnie Thompson, and Anne Willis for plasmids encoding IRESs and LUCs.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript of Ruehle et al. describes comprehensive biochemical investigation of a key RNA element in intergenic region (IGR) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mediated translation initiation. These IRES elements, whose founding member is the cricket paralysis virus IRES (CrPV IRES), bind directly to ribosomes from a range of organisms, drive subunit assembly and can initiate elongation in the absence of an initiator tRNA. In particular, the authors focus on a key loop within a pseudoknot that mimics the codon-anticodon interaction in the IRES sitting initially in the ribosomal A site in the 80S complex; as such the IRES requires translocation (pseudotranslocation) to move the IRES to the P site to allow elongation. Here the authors use a wide variety of experimental approaches – toeprinting, dual luciferase assays, co-sedimentation assays, fluorescence anisotropy and single-molecule co-localization assays – to probe the role of the loop. They argue that certain mutations in the loop affect the initial pseudotranslocation step while others affect the 2nd pseudotranslocation step. In general, the conclusions of the work are supported by the array of experiments, and the mechanistic model is clear and substantiated. Moreover, these studies nicely shed light on how dynamic features of RNA elements are critical is specifying their unusual function on the ribosome.</p><p>Despite the overall strengths of the manuscript, there are a number of issues that the authors need to address in order to make the manuscript suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. Broadly speaking, the presentation of the manuscript muddles the story in a number of places and creates some confusion.</p><p>First, the authors here are probing the function of loop 3 of the CrPV IRES, following on earlier work by Jan and colleagues, and they reach quite different conclusions. It is important for the authors to discuss these differences. The authors also make some broad statements about the consequences of loop 3 mutations on complex formation and that are difficult to reconcile with some of the toeprinting data. For example, the authors broadly conclude that there are no defects in complex formation that result from the various loop 3 mutations (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and yet there are clear differences in the level of toeprint that is observed; differences in these results should be fairly discussed. There are a number of similar discrepancies that should be addressed throughout the manuscript (see detailed points).</p><p>Another major point of concern is the many different systems used throughout the manuscript. While the authors would like to claim that all the eukaryotic components are compatible with one another (from yeast to shrimp to rabbit etc), we know from an earlier publication where CrPV is characterized on <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes that mechanistic differences can result. At a minimum, the authors should clarify throughout the manuscript when heterologous components are utilized, and that there are some cautions that need to be considered. Better yet, the authors could run toeprinting experiments on each system to show that rudimentary features are conserved throughout the species utilized.</p><p>Finally, there are a number of places where additional controls would strengthen the conclusions. For the luciferase assays, it should be demonstrated that the mRNAs are intact and equivalently abundant. For the binding assays, the dependence of high background binding (20%) should be sorted out by providing additional controls (minus ribosomes, minus 60S, etc.).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Ruehle et al. describes a mutation analysis of RNA loop 3 that connects the anticodon- and codon-like elements within the pseudoknot I (PKI) domain of the IGR IRES of the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> viruses. Their data show that both the length and the sequence of this loop determine the efficiency of translation from different types of IGR IRESs. Specifically, they found, using the IGR IRES from Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), that the intactness of loop 3 is important for both elongation factor-dependent pseudotranslocation events. Since loop 3 is unlikely to directly interact with elongation factors, they put forward a hypothesis in which this loop assists in pseudotranslocation by affecting ribosome conformation. Interestingly, hygromycin B was found to inhibit the first but not the second translocation event driven by the CrPV IRES. Overall, if sufficiently developed, this study will provide important information about the features of IGR IRESs that contribute to their efficiency in translation at the steps downstream of the initial IRES-80S ribosome interaction. However, there are major issues with the toeprint assays that they carried out to support their main conclusions.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) An earlier mutagenesis study by Au and Jan (2012) demonstrated that IGR IRESs tolerate significant changes in the loop-3 length, which at sharp variance with the results of the present study. Some explanation is required.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. It seems that WT mutant IRESs recruit yeast 80S ribosomes with different efficiencies, which casts doubt on their conclusion that &quot;Domain III is dispensable for efficient 40S and 60S binding&quot;. In addition, the relative intensities of these toeprints poorly correlate with the formation of ribosomal complexes resolved by centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Why? In fact, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, presenting pretranslocation toeprints with RRL in which eEF2 is specifically inhibited by diphtheria toxin would be more appropriate than those with yeast ribosomes.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows that the delta 3 mutation although inhibitory does completely block translocation. This is inconsistent with the complete absence of the 20/21 toeprint either in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (lane 16, panel A). There might be a mistake in measuring band intensities/calculations.</p><p>4) Why does the GGC mutant binds 80S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (lane 26), but not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1</xref>?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1</xref> there is a significant binding of IRESs to the 40S ribosome in RRL. Therefore, it is surprising that they don't see 40S toeprints in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Are these coinciding with the 80S toeprints? A control with GMPPNP, which inhibits 60S binding, would be helpful in resolving this issue.</p><p>6) “…the length mutants do not execute the first pretranslocation event…”. Although the toeprinting experiments using hygromycin B seem to support this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), those done with the delta-1 and delta-2 mutants using cycloheximide tell the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Please reconcile these results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript of Ruehle et al. describes comprehensive biochemical investigation of a key RNA element in intergenic region (IGR) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mediated translation initiation.

In general, the conclusions of the work are supported by the array of experiments, and the mechanistic model is clear and substantiated. However, the presentation of the manuscript, as written, muddles the story and creates confusion. This manuscript would merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after the authors address this global concern and points outlined below.</p><p>1) The work presented uses many different translation systems–yeast, shrimp, <italic>E. coli,</italic> rabbit retic and insect viruses. The need to utilize reagents from various origins is understandable and unavoidable due to inefficiencies of the current reconstituted systems, but a certain rigor is needed. I counted at least 4 mixed translation systems in this paper. Furthermore, tRNA can be from yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic>; similar true for the ribosomes that could be yeast or shrimp. It creates confusion, as sometimes it is impossible to deduce what combination of reagents has been used. It would be desirable if authors clearly indicate sources of ribosomes, factors and tRNA for every experiment.</p><p>While it is fully acceptable to use mixed model systems, a caution should be used when such systems are compared to each other. Curiously, Kieft et al. recently published a paper where it was demonstrated that translation initiation on CrPV IRES occurs via different mechanism in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The authors should show that initiation in the various mixed systems used in the current manuscript occurs via similar mechanisms. Perhaps a toeprint in each used system, as the paper already presents a toeprint for yeast ribosomes in RRL. It would be useful if authors would explain why they feel a need to use multiple systems, as it will help to understand how comparable those systems are. This is the biggest weakness of the current work, and one the authors should be able to readily address, given the robust mechanism of the IGR IRESs.</p><p>2) Dual luciferase assay data should be supported by experiments demonstrating reporter mRNA integrity and abundance. This is especially true when different reporter constructs are compared, and more so when changes are expected to affect mRNA structure. Northern blot of RRL samples used to measure luciferase activity would be highly preferable, if that is impossible authors should show the denaturing and native gel of the reporter mRNAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08146.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] First, the authors here are probing the function of loop 3 of the CrPV IRES, following on earlier work by Jan and colleagues, and they reach quite different conclusions. It is important for the authors to discuss these differences.</italic> </p><p>The Au and Jan paper is a very valuable contribution to the field and we have revised both the Results and Methods to better discuss the different conclusions we make and the basis for this difference. The source of the difference is an important point that bears on several reviewer comments, and thus in addition to our revision in the manuscript itself, we feel it is worth devoting some explanation here. Simply stated, our conclusions differ not because of conflicting data, but largely because of how we interpret what the toeprinting experiment can and cannot reveal.</p><p>To summarize the relevant data of Au and Jan (2012), the authors altered loop 3 length and sequence using translation assays and the toeprinting experiment. They found that increases in loop 3 length were tolerated functionally up to four additional nucleotides. We did not assess the effect of increasing the length of loop 3, which we did not think would be as mechanistically insightful. The effect of decreasing loop 3 length that the Jan group tested mirrored our results, although they deleted only one or two nucleotides from the loop, not three as we did. In toeprinting assays, these deletion mutations generated a pretranslocation toeprint at the same position as the WT RNA using the antibiotic edeine as an inhibitor in the lysate. Notably, the toeprint intensity varied from 61-126% of WT, thus toeprint intensity did not correlate with translation activity. This is consistent with our data. In addition, Au and Jan present a large number of point mutations in their paper analyzed the same way, with varying levels of activity and toeprint intensities. Au and Jan conclude that their mutations alter 80S binding efficiency and that “ribosome positioning” is affected by these mutations, although the position of the toeprint does not change in their experiments. Likewise, they do not include alternate approaches to directly measure ribosome binding.</p><p>Our interpretation of the toeprinting data is different, based on our assessment of the method’s strengths and weaknesses after applying it to several IRESs over many years. Our assessment is that while the method is powerful, the results are often over-interpreted or used as an inappropriate proxy for more quantitative methods. To illustrate, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> of our manuscript two toeprint experiments are shown with WT IRES RNA, performed on the same day. There is variability in the intensity of the toeprints even though the position of the toeprints is the same. This is likely due to experimental variables such as different extension and cDNA extraction efficiencies as well as differences in how the RT might stop due to conformational dynamics of the ribosome, the dynamic nature of the system, etc. Thus, a quantitative analysis requires normalization and averaging of multiple replicates (as we do in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, even with this careful quantitation, we are convinced that the results should not be interpreted as a quantitative measure of ribosome binding without additional complementary approaches (as we do in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we assert that toeprint intensity is not a quantitative measure of ribosome binding or complex formation, it is best used to monitor the position of bound ribosomes on the mRNA. This is part of the reason why we regard the toeprinting data as one part of a much more comprehensive examination using a “wide variety of experimental approaches–toeprinting, dual luciferase assays, co-sedimentation assays, fluorescence anisotropy and single-molecule co-localization assays” as pointed out by a reviewer. Furthermore, because we discovered mutants with more pronounced translation defects and applied this set of novel and more quantitative biochemical assays designed to interrogate each step in the initiation pathway, we could dissect the specific mechanistic role of loop 3 to a much greater depth.</p><p>In summary, while the raw data presented here are not at odds with the valuable data that Au and Jan reported, we must “agree to disagree” regarding interpretation, and thus the conclusions we reach are slightly different. With all this pointed out, we fully agree that the basis of our interpretation and the resultant differences needed to be better articulated. Thus, we now include text that explicitly states the way in which we use toeprinting data.</p><p><italic>The authors also make some broad statements about the consequences of loop 3 mutations on complex formation and that are difficult to reconcile with some of the toeprinting data. For example, the authors broadly conclude that there are no defects in complex formation that result from the various loop 3 mutations (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and yet there are clear differences in the level of toeprint that is observed; differences in these results should be fairly discussed.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the way we presented and discussed our data caused confusion and did not make the point well. We have therefore revised the manuscript and added additional data as follows:</p><p>1) The statement “domain III is dispensable for efficient 40S and 60S binding” comes from published data (Nishiyama et al., 2003; Costantino and Kieft, 2005; Jan and Sarnow, 2002). These studies showed that removal of the entire domain III has no effect on the ability of the remaining IRES RNA to assemble 80S complexes. Thus, we expect that smaller mutations to the domain would also not affect binding. We have clarified this statement in the text.</p><p>2) We now better explain the use of several complementary approaches to assess 80S complex formation. As explained above, we now more clearly point out that we do not use toeprinting as a quantitative measure of the efficiency of complex formation. We also call better attention to the direct and quantitative filter binding experiment that shows no difference in the approximate on- and off-rates of the WT and mutant IRES binding to ribosomes. In addition, we replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (shows 80S formation on IRESs by sucrose gradient) with a much better version in which the RNA constructs used were more appropriate and the reaction was captured using an antibiotic. The conclusions that these results support are more clearly described in the text.</p><p><italic>There are a number of similar discrepancies that should be addressed throughout the manuscript (see detailed points). Another major point of concern is the many different systems used throughout the manuscript. While the authors would like to claim that all the eukaryotic components are compatible with one another (from yeast to shrimp to rabbit, etc.), we know from an earlier publication where CrPV is characterized on</italic> E. coli <italic>ribosomes that mechanistic differences can result. At a minimum, the authors should clarify throughout the manuscript when heterologous components are utilized, and that there are some cautions that need to be considered. Better yet, the authors could run toeprinting experiments on each system to show that rudimentary features are conserved throughout the species utilized.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the confusion that might arise from using heterologous systems and that we did not do a good job of defending or motivating their use. We have adjusted the manuscript in several ways:</p><p>1) We now point out the abundance of studies of the IGR IRESs using components from a variety of sources and from mixtures of these (yeast, rabbit, wheat germ, shrimp, pig, human, etc.), and most importantly that the conclusions from these systems are identical and consistent. A set of representative references are included to show that the literature contains strong, established, and widely accepted evidence that the IRES works identically in all of these eukaryotic and in heterologous systems. In addition, although the figure legends specified the species of ribosomes/elongation factors or lysate that was used, we also now include that information in the text as much as possible.</p><p>2) We now include additional supplementary data, which is a toeprinting analysis of the WT IRES bound to yeast subunits and pure rabbit subunits (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The position of the toeprints is the same and matches published toeprints from a variety of papers using diverse sources. When combined with the wealth of published literature this justifies the use of diverse systems.</p><p>3) In regard to the question of IGR IRES activity in <italic>E.coli</italic>, we regret the understandable confusion that this caused. That study (from our lab) showed that the IRES can bind the bacterial ribosome largely by shape-complementarity to the decoding groove, that the mRNA moves by some mechanism to an AUG downstream to initiate translation using a process <italic>not</italic> dependent on the same structure-based mechanism that is known to drive efficient translation in all eukaryotes studied. Hence, the mechanisms are not comparable and that study does not change the way we understand the mechanism in eukaryotes. In our study, we used eukaryotic ribosomes and elongation factors from organisms that have previously been used to study IGR IRES function and which have shown mechanistic consistency. We now more clearly point this out in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Finally, there are a number of places where additional controls would strengthen the conclusions. For the luciferase assays, it should be demonstrated that the mRNAs are intact and equivalently abundant.</italic> </p><p>This is an astute and valid concern. Two points that address this are now included in the text:</p><p>1) Since we used an in vitro lysate system we precisely control the amount of input RNA, which we kept constant. The upstream RLUC reporter provides an internal control to help verify this.</p><p>2) We assessed whether the different mRNAs were indeed intact and whether their degradation rates were altered by mutation. Because our assays were done using cell lysate, we used the straightforward technique of body-radiolabeling input reporter mRNAs and then incubating them in rabbit reticulocyte lysate over the time course and temperature of the translation experiments. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows that the different mutants behave the same. Thus mRNA quality or abundance in the translation assays do not account for the differences in IRES activity that we observed.</p><p><italic>For the binding assays, the dependence of high background binding (20%) should be sorted out by providing additional controls (minus ribosomes, minus 60S, etc.).</italic> </p><p>This is a good suggestion. To adjust the manuscript we included additional data and discussion:</p><p>1) The minus ribosome control was conducted but was not included in the original manuscript. These data are now provided in Figure 6—figure supplement 3. Briefly, the data clearly show increases in raw anisotropy signal as we move from free tRNA, to eEF1A- bound tRNA (ternary complex, TC), to TC+80S (no mRNA), and finally TC+80S+IRES. There is background association of tRNA to empty 80S ribosomes, which is expected.</p><p>2) The minus 60S control was not performed because this would change the extent of the mass shift that causes the altered anisotropy signal, and this would not be readily interpreted with the other data. This control would only assess binding of tRNA to 40S subunits which is neither stable nor directly relevant to our study.</p><p>3) We include the more stringent control of measuring tRNA binding to 80S complexes without an IRES RNA present and compare that to IRES-80S complexes with cognate or noncognate codons. These data show background tRNA binding to 80S complexes (no mRNA control), the specific influence of using an IRES with a cognate codon that should more stably associate with tRNA, and the transient binding caused by proofreading and rejection of tRNA (non-cognate control). We better point out the importance of this control in the manuscript text.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Major comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) An earlier mutagenesis study by Au and Jan (2012) demonstrated that IGR IRESs tolerate significant changes in the loop-3 length, which at sharp variance with the results of the present study.

It seems that WT mutant IRESs recruit yeast 80S ribosomes with different efficiencies, which casts doubt on their conclusion that &quot;Domain III is dispensable for efficient 40S and 60S binding&quot;. In addition, the relative intensities of these toeprints poorly correlate with the formation of ribosomal complexes resolved by centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In fact, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, presenting pretranslocation toeprints with RRL in which eEF2 is specifically inhibited by diphtheria toxin would be more appropriate than those with yeast ribosomes.</italic> </p><p>The response above regarding our interpretation of toeprinting and the use of complementary approaches relates to this point, and we refer the reviewer to that.</p><p>In addition, in regard to the reviewer’s comment about inhibiting the initial translocation event to capture the pretranslocation toeprint using diphtheria toxin, we have performed toeprinting with pure rabbit and yeast ribosomes and observed the same toeprint with both (now in Figure 4—figure supplement 3). This, by definition, represents the pretranslocated position as no other factors are present and because it is in the same position regardless of the species of ribosome, it is a “marker” of the initial pretranslocated binding location. Furthermore, we also show the location of the pretranslocation toeprint by using hygromycin B in RRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Our sequencing ladders are of high enough quality to allow precise location of the toeprint; these pretranslocation toeprints are always in the same location.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows that the delta 3 mutation although inhibitory does completely block translocation. This is inconsistent with the complete absence of the 20/21 toeprint either in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (lane 16, panel A). There might be a mistake in measuring band intensities/calculations.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this astute observation. This resulted from a lack of background signal subtraction for each RNA during the image analysis, which is why the delta 3 mutation appears to be higher than it should be and the WT appears to be lower than it should be. The data were re-analyzed to subtract this background signal and have now replaced the original figure.</p><p><italic>4) Why does the GGC mutant binds 80S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (lane 26), but not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1</xref>?</italic></p><p>We believe the reviewer was referring to the GGC mutant in the toeprinting experiment, but to the G-rich mutant in the assembly assay. The assembly assay originally shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1</xref> showed the GGC mutant to assemble 80S complexes at similar levels as WT, whereas the G-rich mutant had a lower peak. To address this, as stated above we have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> with a much better version that more clearly shows robust 80S assembly. Also, the issue of toeprint band intensity as a representation of 80S binding efficiency is discussed above.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1</xref> there is a significant binding of IRESs to the 40S ribosome in RRL. Therefore, it is surprising that they don't see 40S toeprints in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Are these coinciding with the 80S toeprints? A control with GMPPNP, which inhibits 60S binding, would be helpful in resolving this issue.</italic> </p><p>The location of 40S and 80S toeprints are the same and thus binding of each cannot be distinguished using toeprinting, as is now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Additionally, while the reviewer is correct that the use of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog would normally be useful here, this is not the case with the IGR IRESs as these IRESs do not use or require GTP hydrolysis for 80S assembly. Also, the new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1</xref> shows far more robust 80S formation.</p><p><italic>6) “…the length mutants do not execute the first pretranslocation event…”. Although the toeprinting experiments using hygromycin B seem to support this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), those done with the delta-1 and delta-2 mutants using cycloheximide tell the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Please reconcile these results.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer makes a valid point and we clearly did not explain this well. Examination of the toeprint gels shows visible toeprints at the pretranslocation position in the delta 1 and delta 2 mutants, even in the absence of the antibiotic. This is not the case in the G-rich and GGC mutants. This is consistent with the interpretation that the first translocation event is hindered (albeit to different degrees) in the length mutants. We have clarified this in the text.</p><p>Reviewer #2:<italic>1) The work presented uses many different translation systems–yeast, shrimp,</italic> E. coli<italic>, rabbit retic and insect viruses.
