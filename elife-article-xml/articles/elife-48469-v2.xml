Here, we show that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) is indispensable for the expression of viral polyproteins. We demonstrated that EMC was essential for accurate folding and post-translational stability rather than translation efficiency. Specifically, we revealed degradation of NS4A-NS4B, a region rich in transmembrane domains, in absence of EMC. Orthogonally, by serial passaging of virus on EMC-deficient cells, we identified two non-synonymous point mutations in NS4A and NS4B, which rescued viral replication. Finally, we showed a physical interaction between EMC and viral NS4B and that the NS4A-4B region adopts an aberrant topology in the absence of the EMC leading to degradation. Together, our data highlight how flaviviruses hijack the EMC for transmembrane protein biogenesis to achieve optimal expression of their polyproteins, which reinforces a role for the EMC in stabilizing challenging transmembrane proteins during synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Flavivirus</kwd><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Zika</kwd><kwd>EMC</kwd><kwd>ER membrane protein complex</kwd><kwd>protein topology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shurtleff</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ER membrane protein complex (EMC) facilitates the correct topology of the flavivirus non-structural proteins NS4A and NS4B at the ER membrane critical for viral replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) or West Nile virus (WNV) express their genomes as a single multi-pass transmembrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Subsequently, the polyprotein is cleaved by the viral NS2B-NS3 protease and the cellular signal peptidase into the individual structural (C, prM, E) and non-structural (NS1-5) proteins required for replication and assembly into new virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Neufeldt et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to cellular transmembrane proteins, the viral polyprotein relies on the host cell machinery for targeting to the ER, translocation across the membrane and insertion of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the lipid bilayer during its translation. These processes are facilitated by the signal recognition particle (SRP), the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex (also known as signal-sequence receptor complex), the Sec61 translocon and the signal peptidase complex. These cell components were all identified as essential host factors for flavivirus infection in genetic screens underscoring their importance for virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sessions et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). For most transmembrane proteins, recognition of a hydrophobic TMD or signal sequence by the SRP followed by transfer to the Sec61 translocation channel are sufficient for membrane targeting and accurate topogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shao and Hegde, 2011</xref>). Recently, it was shown that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) plays a role in the insertion and/or stabilization of certain transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, several genome-wide CRISPR knockout (KO) screens for flavivirus dependency factors showed strong enrichment of the EMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Savidis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, its role in the virus life cycle is not yet understood.</p><p>The EMC was originally discovered in a genetic screen for yeast mutants modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic interaction mapping and biochemical purification revealed a six-subunit core complex (EMC1-6) conserved in yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>). Other than its more general association with UPR and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), the EMC was shown to interact co-translationally and enable biogenesis of a subset of multi-pass transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Biochemical characterization of select EMC client proteins, such as tail-anchored proteins and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), revealed that the EMC is capable of inserting TMDs into the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guna et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we investigated how the mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as DENV, ZIKV and WNV, depend on the EMC for their polyprotein biogenesis during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To validate the enrichment of EMC components in the flavivirus CRISPR screens, we generated isogenic EMC subunit KO cell lines in Huh7.5.1 and HEK293FT, two cell types that were used for the genetic screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon infection with DENV expressing Renilla luciferase (DENV-Luc), we measured aÂ ~Â 10,000 fold reduction in viral replication in Huh7.5.1 EMC1-6 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and a 10â1,000-fold reduction in HEK293FT EMC1-5 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The differences in the extent of the phenotypes may be attributed to the presence of compensatory pathways or the degree of disruption of the entire protein complex between the two cell types upon knockout of a single subunit. The strong deficit in DENV replication in the absence of the EMC persisted over a 30â72 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Complementation of EMC2 and EMC4 KO cells with the respective cDNA completely restored levels of DENV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Lastly, we tested the effect of EMC4 KO on several flaviviruses and saw a significant decrease of viral RNA for DENV, WNV and ZIKV but not hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a more distantly related member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). This is congruent with results of an HCV CRISPR screen that did not identify the EMC as a critical host factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>). This finding highlights that there is a specific, evolutionarily conserved dependency on the EMC among mosquito-borne flaviviruses and not a universal disruption of trafficking to and/or translation or replication at the ER membrane, which would affect a wider range of viruses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48469.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EMC is required for flavivirus infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DENV infection of WT and EMC subunit KO Huh7.5.1 cells.Â Cells were infected with DENV-Luc, harvested at 30hpi and luminescence was measured.

As the EMC is important for the expression of a large set of transmembrane proteins, its disruption leads to an altered cell surface proteome, which may affect viral attachment to cells and/or entry. We measured effects on viral binding and uptake by quantifying the amount of viral RNA after virus incubation with WT and EMC4 KO cells at 2 and 6 hr post-infection (hpi), where we did not observe a difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Only at 24hpi, a timepoint when viral replication had occurred, thereÂ was a difference in RNA load evident between WT and EMC4 KO cells. Furthermore, we used a DENV replicon expressing luciferase, which bypasses entry and does not produce viral particles, thus allowing the analysis of the effect of EMC KO specifically on translation and replication. In this assay, we saw decreased luminescence in EMC4 KO cells starting at 12 hr post-electroporation suggesting that the EMC is important during or prior to viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We additionally performed the replicon assay in the presence of MK-0608, a nucleoside analogue that inhibits the viral polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), and observed that the luminescence signal in EMC4 KO cells was lower than in replication-inhibited WT cells suggesting that deletion of EMC has an effect on viral translation, which happens prior to replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To further dissect effects on translation or genome replication of DENV, we conducted an immunoblot timecourse series, where WT and EMC4 KO cells were infected at a high multiplicity of infection (moiÂ =Â 32) and lysates were harvested at early timepoints post-infection (6-12hpi), when no or only little DENV replication had occurred. Viral protein expression was lower in EMC4 KO compared to WT cells as early as 6hpi further supporting a translation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To rule out any contribution of low levels of replication to the observed phenotype, we also performed the immunoblot experiment in the presence of MK-0608 and still saw different amounts of DENV protein accumulation between WT and EMC4 KO cells indicating that the EMC is indeed important for viral protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, while the EMC has been implicated in the stable biogenesis of transmembrane proteins, we found reduced expression of both TMD and non-TMD containing viral proteins. This suggests that the defect likely occurs at the polyprotein stage thus affecting all individual, cleaved proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48469.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>EMC is important for optimal viral protein expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitative RT-PCR of DENV RNA from cell-bound and internalized virions in WT and EMC4-KO Huh7.5.1 cells.Â Cells were infected on ice with an moi of 30, incubated for 1 hr, then moved to a 37C incubator, and finally lysed at indicated timepoints.

DENV translation is initiated in a cap-dependent manner, whereupon the single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome is translated into a singleÂ ~Â 3400 amino acid long multi-pass transmembrane protein. This polyprotein is co- and post-translationally processed by host and viral proteases producing the individual structural and non-structural proteins. We first tested whether the defect occurs at the stage of polyprotein translation. We used ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), which measures the density of ribosomes on a given mRNA species with high positional resolution, to compare translation efficiencies (TE) and successful full-length synthesis of both cellular and viral proteins in WT and EMC4 KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Any changes in TE or premature ribosome stalling in EMC KO vs WT cells would be reflected by changes in ribosomal footprints (as measured by ribosome profiling) normalized to changes in mRNA abundance (as measured by RNA-seq). In the uninfected condition, we did not observe dramatic changes in TE for cellular mRNAs in EMC4 KO vs WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>). This is in line with previously reported results using CRISPRi knockdown against EMC subunits suggesting that deletion of EMC minimally impacts the synthesis rates of its client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, we did not find any substantial differences in viral TE in EMC4 KO cells relative to WT cells at 18 (0.43x) and 44hpi (2.17x) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>). Instead, we observed that DENV RNA was among the highest translated (top 0.1%) mRNAs in both WT and EMC4 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The lower number of ribosomal footprints aligning to the viral genome in EMC4 KO cells was largely due to the reduced number of viral RNA copies present in the cells. Moreover, footprints were found to map throughout the viral genome in EMC4 KO cells, indicating that synthesis of full-length polyprotein still occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that translation of DENV polyproteins is not strongly impacted by loss of EMC, which led us to explore potential post-translational defects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48469.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>EMC knockout does not largely affect viral translation efficiency but leads to post-translational protein degradation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA-seq were performed in uninfected WT and EMC4-KO HEK293FT cells to measure changes in translation efficiency (TE).Â Cycloheximide was added to stop translation and total RNA was isolated.

To probe whether an increased fraction of viral proteins is degraded by the proteasome in EMC deficient cells, we infected WT and EMC4 KO cells with DENV in the presence of Bortezomib (BZ), a proteasome inhibitor, thus preventing removal of misfolded proteins from the cells. Indeed, BZ treatment led to an increase of detectable viral proteins in EMC4 KO cells but not WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Addition of BZ, however, did not restore DENV replication arguing that the proteasome-targeted proteins are non-functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together, this suggests that in the absence of EMC viral proteins are still translated but are unable to achieve a stable conformation resulting in their degradation and inability to establish efficient replication.</p><p>For cellular multi-pass client proteins, such as transporters and GPCRs, the EMC co-translationally engages with specific TMDs in order to support insertion into the membrane and allow stable expression of the entire transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). We used two orthogonal methods, a fluorescence-based protein stability assay and viral evolution, to examine which region of the viral polyprotein requires the EMC for successful expression. First, we utilized a dual-color fluorescent reporter as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). The C terminus of different segments of the DENV polyprotein was fused to eGFP followed by a viral T2A sequence and mCherry (G2C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Translation of the fusion constructs generates two protein products at a 1:1 ratio due to peptide bond skipping by the ribosome at the T2A site: 1) a polyprotein segment fused to eGFP and 2) mCherry. Any post-translational instability of the eGFP fusion protein due to misfolding results in an eGFP:mCherry ratio of less than 1. As expected, the cytosolic G2C-only construct displayed a 1:1 ratio in both WT and EMC4 KO cells, while the Î²<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) fused to G2C exhibited drastic destabilization in EMC4 KO compared to WT cells as was previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). Applying this approach to different DENV polyprotein G2C fusion constructs, we observed that the segments containing only the structural proteins (capsid, prM and E) or NS1-3 were not destabilized in EMC4 KO Huh7.5.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, constructs encoding both NS4A and NS4B (but not either of them alone) showed reduced stability in EMC4 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar results were obtained in HEK293FT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). NS4A has 3 TMDs with the third (termed 2K peptide) being highly hydrophobic and serving as a signal sequence for the translocation of NS4B into the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 1993</xref>). Subsequently, the NS4A-2K junction is cleaved by the viral protease and the 2K-NS4B junction by the signal peptidase. As the 2K-targeted NS4B-5-G2C construct did not display a stability defect in EMC deficient cells, the results suggest that EMC mediates stable expression by first engaging within NS4A prior to the 2K peptide and that a defect in NS4A is extended to the NS4B region. Stability of NS4A-4B-G2C was restored to near WT levels by complementation of EMC4 KO cells with EMC4 cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, treatment of EMC4 KO cells with BZ increased the eGFP:mCherry ratio of NS4A-4B-G2C in EMC4 KO cells indicating that this region of the polyprotein is misfolded and targeted for degradation in the absence of EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Only one of 1,359 DENV serotype two genomes from the NCBI database has a G at this position encoding cysteine, while other sequences all encode tyrosine.

Similarly, the frequency of A at position 7558 is very conserved with 99.6%, and there is no T encoding tyrosine in the 1359 sequenced strains. Interestingly, A7558T resides in a non-TMD region at the end of NS4B, thus likely not supporting membrane insertion but folding in a different manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miller et al., 2006</xref>).

We also introduced the two adaptive mutations into NS4A-5-G2C, which showed increased stability in EMC4 KO cells compared to the WT construct thus reverting the molecular destabilization phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Remarkably, the G2C fluorescence assay and viral adaptation independently pinpointed NS4A-4B of the polyprotein as the region, which requires the EMC. The results of the two experiments suggest that a defect in the stable insertion of the NS4A TMD2 could lead to an aberrant topology/instability of NS4B. By contrast, polyprotein segments starting with 2K-NS4B were stably expressed in EMC KO cells as was shown using NS4B-5-G2C construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, the EMC is required for correct insertion, processing and/or folding of the NS4A-4B region.</p><p>To probe further how absence of EMC causes failure of DENV replication, we transfected a subgenomic NS2B-4B construct (containing functional NS2B-NS3 for polyprotein cleavage) with a C-terminal fusion to eGFP into WT and EMC4 KO cells and immunoblotted against the different processed products. While there was no notable difference in expression levels between the higher molecular weight intermediates (NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-eGFP or NS4A-NS4B-eGFP), we observed reduced accumulation of processed NS4B-eGFP in EMC4 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). BZ treatment indicated rapid degradation of cleaved NS4B-eGFP in EMC deficient cells. Furthermore, if the EMC acts to insert or stabilize NS4A-4B, we hypothesized that direct binding of NS4B to EMC post polyprotein-processing should be detectable in WT cells. We performed a co-immunoprecipitation using FLAG-tagged EMC4 and detected NS4B but not prM or NS5 in the pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This supports the finding that EMC physically engages with NS4A-4B to facilitate its biogenesis and stable expression. Interestingly, we also detected physical interaction between the EMC and NS4B of the adapted DENV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

We generated different constructs, in which eGFP was C-terminally fused after different TMDs that had been determined experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miller et al., 2006</xref>). Transfected cells were left untreated or treated with digitonin and proteinase K followed by immunoblot. In the case of luminal localization, eGFP is protected against protease digestion, while cytoplasmic eGFP is degraded. Our results showed that in WT cells eGFP fused after NS4B TMD1 and TMD4 is luminal, which is consistent with the previously determined topology of NS4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miller et al., 2006</xref>). By contrast, we did not observe luminal localization for NS4B TMD1 and TMD4 in EMC4 KO cells, which indicates that EMC is required for the achieving the correct topology and thus stable expression of NS4B. We additionally probed the topology of NS4A using a deglycosylation assay similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). We introduced an opsin tag containing a glycan acceptor site downstream of NS4A TMD2, which had been determined to be in the ER lumen and should therefore be glycosylated. We observed efficient glycosylation in WT cells (as expected) but very poor glycosylation in EMC4 KO cells, indicating an aberrant topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, we sought to test whether the adaptive mutations restore the topology of NS4A-4B or allow the virus to replicate with a different topology in the absence of the EMC. Since a topological defect was observed early in NS4A-4B and membrane translocation occurs co-translationally, we focused on the A6665G mutation, which is located in TMD2 of NS4A, rather than the A7558T mutation near the C-terminus of NS4B. As the A6665G mutation led to a significant increase in replication in EMC deficient cells, we would expect any rescue of correct topology to be visible. However, no increase of glycosylation was observed in EMC4 KO cells using the NS4A-TMD2-opsin construct containing the adaptive mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the adaptive mutation in NS4A does not immediately restore the correct topology but instead allows the virus to replicate with NS4A-4B assuming an aberrant topology. However, we cannot exclude that the adaptive mutations, which were selected by passaging full virus, only restore the wild-type topology in the context of full-length viral polyprotein, for example through interactions with other viral proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on our results and previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chitwood and Hegde, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>) we propose the following model for the role of the EMC in flavivirus infection. During translation of the polyprotein the EMC engages with TMDs in NS4A and NS4B to ensure their accurate topology, correct folding and stable expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In the absence of the EMC, TMDs in the NS4A-4B region are not accurately or stably integrated in the ER membrane leading to misfolding and degradation of processed NS4B (and potentially also NS4A). Based on the molecular weight of the detected bands in the protease protection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we expect that cleavage between 2K and NS4B by the signal peptidase still occurs in EMC deficient cells, which is consistent with previously observed processing of dengue NS4A-2K-NS4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cahour et al., 1992</xref>). This suggests that the N-terminus of NS4B is still localized to the ER lumen (at least while being translated) in EMC KO cells. However, unlike in WT cells, where the TMD1 and TMD4 of NS4B are luminal, their termini are localized to the cytoplasmic site of the ER membrane in EMC KO cells highlighting that EMC is required for achieving the correct topology of NS4B. Our data suggests that EMC does not affect ER targeting and translocation of 2K but it still remains an open question whether EMC facilitates proper insertion of TMDs into the membrane or if it is required for maintaining the correct topology in a chaperone-like function post membrane integration.</p><p>NS4A and NS4B fulfill crucial functions for viral replication. NS4A induces ER membrane rearrangements important for the formation of viral replication complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roosendaal et al., 2006</xref>) while NS4B interacts with the NS3 helicase and also suppresses the cellular interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MuÃ±oz-JordÃ¡n et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zou et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, it was demonstrated that the NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor interacts with NS1, important for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">PÅaszczyca et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recently, another study found that biogenesis of DENV and ZIKV NS4A and NS4B is dependent on the EMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). While Lin et al. used ectopic expression of individual viral proteins to identify NS4A and NS4B as EMC client proteins, we performed a fluorescent based stability assay expressing different fragments of the viral polyprotein leading to similar conclusions. However, we only observed destabilization when NS4B was preceded by NS4A arguing that the NS4A-4B intermediate triggers an EMC-dependent process. Both studies showed that the EMC physically interacts with NS4B to facilitate stable expression and that, in absence of EMC, NS4B is misfolded and targeted for degradation as demonstrated by proteasomal inhibition. Lin et al. showed that NS4B is still membrane associated in EMC deficient cells, while we provided further molecular insights that NS4A-4B assumes an aberrant topology at the ER membrane. Furthermore, bioinformatic prediction of NS4B transmembrane regions revealed that the two N-terminal domains are only weakly hydrophobic, which could explain the dependence of NS4B on the EMC for stable expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). This is consistent with the systematic analysis of cellular EMC client proteins, which showed an underrepresentation of hydrophobic and an overrepresentation of charged and aromatic amino acids within their TMDs compared to all TMDs in the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, Lin et al. demonstrated that substitution of all polar and charged residues inside TMD1 and TMD2 of NS4B to hydrophobic leucines led to complete rescue of ectopic NS4B expression in EMC depleted cells. However, it remains unclear whether these substitutions would allow for viral replication in the full polyprotein context. By contrast, our EMC KO adapted mutations do not reside in TMD1 and TMD2 of NS4B but in NS4A TMD2 and near the C-terminus of NS4B, and were shown to increase NS4A-4B expression levels as well as restore viral replication. Overall, both studies are complementary and in large agreement, and together provide a detailed picture of how the EMC ensures stable expression of two viral multi-pass transmembrane proteins.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the A6665G mutation inside NS4A TMD2 does not restore the wild-type topology. The A6665G mutation also arose during DENV adaptation to cell lines deficient in the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, another critical host factor inside the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puschnik et al., 2017</xref>). The OST complex has been shown to be important for RNA genome replication in a catalytically independent function and was suggested to act as structural scaffold for viral replication complexes. It is thus possible that the tyrosine to cysteine substitution generally modulates ER membraneÂ integration of NS4A-4B or exposes a binding interface important for replication complex formation, thus likely rescuing replication without restoring the normal topology. Since membrane proteins are co-translationally translocated across and inserted into the membrane, it is unlikely that the A7558T mutation downstream of the apparent topology defect restores proper membrane integration. Possibly, the substituting tyrosine may stabilize the cytosolic orientation of the C-terminus through expansion of the âaromatic beltâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Granseth et al., 2005</xref>) to allow for efficient viral protease cleavage or facilitate other critical protein-protein interactions.</p><p>The isolation of EMC-independent DENV mutants additionally enables drug screening for EMC modulators by testing compounds against WT DENV-Luc and then counter-screening hits with EMC-adapted virus. EMC inhibitors may be a useful chemical tool to study EMC function and also provide a potential antiviral therapeutic against flaviviruses. Host-directed antivirals may have the advantage of a broader activity against multiple viruses and a higher barrier of drug resistance. Only 50% of the adaptation experiments yielded escape mutants containing two mutations afterÂ &gt;Â 20 passages. For comparison, for direct-acting antivirals (e.g. viral polymerase inhibitors), one point mutation is often sufficient to overcome the mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaucourt and Vignuzzi, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to characterizing the role of the EMC in the viral life cycle, our data also help to further elucidate its cellular function. The emerging role of the EMC to facilitate membrane protein insertion and biogenesis has been implicated for several cellular transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coelho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Volkmar et al., 2019</xref>). For a subset of tail-anchored proteins, the EMC inserts the sole C-terminal TMD after translation is completed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guna et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the EMC co-translationally inserts the first N-terminal TMD of many GPCRs with an N<sub>exo</sub> topology (N terminus in the ER lumen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, we found EMC-dependency within DENV NS4A-4B, a region with several TMDs, which are not close to the termini of the polyprotein. Moreover, as NS4A is already targeted to and inserted into the ER membrane, it argues against an insertase mechanism (as shown for tail-anchored proteins and GPCRs) to ensure NS4B expression. This provides experimental evidence that the EMC is not only capable of supporting stable expression of TMDs near the N and C termini but also of internal TMDs, arguing that the EMC may directly facilitate the biogenesis of a wide variety of implicated transmembrane proteins beyond tail-anchored proteins and GPCRs as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). It is noteworthy that the DENV polyprotein is distinct from human transmembrane proteins in that it contains multiple signal peptidase cleavage sites along the polyprotein, including at the 2K/NS4B site between NS4A and NS4B, which removes the 2K peptide acting as signal sequence for NS4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miller et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, it was shown for ADRB1 that addition of a signal sequence or an N<sub>cyt</sub> TMD upstream of the first N<sub>exo</sub> TMD makes the EMC dispensable for biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>), whereas NS4B is EMC-dependent despite the upstream 2K signal peptide within the polyprotein. This observation suggests that EMC-mediated integration/stabilization of TMDs may be context-dependent. Generally, for both cellular multi-pass transmembrane proteins and the DENV polyprotein, only one or a subset of TMDs seem to require the EMC for accurate topology, while the other TMDs rely on the Sec61 translocon. The exact interplay between Sec61 and the EMC during transmembrane protein biogenesis warrants further investigation. The simultaneous dependency of flaviviruses on both Sec61 and EMC as highlighted by the CRISPR KO screens could allow an in-depth analysis of the sequence and TMD features that may determine membrane insertion via Sec61 or EMC.</p><p>Lastly, the EMC was originally discovered to be associated with the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>), and upregulation of UPR during flavivirus infection has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">PeÃ±a and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reid et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2002</xref>). It is possible that competition between viral polyproteins and cellular proteins for the machinery important for proper transmembrane protein expression (such as EMC, OST complex and ERAD components) is linked to this phenomenon. The induction of ER stress can further trigger autophagy, which has also been shown to be beneficial for flavivirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Senft and Ronai, 2015</xref>). Therefore, hijacking the EMC may have direct and indirect implications for flavivirus replication.</p><p>Overall, our study gives detailed insights into how flaviviruses exploit the EMC to support proper polyprotein expression, and we provide further evidence for the cellular function of the EMC in ensuring accurate transmembrane protein topology by utilizing DENV as a cell biological tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource<break/></th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>HEK293FT</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>R70007</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC1-KO HEK293FT</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC2-KO HEK293FT</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC3-KO HEK293FT</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC4-KO HEK293FT</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC5-KO HEK293FT</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>Huh7.5.1</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15939869">15939869</ext-link></td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_E049">CVCL_E049</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC1-KO HUH7.5.1</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC2-KO HUH7.5.1</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC3-KO HUH7.5.1</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC4-KO HUH7.5.1</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC5-KO HUH7.5.1</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>EMC6-KO HUH7.5.1</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Material and Methods, âGeneration of knockout cell linesâ</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (virus)</td><td>DENV serotype 2 strain16681</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9143286">9143286</ext-link></td><td>NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_001474.2</td><td>Generated from infectious clone obtained from Karla Kirkegaard</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (virus)</td><td>DENV-Luc</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27383987">27383987</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (virus)</td><td>WNV Kunjin strain CH16532</td><td>Other</td><td>GenBank: JX276662.1</td><td>Source: John F.

PCR products were cloned into NarI and AvrII cut WT DENV-Luc infectious clone using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs) and transformed into Stbl3 bacteria (Berkeley MacroLabs). Constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI and RNA was generated by in-vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7 Kit (Invitrogen) with the reaction containing 5mM m7G(5')ppp(5')G RNA Cap Structure Analog (New England BioLabs). Resulting RNA was purified by lithium chloride precipitation and transfected into BHK-21 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 for viral production. Supernatants were harvested 6â9 days post-transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Focus-forming unit assay</title><p>Huh7.5.1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Next day, cells were infected with DENV stocks at serial dilutions from 10<sup>â1</sup> to 10<sup>â6</sup> in a total volume of 500 Âµl. 30 hr later, cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then blocked for 15 min at room temperature in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% saponin, 1% Triton X-100, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% azide). Fixed cells were incubated with mouse 4G2 antibody (Novusbio, # D1-4G2-4-15) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 1 hr with gentle shaking. Primary antibody was washed off with three PBS washes and then cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (Life Technologies) diluted 1:1000 for 30 min. Secondary antibody was washed off with two PBS washes. Lastly, cells were stained with Hoechst diluted 1:2000 in PBS and fluorescent colonies were counted under the microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>HEK293FT EMC4 KO cells complemented with FLAG-tagged EMC4 were seeded in a 10 cm dish and infected with DENV (moiÂ =Â 1) for 96 hr. Cells were washed with PBS and then collected in 1 ml Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 1 mM PMSF (Thermo Scientific), 5 mM EDTA and 1x Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific) with help of cell scrapers. Cells were lysed on ice for 1 hr with occasional vortexing and subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4C to clear lysates. For co-immunoprecipitation, clarified lysates were incubated at 4C overnight with Anti-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads (Sigma) while rotating. Beads were washed three times using TBS-T and eluted by boiling in 2x Laemmli buffer. Eluates were loaded for SDS-PAGE and stained for viral proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Protease protection assay</title><p>NS4A-4B was amplified starting from NS4A and ending as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> with addition of an upstream overhang to plenti-CMV-Puro, a Kozak sequence and ATG start codon, and a downstream overhang to eGFP. Fragments were assembled into EcoRV-cut plenti-CMV-Puro using Gibson-like master mix (Berkeley MacroLabs). Plasmids were then transfected into WT and EMC4 KO cells, trypsinized after 24 hr and pelleted by centrifugation at 400xg for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in PBS, split into two tubes and pelleted again. Pellets were either resuspended in KHM buffer (110 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) or KHM buffer containing 50 ÂµM digitonin (Sigma) and 50 Âµg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen) and incubated on ice for 45 min. Subsequently, PMSF (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. After 10 min, 2x Laemmli buffer containing 5% beta-mercaptoethanol was added and samples were boiled for 10 min. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above using the anti-GFP antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Deglycosylation assay</title><p>An opsin tag with the amino acid sequence GPNFYVPFS<underline>NKT</underline>G (containing a sequon for N-glycosylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buentzel and Thoms, 2017</xref>) was introduced downstream of NS4A TMD2 at amino acid position 99 of NS4A. Constructs contained either the WT sequence or the A6665G mutation and were FLAG-tagged at the N-terminus of NS4A. WT and EMC4 KO cells were transfected, harvested in Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 1x Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific) after 24 hr, and deglycosylation assay was performed using PNGase F (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, lysates were mixed with Glycoprotein Denaturing Buffer and incubated at 98C for 10 min. Subsequently, 10% NP-40 and GlycoBuffer two were added, samples split in halve and incubated at 37C for 1.5 hr with or without PNGase F. Finally, 4x Laemmli buffer containing 5% beta-mercaptoethanol was added, samples were boiled for 10 min and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis and reproducibility</title><p>GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze data and perform statistical tests. Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests were applied to measure statistical significance of differences in DENV infection between WT and EMC KO cells. Infection experiments were performed with three biological replicates each. Biological replicates are defined as independent infections and measurements of separate wells. Each set of infection experiments containing three biological replicates was repeated twice and one representative is shown in the figures. Immunoblot and flow cytometry experiments were performed at least twice and one representative is shown.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We like to thank the following people: Jan Carette for discussions, providing reagents and critically reading the manuscript; Caleb Marceau and Kelsey Hickey for technical advice and providing reagents; members of the Biohub Infectious Disease Initiative and the Weissman lab for discussions and technical advice; the Biohub Genomics Platform for help with sequencing.

EMC was found to be required for proper folding and thus the stability of DENV proteins. The NS4A-NS4B domain was shown to be critical to mediate the interactions of the viral protein with EMC. This manuscript provides a model of EMC-dependent viral protein biogenesis, corroborates independent reports on the function of EMC in flavivirus replication and expands our understanding of the EMC. The very nice Discussion section does a good job of setting the findings within a broader context and put forward a model whereby EMC may directly facilitate biogenesis of a wider variety of transmembrane (TM) proteins than was previously reported, specifically proteins with internal TM domains distant from the protein N and C termini. While all the reviewers found the paper interesting, some revisions, one of them experimental, are needed before it can be published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The new topology assay is great. Analyzing the topology of the adapted NS4A-NS4B in EMC4 KO cells is also needed to support or extend the mechanistic analysis. Does the adaptation mutation now allow correct folding? Or does it allow the virus to grow with incorrect folding? These experiments are necessary to understand the nature of the growth defect and the structure-function relationship of the adaptation mutation. Either answer would be interesting, and necessary to ask whether the complex topology itself is needed or the cytoplasmic presentation of particular sequences.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The authors should compare the data in this manuscript and the ones published previously by Lin et al. (Cell Reports, 2019).</p><p>2) In 293FT cells, the phenotypes of EMC4 and EMC3 KO were so different (Figure 1B). Does this suggest that EMC4 could act in a manner independent of EMC or EMC could work independently of EMC4? All the later experiments were done with the EMC4 KO cells.</p><p>3) In Figure 2A, it appears that it is more the binding than the fusion and release of viral RNA from the endosomes that is being measured. In which case, RT PCR will not provide much information.</p><p>4) In Figure 6A, stability of NS4A-4B appears to be the same even in non BZ treated samples. However, in Fig 4B, stability of NS4A-4B is lower in EMC4 KO cell. Please address this discrepancy.</p><p>5) The figure legends would benefit from more experimental details.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48469.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The new topology assay is great.

To probe for stable luminal localization of NS4A TMD2, we introduced an opsin tag containing a N-glycan acceptor site downstream of NS4A TMD2. Luminal localization of the sequon will result in N-glycosylation and thus a band shift as visualized by Western blot after treatment with PNGase F, a deglycosylation enzyme (PMID: 28409466). We observed efficient glycosylation in WT cells (see new Figure 6E) as expected from the previous report. By contrast, almost no glycosylation was detected in EMC4 KO cells indicating an aberrant topology of NS4A. To test whether the adaptive mutations restore the topology or allow the virus to replicate with a different topology in the absence of the EMC, we performed the deglycosylation assay using the NS4A-TMD2-opsin construct containing the A6665G adaptive mutation. As the A6665G mutation led to a significant increase in replication in EMC deficient cells, we would expect any rescue of correct topology to be visible. However, no increase of glycosylation was observed in EMC4 KO cells using the mutant construct (see new Figure 6E). Therefore, we conclude that the adaptive mutation in NS4A does not immediately restore the correct topology after TMD2 but instead allows the virus to replicate with NS4A-4B assuming an aberrant topology.</p><p>To expand our results, we additionally attempted to probe the topology using full-length NS4A-4B constructs containing either WT sequence or both adaptive mutations (A6665G in NS4A and A7558T in NS4B). However, our efforts were unsuccessful as introduction of glycan acceptor sites either impaired expression of the constructs or we did not observe efficient glycosylation of luminal sites even in WT cells, most likely due to poor accessibility of certain regions by the oligosaccharyltransferase. This was the case despite introducing sequons in different luminal positions and adding various flexible linkers surrounding the acceptor site to increase accessibility. Moreover, we attempted a different strategy using cysteine scanning, which relies on engineering individual cysteines into cytoplasmic loops and using their chemical reactivity for tagging. Similarly, we did not observe reliable expression of these constructs.</p><p>Nevertheless, we think the results regarding the A6665G mutation inside NS4A-TMD2 provide a convincing argument that the wild-type topology is not restored in EMC KO cells. Since membrane proteins are co-translationally translocated across and inserted into the membrane, it is unlikely that the A7558T near the C-terminus of NS4B affects the topology of the upstream TMDs in NS4A and NS4B. However, we cannot fully exclude that the adaptive mutations only restore the wild-type topology in tandem or in the context of full-length viral polyprotein, for example through interactions with other viral proteins as the two mutations were selected by passaging replicating virus.</p><p>We have included the new results in Figure 6E and described them in the last paragraph of the Results. We additionally discuss the new findings in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Minor points:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors should compare the data in this manuscript and the ones published previously by Lin et al. (Cell Reports, 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now included a paragraph in the discussion, where we compare our results with the study published by Lin et al (see lines 310-336):</p><p>âRecently, another study found that biogenesis of DENV and ZIKV NS4A and NS4B is dependent on the EMC (Lin et al., 2019). While Lin et al. used ectopic expression of individual viral proteins to identify NS4A and NS4B as EMC client proteins, we performed a fluorescent based stability assay expressing different fragments of the viral polyprotein leading to similar conclusions. However, we only observed destabilization when NS4B was preceded by NS4A arguing that the NS4A-4B intermediate triggers an EMC-dependent process. Both studies showed that the EMC physically interacts with NS4B to facilitate stable expression and that, in absence of EMC, NS4B is misfolded and targeted for degradation as demonstrated by proteasomal inhibition. Lin et al. showed that NS4B is still membrane associated in EMC deficient cells, while we provided further molecular insights that NS4A-4B assumes an aberrant topology at the ER membrane. Furthermore, bioinformatic prediction of NS4B transmembrane regions revealed that the two N-terminal domains are only weakly hydrophobic, which could explain the dependence of NS4B on the EMC for stable expression (Lin et al., 2019). This is consistent with the systematic analysis of cellular EMC client proteins, which showed an underrepresentation of hydrophobic and an overrepresentation of charged and aromatic amino acids within their TMDs compared to all TMDs in the proteome (Shurtleff et al., 2018). Consequently, Lin et al. demonstrated that substitution of all polar and charged residues inside TMD1 and TMD2 of NS4B to hydrophobic leucines led to complete rescue of ectopic NS4B expression in EMC depleted cells. However, it remains unclear whether these substitutions would allow for viral replication in the full polyprotein context. By contrast, our EMC KO adapted mutations do not reside in TMD1 and TMD2 of NS4B but in NS4A TMD2 and near the C-terminus of NS4B, and were shown to increase NS4A-4B expression levels as well as restore viral replication. Overall, both studies are complementary and in large agreement, and together provide a detailed picture of how the EMC ensures stable expression of two viral multi-pass transmembrane proteins.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In 293FT cells, the phenotypes of EMC4 and EMC3 KO were so different (Figure 1B). Does this suggest that EMC4 could act in a manner independent of EMC or EMC could work independently of EMC4? All the later experiments were done with the EMC4 KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The ER membrane protein complex (EMC) consists of 10 subunits (EMC1-10) in mammalian cells. Independently conducted genetic screens for flavivirus host factors in different cell types, such as Huh7.5.1 (PMID: 27383987), 293T (PMID: 27383988), HAP1 (PMID: 31384002), HeLa H1 (PMID: 27342126) or neural progenitor cells (PMID: 31019072), all identified multiple subunits of the EMC including EMC3 and EMC4. This suggests that the entire complex is important for viral replication and that knockout of one subunit is generally sufficient to disrupt EMC function.</p><p>Quantitative assays for viral replication in Figure 1 revealed differences in the strength of the phenotypes of different EMC KO mutations in different cell types. While knockout of any subunit (EMC1-6) in Huh7.5.1 cells led to a &gt;1,000x reduction of dengue replication (Figure 1A), we observed differences in the degree of viral inhibition in EMC KO in 293FT cells (Figure 1B). As stated in the text, we speculate that this could be due to the degree of disruption of the entire protein complex. Knockout of EMC3 in 293FT may result in a partially intact complex while deletion of the EMC4 subunit completely destroys EMC activity. We highlight this as follows: âThe differences in the extent of the phenotypes may be attributed to the presence of compensatory pathways or the degree of disruption of the entire protein complex between the two cell types upon knockout of a single subunit.â</p><p>The majority of experiments were performed with EMC4 KO cells to have the largest dynamic range for phenotypic readouts in both Huh7.5.1 and HEK293FT cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2A, it appears that it is more the binding than the fusion and release of viral RNA from the endosomes that is being measured. In which case, RT PCR will not provide much information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that RT-qPCR of viral RNA upon incubation of virus with cells at 4C followed by incubation at 37C cannot distinguish between virions attached to the cell surface and virions that are internalized and released from the endosomes. We have changed the wording in the main text accordingly.</p><p>Nevertheless, the viral binding/uptake data together with the replicon results still lead to the conclusion that the EMC is required for intracellular steps of the viral life cycle. In the replicon assay (Figure 2B), in vitro transcribed viral RNA is electroporated into the cells thus bypassing the requirement for viral fusion and release into the cytosol. Thus, differences in luminescence levels starting at 12h post-electroporation between WT and EMC KO cells indicate that viral replication and/or translation are impaired. However, we cannot completely rule out an additional effect on virus infection post-attachment (e.g. fusion or release from endosomes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 6A, stability of NS4A-4B appears to be the same even in non BZ treated samples. However, in Fig 4B, stability of NS4A-4B is lower in EMC4 KO cell. Please address this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this discrepancy. In the G2C reporter assay (Figure 4B) we used a NS4A-4B construct with a C-terminal fusion to GFP-2A-mCherry and we calculated the ratio of the GFP-fusion protein to mCherry as a measure of stability. It has been shown that cleavage between NS4A and NS4B can occur in absence of the viral protease and is mediated by the signal peptidase at the 2K-NS4B junction (PMID: 1531368). Therefore, we think that the destabilized form that is measured in the G2C assay is likely to be the cleaved NS4B-eGFP fusion protein and not NS4A-NS4B-eGFP, which would be in agreement with the Western blot data in Figure 6A. This is also consistent with the immunoblot in Figure 6D, where after transfection of NS4A-4B-eGFP we detected NS4B-eGFP at the molecular weight expected for NS4B+eGFP, thus after cleavage from NS4A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The figure legends would benefit from more experimental details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more experimental details to the figure legends in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
