The balance of BMP/Wnt signalling network is instructive for OPCs to undertake fate decision shortly after their activation: disruption of the OPCs homeostasis during demyelination results in BMP4 upregulation, which, in the absence of Socstdc1, favours SCs differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>remyelination</kwd><kwd>perivascular niche</kwd><kwd>Schwann cells</kwd><kwd>adult CNS progenitors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012/07/N/NZ3/01943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ulanska-Poutanen</surname><given-names>Justyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>Robin JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core support grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>Robin JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core support grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>Robin JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NN 401 584238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zawadzka</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinctive microenvironments within demyelinated white matter determine fate decisions of adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CNS remyelination is mediated by a specialized type of adult multipotent progenitor cells, commonly referred to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or OPCs, that are able to differentiate into new myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs) following primary demyelination. This regenerative process can also involve the generation of remyelinating Schwann cells (SCs), the myelin-forming cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The contribution of SCs to CNS remyelination have been reported in several clinical conditions including traumatic spinal cord injury, leukodystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunge et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guest et al., 2005</xref>), and most frequently in severe forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itoyama et al., 1983</xref>). Experimentally, this phenomenon has been observed following virtually all forms of CNS injury with a demyelinating component, including ischemic, excitotoxic, and traumatic injury as well as in toxic and immune-mediated models of demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Snyder et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dusart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felts et al., 2005</xref>). It was originally assumed that SCs invaded demyelinated regions of the CNS from the periphery following a breach in the <italic>glia limitans</italic> (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin and Blakemore, 1993</xref>). However, we have previously shown using a genetic fate mapping strategy that following CNS demyelination, adult OPCs are presented with a fate choice, having the option to become OLs or SCs as they contribute to remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zawadzka et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assinck et al., 2017</xref> demonstrated extensive Schwann cell-mediated remyelination following clinically relevant traumatic spinal contusion injury and using genetic reporters provided confirmatory evidence for their central origin.</p><p>The underlying mechanism controlling this unusual CNS-to-PNS fate-switching of adult OPCs is unclear. SC-mediated remyelination of central axons is closely associated with localization of cells in the lesion and cellular composition of the surrounding tissue. We and others have reported that SCs can be predominantly found in the CNS areas from which astrocytes are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodruff and Franklin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blakemore, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blakemore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talbott et al., 2006</xref>). The central role of astrocytes in determining which type of remyelination occurs has recently been demonstrated by increased SCs remyelination when the astrocyte response to demyelination has been reduced either transgenically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monteiro de Castro et al., 2015</xref>) or by reducing testosterone signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bielecki et al., 2016</xref>). Transplantation studies suggest that the molecular composition of an astrocyte-free CNS environment promotes SC differentiation of adult OPCs, possibly via a mechanism that involves bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talbott et al., 2006</xref>). However, BMPs alone are unlikely to induce SC differentiation since they primarily promote OPC differentiation into astrocytes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mabie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grinspan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sabo et al., 2011</xref>) or astrocyte and neuronal fate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kondo and Raff, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Fate decisions by adult multipotential cells are often regulated by a specialized microenvironment, termed the ânicheâ, associated with the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldman and Chen, 2011</xref>). Injury-induced loss of the local vasculature and disruption of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity is a common pathological feature of demyelinating disease, while tissue reconstruction is associated with enhanced angiogenesis and the reestablishment of a functional vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egawa et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesized that unique properties of the perivascular niche within remyelinating white matter would create microenvironment that favour the alternative differentiation of OPCs. Although the transcriptomic changes associated with OL differentiation have been described (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dugas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moyon et al., 2015</xref>), the instructive clues and the molecular mechanisms of alternative OPCs differentiation remain unresolved. It is also unclear whether injury-activated endothelium and OPCs may interact with one another during white matter regeneration. We therefore characterised the transcriptomic profile of discrete microenvironmental niches during the early stages of remyelination and identified several factors that significantly discriminate between vascular and non-vascular areas. Our results demonstrate a role of the context-dependent BMP/WNT signalling network in regulation of the alternative, SC differentiation of OPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Different cellular compositions define discrete niches within areas of CNS demyelination</title><p>To get insight into molecular composition of post-injury niches we used a well-established model of demyelination induced by a stereotactic injection of ethidium bromide (EB) into the caudal cerebellar peduncle (CCP) of adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodruff and Franklin, 1999</xref>).

First, we characterized the spatial distribution of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the lesion using antibodies to the transcription factor Olig2 and found them preferentially distributed around blood vessels, visualized with agglutinin RCA120, which specifically binds to endothelial cells and their basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We defined the vascular niche (VN) as an area around blood vessel with a radial length two times greater than a diameter of the particular blood vessel; the remaining lesion tissue was defined as the non-vascular area (non-VN). Numerous Olig2+Â cells were preferentially associated with blood vessels and reached their highest density in the VN at 10 days post-lesion induction (dpl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The vast majority of these cells co-expressed the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor Sox10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hornig et al., 2013</xref>) and Sox2, a transcription factor associated with OPC activation and early stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). From 10 dpl there was a significant increase of the number of cells Sox10+/Sox2+Â but that were Olig2- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By 14 dpl up to 80% of total Sox10+Â within the VN were Olig2- (av. 68.40 Â± 14.65%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These observations could have at least two explanations: 1) extensive apoptosis of Olig2+Â OPCs takes place preferentially in vascular niche and is associated with proliferation of Olig2-/Sox10+Â cells migrating to the lesion, or, alternatively 2) Sox10+Â OPCs loose Olig2 expression within the VN. Since Sox10 is a transcription factor required for both OLs and SCs homeostasis and myelin maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremer et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesized that downregulation of Olig2 expression might be associated with switch in differentiation program and Olig2-/Sox10+/Sox2+Â cells could give rise to cells producing peripheral-type myelin. To rule out cell death as the cause of the decrease in Olig2+Â cells within the VN we performed immunohistochemistry for activated caspase three and found no significant differences in the number of apoptotic OPCs between the VN and non-vascular regions at any time points investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Using Pdgfra-Cre reporter mice, we found that the Olig2-/Sox10+Â cells at 14 dpl in the VN were likely of OPC origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that oligodendrocyte lineage cells can lose Olig2 expression at early stages of differentiation while continuing to express Sox10 and Sox2, and that these cells, clustered within the VN are a source of SCs that eventually remyelinate the VN axons.</p><p>We also found substantial regeneration of blood vessels and BBB within the areas undergoing remyelination. Blood vessels rebuilding their basement membrane and endothelial walls occurred in parallel with remyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to precisely separate pre-defined discrete tissue compartments. Since LCM procedure requires good visualization of a structure of interest we developed fast RAC120 staining in fresh tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to define vascular and non-vascular areas. We collected tissue from vascular and non-vascular regions as separate pools from individual animal (nÂ =Â 5 samples from both, VN and non-VN areas) and obtained high quality RNAs (with a RNA integrity number, RIN, above 7.0) that were used for global gene expression profiling using Illumina RatRef-12 microarrays.</p><p>Using bioinformatic tools we identified genes differentially expressed in separated niches.

Next, we placed the identified expression changes within pathways that contained significantly high number of differentially expressed genes. The most prominent group of genes clustered in the âhedgehog signalling networkâ, which includes interaction with elements of BMP and Wnt signalling pathways.

We first demonstrated that Wnt1-Cre was active in SCs in peripheral nerves, but not in OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We then induced focal demyelination to the Wnt1-Cre mice and found that very few MPZ+/YFP+Â SCs were detected within the lesions at 28 dpl, even if the lesion was located next to the ventral root and despite the high efficiency of labelling of peripheral cells. MPZ+Â myelin within the CNS lesion was almost exclusively associated with cells negative for YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In striking contrast to peripheral SCs, cells that remyelinated spinal cord white matter did not produce CTGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The CTGF+Â cells were mainly detected at the lesion rim and displayed the typical stellate morphology of activated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that expression and accumulation of CTGF is restricted to the astrocytic response to demyelination.

This is in agreement with data reporting that cerebral endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>) promote OPC migration along blood vessels during development. These two processes are likely interconnected, indicating that OPC activation and their paracrine activity integrates the onset of myelination with white matter angiogenesis also in adulthood.</p><p>Identification of a perivascular niche as a causative factor for alternative differentiation prompted us to employ transcriptome profiling approach in order to describe signals and processes that occur in the niche. Comparative analysis of global transcriptome in discrete areas of the same affected structure pointed towards BMP and Wnt signalling pathways as the crucial players with context-dependent functions. The implication of BMPs in healthy brain neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colak et al., 2008</xref>) and after remyelination has been demonstrated. BMPs interfere with OPCs differentiation after toxin-induced demyelination, whereas BMP antagonists such as noggin promote OL generation and remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sabo et al., 2011</xref>). The infusion of noggin or chordin increases the commitment of SVZ cells to the oligodendrocyte lineage and their mobilization following demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jablonska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cate et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, BMP signalling interferes with OL maturation following perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dizon et al., 2011</xref>) or intraventricular hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dummula et al., 2011</xref>). BMP4 affects myelination by downregulating the transcription factors, Olig1 and Olig2, which are required for OL differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samanta and Kessler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that BMP acts as a negative regulator of OL differentiation by preventing cell mobilization and maturation and promotion of astrogliosis.</p><p>We identified BMP4 as an OPCs-derived factor whose increased expression in the VN did not, however, correlate with astrogenesis. Moreover, as we showed previously, adult OPCs do not differentiate significantly into astrocytes in vivo, only occasionally we found OPC-derived astrocytes in the non-vascular areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zawadzka et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that BMP4 takes part in the autonomous, alternative PNS-like, OPC differentiation.</p><p>BMP4 has been proposed to promote differentiation of engrafted adult OPCs primarily into cells with immunophenotypic and ultrastructural characteristics of myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talbott et al., 2006</xref>). SC differentiation was blocked when OPCs were co-transplanted with astrocytes or by noggin overexpression in engrafted OPCs. However, neither noggin overexpression nor the presence of co-transplanted astrocytes enhanced differentiation into OLs, suggesting that suppression of BMP signalling alone is not sufficient to promote OL differentiation. Since endogenous OL remyelination is normally successful in the perimeter of lesions, coinciding with a region of densely populated reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blakemore and Crang, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin and Blakemore, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talbott et al., 2006</xref>) it was unclear why co-transplantation of astrocytes with adult OPCs did not induce OL differentiation. Our results suggest that BMP4 is necessary but not sufficient to induce PNS-like differentiation program. Upon demyelination OPCs upregulate BMP4 and loose Sosctdc1 expression which enable them to convert into activated cells, primed for differentiation. This corroborates previous studies on OPC plasticity. In particular, it has been shown that BMP4 treatment inhibits the progression of OPC differentiation toward OLs by favouring global histone acetylation and nuclear chromatin conformation characteristic for euchromatin. Thus, BMP4 acts as a potent inducer of gene expression, possibly supporting the undifferentiated progenitor state and/or making the cells more responsive to the other signals such as Wnt. In contrast, OL differentiation is accompanied by peripheral chromatin condensation in OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) and decrease in histone deacetylation at transcriptional repressors of oligodendrocytic differentiation such as Sox11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2007</xref>) and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lyssiotis et al., 2007</xref>). We show that BMP4 expression coincides with OPCs activation and this provides an additional aspect to the notion that OPCs can acquire multipotency in specific conditions of local microenvironment. Consequently, astrocyte-derived Sostdc1 controls biological availability of BMP4 in the non-vascular area and maintains OL-driven remyelination. Since Sostdc1 is produced exclusively by activated astrocytes within the non-VN lesion area during the period of first 10 days post demyelination our data corroborate with the long-postulated notion that astrocytes are one of the key regulators of OPC differentiation fate.</p><p>Our in vivo experiments provide evidence for the ability of OPCs to generate SCs cells in the PNS under the condition resembling the CNS perivascular niche, in a BMP and Wnt dependent manner. OPC differentiation was affected by both USAG1 and dorsomorphin treatment. USAG1 (a product of human ortholog of rat gene <italic>sostdc1</italic>) binds directly to BMPs and antagonizes BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagita et al., 2006</xref>) and interacts with the LRP6 receptor to antagonize Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lintern et al., 2009</xref>). Dorsomorphin is a potent inhibitor of BMP signalling which binds to the BMP type I receptors ALK1/2/3/6 and type II receptor ActRIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horbelt et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, BMP stimulation seems to be indispensable for the alternative fate induction. Moreover, inhibition of Lrp6-dependent Wnt signaling prevents OPC-to-SC differentiation even within the high BMP4 background of injured sciatic nerve. Defective phenotype of cells transduced with LRP6 shRNA indicates that activation of WNT signalling is required for initiation of PNS fate differentiation which has not been proposed yet.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that OPCs differentiate into SCs when exposed to BMP/Wnt-enriched PNS environment; however, an axonal contact seems to be an indispensable factor. This is consistent with recent findings showing that neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) mediates SCs remyelination by precursors of CNS origin after spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartus et al., 2016</xref>). However, while neuregulin-1 is evidently important for Schwann cell myelination of the CNS axons, we did not find any evidence in our whole genome analysis to suggest that Ngr1 is involved in OPCs fate determination at its early stage.</p><p>Finally, by using a transgenic approach we have provided novel evidence that CNS-derived SCs substantially differ from PNS myelinating cells, thatÂ is by different CTGF production. We show that CTGF participates in the pathological reaction of the astrocytic compartment which is in line with previous reports describing contribution of accumulating CTGF+Â astrocytes to wound healing and glial scar formation in response traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hertel et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>This study is the first to demonstrate the PNS-like OPC differentiation effect of BMP and Wnt signalling, both of which are signalling pathways associated with inhibition of OL differentiation and maturation. We propose that BMPs induce OPC priming and activation and, when combined with Wnt, instruct them to differentiate into peripheral myelin producing cells. This sets the stage for further investigations into the downstream effectors of the proposed signalling networks that govern alternative OPC differentiation during CNS remyelination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>All research and animal care procedures were approved by the First Warsaw Local Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation (protocols 1020/2009, 1046/2009, 556/2014 and 431/2017) and performed according to international guidelines on the use of laboratory animals.</p><p>The animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with constant access to food and water and were randomly assigned to experimental groups.</p><p>Animals used:</p><p>8â10 week-old female Wistar rats;</p><p>9â12 week-old female Wnt1-Cre transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under control of the Wnt1 promoter elements described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danielian et al., 1998</xref>).

Delta CT values from qPCR analysis were calculated by subtracting the average value from housekeeping gene (18s RNA or Actb). The relative gene expression levels between the sample and control were determined using the formula 2<sup>â(SÎCtâCÎCt)</sup> or as ratio of experimental sample/condition to intact tissue or control condition. For comparison of gene expression level in different cell types data were presented as ÎCT. Triplicate measurements were made on at least three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In situ hybridisation <italic>with cRNA probes</italic></title><p>Riboprobes were generated based on rat genomic sequence from NCBI database. Specific sequences of rat mRNAs were chosen and later amplified by PCR reaction using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (ThermoFisher Scientific) to avoid false incorporation of nucleotides and cloned using TopoTA Cloning Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The rat <italic>BMP4</italic> and <italic>Sostdc1</italic> cDNA was amplified using total RNA isolated from injured rat spinal cord (0.1% EB injection, 10 dpl). The fragment of cDNA was subcloned into plasmid pSP73 (Promega) with flanking promoters for SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase. The sequences (5ââ3â) of the PCR primers were: <italic>BMP4</italic> forward CCTGGTAACCGAATGCTGAT, reverse CGATCGGCTAATCCTGACAT; <italic>Sostdc1</italic> forward GAAAGAATTCACCGCCTCAG, reverse CCTGGCTTTCACTGCAAACT. Plasmids were sequenced and transcribed in vitro to obtain antisense and sense (control) probe used for hybridization. Briefly, to label cRNA probes, following linearization of plasmids with appropriate restriction enzyme DIG labelled antisense probes were synthesized using the DIG RNA labelling kit (Roche) with suitable RNA polymerases. The target mRNA-expressing cells were visualized as a dark blue-purple deposition with NBT/BCIPâalkaline phosphatase. Double labeling with two color in situ hybridization has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, a mixture of two different target mRNA probes labeled with DIG and FITC, respectively, was used for hybridization with the same subsequent procedure of single color in situ hybridization. After visualization of first target mRNA using NBT/BCIP, the alkaline phosphatase was inactivated by incubation of the slides at 65Â°C then 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.2, for 30 min, respectively. Sections were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody specific to the label of the second probe. The second target mRNA was visualized by incubating with INT/BCIP, which formed a magenta/brown deposition. Lesions were identified on digital images of sections stained with solochrome cyanine for myelin identification and the lesion area was determined using ImageJ 1.43b (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Tissue was processed as described above. Sections or cells were incubated in sodium citrate (10 mM, microwave preheated) for antigen retrieval, blocked with PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10% (v/v) normal donkey serum (1 hr, RT), and incubated with primary antibody overnight, 4Â°C.</p><p>Primary antibody used: Caspase3 R and D Systems AF835-SP; CTGF Abcam ab6992; GFAP DakoCytomation Z0334; GFAP BD Biosciences 556330; GFP Abcam ab6673; MPZ Abcam ab39375; Neurofilament NF DakoCytomation M0762; Olig2 Abcam ab33427; Olig2 Millipore MABN50; Periaxin Gift from Prof. Peter Brophy, University of Edinburgh, UK; SMI71 Calbiochem NE1026; Sostdc1 Abcam 99340; Sox10 Gift from Dr. Michael Wegner, UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Erlangen, Germany; Sox2 Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-17320; vWF Abcam ab6994; Iba1 Wako 019â19741, MBP R@D Systems MAB42282, tRFP Evrogen AB233.</p><p>Then, sections were incubated with appropriate AF488, AF555, or AT647- conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific). Nuclei were visualized with 4â, 6â-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.1 mg/ml; Sigma). Images were acquired with fluorescence microscope (Leica DM4000B) and confocal (Zeiss LSM700) microscopes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis of microarray data</title><p>Microarray data were exported from Illumina BeadStudio software, processed and normalized using the R/Bioconductor beadarray, lumi and limma packages. Before normalization, probes that were not detected (detection p value&gt;0.01) were removed from further analysis. Remaining probes were mapped to gene identifiers from Ensembl database (gene_stable_id). For each gene, we computed a single average intensity profile from the profiles of all the probes mapped to it. The resulting average profile was then log2-transformed and used in statistical analysis and visualization. Two microarrays (derived from one animal), which did not accomplish our highest standards of analysis have been excluded from comparison. Differential expression analyses were conducted using the limma Bioconductor package. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Genes with FDRÂ &lt;Â 0.05 and with at least 1.5-fold change in expression levels were found as differentially expressed. Signalling pathways described in the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, 2000) were tested for overrepresentation in the list of differentially expressed genes using Fisherâs exact. Differentially expressed genes between the niches were detected and volcano plot was created.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad) software except microarray analysis. Data are represented as meanÂ Â±Â sd. To detect differences between experimental conditions Studentâs t-test or Mann-Whithney U-test were performed. p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Multiple group comparisons were conducted using one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test. In vitro assays represent three independent experiments from individual culture preparations, unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter along with the Editor-in-Chief to help you consider what may be involved in satisfying the serious concerns raised in the reviews and the reviewer consultation session.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Justyna Ulanska-Poutanen and colleagues try to identify the molecular cues that cause adult OPCs to differentiate into Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes during CNS remyelination following ethidium bromide-induced demyelination in the caudal cerebellar peduncle. They argue that differentiation to Schwann cells (or better Schwann-like cells) is confined to injury-induced perivascular niches (VN) and induced by combined BMP/Wnt signals. These signals are derived from adult OPCs and endothelial cells and become dominant because of the low number of astrocytes and the low level of the astrocyte-derived dual BMP/Wnt inhibitor Sostdc1 in these areas.</p><p>The topic of the study is very interesting and has the potential to shed light on remyelination processes. It is mostly written in an intelligible way. However, there are also several major drawbacks.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript falls short of providing a molecular mechanism of how combined BMP/Wnt signals cause the fate switch in OPCs.</p><p>1) I am missing clear-cut evidence that the proposed signals really cause the fate switch in situ in the CNS. The presented data in favor of the model are first of all correlative CNS expression data. Additional support or stems from DRG co-culture experiments in which OPCs are treated with BMP4 and Wnt2b, and from experiments in which OPCs are grafted into the crushed sciatic nerve in the presence of signaling inhibitors. Neither of these experimental setups faithfully recreates CNS conditions. This is for instance evident from the fact that only Oct6 is induced in co-culture, not however any of the classical peripheral myelin genes.</p><p>2) The argument for selective BMP inhibition in the non-vascular area appears soft. As shown in Figure 3C, there appears to be, at best, a delay in expression of Sostdc1 mRNA in the vascular niche, raising the question as to what happens to the phenotype of the Schwann-like cells or ongoing myelination within that zone subsequent to the 14 day time-point. In addition, is Sostdc1 protein diffusible within the microenvironment? The effects of DORSO and USAG1 upon the numbers of myelinated segments produced by the transplanted cells in the sciatic nerve should also have been quantified, rather than just by single photomicrographs.</p><p>3) In addition, do the total numbers of Sox10 positive cells per unit area in the vascular niche at D10 and D14 post-lesion match (as superficially appear to be the case) supporting a transformation argument. Otherwise, are there other potential explanations for the reduction in Olig2 positive cells such as migration into non-vascular areas or along newly generated blood vessels?</p><p>4) It would be useful to have complementary myelin protein staining to MPZ in Figure 1F. Presumably MBP would be more widely expressed. What about PLP (an oligo specific protein); is this excluded from the perivascular niches?-if not it argues against an all or none phenomenon and/or suggests that the cells in this region are hybrids and as inconsistently conceded in the manuscript only 'Schwann cell like'.</p><p>5) Whereas the expression profile of BMP4 is increased that of BMP2 is trending down. Is further, more complete interrogation of BMP profiling/signalling required before definitive comments about its relevance can be made?</p><p>6) There will of course be some astrocytes in the perivascular area with end-feet contributing to the re-establishment of the blood-brain barrier. Is there suppression of their innate phenotype in this region or is it that these cells are fundamentally different to the reactive astrocytes in the non-vascular area?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30325.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript falls short of providing a molecular mechanism of how combined BMP/Wnt signals cause the fate switch in OPCs.</p><p>1) I am missing clear-cut evidence that the proposed signals really cause the fate switch in situ in the CNS.

Our specific aim was, however, to identify the causative cues that govern the alternate, PNS fate of OPC differentiation. To this end, we have primarily studied a CNS lesion model in which different OPCs differentiation fates occur in defined regions of the lesion. This led us to show that the alternate PNS fate was controlled by a perivascular microenvironment temporarily depleted of astrocyte-derived factors. Thus, a CNS environment containing reactive astrocyte supports canonical oligodendrocyte differentiation. Our logic in the current study was therefore to provide a PNS rather than a CNS environment to examine the ability of the candidate factors to induce the OPC alternative, PNS fate.</p><p>Several lines of evidence have already suggested that BMPs are key players in lineage diversification during differentiation of neural stem cells and promoting a neural crest phenotype in CNS progenitors isolated from embryonic and adult spinal cord. Our microarray data proved the importance of BMP4 and shed light on Wnt signalling as a candidate for cooperative action. Therefore, our working hypothesis was that those two pathways, normally inhibited by astrocyte-derived factor/s in the extra vascular areas of demyelinated CNS white matter are responsible for PNS fate induction.</p><p>We entirely agree that any of the classical peripheral myelin proteins were identified in our in vitro experiments (former Figure 5). We observed an occurrence of myelin segments mainly in control conditions, which suggests that the other treatments caused OPC differentiation delayed.</p><p>Therefore, in order to avoid any further confusion we propose to focus purely on in vivo studies in our revised manuscript. We now provide novel data to strengthen our conclusions and to confirm the causative role of Wnt signalling and BMP/Wnt cooperation in cell fate decision in vivo.</p><p>Namely, we have inhibited Wnt signalling in transplanted OPCs with lentiviral shRNA against Lrp6 (a Wnt co-receptor shown to be necessary for the signaling pathway induction) mimicking Sostdc1 action with regard specifically to Wnt. It has been shown that BMP4 does not interfere with Sostdc1-LRP6 binding, and functional assays showed that the ability of Sostdc1 to block Wnt activity through LRP6 is not impeded by BMP4 (Lintern et al., 2009). Now, we are able to show that inhibition of Lrp6-dependent signaling prevents OPC-to-SC differentiation even in the high BMP4 background of injured sciatic nerve. Specifically, we have infected primary OPC with lentiviral shRNA against Lrp6 and transplanted them into nerves at 1 day after crush. Defective phenotype of cells transduced with LRP6 shRNA indicates that activation of WNT signalling is required and activation of both signalling is indispensable for initiation of PNS fate differentiation which has not been proposed yet. These new data are included in a new Figure 6.</p><p>We do accept that the detailed mechanism of molecular control of the BMP/Wnt pathways cooperation in OPC alternative fate induction we describe remains unresolved. We recognize that solving this question will require for example, conditional genes tracing and OPCâspecific overexpression of BMP4 and Wnt exclusively outside the vascular niche. Moreover, since we proposed Sostdc1 to be a central player to inhibit both signalling pathways the other experimental approach would be using inducible Sostdc1 knockout mice, which however, to our best knowledge, does not exist. On the other hand, rapid depletion of astrocyte, the main source of Sostdc1 protein, by which we could have reduced Sostdc1 production has been shown to cause central axonal damage.</p><p>We therefore contend that since an important milestone has been now achieved, a detailed description of the molecular control of the signalling crosstalk and their downstream elements is beyond the scope of the current study. We very much hope that the reviewer will agree with us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The argument for selective BMP inhibition in the non-vascular area appears soft.

The effects of DORSO and USAG1 upon the numbers of myelinated segments produced by the transplanted cells in the sciatic nerve should also have been quantified, rather than just by single photomicrographs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not having addressed these very valid points more clearly in our original submission.</p><p>Our contention is that expression profiles of BMP4, Wnt2b and Sostdc1 are non-overlapping within defined lesion areas, and this disequilibrium, rather than BMP inhibition per se, is a key factor in determining OPC fate decision. In support of this, we have found that OPC-derived BMP4 is significantly increased in the vascular niche at 10 dpl, while expression of Sostdc1 is low at 10 dpl and limited to non-vascular niche areas. In other words, the delay of Sostdc1 expression in the vascular area allows the both signalling to be activated by their ligands present in the niche within the most critical time frame of OPC differentiation. Thus, the balance between activating and inhibitory signals and their fine-tuning affects the cell fate between 6 and 10 dpl (mostly around 10 dpl).</p><p>Sostdc1 is definitely not restricted to the cell in which it is produced, since it is secreted molecule. However, at 14 dpl, when Sostdc1 is highly expressed, equally in both compartments of the lesion, most of OPCs are already specified to either an oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell fate (according to published data and our previous results on OPC differentiation kinetics, see: Woodruff and Franklin, 1999; Zawadzka et al., 2010, see also depicted in Figure 1).</p><p>In our revised manuscript we have provided quantification of the effects of DORSO and USAG1 upon the numbers of myelinated segments produced by the transplanted cells in the host sciatic nerve, as the reviewer has requested. Moreover, we have performed experiments aimed to dissect BMP and Wnt impact on OPCs fate decision. Because Sostdc1 (or USAG1) serves as an inhibitory protein for both BMP and Wnt, our previous results might have not been fully conclusive in regard to Wnt involvement. Now we show clear evidence for Wnt involvement in induction of Schwann cell differentiation by genetic interference with Wnt signalling in differentiating OPCs (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition, do the total numbers of Sox10 positive cells per unit area in the vascular niche at D10 and D14 post-lesion match (as superficially appear to be the case) supporting a transformation argument.

Microarray data have shown that only BMP4 was upregulated within the demyelinated lesion, regardless of the specific area examined. However, as we shown in Figure 3A, there was a significantly higher level of BMP4 in vascular areas versus non-vascular ones at 10 dpl (which we confirmed by qPCR).</p><p>The data presented in Figure 3A show the ratio of expression between vascular niche and non-VN vascular niche, and suggest low expression of BMP2 in the vascular niche. We draw the reviewersâ attention to the fact that BMP2 transcripts are detected at a very low level and the difference in expression was not significant for either comparison (i.e.: vascular niche vs. non-vascular niche and at 6 dpl vs. 10 dpl).

In this regard, it proved very useful and helped provide the basis for subsequent hypothesis-led experiments about some (but not all) of the potentially relevant signalling pathways that emerged. We do agree that differential expression pattern between regions primarily reflects the difference in cellular composition. Indeed, we provided in vivo and in vitro evidences that the main sources of revealed differences in gene expression are OPCs in the VN and astrocytes in the non-VN. We acknowledge that we could do more to explain why some were chosen and others (Hedgehog for example) were not and have made the necessary amendments to our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There will of course be some astrocytes in the perivascular area with end-feet contributing to the re-establishment of the blood-brain barrier. Is there suppression of their innate phenotype in this region or is it that these cells are fundamentally different to the reactive astrocytes in the non-vascular area?</p></disp-quote><p>As we showed in the Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, astrocytes gradually repopulate the lesion areas (confirming previously published data â e.g. Woodruff and Franklin, Glia, 1999; Gautier et al., Nature Comms, 2015). We found that at 6 dpl astrocytes were not present in the core of lesion, since they were likely killed by ethidium bromide. However, at 10 dpl some astrocytes, with processes juxtaposed to blood vessels and presumably contributing to the re-establishment of the blood-brain barrier, were occasionally observed. At 14 dpl, astrocytes are present in the vicinity of large blood vessels and by 28 dpl present throughout the entire remyelinated area (with the exception of the Schwann cell remyelinated areas) as we have now showed in the Figure 1âfigure supplement 2. In such cases periaxin and GFAP were mutually exclusive, supporting our conclusion that astrocyte-derived factors inhibit the induction of OPC-to-Schwann cell differentiation within areas of the lesion in which astrocytes are present.</p></body></sub-article></article>
