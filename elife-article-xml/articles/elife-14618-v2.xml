For example, compartments called mitochondria – which are surrounded by two layers of membrane – provide the energy needed for many cell processes. The organization of the network of mitochondria in a cell has a large effect on their capacity to provide energy. Mitochondria can fuse together to make larger compartments or divide to make smaller ones. Defects in fusion or division of mitochondria can reduce the amount of energy that is provided, which, in humans and animals can lead to diseases that affect various organs, especially those in the nervous system.</p><p>When two mitochondria fuse they must first attach to each other and then merge their outer membranes. Proteins called mitofusins are known to be involved in these processes, but the molecular details of how they take place were not clear.</p><p>Brandt, Cavellini <italic>et al.</italic> investigated how mitochondria isolated from budding yeast cells attach to each other. The experiments found that two mitochondria first become loosely attached by mitofusins. These proteins then promote a tighter attachment in which the outer membranes of the two mitochondria come into contact over a larger area. This contact area is determined by a linear arrangement of proteins referred to as the docking ring. Brandt, Cavellini <italic>et al.</italic> further observed that local fusion between the outer membranes takes place at the edge of the contact area in the path of the docking ring.</p><p>Future research will need to address how mitochondria attach to each other in living cells and how the process is regulated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14618.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14618.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>mitofusin</kwd><kwd>dynamin-related-proteins</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial dynamics</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INE20100518343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Mickaël M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie FP7</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>276912 (Mitofusion)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Mickaël M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labex DYNAMO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0011-DYNAMO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Mickaël M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CNRS-INSERM ATIP-Avenir Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Mickaël M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of an <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial fusion assay with electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) reveals distinct steps and protein complexes during mitofusin-dependent fusion between adjacent mitochondrial outer membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane fusion underlies fundamental biological processes such as fertilization, virus entry into host cells or intracellular protein trafficking. Protein and lipid trafficking mainly involves SNAREs (Soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptors) that are expressed on all intracellular compartments undergoing fusion except peroxisomes and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escobar-Henriques and Anton, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria constitute a remarkably dynamic network with an organization and ultra-structure that is regulated by fusion and fission of mitochondrial outer and inner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labbé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Fusion and fission are crucial for all mitochondrial functions including oxidative phosphorylation, calcium signalling, apoptosis and lipid metabolism. Defects in mitochondrial fusion and fission are associated with numerous pathologies and severe neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liesa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial fusion and fission both depend on large GTPases of the Dynamin-Related Protein (DRP) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labbé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low and Löwe, 2010</xref>). To promote fission, soluble DRPs assemble into spirals around membrane compartments. GTP hydrolysis causes the spirals to constrict, reducing the diameter of the compartments, ultimately followed by their separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bui and Shaw, 2013</xref>). In contrast to fission, the role of DRPs in lipid bilayer fusion remains poorly understood. Among the three families of transmembrane DRPs implicated in fusion, Mitofusins and OPA1 mediate fusion of the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, respectively, whereas atlastins promote homotypic fusion of ER tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNew et al., 2013</xref>). GTP binding and hydrolysis participate in <italic>trans</italic> auto-oligomerization of atlastins and OPA1 through their respective GTPase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Rujiviphat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Klemm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeVay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meglei and McQuibban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting homotypic tethering of ER and mitochondrial inner membranes is accompanied by conformational rearrangements of the DRPs that are thought to trigger subsequent fusion of lipid bilayers. Based on structural insights gained from BDLP (Bacterial Dynamin-Like Protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Low and Löwe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Low et al., 2009</xref>), a close relative of the yeast mitofusin Fzo1, mitofusins may promote outer membrane tethering and fusion through similar processes of oligomerization and conformational rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escobar-Henriques and Anton, 2013</xref>).</p><p>As seen with spirals formed during membrane scission, DRPs are characterized by their ability to assemble into higher-order macromolecular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Low et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mears and Hinshaw, 2008</xref>). Whether DRPs participate in the formation of such structures during membrane attachment and fusion is unknown. In particular, the precise orchestration of events from the initial attachment of membranes to their ultimate fusion and the requirement for GTP binding and hydrolysis during these steps is elusive. By combining the power of an <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial fusion assay with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we undertook to visualize the junction between mitochondria, resulting in an unprecedented dissection of the outer membrane fusion process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-ET reveals distinct populations of attached mitochondria</title><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial fusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) allows us to distinguish between discrete steps of the mitochondrial fusion process (<italic>i.e.</italic> attachment, fusion of outer membranes and fusion of inner membranes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2004</xref>).

The large contact surface and close approach of outer membranes would poise them for fusion. The proportion of docked intermediates increases when outer membrane fusion can proceed but decreases when fusion is inhibited, as we showed by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>The question of how docking promotes the formation of intermediates with fused outer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) was nonetheless puzzling. Fusion may occur anywhere within the contact area devoid of visible densities because this area corresponds to regions where membrane contact is closest. Alternatively, the docking ring might trigger fusion over the whole rim of the contact area, similar to the 'vertex ring' that assembles at the edge of docked vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wickner, 2010</xref>). This ring, composed of SNAREs, small GTPases, tethering factors and lipid microdomains, promotes membrane fusion at the periphery of contact regions between vacuoles, generating a lumenal vesicle that degrades in the fused organelle. In the context of mitochondrial fusion, such an intralumenal outer membrane vesicle would block the subsequent attachment of inner membranes. Indeed, we did not find fused outer membrane intermediates of this kind.</p><p>However, close inspection of large populations of attached intermediates (from 87 high magnification micrographs) by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of stained plastic sections revealed a sub-category of mitochondria in close contact, presumably in the docked configuration, in which the outer membranes were fused near the rim of the contact region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). While the switch from docking to fusion is bound to be a rapid, transient process and cryo-ET can only sample specimen volumes of the order of 10<sup>–7</sup> nanoliters, we succeeded in capturing such a docked intermediate. The tomographic volume shows that the outer membranes of two mitochondria were locally fused to form a toroid, 40 nm pore on one side of the contact area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The toroid pore formed in the path of the docking ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Densities in the vicinity of the fusion pore were sparse, suggesting that in this region the docking ring structure was in the process of disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These observations provide a proof of principle that the docked intermediates are competent for effective outer membrane fusion, raising the question of which molecular events trigger the transition from docking to outer membrane fusion.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14618.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Stages of outer membrane fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Cryo-ET of docked mitochondria with partially fused outer membrane.

On the other hand, the fusion defect caused by the overexpression of Fzo1 may result from the accumulation of Fzo1 molecules on outer membranes and an imbalance with other proteins implicated in mitochondrial fusion, such as Ugo1 and Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

These tethered intermediates are seen in wild-type conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and accumulate upon addition of GMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Subsequently, GTP hydrolysis allows the fusion process to evolve progressively towards mitochondrial docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), as evidenced by the hybrid intermediates observed upon addition of GMP-PNP two minutes after initiation of tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with this, GTP hydrolysis by <italic>trans</italic>-complexes of atlastins precedes vesicle fusion and is essential to promote tethering of proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The docked intermediates are characterized by a docking ring of protein density that surrounds extended areas with outer membranes separated by less than 3 nm and devoid of visible densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, step 2). The capture of docked intermediates with partly fused outer membranes, the location of the fusion pore in the path of the docking ring undergoing disassembly and the inhibition of fusion upon treatment of docked mitochondria with GMP-PNP, demonstrates that docking is the stage that precedes merging of outer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We do not exclude that small protein complexes, which are not visible by cryo-ET, might reside between outer membranes and participate in the fusion process. However, our observations do suggest that the docking ring of protein densities is the driving force for subsequent bilayer merging. We thus propose that the fusion of bilayers is initiated by further GTP hydrolysis in the path of the docking ring where the outer membrane curvature is most pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, step 3). This step may trigger the disassembly of the docking ring. Tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, step 4) and fusion of the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, step 5) mediated by OPA1/Mgm1 then completes the mitochondrial fusion process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mitofusins are involved in tethering, docking and fusion of outer membranes</title><p>Taking into account the essential role of mitofusins in mitochondrial attachment and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>), we obtained several lines of evidence that Fzo1 contributes to the formation of the macromolecular assemblies we discovered at mitochondrial junctions.</p><p>Overexpression of Fzo1 inhibited mitochondrial docking and fusion but stimulated the formation of artefactual tethering intermediates that are characterized by an accumulation of protein aggregates at mitochondrial junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result demonstrates once more that absence of docking correlates with deficient mitochondrial fusion and implies that normal levels of mitofusins are required for the formation of the docking rings. It is also important to realize that increased levels of mitofusins correlate with the accumulation of protein densities at mitochondrial junctions. However, whether these aggregates correspond to abortive mitofusin oligomers remains speculative.</p><p>GMP-PNP that may bind to mitofusins and inhibit their GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>), induced the accumulation of tethered intermediates and prevented progression towards the docked stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, Fzo1 enrichment at mitochondrial contact sites was confirmed by Q-dot labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). To our knowledge, no other GTPase has been shown to be involved in outer membrane fusion. In this context, our observations converge to propose that Fzo1 is at least a component of globular protein repeats and docking rings, possibly together with other, as yet unknown factors.</p><p>In fact, the units composed of a central density with protrusions extending toward each outer membrane suggest that they may be Fzo1 <italic>trans</italic>-oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). So far, the only structural insight into mitofusins derives from the HR2 domain of Mfn1 that has been proposed to tether outer membranes at a distance of 16 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>). This would exceed the 6 nm membrane spacing we measured in tethered intermediates. The overall morphology of the HR2 dimer can hardly account for the distinctive shape of the protein units we observed. However, the structure of the bacterial Fzo1 homolog BDLP in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Low and Löwe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Low et al., 2009</xref>) and the established <italic>trans</italic>-interaction of atlastins through their GTPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Klemm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saini et al., 2014</xref>) allow us to propose an alternative model. Similar to BDLP, mitofusins bound to GMP-PNP or GTP may adopt an open conformation that, in analogy to atlastins, would promote <italic>trans</italic>-oligomerization of Fzo1 molecules through their GTPase domain. Conformational changes of the mitofusin oligomers upon GTP hydrolysis would pull the outer membranes closer together. This model is not only consistent with the shape of the protein units we visualized but also with the essential requirement of GTP hydrolysis for transition from mitochondrial tethering to mitochondrial docking we unraveled in this study. Hence, the structure of mitofusins with or without bound GTP will be instrumental to evaluate this model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> vs <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial outer membrane fusion</title><p>An absolute prerequisite for mitochondrial fusion <italic>in vivo</italic> is that the tips of mitochondrial tubules come close enough to promote attachment between outer membranes.

In the <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion system, the essential role of the cytoskeleton is replaced by centrifugation to bring mitochondria into close enough contact for fusion to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>). However, centrifugation is not sufficient, and an incubation of at least 10 min on ice, previously suggested to promote Fzo1 association in <italic>trans</italic>, has been shown to be essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our results reveal that incubation on ice promotes the transition from tethering to docking, which is an active process that requires several rounds of GTP hydrolysis to progressively bring opposing outer membranes closer over an extended surface area but is not sufficient for their effective fusion. The observation that fusion starts at the edge of the docking ring and also depends on GTP hydrolysis suggests that the transition from tethering to docking brings membranes closer over an extended area. This would induce a locally increased curvature of the lipid bilayer, which may be critical. An ultimate cycle of GTP hydrolysis in this region of local membrane curvature would therefore lead to fusion instead of bringing membranes closer together. Notably, micrographs taken from gastric mucosa of a mole, featured in Chapter 7 of Don W. Fawcett’s 'The Cell', present a series of three pairs of mitochondria proposed to represent successive stages of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fawcett, 1981</xref>). The middle stage intermediate from this series and the fusion events identified in our study actually appear strikingly similar. This not only suggests that the sequence of events shown in this chapter might in fact correspond to successive stages of fusion but also that our model of outer membrane fusion may apply <italic>in vivo</italic> with mitochondria from mammalian cells.</p><p>Whereas <italic>in vitro</italic> local membrane deformation would be promoted exclusively by successive cycles of GTP hydrolysis after mitochondria become tethered through centrifugation, <italic>in vivo</italic> the transition from tethering to docking would also involve the action of the cytoskeleton. In the cell, the process of mitochondrial fusion as indicated by our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies would thus be regulated by cytoskeletal factors.</p><p>Regulation of mitochondrial fusion <italic>in vivo</italic> also involves post-translational modification of mitofusins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shutt et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, the efficient fusion of outer membranes requires Fzo1 ubiquitylation by the Mdm30 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>). While its precise function is yet to be fully characterized, this regulation was previously shown to take place at the stage of mitochondrial attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the UPS-dependent regulation of Fzo1 participates in regulating proper assembly of docking rings, which is consistent with the observation that high levels of Fzo1 inhibit mitochondrial docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At this stage, we cannot exclude that ubiquitylation and degradation of Fzo1 regulates the transition from docking to effective fusion of outer membranes. Further investigations will be required to answer the fascinating question of how mitochondrial fusion is regulated.﻿﻿</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work provides a detailed dissection of the outer mitochondrial membrane fusion process <italic>in vitro</italic> and highlights the crucial involvement of Fzo1 in this system.

Single tilt series (typically ± 60°, step size 1.5–2.0°) were collected at 300 kV with an FEI Polara or FEI Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a post-column Quantum energy filter and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) at 6 µm underfocus. Magnifications were chosen to give an object pixel size of 3.5 Å or 3.3 Å, respectively. The total electron dose per tilt series was 90–120 e<sup>-</sup>/Å². If dose fractionation was used, frames were aligned using the IMOD software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Tilt series were aligned to gold fiducial markers, binned 2-fold and tomograms were reconstructed by back-projection with IMOD. A final filtering step applying non-linear anisotropic diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frangakis and Hegerl, 2001</xref>) was performed to increase contrast. Tomograms were manually segmented with the program Amira (FEI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of cryo-ET data</title><p>Distances in tomographic data were analyzed using IMOD. The following parameters were measured for each contact: the radii <italic>r</italic> of mitochondria perpendicular and parallel to the contact area, the major axis <italic>l<sub>a</sub></italic> and the minor axis <italic>l<sub>b</sub></italic> of the contact area assuming elliptical geometry and the distance between the outer membranes <italic>d</italic>. The contact area <italic>A</italic> was calculated assuming it to be elliptical, <italic>A</italic> = (π<italic>l<sub>a</sub>l<sub>b</sub></italic>)/4. The normalized contact area ratio <italic>R</italic> was calculated, taking the radius r of the smaller of the two involved mitochondria into account, <italic>R</italic> = <italic>l<sub>a</sub></italic>/(2<italic>r</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial fusion reactions by fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For fluorescence microscopy analysis, the fusion reactions were fixed with two volumes of 8% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Aliquots were immobilized on microscope slides by mixing 1:1 with 2% low melting point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in NMIB. The ratios of fused mitochondria were obtained by dividing the number of GFP and mCherry signals co-localizing with each other over the total number of OM45-GFP (obtained from strain #779) and mito-mCherry (obtained from strain #980) mitochondria (n &gt; 1000). The levels of fused mitochondria were then determined by subtracting the ratios obtained for fusion reactions stopped at the mixing step (at the beginning of the reaction) from those obtained from reactions stopped at t = 45 min (at the end of the reaction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein extracts and immunoblotting</title><p>Cells grown in SD medium were collected during the exponential growth phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5–1). Total protein extracts were prepared by the NaOH/trichloroacetic acid (TCA) lysis technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Volland et al., 1994</xref>). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE 8% and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham<sup>TM</sup> Hybond<sup>TM</sup>-ECL; GE Healthcare, UK). Primary antibodies for immunoblotting were mouse anti-Pgk1 (clone 22C5D8; Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-Fzo1 (Covalab, France), anti-Ugo1 (Covalab), anti-Mgm1 (kind gift from Andreas Reichert) and mouse anti-Por1 (clone 16G9E6BC4; Abcam). Primary antibodies were detected by secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation with the Clarity Western ECL kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting images were acquired with a Gel Doc<sup>TM</sup> XR + (Bio-Rad) and processed with the Image Lab 3.0.1 software (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Spot assays</title><p>Cultures grown overnight in SD medium were pelleted, resuspended at OD<sub>600</sub> = 1, and serially diluted (1:10) five times in water. Three microliters of the dilutions were spotted on SD and SG plates and grown for 3 days (dextrose) or 5 days (glycerol) at 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mitochondrial network morphology</title><p>Mitochondrial morphology was analyzed in cells expressing mito-GFP from the p426-TEF-mitoGFP plasmid (MC244). Strains were grown in dextrose medium to mid-log phase and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Morphology phenotypes were assessed in at least 100 cells. Data reported are the mean and standard deviation (SD, error bars) of three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy was carried out with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany). For <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion assays a 100X oil immersion objective and the following filter sets were used: 10 Alexa Fluor 489 (Excitation BP 450–490, Beam Splitter FT 510, Emission BP 515–565) for GFP, mCherry (Excitation BP 542–582, Beam Splitter FT 593, Emission BP 604–679) for mCherry. Images were acquired with an SCMOS ORCA FLASH 4.0 charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) and the Zen 2012 Package Acquisition/Analyse software before processing with ImageJ. Mitochondrial morphology was analyzed with a 63X oil immersion objective and an FITC filter (Filter set 44, Excitation BP 475/40, Beam Splitter FT 500, Emission BP 530/50) for GFP. Cell contours were visualized with Nomarski optics. Images were acquired with an ORCA-R2 CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and processed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantum dot labelling</title><p>Specific labelling of mitofusins on attached mitochondria was achieved using Quantum Dots coupled to streptavidin (QDot 525ITK streptavidin; Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA), which required specific biotinylation of Fzo1. For this purpose, the <italic>FZO1</italic> ORF placed under control of its own promoter, was fused at its 3’-end in tandem with a sequence encoding for the Avi tag, a 15 amino-acid peptide that can be recognized and undergo specific biotinylation by the <italic>E. coli</italic> biotin ligase BirA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckett et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Werven and Timmers, 2006</xref>). The resulting <italic>pFZO1-AVI</italic> plasmid (MC369) was introduced in <italic>fzo1△</italic> cells using a plasmid shuffling strategy to yield the <italic>FZO1-AVI</italic> yeast strain (MCY1155) that expresses Fzo1-Avi as the sole source of mitofusin in the cell. After verifying that Fzo1-Avi is competent for mitochondrial fusion <italic>in vivo</italic>, mitochondria were purified to promote biotinylation of Fzo1-Avi <italic>in vitro</italic>. Briefly, 0.5 mg of total mitochondrial enriched fractions prepared from FZO1 (MCY1154) or FZO1-Avi (MCY1155) cells were incubated at 25°C for 60 min with 10 µg BirA and 1X biotin in biomix A + B buffer (Biotinylation kit purchased from GeneCopoeia Inc; Rockville, MD) before processing for attachment assays. Following 30 min incubation on ice in Stage 1 buffer, attachment reactions were incubated for 60 min at 4°C with 50 nM streptavidin-coupled QDs before processing for cryo-ET analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Friederike Joos for expert technical assistance in preparing and imaging thin sections and Naïma Belgareh-Touzé for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Brandt et al. analyzed structural steps involved in the fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane by applying electron cryo-tomography to an in vitro mitochondrial fusion assay. The authors centrifuged the mitochondria to attach to each other at 4°C and stimulated fusion by increasing the temperature to 25°C. After centrifugation, the authors observed two types of mitochondrial contacts. The first type of contact, with a relatively short distance of 1-3 nm, includes a regular pattern of globular proteins or protein complexes at the periphery of the contact sites (termed docking ring) based on three-dimensional reconstitution. The second type of contact does not exhibit a docking ring, and globular protein patterns are observed uniformly over the contact surface. The formation of these contact sites requires Fzo1, an outer membrane GTPase that is essential for mitochondrial fusion. Incubation of mitochondria in the presence of GMP-PNP decreased the first type of contact site with a docking ring and increased the second type of contacts, suggesting that GTP hydrolysis is necessary for the formation of contacts with a docking ring from less-organized contacts. To test whether the docking ring contains Fzo1, the authors examined the localization of Fzo1 using the Avi tag and quantum dots and noted that Fzo1 was enriched at the junctions. The authors additionally suggest that fusion initiates at the periphery of contact sites where the docking ring is located (based on one image that they were able to capture). The model in which Fzo1 forms a ring-like pattern at membrane contacts using GTP hydrolysis is interesting. Since structural intermediates of mitochondrial fusion are largely unknown, this study potentially provides new insight into the mechanisms of mitochondrial fusion. However, at the same time, the findings are still preliminary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript presents an interesting model. The formation of a large ring is different from what has been expected. The reviewers appreciate the high technical challenges posed by this problem and the novelty of the approach, but at the same time are skeptical about the model. The main point seems to be that localized tethering is followed by spreading of the contacts to a larger area with Fzo1 moving out to the edges. It is not easy to understand how this sequence of events promotes fusion. The reviewers worry that the spreading could be an artefact of the system; in vitro fusion is slow and relatively inefficient in comparison with fusion in living cells, and thus the single fusion event caught by cryo-EM could be abnormal. Can it be excluded that the large rings may just happen when mitochondria are squished together enough in vitro. It is not clear if this may happen <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors seem to conclude that the site of fusion is adjacent to the docking ring on the basis of one image.

The formation of a large ring is different from what has been expected. The reviewers appreciate the high technical challenges posed by this problem and the novelty of the approach, but at the same time are skeptical about the model. The main point seems to be that localized tethering is followed by spreading of the contacts to a larger area with Fzo1 moving out to the edges. It is not easy to understand how this sequence of events promotes fusion. The reviewers worry that the spreading could be an artefact of the system;</italic> in vitro <italic>fusion is slow and relatively inefficient in comparison with fusion in living cells, and thus the single fusion event caught by cryo-EM could be abnormal. Can it be excluded that the large rings may just happen when mitochondria are squished together enough in vitro. It is not clear if this may happen in vivo.</italic> </p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial fusion assay was set up by the Nunnari group and allowed demonstrating that outer and inner membrane fusion are distinct events (Meeusen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004). This distinction was manifest by the observation of outer membrane-fused intermediates in which two unfused cristae systems are surrounded by a single outer membrane. By blocking fusion of inner membranes, the occurrence of such outer membrane-fused intermediates was subsequently demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> (Chan DC <italic>et al.</italic>, Mol Biol Cell, 2009), confirming that <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion processes are similar.</p><p>The major difference between both systems is that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, mitochondria are brought into proximity by the cytoskeleton. <italic>In vitro</italic>, this essential step is achieved by centrifugation. However, bringing mitochondria into proximity by centrifugation is not sufficient to promote fusion <italic>in vitro</italic>. An additional 10 minute pre-incubation on ice was shown to be required (Meeusen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004).</p><p>Our high-resolution analysis of attachment intermediates reveals the existence of tethered and docked mitochondria and describes the differences between these two states. Most importantly, it establishes that the incubation on ice enables the transition from tethering to docking and demonstrates the essential requirement of GTP hydrolysis, which proves that it is an active process. An important conclusion of the study is that absence of docking systematically correlates with a lower incidence of outer membrane-fused intermediates, and therefore with an inhibition outer membrane fusion. Moreover, mitochondria in the docked configuration are the only intermediates with which we were able to capture fusion events (1 in cryoEM and 2 new events in TEM; see below). Taken together, these observations indicate clearly that docked mitochondria are the initial state in the formation of outer membrane-fused intermediates <italic>in vitro</italic>. Visualization of docking <italic>in vivo</italic> merits further investigation, but this clearly goes well beyond the scope of our study. In the revised manuscript, we extended the Discussion to emphasize the main differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial fusion (see point 4 below).</p><p> <italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors seem to conclude that the site of fusion is adjacent to the docking ring on the basis of one image. The reviewers strongly feel that the single fusion event observed is not enough. Additional images and quantification will be required.</italic> </p><p><italic>For instance, would lowering the temperature slow down the rate of fusion pore opening and help to obtain more images of this intermediate? In order to capture further fusion intermediates the authors may also consider the possibility of treating docked mitochondria with a crosslinker. As outer membrane fusion is accompanied by a quick disassembly of trans-associated Fzo1 molecules, crosslinked molecules are probably more difficult to disassemble so that local fusion pores might be retained and fusion might not proceed further.</italic></p><p>We agree that the visualization of additional fused intermediates such as that captured by cryo-EM is desirable. It has to be realized though that the visualization of such inherently rare events by electron cryo-tomography, which samples volumes of a few billionths of a nanoliter at a time, is extremely difficult. We were fortunate to capture one fusion intermediate after incubation of docked intermediates at 4°C and extensive screening. By lowering the temperature we slowed down the rate of fusion pore opening as much as possible, but even so found only one single event. In addition, fusion is, even at 4°C, highly transient, which reduces the capturing probability further. Lowering the temperature to 0°C is unlikely to help, and temperatures below 0°C are obviously excluded in aqueous solution. It might be possible to visualize fusion events by live imaging and fluorescence microscopy, but this would be at much lower resolution and an entirely different study.</p><p>While at first sight the suggestion to treat docked mitochondria with crosslinking agents may seem reasonable, it could be (rightly) criticized for producing artefacts, as it carries a high risk of capturing aberrant and non-productive events instead of <italic>bona-fide</italic> docking and fusion intermediates. Moreover, to monitor such experiments by cryo-tomography would be extremely tedious and time-consuming. We conclude that in the context of our present study, crosslinking is not a good approach.</p><p>To produce more images of fusion intermediates and to satisfy the reviewer and editor, we resorted to EM analysis of thin sections of mitochondria that were fixed and stained after inducing fusion <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this way, it is possible to sample large populations of attached mitochondria, some of which will have undergone fusion of their outer membranes. While this is still a rare event, we were indeed able to image two more fusion events in this way, in addition to the fusion intermediate captured by cryo-EM. In both cases, the outer membranes are fused near the outer rim of the contact region. These two intermediates are now shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref> in the revised manuscript. Note that our new EM analysis did not indicate any fusion intermediates other than mitochondria with two <italic>cristae</italic> surrounded by a single outer membrane, as shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. This fully supports our model and indicates that docking results in fusion, which commences near the edge of the contact area, which precedes the apposition and merging of inner membranes occurs. These new results are presented in a paragraph in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>2). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors suggest that the overexpression of Fzo1 increases mitochondrial attachment</italic> in vitro<italic>. However, it is unclear whether these mitochondria are already attached before the assay was performed because Fzo1-overexpressing cells possess aggregated mitochondria. What is the frequency of attached Fzo1-overexpressing mitochondria without centrifugation?</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. To check it, we used fluorescence microscopy to analyze the ratio of attached mitochondria from cells overexpressing Fzo1 as compared to wild-type. This was done before centrifugation, after centrifugation and after 10 minutes incubation on ice (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7 —figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). The results indicate that mitochondria from Fzo1-ovexpressing cells are not only more attached before centrifugation but are also more competent for <italic>de novo</italic> attachment <italic>in vitro</italic> (as evidenced by the difference of attachment before and after centrifugation).</p><p> <italic>As the authors say, fragmentation caused by overexpression of Fzo1 could result from stalling of the fusion intermediates, because there is too much Fzo1 on the surface. This problem could, however, also result from an imbalance with other proteins, such as Ugo1 or Mgm1, impeding progression through the different stages of fusion.</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript, we analyze mitochondrial attachment upon Fzo1 overexpression and conclude that it “induces the formation of protein aggregates that perturb the regulated sequence of events required to reach productive mitochondrial docking.” We did not intend to discuss the molecular details that might explain the fusion deficiency.</p><p>We nonetheless fully agree with the reviewers that the fusion defect may be caused by the aggregation of Fzo1 molecules on outer membranes, an imbalance with other proteins such as Ugo1 and Mgm1, or possibly both. This then led us to test the levels of Ugo1 and Mgm1 in whole-cell extracts prepared from wild-type or Fzo1-overexpressing cells with anti-Ugo1 and anti-Mgm1 antibodies (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7 —figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, while Ugo1 levels did not vary, which is consistent with a possible imbalance, the ratio between long and short forms of Mgm1 was slightly shifted toward the short form in cells overexpressing Fzo1. This may contribute to the changes in <italic>cristae</italic> morphology upon Fzo1 overexpression as seen in the electron micrographs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p> <italic>3). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, only limited images are shown in terms of the localization of quantum dots used to localize Fzo1. Based on these images, it is difficult to determine if Fzo1 is truly enriched at the contact sites. Quantification is also critical to support the conclusion. In addition, the localization of other outer-membrane proteins should be included as negative controls.</italic> </p><p>This comment is well taken. It is however important to remember that the enrichment of Fzo1 at mitochondrial contact sites has already been shown by immuno-labelling of TEM sections (Hoppins <italic>et al.</italic>, J Cell Biol 2009). In our study we nevertheless took the challenge of devising a specific method for Fzo1 labelling on cryo-tomograms, partly to confirm this finding, but mainly to demonstrate that mitofusins accumulate in contact regions, where we discovered the docking rings and regular repeats of globular densities. We must also emphasize that <italic>in situ</italic> Q-dot labelling of endogenous proteins in cryo-tomograms has to our knowledge never been published before. The reviewers and editors should be aware that our approach thus represents a technical breakthrough and is very much more challenging than a routine labelling technique such as to immuno-staining of thin plastic sections.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for inviting us to show more images of Fzo1 labelling and to quantify our observations, to corroborate our conclusions. The requested changes have been made in the new panels C, D and E of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The quantification demonstrates that while Q-Dots were rarely found on the surface of tagged or untagged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>, right graph), they were enriched threefold at the junction of attached FZO1-Avi mitochondria as compared to attached FZO1 mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, left graph). This indicates both that Fzo1 labeling was specific (although weak) and that this specific labeling occurred preferentially in regions where Fzo1 accumulates as shown by Hoppins <italic>et al</italic>. These observations thus confirm that in our tomograms Fzo1 is enriched at mitochondrial contact sites, which is in line with the involvement of this mitofusin in the assembly of docking rings and regular repeats of globular densities.</p><p>In light of these results, the necessity to localize other outer-membrane proteins becomes questionable for several reasons. First, the experiment we devised is already controlled for non-specific labelling. Second, it is unlikely that specific labelling for another outer-membrane protein could be achieved unless this factor gets enriched at particular regions of the mitochondrial surface. Third, localizing another protein would require yet another setup to tag the protein, label it with Q-dots and localize it by Cryo-EM, which, taken together, would place an unreasonably heavy burden on us that would take many months.</p><p> <italic>4) The title should include that the findings are based on an</italic> in vitro <italic>assay.</italic></p><p><italic>The Discussion should also point out the potential limitations due to the</italic> in vitro <italic>system used.</italic> </p><p>The words “<italic>in vitro</italic>” have been added to the title and the Discussion has been extended to explain and rationalize the main differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion of outer membranes.</p><p> <italic>5) According to the style of eLife, the Abstract should mention the biological system used.</italic></p><p>The Abstract has been edited to emphasize that the <italic>in vitro</italic> attachment and fusion assays were performed with mitochondria isolated from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>We include the comments of the three reviewers.
