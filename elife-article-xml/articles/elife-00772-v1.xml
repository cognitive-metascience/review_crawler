However, the molecular identity of the components of the MPTP remains unknown. Here, we determined that the Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak, which are central regulators of apoptotic cell death, are also required for mitochondrial pore-dependent necrotic cell death by facilitating outer membrane permeability of the MPTP. Loss of Bax/Bak reduced outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and conductance without altering inner membrane MPTP function, resulting in resistance to mitochondrial calcium overload and necrotic cell death. Reconstitution with mutants of Bax that cannot oligomerize and form apoptotic pores, but still enhance outer membrane permeability, permitted MPTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling and restored necrotic cell death. Our data predict that the MPTP is an inner membrane regulated process, although in the absence of Bax/Bak the outer membrane resists swelling and prevents organelle rupture to prevent cell death.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00772.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00772.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00772.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In all multicellular plants and animals, cells are continuously dying and being replaced. There are a number of different types of cell death, but two of the best studied are apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis, sometimes referred to as ‘cell suicide’, is a form of programmed cell death that is generally beneficial to the organism. Necrosis, however, occurs whenever cells are damaged—for example, due to a lack of oxygen—and can trigger harmful inflammation in surrounding tissue. Although the processes leading up to apoptosis and necrosis are very different, they both involve regulated changes in mitochondria—the organelles that supply cells with chemical energy.</p><p>Mitochondria have a distinctive appearance, being enclosed by two membranes, the innermost of which is highly folded. During apoptosis, large pores form in the outer membranes of mitochondria. These pores are generated by two proteins—Bax and Bak—and they enable the mitochondrion to release proteins that activate processes involved in apoptosis. Pores also form in the mitochondrial membrane during necrosis. However, these mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs) occur simultaneously in both the inner and outer membranes and are thought to lead to swelling and rupture of mitochondria.</p><p>Now, Karch et al. have shown that Bax and Bak are also involved in the formation of these permeability pores that underlie necrosis. When mouse cells that had been genetically modified to lack Bak and Bax were grown in cell culture, they were found to be resistant to substances that normally induce necrosis. Instead, their mitochondria continued to function normally, suggesting that MPTPs cannot form in the absence of Bak and Bax.</p><p>Karch et al. then generated mice with heart cells that lack Bax and Bak, and deprived their hearts of oxygen to simulate a heart attack. Compared to normal mice, the genetically modified animals experienced less damage to their heart muscle, suggesting that the absence of Bax and Bak prevents cell death due to necrosis. If Bax and Bak are involved in both apoptosis and necrosis, inhibiting them could be a powerful therapeutic approach for preventing all forms of cell death during heart attacks or in certain degenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00772.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00772.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>necrosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molkentin</surname><given-names>Jeffery D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HL080101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robbins</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Kinnally</surname><given-names>Kathleen W</given-names></name><name><surname>Molkentin</surname><given-names>Jeffery D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Heart Association pre-doctoral grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karch</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The proteins Bax and Bak, which increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis, are also crucial for generating a mitochondrial membrane pore that is specifically involved in necrosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria have emerged as critical regulators of apoptotic and necrotic cell death, with distinct molecular effectors underlying each process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tait and Green, 2010</xref>). Apoptosis is both an ATP- and caspase-dependent event characterized by chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, and plasma membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004</xref>). Necrosis, however, is an ATP-independent event characterized by organelle swelling and early plasma membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004</xref>). One key difference between apoptosis and necrosis is the type of events that occur in the mitochondria and the distinct pores that are formed. During apoptosis, the mitochondrial outer membrane is permeabilized through the action of the Bcl-2 family members Bax/Bak that generate large pores that allow for the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and the subsequent activation of the caspase cascade. In contrast, during forms of cellular necrosis, one key regulated event is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a protein complex that was proposed to span the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes in facilitating loss of the inner membrane potential, swelling, and eventual rupture of the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halestrap, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tait and Green, 2010</xref>). While the identity of the outer and inner membrane components of the MPTP remains elusive, cyclophilin D (CypD), a peptidylprolyl isomerase located in the mitochondrial matrix, is known to bind and regulate the inner membrane complex. Indeed, deletion of the gene encoding CypD renders mitochondria resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload–induced swelling and the heart and brain partially resistant to cell death due to ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schinzel et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria is absolutely dependent on Bax/Bak, as deficiency in the genes encoding these two proteins renders cells resistant to apoptosis and concomitant release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> through the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tait and Green, 2010</xref>). Previous studies have suggested a role for Bax/Bak in the regulation or formation of the MPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marzo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narita et al., 1998</xref>), although more recent studies have disputed such a direct role, suggesting that Bax/Bak only have a secondary effect, such as by regulating mitochondrial fission/fusion or no effect whatsoever, or just a secondary effect due to organelle rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Marchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaseva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whelan et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that Bax/Bak are required for mitochondrial permeability pore-dependent cell death by serving as a necessary functional component of the MPTP within the outer mitochondrial membrane in a manner that is distinct from their more active mechanism of oligomerization during apoptosis, placing Bax/Bak at the bifurcation point of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and necrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bax/Bak1 null cells resist necrotic cell death</title><p>We first evaluated the ability of wild type (Wt) and <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic>-deficient (<italic>Bak1</italic> gene encodes Bak protein) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to die by apoptosis or mitochondrial-dependent necrosis. As previously reported, <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> double-knockout (DKO) MEFs were highly resistant to cell death by the apoptotic inducer staurosporine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2001</xref>), while Wt MEFs showed high levels of killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, DKO MEFs were also resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ionomycin, and DNA alkylation with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) that appeared to induce a necrotic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Indeed, electron microscopy verified that staurosporine-treated Wt cells, but not DKO cells, exhibited hallmarks of apoptosis including nuclear condensation with maintenance of plasma membrane integrity, while ionomycin induced a purely necrotic phenotype that showed rupture of the plasma membrane and dispersion of the nucleus, which was not seen in DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By comparison, analysis of apoptotic cell death with annexin V (phosphatidylserine externalization in the plasma membrane) and necrotic death with propidium iodide (PI, plasma membrane opening/rupture) staining in cultured MEFs showed an apoptotic profile with staurosporine treatment, while ionomycin induced a necrotic phenotype; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> had an intermediate profile of both forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Apoptosis leads to annexin V staining prior to PI staining, while necrosis causes simultaneous annexin V and PI staining. Molecular markers also confirmed a uniform apoptotic profile in Wt MEFs treated with staurosporine, such that caspase cleavage was observed and cell death was inhibited with z-Vad (pan-caspase inhibitor) but not by disabling the MPTP in MEFs from <italic>Ppif</italic> (CypD)-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). By comparison, ionomycin-induced cell death in Wt MEFs did not appreciably involve caspase activation nor was it affected by caspase inhibition, while inhibiting MPTP function by deletion of the <italic>Ppif</italic> gene–reduced cell death, suggesting mitochondrial-dependent necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). Using these conditions, DKO MEFs were completely refractory to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- and ionomycin-induced necrosis as assessed with annexin V and PI labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), but all deaths were restored in DKO MEFs containing a stably integrated Bax or Bak viral–based expression cassette, or acutely by infection with a recombinant Bax encoding adenovirus, collectively indicating that there is not an unrelated defect in the DKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>).

Necrosis more immediately extinguishes oxidative phosphorylation as the inner mitochondrial membrane is opened and the proton gradient is lost. Indeed, Wt MEFs treated with staurosporine maintained respiration considerably longer than observed with ionomycin treatment even though staurosporine-treated Wt MEFs died considerably faster than those with ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). However, DKO MEFs showed no reduction in oxygen consumption with ionomycin over 24 hr, providing yet another line of evidence that MPTP-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction does not occur in the absence of Bax/Bak protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Other mitochondrial proteins involved in cell death, the MPTP, and respiration all appeared normal in DKO MEFs, except for a mild upregulation of Bim and Bnip3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also verified that ionomycin treated <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> null MEFs still had functionally competent mitochondria as compared to ionomycin treated Wt MEFs by measuring respiration in response to oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A. Both oligomycin (complex V inhibitor) and antimycin A (complex III inhibitor) inhibited oxygen consumption, suggesting that respiration observed was due to mitochondrial oxygen consumption as opposed to extra-mitochondrial sources. Further, treatment with FCCP increased respiration in the <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> null but not in the Wt MEFs, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration was still coupled to ATP synthesis in ionomycin treated DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, mitochondria from <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> null MEFs were fully functional after ionomycin and responded to the drugs similar to untreated mitochondria, showing their ability to maintain respiration and generate ATP long after Wt mitochondria have lost such ability with ionomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, and consistent with results in DKO MEFs, cardiac-specific deletion of <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> significantly protected the heart from ischemia–reperfusion (I-R) injury and reduced lethality in mice subjected to permanent myocardial infarction injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Specifically, in the absence of Bax/Bak protein, mitochondrial inner membrane opening still occurred in response to ionomycin as measured directly with the calcein–CoCl<sub>2</sub> assay, similar to Wt MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This later observation is consistent with ultrastructual data discussed above in which the inner membrane can still reorganize without Bax/Bak in response to necrotic stimuli. Notably, purified mitochondria from Wt MEFs showed release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> with ionomycin stimulation and loss of respiration with serial addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while mitochondria lacking Bax and Bak protein did not show cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release or loss of respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These results suggest that the inner membrane component of the MPTP still functions normally in <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> DKO MEFs, but without sufficient outer membrane permeability, swelling/rupture is prevented and the mitochondria can reestablish respiration capacity.</p><p>To more carefully examine this concept, we attempted to reconstitute the outer membrane function of Bax/Bak with other pore-forming entities or nonoligomerized recombinant Bax (rBax). Purified liver DKO mitochondria stimulated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> were still protected from swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). However, treatment of DKO mitochondria with rBax at concentrations that did not cause cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release (data not shown) fully restored Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced mitochondrial swelling, which was still inhibited with CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Moreover, treatment with gossypol, a BH3-mimetic compound that can convert Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl into pore-forming pro-cell death agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lei et al., 2006</xref>) restored mitochondrial swelling in the absence of Bax/Bak protein, which was also inhibited with CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Generation of nonspecific pores that only affected the outer mitochondrial membrane with either digitonin or tetanolysin also restored Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced swelling in DKO mitochondria, which was again inhibited with CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These results suggest that Bax/Bak permit mitochondrial swelling through a permeabilization activity in the outer mitochondrial membrane that functions independently of the inner membrane CypD-regulated component of the MPTP. Indeed, increasing concentrations of poloxamer-188 (P-188), which inherently reduces membrane permeability characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2004</xref>), prevented mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> as analyzed in purified mitochondria in solution or by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). These observations suggest that outer membrane permeability plays a necessary and permissive role in MPTP-dependent swelling, rupture, and cellular necrosis.</p><p>We also performed patch clamping of the outer mitochondrial membrane from Wt and DKO purified mitochondria to directly examine if Bax/Bak were generating a pore-like activity in the outer membrane. The MPTP has been well characterized by direct patch-clamping of mitochondria and shown to have a specific conductance profile that is distinct from any other channels or permeating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinnally and Antonsson, 2007</xref>). The data show baseline conductance of approximately 750 pS in Wt mitochondria, which was significantly reduced in DKO mitochondria to approximately 300 pS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Addition of the same non-oligomerizing rBax restored this baseline permeability and even enhanced it slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). This low-conductance channel activity with rBax was slightly cation selective but was not voltage dependent (±50 mV) (data not shown). These results suggest that the presence of Bax/Bak impart a different permeability characteristic to the outer mitochondrial membrane that relates to its necessary but permissive role in MPTP function. Because Bax/Bak could be acting through another protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane to impart this increase in permeability, we also used a reconstitution assay in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>).

The high resistance and low permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane with Bax/Bak deficiency reported here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that this membrane is not a sieve but rather a membrane whose permeability is tightly regulated, despite the presence of other channels such as voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, comprising as many as three gene products, <italic>Vdac1</italic>, <italic>Vdac2</italic>, and <italic>Vdac3</italic>) and TOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00772.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Bax/Bak regulate outer mitochondrial membrane permeability directly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Patch clamp current traces (2 s, 5 KHz sampling, 1 KHz filter in 0.15 M KCl media) from Wt and DKO whole mitochondria and liposomes are shown after excised patches were voltage clamped at −20 to 40 mV and reveal small variable-sized transitions, typically approximately 50–100 pS.

Over a decade ago, several reports suggested that Bax and/or Bak directly interacted with presumed components of the MPTP, the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in the inner membrane and the VDAC in the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marzo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shimizu et al., 1999</xref>). However, while the mitochondrial swelling/permeability pore data reported in these earlier manuscripts are still valid, the conclusion that Bax/Bak function merely to regulate the MPTP by binding VDAC or ANT is not consistent with the data from <italic>Slc25a4/Slc25a5</italic> (ANT1/2 protein) and <italic>Vdac1/2/3</italic> gene–deleted mice, which showed that neither protein is directly required for MPTP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kokoszka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our data support a model whereby Bax and/or Bak are part of the outer membrane component of the MPTP in a ‘resting’ nonapoptotic state. Bax has been shown to adopt two types of channel activities, one of which has a small pore size (0.9 nm) and is homogenous in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which could fulfill the permeability function we observed here to permit nonapoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). As another consideration, the α5/α6 domain of Bax is known to have membrane permeation activity and to permit pore formation on its own, the permeation size of which appears to reach an equilibrium of less than 10 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuertes et al., 2010</xref>). Bcl-2 family members appear to generally alter the permeability and rigidity of lipid membranes, and even the Bcl-2 homologue from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, CED-9 can induce leakiness of reconstituted lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). The exact mechanism whereby Bcl-2 family members might increase membrane permeability and small molecular permeation in their nonoligomerized state is unknown, although it may be related to the distinct lipid environment in the mitochondria and how it interacts with the select hydrophobic α-helixes in the core of the Bcl-2 proteins.</p><p>The most straightforward model that is consistent with our data and the literature describing the biophysical properties of Bcl-2 family members is that Bax and Bak function as the outer membrane activity of the MPTP. Once the inner membrane pore opens through a CypD-regulated event, the outer membrane is already poised to complete the process, given the permeability characteristics imparted by Bax/Bak in their monomeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, liposome reconstitution with recombinant nonactivated Bax directly increased membrane permeability, and rBax immediately restored swelling in isolated mitochondria. Moreover, increasing the activity of Bax/Bak with ABT-737 sensitized the MPTP to opening with mild Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation in Wt but not DKO mitochondria, and nonspecific increases in outer mitochondrial membrane permeability with gossypol or other agents fully restored mitochondrial swelling and cell death in the absence of Bax/Bak. Direct patching of mitochondria outer vs inner membranes showed that Bax/Bak permit MPTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling by only enhancing conductance of the outer membrane. Our results also suggest that the outer mitochondrial membrane does not directly induce the inner membrane to undergo MPTP, and that initiation of this process is an inner membrane-regulated phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, lack of sufficient outer membrane permeability, as observed in the absence of Bax/Bak protein or with addition of poloxamer-188 in Wt mitochondria, sufficiently restrains swelling and organelle rupture to allow reestablishment of inner membrane potential and continued cell survival. Thus, Bax and Bak are necessary for MPTP-dependent cell death by functioning exclusively within the outer membrane as permeability factors that facilitate an irreversible swelling threshold leading to rupture of the mitochondrion and cell death, once the inner membrane component is fully engaged.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00772.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of how Bax and Bak influence MPTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling and organelle rupture.</title><p>The model shows mitochondria undergoing MPTP opening (blue) via CypD (yellow) in the presence and absence of Bax/Bak (red).

Indeed, ABT-737 treatment increased cellular necrosis, mitochondrial swelling, and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in isolated mitochondria by augmenting the amount/activity of Bax/Bak in the outer mitochondrial membrane. While we cannot rule out other potential mechanisms of action for ABT-737, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that acute alterations in the activity of select Bcl-2 family members could affect cellular necrosis by acutely regulating the activity, localization, or function of Bax/Bak. Indeed, Nix/BNip3L, which is induced by disease/developmental signaling pathways that enhance cell death, can alter the activity and pro-death characteristics of Bax/Bak as well as alter MPTP-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>With respect to medical relevance, our results are important because they suggest that Bax/Bak are a common nodal point in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Thus, inhibition of Bax/Bak should be the most therapeutically potent means of antagonizing acute cell death following ischemic injury in vivo or in adult onset degenerative diseases, as it would block both mitochondrial-dependent processes. Moreover, other types of regulated necrotic cell death might also be inhibited in the absence of Bax/Bak, such as necroptosis, also referred to as extrinsic necrosis or RIP-dependent necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degterev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hitomi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).

Briefly, cells were harvested and fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with primary antibody diluted at 1:50 in PBS-containing digitonin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in PBS and analyzed with a flow cytometer (10,000/sample). Activation of Bak was determined by cross-linking isolated mitochondria (50 μg) from cells treated with 10 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) at room temperature for 30 min. The mitochondria were then suspended in SDS sample buffer, and a Western blot was performed. Wt MEFs were treated with or without St and Iono for 12 hr in the presence of 40 μM z-Vad. After 12 hr, they were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in HNC buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 2% CHAPS). The lysates were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE, Pittsburgh, PA). The column was pre-equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, and 2% CHAPS and calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), B amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (12 kDa; Sigma).

Membrane patches of isolated mitochondria were excised after formation of a seal using micropipettes with approximately 0.3-µm tips and resistances of 10–30 MΩ at room temperature. Patching media was 150 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 0.23 mM CaCl<sub>2,</sub> 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. Voltages were clamped with an Axopatch 200 amplifier and reported as pipette potentials. Permeability was typically determined from stable current levels and/or total amplitude histograms of 30 s of data at +20 mV. pClamp version 8 (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) and WinEDR v2.3.3 (Strathclyde Electrophysiological Software, Glasgow, UK) were used for current analysis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2009</xref>). Sample rate was 5 kHz with 1–2 kHz filtration. The channel activity of rBax was characterized in DKO mitochondria and liposomes devoid of other proteins with and without its activator tBid. Micropipette tips were filled with media containing 10–100 ng/µl monomeric rBax and then backfilled with patching media. Hence, the actual Bax concentration was lower than that loaded in the tips. Seals were formed with these micropipettes on giant liposomes or mitochondria prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2009</xref>). Ion selectivity was determined through reversal potentials after a 150:30 mM KCl gradient was established across the patch as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pavlov et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Suzanne Hoppins and Jodi Nunnari (University of California, Davis, CA) for providing the MEFs with the non-oligomerizing Bax mutants.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript addresses the important question of whether Bax and Bak regulate the permeability properties of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The data suggest that Bax/Bak null mitochondria resist swelling, and they are interpreted within a model “whereby Bax and/or Bak are part of the outer membrane component of the MPTP in a ‘resting’ non-apoptotic state”. Yet the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is an inner membrane event that readily occurs in mitoplasts. The link with MPTP-dependent swelling is therefore an interpretation that must be confirmed by additional experiments. The proposed experiments will address whether Bax/Bak affect outer membrane resistance to rupture only when the MPTP opens or independent of the mechanism of matrix swelling.</p><p>1) The first experiment the reviewers agreed on is to test whether mitochondria are able to resist swelling if the mitoplast swelling is induced by other agents that are not known to cause MPTP, for example valinomycin in K<sup>+</sup>- and Pi-containing media, or in iso-osmotic media containing varying K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, best if in the presence of added cytochrome c. This would also allow testing to determine whether resistance to swelling is specifically seen when the pore opens, or is rather an independent feature conferred to the outer membrane by lack of Bax/Bak.</p><p>2) Additionally, since comparing mitochondria of different genotypes is not trivial, and normalization to initial absorbance can be deceptive, what is needed is the addition of a pore-forming agent (such as alamethicin) at the end of each swelling experiment, which should report the actual rather than normalized absorbance values to test whether the Bax/Bak null mitochondria can swell, and to what extent. If the Bax/Bak null mitochondria are resistant to alamethicin this would already indicate that lack of swelling is not specifically related to the permeability transition; if they do swell this would make for an important internal calibration allowing a comparison with the wild type genotype.</p><p>Although we agree that the main observation is of interest, the interpretation of such may change depending on the outcome of suggested experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00772.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The first experiment the reviewers agreed on is to test whether mitochondria resistant to swelling can happen if the mitoplast swelling is induced by on other agents that not known to cause MPTP</italic>.</p><p>We agree: determining whether lack of Bax/Bak specifically affects MPTP dependent swelling or all types of mitochondrial swelling is crucial to this manuscript. To address this issue we isolated both wild type and Bax/Bak deficient mitochondria from MEFs and livers. These mitochondria were subjected to varying concentrations of KCl. Wild type and Bax/Bak null mitochondria responded equally to the varying concentrations of KCl as now seen in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C,D</xref> (MEFs) &amp; G,H (livers). These new data further strengthen our hypothesis that Bax and Bak are required specifically for MPTP dependent mitochondrial swelling and not non-specific mitochondrial swelling induced by osmotic changes.</p><p><italic>2) Additionally, since comparing mitochondria of different genotypes is not trivial, and normalization to initial absorbance can be deceptive, what is needed is the addition of a pore-forming agent (such as alamethicin) at the end of each swelling experiment, which should report the actual rather than normalized absorbance values to test whether the Bax/Bak null mitochondria can swell, and to what extent</italic>.</p><p>This is a good suggestion and we have added such data. As requested we now show raw absorbance that is not normalized. However, in the past we normalized such values because the initial absorbance can slightly vary from preparation to preparation, although independent of genotype (it is a variable of such purification preparations). Hence, while initial absorbance varies slightly between preparations, the response of the mitochondria in each preparation is the important value and this is always consistent, similar to normalized data. In all of our swelling experiments we have never observed a significant difference in the starting point between any of our genotypes (hence the subtle variation in starting swollen state is an independent variable that does not track with any genotype).</p><p>Indeed, the new data we are showing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> show both raw (A, E) and normalized (D, F) values, which show the same relative changes after calcium and then alamethicin. These data were collected from both purified mitochondria isolated from MEFs and livers that are control or Bax/Bak deficient. In both mitochondria, calcium induced swelling does not occur when Bax and Bak are absent, but the addition of alamethicin confirms that these mitochondria have an equal maximal swelling potential when compared to the wild type control. Taken together, the results from the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> reinforces our original hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
