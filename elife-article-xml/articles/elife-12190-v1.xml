Here we show in two evolutionarily distant vertebrates (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> cell culture and mouse nerve-muscle ex-vivo) that the skeletal muscle cell constantly senses, through two identified calcium signals, synaptic events and their efficacy in eliciting spikes. These sensors trigger retrograde signal(s) that control presynaptic neurotransmitter release, resulting in synaptic potentiation or depression. In the absence of spikes, synaptic events trigger potentiation. Once the synapse is sufficiently strong to initiate spiking, the occurrence of these spikes activates a negative retrograde feedback. These opposing signals dynamically balance the synapse in order to continuously adjust neurotransmitter release to a level matching current muscle cell excitability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12190.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12190.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells communicate with each other, and with targets such as muscle cells, at junctions called synapses. The nerve cell before the synapses releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter, which binds to receptors on the cell after the synapses. However, the first cell cannot determine by itself whether it is releasing the correct amount of neurotransmitter to activate its partner. For this, it requires feedback from the second cell.</p><p>This feedback is particularly important at synapses between nerve cells and muscle cells, which are known as neuromuscular junctions. The likelihood that a given amount of transmitter will activate a muscle cell can vary with age and after exercise. Muscle cells must therefore be able to instruct their nerve cell partners to increase or decrease neurotransmitter release to accommodate these changes.</p><p>Ouanounou et al. have now identified the mechanism by which muscle cells determine whether nerve cells are releasing an appropriate amount of neurotransmitter. Experiments in two distantly related animals – mice and embryos from a frog called <italic>Xenopus</italic> – revealed that muscle cells use two calcium-based signals. The first is the flow of calcium ions into the muscle cell in response to binding of neurotransmitter to receptors at the synapses: this tells the muscle cell how active the nerve cell is. The second is the release of calcium ions from internal stores inside the muscle cell: this occurs whenever neurotransmitter release is sufficient to activate the muscle cell.</p><p>In response to the first calcium signal, the muscle cell sends positive feedback to the neuron, telling it to increase neurotransmitter release further. In response to the second signal, the muscle cell sends negative feedback to reduce neurotransmitter release. Thus, when neurotransmitter release is not enough to activate the muscle, positive feedback dominates and neurotransmitter release increases. However, when the muscle is activated, the two types of feedback act in balance to maintain efficient communication across the synapse.</p><p>The next steps are to identify the cell signaling cascades that are mobilized by the two calcium signals, including the specific molecule (or molecules) that regulate neurotransmitter release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12190.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12190.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouanounou</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name><name><surname>Baux</surname><given-names>Gérard</given-names></name><name><surname>Bal</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007393</institution-id><institution>Association Française contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouanounou</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name><name><surname>Baux</surname><given-names>Gérard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouanounou</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name><name><surname>Bal</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Neuropole de recherche francilien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouanounou</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name><name><surname>Bal</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Skeletal muscle cells constantly monitor their own activity and that of their partner neuron at synapses, enabling them to provide the neuron with feedback regarding neurotransmitter release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the nervous system, presynaptic neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic receptors, and postsynaptic excitability can be modulated to bi-directionally and durably change synaptic efficacy. There is a large diversity of plasticity processes, which together shape the neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Changeux and Danchin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goda and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munz et al., 2014</xref>) and tune its properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). In the brain, concomitantly to various forms of associative plasticity which sustain memory and learning, homeostatic plasticity processes are proposed to restrain the mean level of neuronal activity within a physiological regime, and to maintain the stability of recurrent network activity that can be challenged by associative plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macleod and Zinsmaier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turrigiano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). Homeostatic plasticity has been extensively studied at the neuromuscular synapse, in particular at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank, 2014</xref>), due to the robustness of the homeostatic control of synaptic transmission and the great accessibility of the experimental model to genetic manipulations.</p><p>In vertebrates, each skeletal muscle fiber is mono-innervated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>), and each single presynaptic action potential (AP) induces one postsynaptic AP, corresponding to a unity synaptic gain (ratio between the numbers of post- and presynaptic APs equal to 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wood and Slater, 2001</xref>). The stability of the gain implies that presynaptic neurotransmitter release and/or postsynaptic receptors adapt the effective synaptic strength to the excitability of the muscle fiber, which depends on the fiber characteristics, and presumably decreases with growth and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turrigiano, 2007</xref>). In adult vertebrate skeletal muscles, cholinergic nicotinic receptors are clustered in the synaptic region. Expression and location of nicotinic receptors have been shown to depend not only on agrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMahan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall and Sanes, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sandrock et al., 1997</xref>) but also on activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lømo, 2003</xref>), suggesting their possible role as adjustment variables in the control of synaptic strength. In the recent years however, thorough studies of the glutamatergic NMJ in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed that presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release is certainly a major adjustment variable for synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>). In such 'presynaptic homeostasis', increase in neurotransmitter release counterbalances a genetically-induced decrease of the postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>), a genetically-induced increase of postsynaptic input conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paradis et al., 2001</xref>) or a pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>), thus resulting in the strict maintenance of the level of evoked postsynaptic depolarization. Presynaptic compensation of postsynaptic excitability changes implies the existence of a retrograde feedback process from the innervated muscle fiber to the motor neuron. Particular attention was paid to the determination of the molecular targets of the homeostatic retrograde signaling and of the presynaptic cell signaling involved. It appeared that both the readily releasable vesicle pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2015</xref>) and the presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller and Davis, 2012</xref>) are targeted to promote glutamate release when postsynaptic excitability is reduced. The abundance of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can also be decreased in response to a vesicular content increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaviño et al., 2015</xref>), confirming the bi-directionality of the process. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, endostatin is a candidate trans-synaptic factor for the retrograde feedback targeting presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Upstream from the retrograde factors, the postsynaptic kinases, CAMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haghighi et al., 2003</xref>) and TOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Penney et al., 2012</xref>), pathways are necessary for a functional homeostatic control at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular transmission.</p><p>An abundant literature is thus progressively assembling pieces of the signaling puzzle underlying the interactions between the motor neuron and the muscle cell for the control of synaptic strength. However, besides the nature of the retrograde feedback and its presynaptic targets, a mechanism for the evaluation of the synaptic strength should be present at the postsynaptic level. The nature and dynamics of these mechanisms, primarily sensing synaptic strength in the muscle cell and initiating retrograde feedback, are key issues of homeostatic plasticity that still remain enigmatic in both invertebrates and vertebrates.</p><p>Here we investigate this issue in vertebrate (<italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse) cholinergic transmission. Motor neurons and muscle cells of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos establish functional neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tabti et al., 1998</xref>) in primary co-culture. Standard intracellular recording from muscle cells is possible in <italic>Xenopus</italic> culture owing to the small size of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, perforated patch-clamp), while it is not possible in muscle cells from adult mice, due to macroscopic movements during contraction. To circumvent this issue and maintain intracellular recordings in moving tissue, we adapted a ‘floating electrode’ device from previous methods invented for muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Woodbury and Brady, 1956</xref>) or neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kunze, 1998</xref>). We applied this method to mouse ex vivo nerve-skeletal muscle preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach preserved the physiological conditions, necessary to reveal the control exercised by the muscle cell over the neuromuscular synaptic transmission, a role that might have been previously overlooked in vertebrates due to commonly used high concentrations of the nicotinic receptor antagonist curare to prevent contraction.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptic transmission is homeostatically regulated.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Perforated patch-clamp on <italic>Xenopus</italic> neuron (N) and muscle cell (M) in primary culture.

In vertebrate muscle cells, the amplitude of PSPs depends on the ratio between the nicotinic conductance activated by acetylcholine (ACh) and the muscle input conductance, which is largely due to resting K<sup>+</sup> leak currents. Fibers in flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), extensor digitorum longus and soleus mouse muscles have a wide distribution of input conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A similar distribution in <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, X axis) is linked to the diversity of membrane surfaces with homogenous conductance density (196 ± 14 pS/pF, n=19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Despite these differences in muscle cell excitability, a single presynaptic AP triggered a single postsynaptic AP, and a contraction, in all tested cells from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> cultures, we found that the nicotinic conductance activated in muscle cells by spike-evoked ACh release varied linearly with the postsynaptic input conductances measured in a population of synaptic neuron/muscle cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and resulted in comparable ePSP (evoked PSP) voltage amplitudes.

Previous research reported that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell cultures, burst activation of presynaptic input results in marked enhancement of ACh release, in both voltage-clamp and current-clamp conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan and Poo, 1999</xref>). We reproduced this result in the specific condition of post-synaptic voltage-clamp (not shown) but not in that of current-clamp where we found instead absence of potentiation. To observe such absence in current-clamp, we believe that it is essential that all or most of the ePSPs evoked by the conditioning burst, reach threshold for spike initiation in the postsynaptic cell. This was not the case in the only example of current-clamp presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan and Poo 1999</xref> (see their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>(i)). Homeostatic plasticity rules suggest in fact that this form of plasticity should not occur in the presence of synaptic transmission that is effective in generating a muscle AP. To test this hypothesis, we initiated burst stimulation of motor neurons in both <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mice –during current-clamp recordings– in order to allow voltage responses and APs in the muscle cells. In these physiological conditions and despite the chronic burst activity, no significant change in the synaptic gain was visible. The probability for a synaptic event to induce a postsynaptic AP was close to unity and kept constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> however, test evoked postsynaptic currents (ePSCs) were recorded under brief periods of postsynaptic voltage-clamp before and after the 30 min of chronic activity under current-clamp, and showed a slight relative decrease of 0.2 in the averaged ePSCs amplitude (see first bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In mice, the average ePSPs were not changed by high-frequency conditioning stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggest that synapses able to trigger postsynaptic APs do not exhibit strong plasticity, and that the occurrence of muscle APs may be involved in the homeostatic mechanisms adjusting and maintaining the synaptic strength in concordance with the postsynaptic input conductance.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Nicotinic receptor activity induces a positive feedback on ACh release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In order to obtain the nicotinic calcium signal in absence of DICR in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, synaptic events were transiently kept subthreshold either with curare (decreased nicotinic conductance, Gnico) or by dynamic-clamp injection of gK<sup>+</sup> leaks (increased input conductance, Gin), or left suprathreshold while DICR was blocked by ryanodine.

We reasoned that there may be two distinct postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways involved in this homeostatic regulation: a postsynaptic reporter of the presynaptic activity that signals the occurrence of a synaptic event, and a postsynaptic reporter that signals the occurrence of a postsynaptic AP. The postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> build up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>) due to a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the nicotinic receptor-channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fucile et al., 2006</xref>) (PCa<sup>2+</sup>/PNa<sup>+</sup>=0.23 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) is a good candidate for signaling the occurrence of synaptic events. Furthermore, in vertebrates, the skeletal muscle cells exhibit a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal linked to the AP and involved in the excitation-contraction coupling, <italic>i.e.</italic> 'the depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release' (DICR). The DICR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors, triggered by plasma membrane depolarizations above –40 mV, and thus triggered by AP in physiological conditions. Depolarization is detected by a voltage-sensor (the dihydropyridine receptor) located in the plasma membrane. This voltage-sensor derives from an L-Type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel; it is voltage-dependent but not ion permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almers et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melzer et al., 1995</xref>). Functionally linked to the ryanodine receptor at the level of the T-tubule, its activation triggers the opening of the ryanodine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rios and Brum, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franzini-Armstrong and Protasi, 1997</xref>). The resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is independent of the extra-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), purely voltage-dependent, and its voltage-dependency follows the typical pattern of the activation curve of a 'High Voltage-Activated' Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Ryanodine fully blocks this Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We hypothesized that these two distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DICR, are used by the muscle cell to detect synaptic activity and its efficiency to elicit an AP, respectively, leading to retrograde control of the presynaptic ACh release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> scheme). To validate this hypothesis, we examined each of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent mechanisms in isolation and their respective impact on synaptic efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers LTP</title><p>We first examined the specific role of nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the regulation of synaptic transmission. To trigger the nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but not the DICR in <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cells, we transiently reduced synaptic strength below AP threshold during the conditioning presynaptic burst stimulations performed in postsynaptic current-clamp. We monitored subsequent synaptic conductance changes under postsynaptic voltage-clamp during low-rate single-pulse intracellular stimulation of the neuron. We reduced the synaptic efficacy either by decreasing the synaptic conductance with low-doses of the reversible nicotinic antagonist curare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), or by artificially increasing the muscle cell input conductance using dynamic-clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sharp et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robinson and Kawai, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figures supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2A</xref>). The lowered synaptic conductance mimicked the effects of low ACh release in developing synapses. Simulation and dynamic-clamp injection of a combination of a linear and an inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> leak conductances (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) mimicked the increased endogenous input conductance associated with muscle cell growth. In both cases, presynaptic burst-stimulation (3 bursts of 5 pulses at 30 Hz) induced a strong, fast (within minutes) and long-term potentiation (LTP) of ePSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while the transient application of curare in absence of presynaptic stimulation did not induce potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, 'curare No Burst' bar). This form of LTP induced by subthreshold synaptic events depends solely on nicotinic receptor activity and therefore was insensitive to DICR blockade obtained by pre-loading the muscle cell with ryanodine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, when ePSPs were left intact but in presence of postsynaptic ryanodine, presynaptic burst-stimulation produced postsynaptic APs and nonetheless a strong LTP of the ePSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), while no potentiation occurred when DICR was functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The LTP induced in our postsynaptic current-clamp protocols was accompanied with a strong increase of the frequency, but not amplitude, of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). As previously observed in voltage-clamp protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan and Poo, 1999</xref>), this indicates that LTP is due to an evoked ACh release increase and not to a postsynaptic receptor modulation. We found similar results in ryanodine-treated mouse muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>): it is only when nicotinic channels were activated following conditioning bursts of nerve stimulations and ACh release —in the absence of DICR and contraction— that subsequent single test pulses revealed a strong LTP of the ePSPs. In contrast, as shown above, when DICR was functional and the nerve was stimulated, nicotinic ePSPs did not change and remained identical to those in the absence of nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore the simultaneous occurrence of postsynaptic nicotinic receptor activation and DICR is essential to the stability of functional synaptic gain. Because the regulation targets ACh release, this implies the existence of retrograde feedback onto the presynaptic compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DICR triggers LTD</title><p>In order to understand the specific role of DICR, we examined its effect on synaptic efficacy in isolation from the effect of nicotinic receptor activation. Direct stimulation of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cell induces postsynaptic APs and DICR, with no ACh release and no involvement of nicotinic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conditioning bursts of suprathreshold current steps injected in the muscle cell induced a strong, fast and long-term depression (LTD) of ePSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The average amplitude of sPSCs did not change, confirming the presynaptic locus of gain control, for negative modulations of synaptic strength just like for the positive modulations described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). LTD induced by repetitive postsynaptic depolarizations has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dan et al., 1995</xref>). Here we show that this form of LTD relies strictly on DICR: it was insensitive to removal of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and blocked by postsynaptic pre-loading with ryanodine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In adult mouse nerve-muscle preparations, external electrical stimulation elicits an AP in both the nerve and the muscle fibers, a situation in which both DICR and nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occur. As expected, in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the external burst stimulation did not change the average ePSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>) compared to nerve stimulation only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). When the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> was transiently removed, the external stimulation still elicited APs in both the nerve and the muscle, but neither the ACh release nor its associated postsynaptic nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In these conditions, the external stimulation induced DICR alone and resulted in a strong LTD of the ePSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).

Next, we set to closely examine these small synaptic changes in individual synapses. Given the variety of average synaptic conductance among neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Y axis), and its strong correlation with the muscle input conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the range of the ratio between the synaptic and the input conductances 'Gsyn/Gin' is much tighter than the synaptic conductance range. We reasoned that because this ratio, and not the synaptic conductance alone, determines the synaptic efficacy (ePSP amplitude), it should be the appropriate synaptic parameter targeted by the homeostatic process. Therefore, we recorded the ePSCs under brief test periods of postsynaptic voltage-clamp, before and after 20–30 min of chronic burst stimulation of the motor-neuron under postsynaptic current-clamp, and normalized these averaged ePSCs by the input conductance of the muscle cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (black dots) shows that the slight depression was not homogenous among neuromuscular synapses. The degree of depression seems to depend on the distance of the initial Gsyn/Gin ratio from the mean ratio obtained after chronic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, dashed line). Consequently, standard deviation from the mean is reduced after chronic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, inset).

Two distinct calcium signals report the pre- and postsynaptic activity. Synaptic events are detected through the nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and trigger a positive retrograde feedback that targets presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic APs are detected through the sarcoplasmic reticulum DICR signal and trigger a negative retrograde feedback. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, convergence of the synaptic efficacy —here captured by the ratio between the synaptic and the input conductances— towards an attractor set point located in the suprathreshold range of synaptic efficacy suggests that a dynamic balance between the potentiating and depressing synaptic processes ensures homeostasis of the neuromuscular transmission. This equilibrium automatically sets the neurotransmitter release to a level matching the postsynaptic excitability. Obviously, ACh release is not the only actor of synaptic efficacy, nicotinic receptors density and muscle input conductance being also under control. However, the advantages of the calcium sensors-based plasticity of presynaptic release are its dynamical aspect and its fast kinetics, confirming in vertebrates that rapid adjustment of the neurotransmitter release is a primary variable in the homeostatic control of neuromuscular synaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plomp et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paradis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>).</p><p>This mechanism may primarily explain the ubiquity of the unity neuromuscular synaptic gain across different muscles and species, and is likely to be involved in several synaptic regulation processes that occur throughout the life of the neuromuscular synapse.

This homeostatic control might also be involved in the quantal content increase which partially compensates for the reduced number of postsynaptic receptors at myasthenic human end-plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cull-Candy et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1980</xref>), or in rat diaphragm muscle treated with the nicotinic antagonist α-bungarotoxin, mimicking myasthenia gravis syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plomp et al., 1992</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A novel plasticity orientation rule</title><p>When selectively triggered, the nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the DICR signal induce a form of LTP and LTD respectively.

This orientation rule finds its equilibrium in the suprathreshold range of the synaptic strength and provides the specific 'homeostatic' function to this plasticity.

Therefore, neurotrophic factors should be considered for future investigations to determine whether they can be retrograde factors mediating homeostatic plasticity at the neuromuscular synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Postsynaptic calcium signaling</title><p>The diversity of the effects of the calcium signaling comes from the variety of its temporal patterns, amplitude, and location. The two antagonist calcium signals that we demonstrated here to be involved in the orientation of the neuromuscular plasticity exhibit different temporal patterns and amplitudes. The AP-associated DICR signal exhibits fast transient large calcium concentration elevations for each AP. The kinetics of the nicotinic calcium build-up is much slower and does not contain transients during repetitive nicotinic receptor stimulations. Its amplitude under voltage-clamp is low compare to the DICR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and even lower under current-clamp given the reduced driving-force for the calcium ion due to the postsynaptic depolarization. This dichotomy between fast large transient and slow low calcium build-up is known to trigger selectively, <italic>via</italic> calmodulin, the CAMKII kinase and the calcineurin phosphatase respectively. This mechanism is considered in the central nervous system to implement Hebbian plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malenka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkey et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">1994</xref>) by modulating the conductance and number of the postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barria et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mammen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beattie et al., 2000</xref>). The CAMKII signaling pathway was also shown to be required for normal 'presynaptic homeostasis' in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haghighi et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan and Poo 1999</xref> showed at the <italic>Xenopus</italic> synapse in vitro that induction of LTP and LTD can be blocked by pre-loading the muscle cell with peptide inhibitors of calcineurin and CAMKII respectively. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan and Poo 1999</xref>, this situation is opposite to the central synapses, where calcineurin is associated to depression and CAMKII to potentiation. Our results suggest that the low-calcium nicotinic signal and the calcineurin activation have a possible causal link with the detection of the synaptic events and the synaptic potentiation, while the high-calcium DICR signal and the CAMKII activation are associated with the detection of the postsynaptic APs and the synaptic depression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A push-pull mechanism for homeostatic plasticity</title><p>The convergence of the synaptic efficacy towards a set point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that the potentiating and depressing synaptic processes balance each other in the suprathreshold range of the synaptic strength. These observations strongly suggest that the set point of the homeostatic plasticity is sustained by a push-pull mechanism. Our results, however, do not determine the stages where this push-pull mechanism could operate in the causal chain linking the evaluation of synaptic efficacy to the presynaptic modulation. In particular, our findings do not necessarily imply that two independent antagonist trans-synaptic retrograde factors balance their effects at the presynaptic level. The coexistence of potentiating and depressing trans-synaptic factors is a possibility among others. The increased and decreased secretion of a single positive retrograde factor —like for example endostatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and neurotrophins in vertebrates— could also bi-directionally regulate neurotransmitter release. In this case, it could be hypothesized that a push-pull mechanism operates downstream of the calcium signaling, for example at the level of the calcineurin/CAMKII balance, ultimately determining the secretion level of a single factor. Therefore, the use of blue and red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is intended as a schematic representation of the retrograde mechanisms that can bi-directionally change neurotransmitter release, without presuming the existence of two distinct retrograde factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparison with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model</title><p>Most of what we know about synaptic homeostasis stems from experimental studies at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva neuromuscular junction. Given the numerous differences between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates the comparison between these systems is not straightforward. Action potentials and the associated DICR signal in vertebrates being absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hong and Ganetzky, 1994</xref>), the homeostatic mechanism we propose here cannot be directly transposed to <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

However, different actors could play similar roles in both systems. The calcium permeability of glutamate receptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> could have a similar role than the calcium permeability of nicotinic receptors in vertebrates.

In order to establish the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, cells were incubated in curare in absence of neurons spikes during 30–60 min before recording (red dots). Therefore, the spontaneous ACh release did not restore the normal Gsyn/Gin ratio (found in non-treated synapses) before chronic bursts were applied. A possible explanation of this difference between the two systems is the high frequency of miniatures in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (10–20 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>), while the average frequency of spontaneous release in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells culture was 100 fold lower. In vertebrates, evoked activity responsible for muscular tonus and voluntary motions represents most of the synaptic activity, and the 20–30 Hz frequencies we used in our experiments are in the normal range for a motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorassini et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the evoked activity in vertebrate is more likely able to rapidly mobilize the homeostatic machinery than the spontaneous miniatures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>NMJ as a model for homeostasis in the central nervous system?</title><p>In the central nervous system, homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed to restrain the mean level of neuronal activity within a physiological regime, and to maintain the stability of recurrent network activity challenged by associative plasticity. Because of the robustness of its synaptic transmission, the neuromuscular junction is considered as a model of homeostasis. However, the neuromuscular junction being the end effector of the motor network, its main function is the faithful translation of the motor command into muscle activity. The mean level of muscle activity is not involved in any recurrent network that requires stability, and therefore does not need to be controlled. While the synaptic strength is the adjustment variable for the control of the mean level of neuronal activity in the CNS, at the NMJ it is the efficacy of synaptic transmission itself that must be maintained constant for reliable relay of the motor command. Therefore, homeostatic plasticity could be regarded as a functionally different phenomenon at the NMJ than in the CNS. Nevertheless, the plasticity orientation rule described in the present work matches a synaptic 'relay' function. Despite differences in the nature of the activity sensors, other 'relay' synapses in the CNS, such as those involved in sensory inputs to the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guido, 2008</xref>), might share with the NMJ a comparable homeostatic control based on pre- and post- synaptic activity detection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Animal care followed the European Union regulations (OJ of EC L358/1 18 December 1986), and the European directive 2010/63/UE.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary cell culture</title><p>Myotomal and spinal tissues from 1-day-old <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos (stages 23 to 25) were mechanically dissociated using a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free medium of the following composition (in mM): 115 NaCl, 2.6 KCl, 0.4 EDTA, 10 HEPES (pH = 7.6).

Sharp pipettes were made from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments), pulled on a P-1000 puller (Sutter Instrument Company), and had a resistance of 40–60 MΩ when filled with a KCl 3 M solution. The filled pipette tip was cut at the limit of the pulled zone, and used as electrode. The chlorided end of a 10 cm long, 50 µm diameter, silver wire was introduced inside this electrode, and plugged by its opposite end to the headstage of an Axoclamp 2A amplifier (Axon Instruments), where it hung loosely above the muscle. A drop of mineral oil was added at the back of the intra-pipette medium to avoid evaporation. The pipette pendulum was vertically manipulated to enter the muscle cells, and its flexibility allowed stable membrane potential recordings in contracting muscles. Nerve APs were induced with 6 V, 30 µs voltage steps in a suction pipette. 2 µM of µ-conotoxin GIIIB (10 min) was used to isolate the ePSPs. Data acquisition and analysis were made as above.</p><p>Under µ-conotoxin the amplitudes of the recorded ePSPs depend on the distance between the recording site and the synaptic region. With the floating electrode method, the placement of the electrode is not precisely controlled. We limited the distance effect by using the FDB mouse muscle, where cells are shorter (300 µm) than the muscle length (1 cm). Therefore, blind placement of the electrode can be performed on this muscle, with a maximal 150 µm distance between the recording site and the end plate. The specific cells size and organization in FDB limit the distance effect in our recordings, but this effect is presumably responsible for an underestimation of the ePSPs amplitudes and for most of the variability between the recorded cells. Despite the underestimation of the ePSPs amplitudes, the recorded amplitudes were above the -63 mV AP threshold determined in muscle cells of rat fast and slow muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wood and Slater, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Products</title><p>The salts composing the media used for electrophysiological recordings, EGTA used to obtain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free media, and Amphotericin B used for perforated patch-clamp were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin Eaton and Alberto Cangiano (peer reviewers).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors record from <italic>Xenopus</italic> neuromuscular junctions in culture and mouse ex vivo nerve-muscle preps and observe potentiation and depression which together implement a homeostatic learning rule for maintaining the gain of neuromuscular transmission close to 1. Both the potentiation and depression have been previously studied at the neuromuscular junction but here, by independently regulating pre and postsynaptic efficacy, the authors demonstrate a dual positive and negative feedback on presynaptic release mediated by calcium influx through nicotinic receptors and depolarization induced calcium release respectively.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors misstate the prior results of Wan and Poo who reported achieving LTP when the postsynaptic cell was either in voltage clamp or current clamp. The subsection “A stable synaptic gain” should entirely be rewritten since: 1) Wan and Poo (Science 1999) saw synaptic potentiation not only after presynaptic burst stimulation under myocyte Vclamp but also Iclamp, and 2) the statements of &quot;…no apparent synaptic plasticity was visible. On the contrary…&quot;, are not clear. Also, the effects of nicotinic calcium signaling on presynaptic function presented here are seemingly in contrast to the previous observations (i.e. Dan and Poo, Science 1992) that found that increased nicotinic calcium produces synaptic depression and not LTP. The authors need to address these discrepancies.</p><p>2) The results presented on triggering LTP suggest that the sensitivity of the muscle to neurotransmitter is not what determines the increase in ACh release but rather the lack of the LTD mechanism induced by postsynaptic firing. This seems to be contrary to numerous studies from flies, mice, and humans supporting the idea that presynaptic compensation for changes in muscle sensitivity to neurotransmitter is one of the primary homeostatic mechanisms at the NMJ and driven by reduced AChR function or increasing K leak (see below). This point needs shoring up both with further discussion and with controls for the effects of curare incubation and/or changes in input conductance on ACh release in the absence of bursting. With respect to further discussion, the authors need to do a better job of explaining other differences between this data set and previous studies such as those of Paradis et al. 2001, Frank et al. 2006, Petersen et al. 1997; Cull-Candy et al. 1979 and 1980; Plomp et al. 1992 and Plomp and Molenaar 1996.</p><p>3) It is not clear whether the authors are suggesting that the positive and negative feedback mechanisms are dynamically balanced to achieve unity gain or gate each other to shut off plasticity once unity gain has been achieved. Given the fact that both forms of plasticity have previously been described and what is novel here is the interaction between the two it seems reasonable to insist on a better characterization of that interaction. This could be performed along one or both of the following dimensions:</p><p>A) Timing: Is the plasticity &quot;gated&quot; by SR calcium release or is there a temporal dependence to this mechanism? A tight temporal requirement would support that the gating mechanism is occurring within the muscle cell. Demonstrating a shared cellular localization for the convergence of these processes would strengthen the argument that LTD regulates/gates the LTP. Related to this point, is it surprising that the LTD is so stable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> given that the ePSPs seem to all fail to reach threshold? Shouldn't this induce LTP?</p><p>B) Gradation: It is predicted that homeostatic regulation of PSP amplitudes would require a graded response to provide needed precision to the regulation (Davis, 2006). This should be demonstrated. Is either of the signals or their respective outputs graded? This could be revealed by investigating the freq dependence and/or the number of postsynaptic depolarizations required to generate LTD (Dan and Poo, Science 1992). Or is bulk unloading to the SR with thapsigargin sufficient to induce LTD? Overall, the authors need to strengthen their argument that this system is truly homeostatic. Similarly, is there a threshold level of nicotinic calcium required to induce LTP? Is there any freq dependence? Given previous observations from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and patients with myasthenia gravis, it might be expected that sub-blocking levels of curare would induce increased ACh release independent of bursting. Thus, an important control for the curare experiments is whether curare incubation in the absence of bursting or with chronic activity results in LTP.</p><p>One related concern is the safety factor for NMJ transmission – if homeostasis is ongoing wouldn't it tend to obliterate excess EPSP above that needed to evoke an AP?</p><p>Although it would be strongest to address both &quot;axes&quot; doing one or the other should be sufficient for publication (though the curare control experiment should be done in either case). This need not be carried out in both systems. Hence revision could involve a modest number of additional experiments which could be completed in two months or less.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors misstate the prior results of Wan and Poo who reported achieving LTP when the postsynaptic cell was either in voltage clamp or current clamp.

Also, the effects of nicotinic calcium signaling on presynaptic function presented here are seemingly in contrast to the previous observations (i.e. Dan and Poo, Science 1992) that found that increased nicotinic calcium produces synaptic depression and not LTP. The authors need to address these discrepancies.</italic>1A) <italic>“Misstatement of the prior results of Wan &amp; Poo”:</italic> </p><p>In the pioneer study by Wan &amp; Poo (Science, 1999) the induction of LTP was indeed shown both under postsynaptic current-clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>(i)) and voltage-clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>(ii-v)). Nonetheless, it was not clear to us whether the plasticity orientation rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in Wan &amp; Poo 1999), dependent on the initial synaptic conductance, was obtained under post-synaptic voltage- or current-clamp, since this information was not provided in the main text nor in the figure legend. Since the plasticity we found under current-clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, blue dots) was different from that found by Wan &amp; Poo 1999, we explicitly addressed the question whether this discrepancy was due to different clamping modes. We then performed the experiment under postsynaptic voltage-clamp, following the protocol of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>(ii) in Wan &amp; Poo. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> (black dots) shows the orientation rule obtained under voltage clamp, which perfectly matched the orientation rule found in Wan &amp; Poo 1999 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of burst stimulation of the motor neuron under postsynaptic voltage- and current-clamp.</title><p>Black dots: same protocol as Wan &amp; Poo 1999 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (ii)).

We then had to artificially reduce the ratio between the synaptic and the input conductances to obtain sub-threshold synaptic bursts that resulted systematically in potentiation, independently on the initial synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>, red dots).</p><p>All these observations brought us to conclude, maybe wrongly, that the orientation rule of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in Wan &amp; Poo 1999 was established under postsynaptic voltage-clamp.

This discrepancy was the object of the statements in the subsection “A stable synaptic gain”. Because of the correlation with the input conductance, most of synapses were efficient in eliciting the muscle spikes, and according to homeostatic rules, a synapse able to trigger the muscle spikes (i.e. close to the set point of the homeostasis) should not exhibit strong plasticity. This is further confirmed by the fact that chronic bursting stimulation of the motor neuron under post-synaptic Iclamp in non-treated synapses induced a low depression and extremely rarely a potentiation of the synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, blue dots).</p><p>We clarified the statement in the subsection “A stable synaptic gain”.</p><p>1B) <italic>“Also the effects of nicotinic calcium signaling on presynaptic function presented here are seemingly in contrast to the previous observations (i.e. Dan and Poo, Science 1992) that found that increased nicotinic calcium produces synaptic depression and not LTP.”:</italic></p><p>Our study was more qualitative (nicotinic calcium versus DICR) than quantitative, and we estimate that our results do not contradict that “increased nicotinic calcium induces depression and not potentiation”. We think that our work is not in contrast with the idea that low calcium induces potentiation and high calcium depression, but points out how these two calcium regimes are physiologically achieved via different pathways.</p><p>Plasticity orientation rule under postsynaptic Vclamp supports the idea that “increased nicotinic calcium produces synaptic depression and not LTP”:</p><p>Even more than the data in Dan &amp; Poo 1992, the orientation rule obtained under Vclamp may also suggest that “increased nicotinic calcium produces synaptic depression and not LTP”. Indeed, in Dan &amp; Poo 1992, depression was obtained via ionophoretic ACh application. Since in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell culture the nicotinic receptors are not limited to the synaptic region, ionophoretic ACh application may mimic a competing synapse. This situation may be more related to synaptic competition and hetero-synaptic depression than to plasticity at mono-innervated muscle cell. Nicotinic calcium may have different effects when induced by another synapse. This idea is supported by the fact that Dan &amp; Poo obtained depression with ionophoretic ACh alone and not when ACh was applied under postsynaptic Vclamp concomitantly with the pre-synaptic stimulation, while in this case nicotinic calcium build up should have been more important (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Dan &amp; Poo 1992).</p><p>In contrast, under post-synaptic Vclamp at mono-innervated muscle cell, DICR is prevented (owing to the lack of depolarizations) and nicotinic calcium at the synapse is the only source of calcium. Since under Vclamp the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is constant and the nicotinic calcium depends solely on the membrane permeability (i.e. the synaptic conductance), then nicotinic calcium increases linearly with the X-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>. Low nicotinic calcium-induced LTP and high nicotinic calcium-induced LTD may thus be an attractive explanation for the orientation of plasticity under post-synaptic Vclamp, and is compatible with the demonstration by Wan &amp; Poo 1999 that potentiation depends on calcineurin (selectively activated by low calcium) while depression depends on CAMKII (selectively activated by high calcium).</p><p>The orientation rule in Wan &amp; Poo 1999 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which matches our results under postsynaptic Vclamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, black dots), leaded to another interpretation: the initial synaptic currents amplitude may reflect the degree of maturity of the synapse, and immature synapses tend to potentiate while mature ones tend to depress. But we showed that 1) the synaptic current amplitude reflects in fact the adaptation to the post-synaptic input conductance and that the synapses are functionally equivalent (they trigger spikes), and 2) all the synapses are capable of both potentiation and depression. The potentiation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (“curare” bar) and the depression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (“direct AP” bar) were independent of the initial synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). Therefore, we believe that nicotinic calcium level-dependent plasticity is a more attractive explanation of the orientation of plasticity under post-synaptic Vclamp than a structural or functional capability of the synapses in plasticity.</p><p>Under postsynaptic Iclamp, the nicotinic calcium is low:</p><p>Are our data under post-synaptic Iclamp compatible with the view that low-calcium induces potentiation and high-calcium induces depression?</p><p>Under post-synaptic Iclamp, nicotinic calcium no longer depends solely on the synaptic conductance as in Vclamp but also on the variation of the membrane potential. We investigated the voltage dependency of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> component of the nicotinic current in <italic>Xenopus</italic> myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3A</xref>) and we found the same Ca<sup>2+</sup>/V relationship as in Miledi et al. 1980 (J Physiol. 1980 Mar;300:197-212), i.e. the nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> exponentially decays with a potential constant of 30 mV. The nicotinic calcium build up is consequently strongly sensitive to the membrane potential. Thus for a given nicotinic conductance the nicotinic calcium is much lower under Iclamp than under Vclamp with a holding potential close to the resting potential.</p><p>In order to quantify the effect of the potential on the nicotinic calcium during a burst we did a conductance-based computer model based upon our characterization of the ionic currents of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> myocyte, including the voltage-dependency of the nicotinic calcium. For a given membrane surface, the increased permeability combined with the opposite voltage-dependency resulted in a bell-shape relationship between the nicotinic calcium and the synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3B</xref>). As an illustration, simulations show that for a burst of 5 synaptic events at 20-30 Hz with a conductance producing a 1.5 nA synaptic current at a holding potential close to the resting potential, the use of Vclamp increases by 5 times the nicotinic calcium compared to Iclamp. In other words, under Iclamp the nicotinic calcium during this burst is equivalent of that provided under Vclamp by a much weaker synaptic conductance producing -300 pA of current. Therefore, the range of nicotinic calcium mobilized under Iclamp is globally in the range mobilized under Vclamp by low synaptic conductances which induce potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, black dots). Finally, the AP-induced DICR, known to be largest calcium signal in skeletal muscle cells, might be more susceptible than the nicotinic calcium to reach under IClamp the high level of calcium necessary to activate CAMKII and to induce depression.</p><p>The corollary could be that under Vclamp, the nicotinic calcium artificially reaches the threshold inducing depression because of the maximum driving force maintained by the holding potential.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.018</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Voltage-dependency of the nicotinic calcium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nicotinic I/V relationship with iohophoretic ACh applications in media for which the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion only carries the nicotinic current.

We thought interesting to discuss here the discrepancies between Iclamp and Vclamp, but the issue of Vclamp being not crucial to the paper, we chose to avoid a lengthy discussion on this point and we suppressed its mention from the text. We added to the Discussion of the revised version of the manuscript that the low level of nicotinic calcium under Iclamp and the high level of calcium reached by the DICR signal are consistent with the demonstration by Wan &amp; Poo of the roles of calcineurin and CAMKII in plasticity.</p><p><italic>2) The results presented on triggering LTP suggest that the sensitivity of the muscle to neurotransmitter is not what determines the increase in ACh release but rather the lack of the LTD mechanism induced by postsynaptic firing. This seems to be contrary to numerous studies from flies, mice, and humans supporting the idea that presynaptic compensation for changes in muscle sensitivity to neurotransmitter is one of the primary homeostatic mechanisms at the NMJ and driven by reduced AChR function or increasing K leak (see below). This point needs shoring up both with further discussion and with controls for the effects of curare incubation and/or changes in input conductance on ACh release in the absence of bursting. With respect to further discussion, the authors need to do a better job of explaining other differences between this data set and previous studies such as those of Paradis et al. 2001, Frank et al. 2006, Petersen et al. 1997; Cull-Candy et al. 1979 and 1980; Plomp et al. 1992 and Plomp and Molenaar 1996.</italic> </p><p>2A) Controls in absence of bursting:</p><p>The main concern raised in this point seems to be that we used evoked neurotransmitter release (in the form of trains of presynaptic stimulations called “bursts”) to induce potentiation, while in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva evoked release is not necessary to a rapid compensatory potentiation in response to the reduction of the post-synaptic sensitivity (Frank et al. 2006). If evoked release is not necessary for potentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, synaptic activity is nonetheless required, since the authors propose that spontaneous release remaining in absence of motor neuron activity is responsible for this potentiation.</p><p>Following the reviewer suggestions, we performed two control experiments:</p><p>1) In our potentiation induction, it has to be noted that curare was transiently (1 min or less) applied to reduce the synaptic efficacy during the conditioning burst. In order to test that evoked bursts, and not spontaneous release, was responsible for potentiation, we transiently applied curare during 2 min in absence of pre-synaptic stimulation, and we did not obtain potentiation (relative change in ePSC of 0.89 ± 0.05, n=3). We have added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (“Curare No burst” bar).</p><p>2) We did another control with longer lasting incubation of curare. Given the large range of initial synaptic conductances (Gsyn) in the cell culture but the strong correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) between this conductance with the input conductance (Gin), we compared the Gsyn/Gin ratio in non-treated synapses with synapses incubated in curare after 30-60 min of exposure. The averaged Gsyn/Gin ratio in curare (Gsyn/Gin = 1.35 ± 0.32, n = 8) was significantly lower than the averaged Gsyn/Gin ratio in non-treated synapses (Gsyn/Gin = 3.78 ± 0.49, n = 10) with a significance level of 0.001. Since motor neurons do not spontaneously fire in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell culture, this result shows that within 60 min of curare incubation the spontaneous ACh release was unable to sufficiently promote the evoked release in order to restore a normal evoked Gsyn/Gin ratio.</p><p>2B) The frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity may explain some differences between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates:</p><p>The 60 min control incubation of the above experiment does not presume the outcome of a longer curare exposure that could result in a full recovery of the synapse efficacy. In the <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell culture, motor neurons are “isolated” (not connected by afferences) and do not spontaneously fire. Despite the absence of motor neurons spikes, they connect the muscle cells and the mechanisms responsible for the evoked release establish during the 12-24h before the recordings. The establishment of a functional evoked release in absence of neuronal spikes, and moreover dependent on the muscle input conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), presumably implicates the spontaneous release. The difference between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> in the speed of compensatory potentiation induced by spontaneous activity may simply be related to the strong difference between these systems in the frequency of the spontaneous activity. In Paradis et al. 2001, Frank et al. 2006 or Petersen et al. 1997, it seems that the frequency of spontaneous release in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is around 10-20 Hz, while it is 100 time less on average in our <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell culture.</p><p>2C) Evoked activity should also mobilize homeostatic mechanisms:</p><p>If spontaneous synaptic events are able to mobilize some synaptic plasticity mechanisms, it seems reasonable to envisage that evoked release does too. Moreover, homeostasis of the neuromuscular transmission adapts the evoked neurotransmitter release to the post-synaptic input conductance in order to ensure the reliability of the motor command transmission. Therefore, it seems useful for the homeostatic mechanisms that evoked release participates to the evaluation of its own efficacy and that this evaluation does not depend solely on the spontaneous release. The large literature produced by the Poo’s group, and the present work, suggest that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell culture bursts of evoked activity are able to trigger the plastic properties of the synapse more rapidly than spontaneous activity.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Petersen et al. or Paradis et al. observed the outcome of the homeostasis but it does not exclude that evoked neurotransmitter release had participated to the homeostasis before its observation. Even if Frank et al. show that 10-20 Hz spontaneous activity is able to trigger potentiation in absence of evoked activity, this does not prove that evoked activity with the frequency of a normal motor command cannot do the same. A possible stabilizing role of synaptic depressing processes mobilized by evoked activity remains to be investigated but is not yet excluded in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>2D) Evoked burst at 30 Hz is natural:</p><p>In vertebrate, evoked activity is responsible for the muscular tonus and voluntary motions, and represents the prominent part of synaptic activity. In vertebrates, the frequency range of a motor command is 10-60 Hz, and muscle activity being made of temporary motions, the motor command is made of bursts. Thus, the conditioning bursts we used in our experimental protocols closely mimic the typical firing rate of individual motor units, as recorded in fast and slow muscles in the conscious rat during unrestrained walking (Gorassini et al., 2000 Journal of Neurophysiology 83 (4): 2002–11). In addition, bursting activity with frequency of action potentials in the range of 10-60 Hz has also been observed in the developing spinal cord (L. T. Landmesser and M. J. O’Donovan, 1984, J. Physiol. London347, 189; M. J. O’Donovan et al., 1998, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.860, 130).</p><p>2E) <italic>The results presented on triggering LTP suggest that the sensitivity of the muscle to neurotransmitter is not what determines the increase in ACh release but rather the lack of the LTD mechanism induced by postsynaptic firing.</italic></p><p>This question is related to the point 3 of the essential revisions, concerning the type of interaction between the potentiating and the depressing synaptic mechanisms. We used the extreme cases of subthreshold synaptic events and ryanodine treated preparations to prevent DICR and to emphasize the potentiating role of the nicotinic calcium. But as discussed in the answer to point 3, and as shown in the new Results section of the revised version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), potentiation also occurs in a range of synaptic efficacy mixing nicotinic calcium with DICR signals. We show in this new section that potentiation is more related to how far from an “attractor Gsyn/Gin ratio” is the initial Gsyn/Gin than it is due to “the lack of depressing mechanism”.</p><p>One goal of our work was to show that suprathreshold synaptic activity mobilizes both potentiating and depressing mechanisms, and that homeostasis might be due to a balance between these antagonist mechanisms. Even if synaptic strength stabilization at a set point results from such balance, the “postsynaptic sensitivity to the neurotransmitter” – here assimilated to the ratio Gsyn/Gin– remains “one of the primary variables determining presynaptic compensation”.</p><p>2F) <italic>Differences between this data set and previous studies such as those of Paradis et al. 2001, Frank et al. 2006, Petersen et al. 1997; Cull-Candy et al. 1979 and 1980; Plomp et al. 1992 and Plomp and Molenaar 1996.</italic>:</p><p>Beyond the difference between vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> concerning the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity, there are other parameters that make a direct comparison of these systems difficult. In particular, given the lack of muscle action potentials and DICR signal in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, the mechanism we propose here cannot be directly transposed from vertebrate to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, it could well be that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the evoked release mobilize a putative negative side of the homeostasis through actors other than DICR. The literature on <italic>Drosophila</italic> focuses mainly on the presynaptic expression of the homeostatic potentiation, and not on the postsynaptic mechanisms of evaluation of synaptic efficacy leading to the homeostasis. However, despite the absence of muscle spikes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, evoked postsynaptic potentials should activate low-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and the calcium-induced calcium release responsible for muscle contraction. It is tempting to speculate on the possible role of these calcium signals in the stabilization of the evoked release in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and this remains to be investigated. We added to the Discussion the comparison between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and our data, including the differences in the role of the spontaneous release.</p><p>In the study by Cull-Candy et al. 1979 and 1980, the authors compared the neurotransmitter release in Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and control patients. They found that the neurotransmitter release was not responsible for the weakness characteristic of the MG disease (Cull-Candy et al. 1979), and that in contrast a five-fold increase in the quantal content of the evoked release partially compensated the reduced number of postsynaptic receptors (Cull-Candy et al. 1980). Therefore, this work is a post-observation of the outcome of a compensatory process which had occurred into the organism, and does not predict what kind of synaptic activity between spontaneous release and evoked motor command was responsible in the triggering of such compensation. Despite their weakness, MG patients’ movements are indeed due, as mentioned above, to bursts of evoked release in a frequency range containing the 30Hz we used in our experiments. Therefore, the increase in the quantal content we obtained in response to reduced Gsy/Gin and the mechanism we propose seem not in contrast with these observations.</p><p>A similar argument can be applied for the study by Plomp et al. 1992 and Plomp &amp; Molenaar 1996. In this work, the author mimicked the MG syndrome in rat with chronic injections of α-bungarotoxin, and observed that an increase in the evoked release compensate for the reduced number of functional postsynaptic receptors, an observation that is not in contrast with our work. The time course of the compensation cannot be compared with our work since bungarotoxin was injected chronically every 48h. However, a difference with our work is the apparent long delay (3h minimum) before the observation of the compensation. This apparent delay might be linked to the mode of bungarotoxin administration, i.e. subcutaneous injection, which renders the time course of the appearance of the drug’s effect at the diaphragm neuromuscular junctions difficult to predict. We introduced these references, and these elements of discussion, to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear whether the authors are suggesting that the positive and negative feedback mechanisms are dynamically balanced to achieve unity gain or gate each other to shut off plasticity once unity gain has been achieved. Given the fact that both forms of plasticity have previously been described and what is novel here is the interaction between the two it seems reasonable to insist on a better characterization of that interaction. This could be performed along one or both of the following dimensions: A) Timing: Is the plasticity &quot;gated&quot; by SR calcium release or is there a temporal dependence to this mechanism? A tight temporal requirement would support that the gating mechanism is occurring within the muscle cell. Demonstrating a shared cellular localization for the convergence of these processes would strengthen the argument that LTD regulates/gates the LTP. Related to this point, is it surprising that the LTD is so stable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> given that the ePSPs seem to all fail to reach threshold? Shouldn't this induce LTP? B) Gradation: It is predicted that homeostatic regulation of PSP amplitudes would require a graded response to provide needed precision to the regulation (Davis, 2006). This should be demonstrated. Is either of the signals or their respective outputs graded? This could be revealed by investigating the freq dependence and/or the number of postsynaptic depolarizations required to generate LTD (Dan and Poo, Science 1992). Or is bulk unloading to the SR with thapsigargin sufficient to induce LTD? Overall, the authors need to strengthen their argument that this system is truly homeostatic. Similarly, is there a threshold level of nicotinic calcium required to induce LTP? Is there any freq dependence? Given previous observations from Drosophila and patients with myasthenia gravis, it might be expected that sub-blocking levels of curare would induce increased ACh release independent of bursting. Thus, an important control for the curare experiments is whether curare incubation in the absence of bursting or with chronic activity results in LTP.</italic> </p><p> <italic>One related concern is the safety factor for NMJ transmission – if homeostasis is ongoing wouldn't it tend to obliterate excess EPSP above that needed to evoke an AP?</italic> 3A) <italic>“Positive and negative feedback mechanisms are dynamically balanced to achieve unity gain or gate each other to shut off plasticity once unity gain has been achieved?”</italic></p><p>Some elements for answering this question may already be found in the data of the paper, and they support the dynamical balance hypothesis. It should be noted that despite an apparent safety factor (slope in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> ≥ 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>), the synaptic gain in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell culture is not strictly 1 as it is in the mouse neuromuscular junction, but rather close to 0.7-0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This results from the variability of neurotransmitter release in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Evoked post-synaptic activity is thus made of 70-80% of action potentials (some triggered by release largely exceeding the threshold) and 20-30% of sub-threshold ePSPs. The bursts composing the chronic activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> were made of these proportions of sub- and supra-threshold events. We reasoned that in the case of a “gating mechanism”, supra-threshold events would have been neutral in terms of plasticity (“shut off plasticity”), and thus the remaining 20% of sub-threshold events would have potentiated the synapse up to gain 1. Instead of that, the synaptic gain slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) due to a slight depression of the averaged synaptic currents (0.2, subsection “A stable synaptic gain “of the initial manuscript). The absence of potentiation despite the presence of sub-threshold events is not in favor of “gating” hypothesis, and the plasticity outcome – i.e. depression – excludes it.</p><p>Gradation of depression:</p><p>To examine these issues in more details, we performed new experiments addressing the plasticity response to chronic bursting activity in non-treated <italic>Xenopus</italic> synapses (same protocol than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The small depression observed after chronic activity was not homogenous among tested synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>, black dots). Interestingly, the degree of depression of a given synapse seems dependent on how far its initial Gsyn/Gin ratio was from the averaged ratio of the population measured after chronic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4A</xref>, inset, dotted line). Consequently, standard deviation from the mean diminished after chronic activity. We interpret this synaptic behavior as a convergence towards the set point of homeostasis, induced by the evoked bursting activity.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12190.019</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Homeostatic control of the synaptic efficacy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, ratios between averaged synaptic conductance ('Gsyn', calculated from 30–40 ePSCs) and muscle cell input conductance ('Gin') before and after 20-30 min of chronic burst stimulation of the motor neuron (burst of 20–60 events at a 20–30 Hz frequency, every 30–40 s) under postsynaptic current-clamp in non-treated (black dots) and low curare-treated (red dots) synapses.

Contrary to <italic>Xenopus</italic> where the membrane of the muscle cells is isopotential, these ratios in mouse are only apparent since the recorded ePSP amplitude depends on the distance between the synapse and the recording site. This distance effect is limited in FDB muscle because the cells are “only” 300 µm long, but nonetheless the apparent Gsyn/Gin ratio is presumably lower than the actual ratio at the synapse location.

However, in the natural circumstances this situation occurs only in multi-innervated muscle cells, during development. In our work we did not investigate the possible role of the AP-associated calcium signal in heterosynaptic depression, a hypothesis which remains to be tested. It is tempting to hypothesize that if the global DICR signal (activated across the whole fiber) is associated with the release by all the muscle surface of a negative retrograde feedback factor, it could participate to the depression of the less active synapses in the case of a competition.
