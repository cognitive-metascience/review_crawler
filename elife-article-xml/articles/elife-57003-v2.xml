The permeability of the plasma membrane (PM) for small molecules is low and lateral diffusion of proteins is slow. These findings suggest a high degree of lipid order, which raises the question of how membrane proteins function in such an environment. The yeast PM is segregated into the Micro-Compartment-of-Can1 (MCC) and Pma1 (MCP), which have different lipid compositions. We extracted proteins from these microdomains via stoichiometric capture of lipids and proteins in styrene-maleic-acid-lipid-particles (SMALPs). We purified SMALP-lipid-protein complexes by chromatography and quantitatively analyzed periprotein lipids located within the diameter defined by one SMALP. Phospholipid and sterol concentrations are similar for MCC and MCP, but sphingolipids are enriched in MCP. Ergosterol is depleted from this periprotein lipidome, whereas phosphatidylserine is enriched relative to the bulk of the plasma membrane. Direct detection of PM lipids in the 'periprotein space' supports the conclusion that proteins function in the presence of a locally disordered lipid state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>eisosome</kwd><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>membrane domains</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, The Netherlands</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE-BASIC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poolman</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Advanced #670578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poolman</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR048632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moody</surname><given-names>Branch</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of periprotein lipids by direct extraction of membrane proteins, using styrene-maleic acid polymers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The interior of the cell is separated from the exterior by a lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sackmann, 1995</xref>). Cells can have more than 1000 different lipid species, and the molecular composition at any point on a planar membrane, or in the inner and outer leaflets, differs. Eukaryotic membranes vary along the secretory pathway, and the plasma membrane is enriched in sphingolipids and sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardino de la Serna et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells differ in lipid species: anionic lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerbón and Calderón, 1991</xref>) and ergosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solanko et al., 2018</xref>) are enriched in the inner leaflet of yeast. Sphingolipids are more abundant in the outer leaflet as shown for mammalian cells. Within the membrane, the lipids and proteins may cluster in domains of different composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannich et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Yeast and many other fungi have an optimal growth at pH 4–6, but tolerate a pH of 2.5–3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heard and Fleet, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) and various other harsh environmental conditions such as high concentrations of alcohols and weak acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casey and Ingledew, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bubnová et al., 2014</xref>), which suggests high robustness of their plasma membranes. This correlates with observations that the lateral diffusion of proteins in the plasma membrane (PM) is extremely slow, and the passive permeability for small molecules is low compared to mammalian or bacterial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabba et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting high lipid order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aresta-Branco et al., 2011</xref>). In yeast, the lateral segregation of lipids is associated with a differing location of marker proteins. Of these, the Membrane Compartments of Pma1 (MCP) and Can1 (MCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malínská et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malinska et al., 2004</xref>) are well studied. The proton-ATPase Pma1 strictly localizes to the MCP, whereas the amino acid transporters Can1 and Lyp1 localize to the MCP or MCC depending on the physiological condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>). Many more proteins are associated with MCC and MCP, but the molecular basis of their partitioning is elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spira et al., 2012</xref>). The MCC is part of a larger complex called the ‘Eisosome’, which stabilizes the MCC membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walther et al., 2006</xref>), also known as 'MCC/eisosomes.' In terms of lipid composition, the MCP is reported to be enriched in sphingolipids, and the MCC is rich in ergosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aresta-Branco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>), but evidence for this partition is indirect and mainly based on fluorophore binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>) and lipid-dependent protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>). Attempts to accurately determine the lipids of the yeast plasma membrane after cell fractionation are hampered by impurities from other organellar membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zinser and Daum, 1995</xref>).</p><p>A recently developed method involving Styrene-Maleic-Acid (SMA) polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dörr et al., 2016</xref>) allows extraction of proteins from their native lipid bilayer. SMA-polymers form protein-lipid containing disc-shaped structures, called ‘SMALPs’, that preserve the periprotein lipids corresponding to the diameter of the disc. We adopted this method for direct, in situ detection of lipids that surround named membrane proteins, which minimizes contamination of lipids from other membrane compartments. We developed a stepwise method whereby very small lipid shells are generated, hereafter called the periprotein lipidomes. Shells containing a named protein are captured, and lipids associated with each named protein are detected by a mass-spectrometry based lipidomics method. We applied the methodology to proteins in defined domains such as the MCC and MCP and attempt to address the following questions: Are the periprotein lipidomes of MCC and MCP residents different, and how do they differ from the overall lipid composition of the plasma membrane? How can membrane proteins that undergo large conformational changes work in a high-order lipid environment?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Approach to periprotein membrane lipidomics</title><p>We used SMA to extract transmembrane proteins with surrounding lipids from the plasma membrane to capture periprotein-lipid discs, called SMA-Lipid Particles (SMALPs). This approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>) avoids detergents normally needed to capture membrane proteins and selectively captures lipids within a disc of defined diameter of 9 nm ±1 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dörr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This diameter slightly exceeds the area of many membrane proteins (~20 nm<sup>2</sup>), so we expected about 3 concentric layers of lipid inside the disc. Given the number of membrane proteins in the plasma membrane of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>), a 10-fold over-expression of a single membrane protein has negligible effect on the overall protein-to-lipid ratio. Therefore, given the density of membrane proteins in the plasma membrane of ~3 per 100 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>), versus a SMALP area of ~50 nm<sup>2</sup> (assuming SMA-polymer contributes 1 nm to the radius), we reasoned that most SMALPs would contain a single protein and lipid would be in moderate stoichiometric excess. These predictions based on the known cross-sectional area of lipids, proteins and SMALPS estimate the SMA:protein:lipid of 1:1:60–120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We refer to these lipids as the periprotein lipidome, which includes more than just the annular lipids, which are defined as lipids directly contacting the transmembrane domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of SMALP isolation and lipidome analysis.</title><p>Hydrolysis of SMA-anhydride gives SMA acid.

Can1 and Lyp1 leave the MCC and are internalized from the MCP when arginine (substrate of Can1) and lysine (substrate of Lyp1) are present in excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghaddar et al., 2014a</xref>).

To trap Can1 and Lyp1 in the MCC and obtain a better representation of protein-specific MCC lipids, we used a GFP-binding protein (GBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>) fused to the MCC resident Sur7 to specifically enrich for Lyp1-YPet and Can1-YPet proteins in the MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The GFP-binding protein binds YPet with high affinity and sequesters YPet-tagged proteins, when Sur7-GBP is present in excess.</p><p>We engineered a C-terminal 10-His-tag to each of the proteins and used metal-affinity (Nickel-Sepharose) and size-exclusion chromatography for purification of SMALPs containing either Pma1-Ypet, Sur7-Ypet, Can1-YPet or Lyp1-YPet with measurable purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Indicating the SMALP captured lipids correspond to that of the proteins at a given location (MCC or MCP) in the plasma membrane. SDS-PAGE analysis shows multiple protein bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), presumably due to proteolysis of protein loops during purification. Indeed, 2D native-denaturing gel electrophoresis shows that the vast majority of protein bands are genuine parts of Pma1-Ypet, Sur7-Ypet, Can1-YPet or Lyp1-YPet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Each protein migrates as a single band on a native gel and segregates into multiple bands when SDS is included in the 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension of the electrophoresis. Furthermore, MS analysis of proteins in SMALPs shows peptide coverage across the full-length amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Finally, MS analysis of lipids extracted by SMA polymer from synthetic lipid vesicles shows that the procedure does not bias towards the extraction of specific phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), similar to prior observations for sphingolipids and sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scheidelaar et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Lipidomics analysis of periprotein microdomains</title><p>Next, the SMALP-lipid-protein complexes were treated with a chloroform-methanol-water mixture (1:2:0.8)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>) to precipitate protein and SMA polymers in the interphase and capture membrane lipids in the organic phase. Lipid mixtures were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Electrospray Ionization (ESI)-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (QToF) mass spectrometry. Given that samples were limited to 10 picomoles of protein, we used a single-step HPLC-MS- based lipidomic method, which aimed to detect the major lipid classes of the yeast plasma membrane that were associated with proteins: phospholipids, sphingolipids, and ergosterol, while censoring detected ions of low biological interest that derive from SMALP adherence or media, or redundant detection of molecules as isotopes or alternate adducts. For Pma1-MCP versus SMA polymer only, this unbiased approach generated 815 unique ions with low background from SMA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), in agreement with prior analyses of conventional lipid binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Lipidomics of SMALPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three independently purified samples of SMALP-Pma1 obtained from yeast cells were subjected to lipid extraction, and 1 µM of the input protein was used to normalize lipid input for the reversed phase HPLC-QToF-ESI-MS in the negative ion mode.

Building on previously reported methods for analysis of protein-lipid complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birkinshaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wun et al., 2018</xref>), we implemented data filters for lipids in protein-SMALP complexes. First, ions were considered highly Pma1-specific when signals were 10-fold higher than for SMA polymer alone. 511 ions passed this stringent criterium, whereas 3 signals were preferentially found with SMA polymer, demonstrating a low false positive lipid binding to SMALPs. We further enriched for high value hits by censoring ions present in solvents or recognizable as inorganic salt clusters based on low mass defects. We removed ions representing redundant detection of lipids as isotopes, alternate adducts and dimers [2M] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The combined effects of these filters returned 79 high quality molecular events, representing distinct retention times or <italic>m/z</italic> values.</p><p>Yet, 79 lipids still exceeded our capacity to identify them with targeted collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS, so we used a grouping technique whereby all molecules are plotted according to retention time and mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This simple technique yields patterns comprised of lipids with the same underlying general structure with chain and unsaturation variants, represented as X:Y. Next, we solved the lead compound for key groups by CID-MS. Matching the accurate mass, retention time, and CID-MS patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C and D</xref>) to standards, we identified 58 molecules in eight lipid classes, including 10 molecular species of phosphatidylinositol (PI; lead molecule, <italic>m/z</italic> 835.5361, 34:1), 11 phosphatidylcholines (PC; lead molecule <italic>m/z</italic> 804.5771, 34:1), 10 phosphatidylethanolamines (PE; m/z 716.5251, 34:1), 5 phosphatidylserines (PS; lead molecule <italic>m/z</italic> 760.5148, 34:1), 2 phosphatidylglycerols (PG; lead molecule <italic>m/z</italic> 719.4889, 32:1), 2 phosphatidic acids (PA; lead molecules <italic>m/z</italic> 671.4673, 34:2 PA), 9 cardiolipins (CL; lead molecule <italic>m/z</italic> 1399.960, 68:4), and 7 diacylglycerols (DAG; lead molecule m/z 639.5224, 34:1). Although we were unable to detect mannosyl-diinositolphosphoceramide (M(IP)<sub>2</sub>C), we did identify ions matching inositolphosphoceramide (IPC, m/z 952.6846, 44:0) and mannosyl-inositolphosphoceramide (MIPC, m/z 1114.7340, 44:0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The identification of these yeast lipids was confirmed by the CID-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We used IPC and MIPC as the representative sphingolipids without further optimizing the HPLC-MS method for other possibly related species.</p><p>The lipidomic profile of SMALP-Sur7 was generated by the same approach as described for SMALP-Pma1. For SMALP-Sur7, we identified 36 of 50 high quality ions, including 8 PIs, 10 PCs, 5 PEs, 7 PSs, 2 CLs, and 4 DAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the different (isogenic) background strains of Pma1 and Sur7, many of the same phospholipid species were found in both SMALP-protein complexes.</p><p>Given the high specificity for protein pull down and the lack of substantial adherence of lipids to SMA polymers alone, the lipids identified are likely the molecules that surround the transmembrane sequences of Pma1 and Sur7. For other SMALPs: Can1-MCP, Can1-MCC, Lyp1-MCP, and Lyp1-MCC, we carried out targeted lipidomic analysis based on the ions identified from both SMALP-Pma1 and SMALP-Sur7 negative mode lipidomes, which includes 7 classes of phospholipids, 2 types of sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sphingolipids and ergosterol in MCC <italic>versus</italic> MCP domains</title><p>Given limited lipid eluting from pure proteins, this HPLC-MS method could not be diversified with multiple chromatographic methods needed for separating every kind of lipid. However, with the success in identifying two sphingolipids and seven phospholipids as the two major lipid classes of the yeast plasma membrane, we next sought to quantify for the third major component, ergosterol. Unlike membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids that form anions, ergosterol is a neutral species that is rarely detected in negative mode lipidomics. However, in the positive mode we could detect the protonated ion [M+H]<sup>+</sup> at <italic>m/z</italic> 397.3464, which matched the expected mass of ergosterol and had the same retention time as the ergosterol standard.</p><p>MCC domains are thought to be enriched in ergosterol and sphingolipids are relatively excluded. To test this hypothesis directly, we compared the lipidomic profiles with regard to inositol-phosphoceramide (IPC), mannosyl-inositol-phosphoceramide (MIPC) and ergosterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We did not initially detect IPC and MIPC in the computerized high throughput analysis of Sur7 lipidomes. These ions were missed by automated peak-picking algorithms, likely due to their very low intensity. However, manual examination of ion chromatograms that focused on the mass of these two molecules in HPLC-MS convincingly detected chromatographic peaks allowing the quantitative assessment of MIPC and IPC. Standards for MIPC and IPC were not available, so we could not directly determine their molar abundance from MS signals. Here, the MS signals for ergosterol are similar for Sur7-MCC and Pma1-MCP, but IPC and MIPC MS signals are different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using ergosterol as an internal control, we found ~4 fold decrease in MIPC/Ergosterol and IPC/ergosterol ratios in the SMALP-Sur7-MCC compared to the SMALP-Pma1-MCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This phenomenon was not seen in the bulk membrane when Y8000 was compared to Y5000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that this phenomenon is domain dependent, but not strain dependent. However, we did not observe the similar results for Lyp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or Can1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Because these two proteins are not restricted to either domain, the domain specific protein enrichment is probably not 100%. In addition, three independent preparations of samples could result in large variation in terms of domain specificity. These ratios indicate that MCC-Sur7 periprotein lipidomes have reduced levels of sphingolipids as compared to MCP-Pma1, but our data are inconsistent with previous suggestions based on filipin staining that MCC domains are enriched in ergosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>).

We observed a high degree of unsaturated acyl chains and low values of ergosterol in the periprotein lipidomes. Membrane proteins like Lyp1 might require a relatively high fraction of lipids with one or more unsaturated acyl chains that allow sufficient conformational flexibility of the proteins. The proteins with periprotein lipidome are embedded in an environment of lipids that are enriched in ergosterol and possibly saturated long-chain fatty acids such as present in IPC, MIPC and M(IP)<sub>2</sub>C), which yield a highly liquid-ordered state.

The majority of transporters in the plasma membrane of yeast belong to the APC superfamily, including Lyp1 and Can1, or the Major Facilitator Superfamily (<italic>e.g.,</italic> Hxt6, Gal2, Ptr2). These proteins undergo conformation changes when transiting between outward and inward states, which would be hindered in a highly liquid-ordered membrane, where lipids will have to be displaced when the protein cycles between the outward- and inward-facing state. To obtain an estimate of the number of displaced lipids needed for such a conformational change, we analyzed the X-ray structures of the Lyp1 homolog LeuT in different conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>). We analyzed these X-ray structures oriented in the membrane from the OPM database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lomize et al., 2012</xref>), which positions proteins in a lipid bilayer by minimizing its transfer energy from water to membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We have used a numerical integration method to estimate the surface area of the outward and inward state of LeuT in the plane of the outer- and inner-leaflet at the water membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We estimated the number of lipids in the vicinity of the protein by drawing an arbitrary circle around the protein. With a radius of 35 ångström from the center of the protein we need 43 to 50 lipids per leaflet depending on the conformation. For the inner-leaflet, the inward-to-outward movement of LeuT requires plus three lipids and for the outer-leaflet minus three lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which can plausibly be accommodated by local changes in membrane compressibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duschl et al., 1998</xref>) and by redistribution of the annular and next shell of lipids even if they are surrounded by membrane that is in a highly liquid-ordered state. We find similar changes in the numbers of lipids when we analyze different conformations of membrane transporters of the MFS (not shown). Although the difference in number of lipids is small (plus or minus three), the projections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> show that the conformational changes require significant lateral displacement of lipids in both inner- and outer-leaflet.

Furthermore, we find a much lower fraction of ergosterol and an enrichment of PS in the lipidome associated with Can1, Lyp1, Pma1 and Sur7 than in the surrounding bulk lipids. Assuming one protein per SMALP, we find between 52 to 87 lipids per protein. The number of lipids increases when sphingolipids are included and agrees with estimates reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dörr et al., 2016</xref>). Calculated from the estimated perimeter of Lyp1 homolog LeuT, the number of lipids corresponds to 1–2 shells of lipids surrounding the protein in the SMALP. Hence, we conclude that the SMA extraction targets the periprotein lipidome of membrane proteins.</p><p>When we benchmark our <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lipidomic data to other studies of the yeast plasma membrane we find similar, small quantities of PA, CL and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zinser and Daum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zinser et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ejsing et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tuller et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the majority of protein is extracted from the plasma membrane rather than from internal membranes. In terms of selectivity, we benefit from the ability to trap Can1 and Lyp1 in MCC/eisosomes, taking advantage of the GFP-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>) and the fact that we purify proteins using an affinity tag. Thus, the SMALP approach for lipid analysis is much less hampered by contamination with internal membranes than conventional fractionation studies. The SMALP technology only identifies protein specific lipidomes and does not report the overall composition of the plasma membrane.</p><p>Reported values for the average degree of acyl chain unsaturation for the plasma membrane of yeast vary. The values we find in our SMALPs are consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ejsing et al., 2009</xref>), but somewhat higher than found by others using non-SMALP methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zinser and Daum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zinser et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneiter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daum et al., 1999</xref>).

We therefore do not provide specific conclusions about the quantities of M(IP)<sub>2</sub>C in our SMALP samples. We find similar amounts of ergosterol in MCC and MCP by mass spectrometry analysis, whereas filipin staining in the literature has suggested that ergosterol is enriched in MCC/eisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moreira et al., 2012</xref>). Our lipidomics data and our filipin staining are consistent with one another, but not with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Estimates of global membrane order, using fluorescence lifetime decay measurements and mutants defective in sphingolipid or ergosterol synthesis, suggest that the yeast plasma membrane harbors highly-ordered domains enriched in sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aresta-Branco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora et al., 2004</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins in the plasma membrane of yeast is 3-orders of magnitude slower than has been observed for membranes in the liquid-disordered state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, the passive permeability of the yeast plasma membrane for e.g., lactic acid is orders of magnitude lower than in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabba et al., 2020</xref>). A membrane in the gel or highly liquid-ordered state may provide low leakiness that is needed for fungi to strive in environments of low pH and/or high alcohol concentration, but it is not compatible with the dynamics of known membrane transporters, which undergo relatively large conformational changes when transiting from an outward- to inward-facing conformation. In fact, we are not aware of any transporter that is functional when it is embedded in a membrane in the liquid-ordered state.</p><p>The large, ordered lipid domains described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aresta-Branco et al., 2011</xref>) might represent the MCP, because in our analysis of SMALPs the periprotein lipidome of Pma1 is enriched in sphingolipids relative to that of Sur7 in MCC. We also emphasize that the periprotein lipidomes differ from the bulk membranes. We find that ergosterol is depleted from the periprotein lipidome of Sur7, Can1, Lyp1 and Pma1 and is 6-fold enriched in the surrounding bulk membranes. Sterols are known to increase the lipid order and interact more strongly with saturated than unsaturated lipids. Therefore, depletion of ergosterol from the periprotein lipidome is expected to decrease the lipid order. We propose that large parts of the yeast plasma membrane are in the liquid-ordered state but that individual proteins are surrounded by one or two layers of lipids with at least one unsaturated acyl chain. The proteins in these membrane domains would diffuse slowly because they are embedded in an environment with a high lipid order. The periprotein lipidomes enable sufficient conformational dynamics of the proteins, which might be needed for transporters like Lyp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghaddar et al., 2014b</xref>). A systematic analysis of lipid modulated activity of plasma membrane proteins from yeast is needed to confirm this hypothesis; a first study is presented in the accompanying paper.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LYP1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot <break/>ID 32487</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CAN1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot <break/>ID 04817</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PMA1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot <break/>ID 05030</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SUR7</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot <break/>ID 54003</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y8000 <break/><italic>ura3-Δ1</italic></td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y8001/Lyp1 MCP</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y8001/Lyp1 <italic>ura3-Δ1</italic>, pJK2001</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y8002/Can1 <break/><italic>ura3-Δ1</italic>, pJK2002</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y8003/Pma1 <break/><italic>ura3-Δ1</italic>, pJK2003</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y10001/Lyp1 <break/>Sur7p-GBP, Pil1-mCherry, <italic>can1-Δ1, gap1-Δ1, ura3-Δ1</italic>, pJK2001</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y10002/Can1 <break/>Sur7p-GBP, Pil1-mCherry, <italic>can1-Δ1, gap1-Δ1, ura3-Δ1</italic>, pJK2002</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3145.short?rss=1">10.1073/pnas.1719462115</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y5000/Sur7 <break/><italic>ura3-Δ1</italic>, Sur7p-Ypet</td><td valign="top">This Paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Description can be found in section ‘<italic>Yeast strains and plasmids’</italic> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The extracted lipid residue was re-dissolved in the starting mobile phase A and the injection volume was 10 µl for each HPLC-MS run. The injection concentration for lipid extracts from SMALPs was normalized to 1 µM based on input protein concentration. The injection amount for SMA polymer control was 0.02 µg. The injection amounts for the crude membranes were 0.05, 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 µg depending on the application.

Briefly, a series of concentrations of synthetic standard were prepared and analyzed by HPLC-MS to determine the response factor and degree of linearity of input lipid to count values. The ion chromatogram peak areas from known concentrations were used to generate the standard curves for determining the unknown concentrations of the extracted lipids. For key applications where the highest quality lipid quantification was needed or when input lipid mixtures were complex, we used internal standards for authentic lipids and the method of standard addition. For phospholipids, 0.25 µg crude membrane samples were spiked with a series of known concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 pmol/µl) of synthetic molecules for C34:1 PC, C34:1 PE, C34:1 PS, or C34:1 PI and subjected to HPLC-MS negative ion mode analysis. For ergosterol, 0.05 µg crude membrane samples were spiked with a series of known concentrations of the synthetic standard (0, 1 pmol/µl, 3 pmol/µl, and 5 pmol/µl), and the data were acquired in the positive ion mode.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Linda Columbus (Reviewer #3).</p><p>You will see from the individual reviews below that all reviewers like the method that you describe and see it as a significant advance that should be published. The main criticism of your paper during the discussion was that you mix the description of this new method with an investigation of the importance of lipids for a specific transporter.

Specifically, the authors have used the emerging SMALP technology to investigate the annular lipids that associate with specific membrane transporters in the plasma membrane. The work describes the different environments of the yeast plasma membrane, focusing on the Micro-Compartment-of-Can1 (MCC) and Pma1 (MCP), which contain different protein compositions but for which little is known regarding lipid distribution. The authors use SMALP nanodiscs to extract a set of test proteins (Can1, Lyp1, Pma1 and Sur7) from these different domains and undertake a lipodomic study using MS to investigate whether these domains contain different lipid species. The authors find that actually little changes between these domains, but do note a difference in sphingolipid and ergosterol content. The authors then drill down further into the role of lipids in regulating the amino acid transporter Lyp1, a member of the APC superfamily of proton coupled amino acid transporters. Here the authors discover that Lyp1 does prefer specific phospholipids, such as POPS and POPE. The authors then combine this information with their previous results on the MCC and MCP lipidomic analysis to suggest that membrane transporters in the plasma membrane attract POPS and POPE to provide a lipid environment conducive to transport and propose a model where annular lipids play an important role in regulating transport function in the plasma membrane.</p><p>I personally found the manuscript a little difficult to read, and the authors may want to consider focusing the paper more on what they want the take home message to be. For example, the paper starts off describing the different domains of the yeast plasma membrane, and then switches to what appears to be a more focused study on Lyp1. I was unsure what the authors were concluding, that the MCC and MCP don't have different lipid compositions, or that Lyp1 and other APC transporters need at least 3 or 4 POPS or POPE lipids to function?</p><p>Overall, I think the study reports a novel method for seeking to better understand the role of lipids in regulating secondary active transporters, and I liked the use of SMALP and MS to identify endogenous lipids that associated with these proteins in their native state. However, the current study lacks any details on what the lipids are actually doing (i.e. the mechanism by which they regulate transporter function); much of the explanation appears to be based on conjecture, such that these specific lipids provide a more 'fluid-like' environment in an otherwise 'rigid' membrane. This could be tested experimentally using DEER or FRET possibly, in different lipid environments and correlated with the data from the liposome assays? Similar DEER studies have been undertaken in LeuT, and may serve as a starting point.</p><p>It was also unclear to me whether the authors had considered what controls could be used to support a specific role for POPS and POPE in Lyp1 function. Could it be that these lipids are just preferred by all plasma membrane transporters, rather than playing a specific role in Lyp1 regulation? Do you see increased activity for plasma membrane transporters from plants, bacterial or mammalian cells under these assay conditions for example? I guess the significance of this result to the specific regulation of Lyp1 was not apparent to me from the current draft.</p><p>The section and data reported in Figure 9 also seemed to speculative, I am not sure the conclusions drawn from the modelling here are robust enough at this stage to present in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports on lipids isolated with overexpressed proteins in yeast and compares the identities and abundances to bulk distributions, proteoliposomes, and between proteins in the same and different membrane domains. The results of these data have interesting implications with respect to protein – lipid interactions. There are many concerns with the presentation and organization of the manuscript and data that make the impact of the results too difficult to currently understand; however, the novelty of the information gained and potential impact of the results are potentially very compelling.</p><p>The main criticism I have is that the organization and comparisons are not clearly outlined and organized. Is this paper about the lipid distribution in different membrane domains, the impact the lipid composition has on protein function, the impact a protein has on the local lipid population (e.g. annular lipids), or all of the above. The comparisons made to make each of the stated conclusions do not seem to be the ones that would best support the conclusion. For instance, in the section sphingolipids and ergosterol in MCC versus MCP domains, should have a comparison of the two proteins that partition in these domains under different conditions rather than two proteins expressed in two different yeast strains (although this could support the conclusions the comparison is not compelling). Supplementary Figure 6 should be the main focus of this section and statistics provided to know if the data for Lyp1-MCP and Can1-MCP are depleted in ergosterol and enriched in sphingolipids compared to Lyp1-MCC and Can1-MCC. I believe Supplementary Figure 6 says the error is too high to determine if there are differences and that has me very confused about some of the stated conclusions (this is a dense paper and I may be misreading the results, but I have spent a lot of time trying to understand it all so if I misunderstand the organization and text needs to clarify). That all said the assumption here is that the SMALPs do not have different representation of lipids than the bulk lipids. Which is the implication and conclusion the authors want to make in subsequent parts of the manuscript. I just don't see how this can be supported.</p><p>One concern is the comparison made between the SMALPs and SMA polymer. It seems the proper comparison would be the composition in extracted lipids without the overexpressed protein. This could either be the flow through in the his-tag purification or yeast membrane without overexpressed proteins extracted with SMA polymers. It is important to know if the SMA polymers have a selection of lipids different from bulk lipid compositions and provided an understanding of what the protein's impact on that distribution is.</p><p>Another concern is the impact of overexpression of proteins. The authors provide calculations of SMA:protein:lipid ratios but I do not think these are for overexpressed protein concentrations, which could significantly impact the results and interpretations.</p><p>The organization of the proteoliposome data is very difficult to follow. I spent way too much time trying to understand if Lyp1 in SMA extracted proteoliposomes enriched specific lipids from the bulk concentrations. I still do not have an answer to this question and think it needs to be presented as a piece to support the conclusions. Much is focused on the impact of lipids on the function to justify the recruitment of specific lipids but it isn't clear why the annular lipid enrichment may or may not be required for a specifically bound regulatory lipid.</p><p>The impact of these data and conclusions would be more clear with a better presentation of the enormous amount of data and an integration with the filed in which the data is impacting. For example, if this manuscript is about the distribution of lipids in the yeast membrane domains then the biology and what is known (completely) about this topic should be integrated into the Results. If the manuscript is about fluidity and the impact on protein function then that data (chain saturation) which is currently only in the supplement, should be a major figure in the paper and the state-of-the art-understanding of that field should be integrated into the manuscript. If the manuscript is about how annular lipids differ from bulk lipid compositions, then the paper should integrate the current knowledge in the field and explain how this data impacts that field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57003.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

It is well possible that other plasma membrane transporters have a similar lipid dependence, and given our periprotein lipidome analysis we consider this possibility likely, but other studies to benchmark our data are not available. In general, we and others have observed that bacterial transporters require anionic lipids (Dowhan W, et al., 1996 JBC. Veld I.G, et al., 1991 Biophys Acta. Karasawa A, et al., 2013 J Biol Chem) and PE, but the specificity of Lyp1 for PS as anionic lipid or palmitoyl-oleoyl (PO) chains has not been reported in the literature. We have clarified these issues in the Short Report, including details on how lipids are interacting with membrane proteins (described in the Introduction).</p><p>DEER or FRET experiments are powerful in in vitro studies with purified proteins, but we do not see how these methods could be used in vivo to resolve the structure (“fluid-like” environment in an otherwise “rigid membrane”) of the plasma membrane. Without a protein structure, DEER or FRET requires extensive mutagenesis to identify candidate amino acids for labelling, and such studies would provide information on the conformational dynamics of the protein but not readily address the questions we pose. Also, a fully DEER or FRET analysis of a membrane protein takes at least a few years of work and is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>We disagree that the data reported in Figure 9 are speculative; they are based on a comparison of protein structures in different conformation and show that the area of the proteins in the outward and inward facing conformations are similar, but lipids need to be displaced laterally to allow transporters to switch between the inward- and outward-facing conformations. In the revised manuscript (Resources and Tools paper) we present the analysis in greater detail and show precisely what the assumptions and basis for the conclusions are.

By spitting the paper in two parts and restructuring of the Introduction and Discussion we believe to have addressed the main concerns of the reviewer. We do not know what the reviewer means with “a comparison of the two proteins that partition in these domains under different conditions rather than two proteins expressed in two different yeast strains”. The amino acid transporters Lyp1 and Can1 partition in MCC and MCP, and the distribution over these domains depends on e.g. the presence of substrate. To obtain a (more) uniform location of the transporters we used a trapping method and benchmarked the analysis of the lipidomes of Lyp1 and Can1 against that of genuine MCP (Pma1) and genuine MCC (Sur7) proteins. We then extracted the proteins for lipid analysis. It is not possible to specifically extract and purify more than one protein from one strain. We agree that Supplementary Figure 6 represents the findings better, and we have replaced Figure 3 for Supplementary Figure 6. Figure 3 shows that the MCC and MCP differ in sphingolipids and not in ergosterol (written in the main text). In addition, we find that the lipidomes of the proteins contain 6-fold less ergosterol than expected on the basis of the ergosterol contents of the total plasma membrane; similarly we find differences in the amount of PS associated with the proteins and the bulk of lipids. We have rewritten the Results section to more clearly present these findings. Subsections “Sphingolipids and ergosterol in MCC <italic>versus</italic> MCP domains” and “Quantitative lipid analysis of SMALPs”. Indeed, we make the assumption that the SMALPS have a lipid composition that corresponds to that of the proteins at a given location (MCC or MCP) in the plasma membrane, which we also stress in the revised manuscript. Subsection “Approach to periprotein membrane lipidomics” and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One concern is the comparison made between the SMALPs and SMA polymer. It seems the proper comparison would be the composition in extracted lipids without the overexpressed protein.

We then specifically purify the areas where the affinity-tagged proteins reside. One expects the lipidomes of the SMALPs to be different from that of the bulk, unless all proteins would be surrounded by the same lipids. Indeed, we find differences between SMALPs and the bulk lipids (see reply to previous comment).</p><p>Ideally, one would also like to make a comparison with non-protein containing SMALPs. However, it is not possible to purify non-protein containing SMALPs. We make SMALPs from isolated native plasma membrane and purify the SMALPs containing our protein of</p><p>interest, using an affinity tag fused to the protein. As a result, the specific his-tagged protein SMALPs are retained on the column material, while the flow through contains both non-protein and nontagged-protein SMALPs. For this reason, the flow through is not a proper comparison and we therefore compared SMA vs. SMALPs to remove false positive signals originating from SMA. We agree that it is important to know if the SMA polymers select specific lipids. In Figure 1—figure supplement 4 we compare lipid vesicles of known composition with SMALPs made from the same lipid vesicles. This experiment shows that SMA polymers have no significant preference for the subset of lipids we have tested. See also subsection “Approach to periprotein membrane lipidomics”, where we cite others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern is the impact of overexpression of proteins. The authors provide calculations of SMA:protein:lipid ratios but I do not think these are for overexpressed protein concentrations, which could significantly impact the results and interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>The plasma membrane contains many proteins. Native levels of Lyp1 account for approximately 0.1% of all membrane proteins in the plasma membrane of yeast, and even a 10-fold overexpression has negligible effect on the overall protein-to-lipid ratio (e.g. on Coomassie-stained gels of plasma membrane extracts from Lyp1 overexpressing cells the protein band corresponding to Lyp1 is not visible). We now emphasize that the protein-to-lipid ratios are not significantly affected in our overexpressing strains.

We apologize and believe that the revised manuscripts clarify these issues. In brief, we find that protein:SMALP complexes are enriched in PS (and depleted of ergosterol) compared to the contents of the total plasma membrane. In the proteo-liposome data we find that Lyp1 needs POPS to be active and this relationship is sigmoidal; the POPS cannot be replaced with another anionic lipid or PS with two oleoyl chains. Hence, we conclude that specific interactions between POPS and the protein are required for Lyp1 activity; the sigmoidal relationship suggests that multiple POPS molecules are required for activation of Lyp1. All these points are now emphasized in the Short Report paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The impact of these data and conclusions would be more clear with a better presentation of the enormous amount of data and an integration with the filed in which the data is impacting.
