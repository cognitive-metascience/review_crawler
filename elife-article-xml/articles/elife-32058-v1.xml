substantial rewiring of neural circuits. Precisely-timed electrical stimulation could be used to restore corrective feedback mechanisms and promote adaptive plasticity after neurological insult, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke. This study provides the first evidence that closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV) based on the synaptic eligibility trace leads to dramatic recovery from the most common forms of SCI. The addition of CLV to rehabilitation promoted substantially more recovery of forelimb function compared to rehabilitation alone following chronic unilateral or bilateral cervical SCI in a rat model. Triggering stimulation on the most successful movements is critical to maximize recovery. CLV enhances recovery by strengthening synaptic connectivity from remaining motor networks to the grasping muscles in the forelimb. The benefits of CLV persist long after the end of stimulation because connectivity in critical neural circuits has been restored.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32058.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The spine houses a network of neurons that relays electric signals from the brain cells to the muscles. When the spine is injured, some of these neurons may be damaged and their connections to the muscles broken. As a result, the muscles they command become weak, and movement is impaired. It is possible to strengthen the remaining neural connections with physical rehabilitation, but the results are limited.</p><p>Vagus nerve stimulation, VNS for short, is a new technique that could help people recuperate better after their spine is injured. The vagus nerve controls the heart, lungs and guts, and it reports the state of the body to the brain. When this nerve is electrically stimulated, it releases chemicals that can strengthen the neural connections between brain, spine and muscles, and even create new ones. This rewiring process is essential to repair or bypass the broken neural connections caused by a spine injury. However, it is still not clear how best to use VNS to optimize recovery.</p><p>Here, Ganzer et al. study how VNS helps rats whose forelimbs are weakened after a spine injury. Three groups of rats go through physical rehabilitation, using their affected front paws to pull a handle and feed themselves. Two of these groups also receive VNS: their vagus nerve is stimulated either after the best trials (strongest pulls) or worst trials (weakest pulls).</p><p>Compared to the rehab-only and the worst trials-VNS animals, the rats that receive VNS on the best trials while using their affected paw have many more neuronal connections between their brain and the muscles in this limb. These muscles also become much stronger. VNS during the movement improves recovery whether the rodents have one or two front limbs injured, and the benefits are long lasting.</p><p>As the rats pull the handle, the neurons involved in the movement get activated: they then carry a molecular âsignatureâ that lasts for a short time. When VNS is applied during that window, it appears to help these neurons form new connections with each other, as well as strengthen existing ones. These improved connections mean the brain can communicate better with the muscles: movement is enhanced, which results in greater functional recovery compared to rehabilitation alone.</p><p>VNS is already trialed in stroke patients, who have weakened muscles because their brain neurons are damaged. The work by Ganzer et al. provides crucial information on how VNS could ultimately improve the recovery and quality of life of people with spine injuries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>vagus nerve stimulation</kwd><kwd>vagal nerve stimulation</kwd><kwd>recovery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N66001-15-2-4057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hays</surname><given-names>Seth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kilgard</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name><name><surname>Rennaker</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names><suffix>II</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS085167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>April M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008191</institution-id><institution>Wings for Life</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kilgard</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>W.

Many methods have been developed to enhance synaptic plasticity in hopes of enhancing recovery. Unfortunately, these methods have largely failed in the clinic likely due to the challenge of precisely targeting specific synapses and absence of testing in clinically-relevant models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levy et al., 2016</xref>). Real-time control of neural activity provides a new avenue to promote synaptic plasticity in specific networks and restore function after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McPherson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guggenmos et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Human and animal studies demonstrate that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can improve recovery of sensory and motor function. VNS engages neuromodulatory networks and triggers release of pro-plasticity factors including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and fibroblast growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hulsey et al., 2016</xref>). This in turn influences expression and phosphorylation of proteins associated with structural and synaptic plasticity, including <italic>Arc</italic>, CaMKII, TrkB, and glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Dieppa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furmaga et al., 2012</xref>). Engagement of neuromodulatory networks activates a transient synaptic eligibility trace to support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2015</xref>), thus raising the prospect that closed-loop neuromodulatory strategies may provide a means to direct specific, long-lasting plasticity to enhance recovery after neurological injury. Indeed, in the absence of neurological damage, repeatedly pairing sensory or motor events with brief bursts of VNS yields robust plasticity in sensory or motor cortex that is specific to the paired experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hulsey et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the addition of VNS to rehabilitative training improves recovery in rodent models of unilateral brain injury and in chronic stroke patients, highlighting the clinical potential of closed-loop neuromodulatory strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khodaparast et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pruitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hays et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We tested the hypothesis that closed-loop VNS (CLV) could be harnessed to enhance recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). To do so, we developed a real-time closed-loop neuromodulation paradigm based on the synaptic eligibility trace to deliver VNS immediately after the most successful forelimb movements during motor rehabilitation. The strategy uses a control algorithm that adaptively scales stimulation threshold to trigger a brief 0.5 s train of VNS on trials in which pull forces fall within the top quintile of previous trials (Top 20% CLV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). To test the hypothesis that temporal precision is required for VNS-dependent effects, we employed a similar algorithm in which stimulation was delivered on the weakest quintile of trials (Bottom 20% CLV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g</xref>). Both algorithms deliver the same amount of VNS during rehabilitative training, but Bottom 20% CLV results in a significant delay between VNS and the most successful trials.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32058.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Precisely-timed closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation based on the synaptic eligibility trace enhances recovery after spinal cord injury.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Closed-loop neuromodulation to deliver vagus nerve stimulation to reinforce the most successful trials during rehabilitative training after SCI.

A significant increase in recovery is observed with Top 20% CLV after correcting for number of trials and number of stimulations (ANCOVA, effect of group; number of trials: F[1,1]=11.89, p=0.0031; number of stimulations: F[1,1]=9.57, p=0.0066).

Reward threshold was based on the median of the ten antecedent trials and capped at 120 g, thus rats received a food reward on a given trial if their pull force exceeded the best 50% of 10 most recent trials or 120 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganzer et al., 2016a</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>). This adaptive reward threshold was for all subjects at all times throughout the study. The reward threshold is shown as a green line in all panels and in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>. An independent adaptive stimulation threshold specific to each CLV group was used to determine stimulation delivery during rehabilitative training (described in detail below). Adaptive stimulation thresholds are shown as a red line in the panels below. (<bold>A</bold>) In the Top 20% CLV group, the stimulation threshold was scaled such that VNS was delivered on trials in which pull force exceeded the top quintile of the peak pull force from the previous 10 trials. Circles represents the peak force of each individual trial during a rehabilitative training session. Green filled circles indicate the successful trials in which pull force exceeded the reward threshold. Green circles with a red border indicate trials on which VNS was delivered (the top 20% of trials). White circles indicate trials in which peak force did not exceed the reward threshold. A one minute representative segment of trials (marked with a dashed box) is shown in panel B. (<bold>B</bold>) The green vertical line represents the time in which the reward threshold is crossed. The dashed red vertical line indicates the timing of VNS delivery. Stimulation began after pull force crossed the stimulation threshold, resulting in a short difference between the closest successful trial and VNS (Ît) of 0.2 s. (<bold>C</bold>) This panel depicts pull force and VNS timing on an example stimulated trial (denoted with a black box in panel B). Note that the train of VNS (horizontal red lines) occurs coincident with crossing the red stimulation threshold and shortly after pull force exceeds the green success threshold. (<bold>D</bold>) A subset of rats received Delayed Top 20% CLV. In this configuration, VNS was still delivered on trials in which pull force exceeded the top 20% of the previous ten trials, but stimulation was delayed until the end of the 2 s trial window as shown in E and F. (<bold>E,F</bold>) This delay resulted in an average Ît of 1.4 s between the most successful trials and VNS. (<bold>G</bold>) In the Bottom 20% CLV group, the stimulation threshold was set such that VNS was delivered at the end of the trial window if pull force did not exceed the lowest quintile of the peak force of the 10 previous trials. White circles with a red border indicate trials on which VNS was delivered (the bottom 20% of trials). (<bold>H,I</bold>) Stimulation was delivered at the end of the 2 s trial window if the stimulation threshold was not exceeded, resulting in an average Ît of 25 s between the most successful trials and VNS.

We demonstrate that activation of the vagus nerve improves recovery when reliably delivered within seconds of a successful movement, and we provide the first evidence that CLV enhances reorganization of synaptic connectivity in remaining networks in two non-overlapping models of SCI. The flexibility to promote reorganization in a range of pathways is a critical benefit of CLV, given the great heterogeneity in the etiology, location, and extent of damage present in SCI patients.</p><p>Classical studies by Skinner demonstrate that adaptive reinforcement of successive approximations, or shaping, drives behavior toward a desired response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skinner, 1953</xref>). This principle has been adopted for use in rehabilitation, with the intention to reinforce successively better movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wood, 1990</xref>). We made use of this concept by applying an adaptively-scaled stimulation threshold to deliver CLV with the most successful forelimb movements during rehabilitation. Enhanced recovery was observed only when CLV was paired with trials that approximated the desired outcome, highlight the importance of timing for closed-loop stimulation to shape behavioral outcomes and maximize recovery.</p><p>The magnitude of neuromodulatory activation elicited by an event is directly proportional to the surprise, or unpredictability, of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sara and Segal, 1991</xref>). This phenomenon is ascribed to reward prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz, 2002</xref>). Unsurprising events fail to activate neuromodulatory systems, and even rewarding events fail to trigger neuromodulator release if they are expected. We posit the predictability and accompanying tedium of long, frustrating rehabilitation and the minimal reinforcement of practicing a previously simple motor task blunts plasticity and limits recovery after SCI. The closed-loop neuromodulation strategy developed here circumvents this by artificially engaging neuromodulatory networks and providing a repeated, non-adapting reinforcing signal typically associated with surprising consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hulsey et al., 2016</xref>). CLV drives temporally-precise neuromodulatory release to convert the synaptic eligibility trace in neuronal networks that generate optimal motor control to long-lasting plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>CLV is a minimally-invasive, safe strategy to provide precisely-timed engagement of multiple neuromodulatory networks to boost plasticity during rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays, 2016</xref>). Preliminary results in chronic stroke and tinnitus patients highlight the clinical potential of CLV, while delivering less than 1% of the total FDA-approved amount of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Ridder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Menachem, 2001</xref>). Moreover, the flexibility to deliver stimulation with a variety of rehabilitative exercises raises the possibility to design CLV-based to target motor dysfunction of the lower limbs, somatosensory loss, and bowel and bladder issues, all of which are prevalent in SCI patients. Delineation of the timing requirements and documentation of neuronal changes driven by CLV in this study provide a framework for development of this strategy for a range of neurological conditions, including stroke, peripheral nerve injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lozano, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pseudorabies Virus Bartha Strain <break/>containing the CMV-EGFP reporter <break/>cassette</td><td>PRV-152</td><td>NIH Center for Neuroanatomy <break/>with Neurotropic Viruses (CNNT)</td><td>PRV-152</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>All procedures performed in the study were approved by the University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocols: 14â10 and 99â06).

Sample sizes were based estimated effect size determined in our initial pilot studies and are consistent with comparable previous studies. Trained rats were food restricted Monday-Friday to provide task motivation (<italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water). Because of the cage geometry, only the right forelimb can be used to reach the pull handle to trigger a food reward. After reaching task proficiency (85% success rate on ten consecutive sessions), rats received a unilateral contusive injury (NÂ =Â 128) or bilateral contusive injury (NÂ =Â 41) of the cervical spinal cord. After recovery, rats received a vagus nerve cuff electrode and resumed training on the isometric pull task. In addition to the food reward, rats were dynamically allocated to balanced groups to receive a brief burst of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on appropriate trials. Rehabilitative training, consisting of freely performing the task, continued for six weeks. No VNS was delivered in any group on the final week of rehabilitative training, to allow assessment of lasting effects of stimulation. Terminal motor cortex mapping or transsynaptic tracing experiments occurred the week following the end of therapy in a subset of unilateral (NÂ =Â 23) and bilateral SCI rats (NÂ =Â 20). Eighty-seven rats were excluded from the study due to mortality (NÂ =Â 20), inability to perform the task after injury (NÂ =Â 25), or VNS device failure (NÂ =Â 42). Device failure included mechanical failure of the headmount or loss of stimulation efficacy, determined by a cuff impedanceÂ &gt;25 kÎ© or by the absence of a reduction in blood oxygenation in response to a train of VNS while under anesthesia (described below).

Isometric pull training sessions consisted of two 30 min sessions (separated by at least 2 hr) five days per week. Experimenters were blind to treatment group at all times throughout behavioral testing. Early in training, rats were encouraged to interact with the pull handle by dispensing pellets (45 mg chocolate-flavored pellets, Bio-Serv; Flemington, NJ) when they approached or touched the lever. The pull handle was initially located inside the test chamber and then slowly retracted outside of the behavioral chamber to encourage reaching with the right paw. A trial was initiated when the rats exerted at least 10 g of force on the pull handle. A trial window of 2 s started after trial initiation where the animal could receive a reward by pulling with a force exceeding a reward threshold. The reward threshold was scaled adaptively based on the median peak force of the 10 preceding trials, with a fixed bounded minimum of 10 grams and maximum of 120 g based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganzer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>).

Random group assignment was used to determine which rats received VNS for the first 75% of group assignment decisions. To ensure well-balanced treatment groups, the final 25% of rats were assigned to groups based on their post-injury performance. Rehabilitative training continued for 6 weeks with VNS delivered when appropriate.

A microcontroller board (Vulintus, Inc.; Dallas Texas USA) sampled the force transducer every 10 ms and relayed information to the MotoTrak software for offline analysis. For rats receiving VNS, stimulation was triggered by the behavioral software on appropriate trails during rehabilitative training. Peak pull force (maximum force generated in a trial, g) was calculated for every rat for every week of behavior. A Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compared peak pull forces in each treatment condition across time, followed by <italic>post hoc</italic> Bonferroni-corrected unpaired t-tests where appropriate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>).

After achieving isometric pull task proficiency, rats received either a right side (unilateral) or midline (bilateral) C6 spinal cord contusive impact using surgical technique from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganzer et al., 2016a</xref>). A right side or bilateral dorsal C5 laminectomy was performed for rats receiving a unilateral or bilateral SCI, respectively. The vertebral column was stabilized using spinal microforceps.

An incision was made over the medial face of the radius and ulna of the trained limb to expose the forelimb grasping muscles flexor digitorum profundus and palmaris longus. 15 ÂµL of PRV-152 (~8.06Â Â±Â 0.49 x 10<sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units) was injected into the belly of each muscle across three separate sites. The incision was then closed with non-absorbable suture. We conducted detailed pilot studies to determine the optimal time of viral infection to allow for layer five cortical labeling. At 5â5.5 days post-infection we observed little to no cortical labeling for injured or uninjured animals. At 6â6.5 days post-infection we observed consistent layer five cortical labeling across injured or uninjured animals. Therefore, 6â6.5 days was used as our PRV-152 infection duration for our transsynaptic tracing studies. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.5) at 6â6.5 days after injection. The brain and spinal cord were removed. Spinal roots were kept for anatomical reference. Tissue was then post-fixed overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.</p><p>Quantification was limited to the spinal motor neurons, C3/4 cervical propriospinal neurons, red nucleus neurons, and cortical layer five neurons because these regions exhibited consistent labeling and were specifically related to our hypotheses. The whole neuraxis from the rostral tip of the forebrain to spinal level T3 was blocked and frozen at â80 C in Shandon M1 embedding matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Coronal forebrain and midbrain sections were sliced and slide-mounted at 35 Âµm using a cryostat (from the rostral tip of forebrain to 13 mm caudal). Coronal spinal cord sections were sliced and slide mounted at 50 Âµm (from C4 â T3). After coverslipping, slides were scanned and digitized using the NanoZoomer 2.0-HT Whole Slide Scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics; Japan). Tissue images were exported to a custom software program for cell counting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/davepruitt/PRV-Cell-Counting">https://github.com/davepruitt/PRV-Cell-Counting</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/PRV-Cell-Counting">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/PRV-Cell-Counting</ext-link>). PRV-152 infected neurons expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein. PRV-152 neuron counts were made on every other forebrain and midbrain section (35 Âµm inter-slice interval) and every third spinal cord section (100 Âµm inter-slice interval). Experimenters performing analysis were blind to the group of each rat. Cortical neuron counts were restricted to layer 5 of sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>). We defined motor cortex using standard anatomical reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>). Our ICMS mapping studies confirm that these regions contain the cortical forelimb sensorimotor circuitry. Red nucleus neuron counts were made using standard anatomical reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>). Propriospinal neuron counts were made from spinal level C3 â C4 in Rexed lamina VI, VII, VIII and IX using standard anatomical reference similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015</xref>). Back-labeled putative spinal motor neurons were located in Rexed lamina IX and counted identical to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015</xref>). Sensorimotor cortex, red nucleus and cervical propriospinal neuron counts were normalized within rats to the number of putative spinal motor neurons in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord to control for any differences in injection efficacy. No differences in spinal neuron labeling were observed between CLV and Rehab alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>). Sensorimotor cortex, red nucleus and putative spinal motor neuron counts were analyzed separately using unpaired t-tests. Data representing raw neuron counts in each ROI is available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lesion Histology and Analysis</title><p>At the completion of experimental testing, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.5). The spinal cord was removed and spinal roots were kept for anatomical reference. Spinal tissue was then post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 48 hr, blocked and frozen at â80 C in Shandon M1 embedding matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Spinal tissue was sliced at 50 Âµm using a cryostat, slide mounted and stained for Nissl (gray matter) and myelin (white matter) substance similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganzer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganzer et al., 2016b</xref>). Photomicrographs were taken at 600 Âµm intervals to quantify gray and white matter lesion metrics using Image J. For unilateral SCI, the rostral and caudal extent of spinal gray and white matter damage was expressed as the percentage of spared gray and white matter of the right hemicord with respect to the left hemicord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For bilateral SCI rats, the rostral and caudal extent of spinal damage was expressed as the percentage of spared gray and white matter for each hemicord with respect to an unlesioned rostral and caudal tissue reference within animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>). Smallest and largest lesion areas were fitted to a schematic of spinal level C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). To calculate damage to fiber tracts, two experimenters blind to group assignment evaluated the percentage of lesioned tissue to the dorsal corticospinal tract, dorsolateral corticospinal tract, ventral corticospinal tract, rubrospinal tract, propriospinal tract, and gray matter at the lesion epicenter. The dorsal, dorsolateral, and ventral corticospinal tracts were combined to calculate total CST damage based on the proportion of fibers in each tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bareyre et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Ivry (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Heidi Johansen-Berg (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Reggie Edgerton (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the use of closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation to improve motor recovery after spinal cord injury. Overall, the results are potentially very interesting and impactful. However, the reviewers are concerned that the data are over interpreted in places and some key methodological details are lacking.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were queries/concerns over the deliveries of reward. Some of the concerns may be cleared up as aspects of the methods are clarified. Specifically:</p><p>a) Trial structure is very confusing. Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, it is not clear that reward was always given 50% of the time. For example, in G, reward appears to be given more frequently that 50%? Moving <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with clear delineation of the trial structure, reward, etc. will help.</p><p>b) One reviewer commented that it appears that rats received an adaptive reward schedule, such that forces above a threshold resulted in a food reward. Therefore â top 20% pulls would be rewarded while bottom 20% pulls would not be rewarded. To what extent might this difference in reward contribute to results? The current interpretation is that the improved recovery for the top 20% group is due to selective stimulation of 'good' rather than 'bad' movements. However, it seems that the quality (force) of the movement is confounded by the reward. Perhaps if the bottom 20% movements had also been rewarded then equivalent recovery would have been seen in that group. Please clarify or else discuss this confound.</p><p>c) Another reviewer commented that it did not seem that the 120g criteria was used during rehab (i.e. as opposed to healthy training). It appears that during rehab the animals got a reward even if they remained at low levels of force. Is that correct? What was the distribution of forces that typically made the top/bottom 20% during rehab? Did they attempt a less adaptive approach that required higher force levels?</p><p>2) What period during rehab does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> represent? It is interesting that animals seem to start at low values and then rapidly 'ramp up' only with stimulation. In other words, example G appears to show an animal that does not ramp up rapidly without stimulation. Is there always an acute effect of VNS on the ability to ramp up to higher forces? Does the ability to generate higher forces during training explain the final sustained benefits?</p><p>3) The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> are used to support the notion that timing is critical. This is because the 0 and 2s delays are clearly better than the 25 second delay. However, in addition to the 25s condition having a longer mean delay â it is a much more variable delay (relative to the top 20% movements) as stimulation in this condition is not tied to the top 20% movement (but instead to the bottom 20% movements). Therefore there is confound between mean delay and variability of temporal coupling between movement and stimulation. I therefore suggest that interpretation of this result should be cautious. For example, the statement in the Discussion that 'We confirmed that activation of the vagus nerve must occur within seconds of a successful movement' is not adequately supported by the data. The data show that precisely timed stimulation within 2 seconds is effective, and that imprecisely timed stimulation at &gt;20 seconds is not. That doesn't rule out the possibility that precisely timed stimulation at say 5 seconds may be effective.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref> are shown to illustrate similar number of trials and stimulated trials in the two stimulation groups. Although I can see that these distributions are overlapping I would not describe them as 'matched'. Trials and stimulations are reduced (albeit (presumably) not significantly so) in the bottom 20% group compared to the top 20% group. Demonstrating that these distributions don't' significantly differ from each other does not rule out the possibility that differences in trial numbers may have contributed to between group effects. To take into account differences in trial numbers would require, for example, including trial number as a confound in an ANCOVA.</p><p>5) It is great that the authors list the number of animals that were excluded (n=87); 87 is a rather large number. Please list more specifically why. How was device failure assessed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32058.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were queries/concerns over the deliveries of reward.

To determine reward delivery, we utilized an adaptive reward threshold such that animals received a reward if the peak pull force on a trial exceeded the peak pull force of highest 50% (i.e., the median) of the preceding 10 trials <italic>or</italic> if it exceeded a fixed 120 g threshold. As a result, rewards could be delivered more often than 50% of the time, provided animals could generate pull forces greater than 120 g. We have used this capped adaptive threshold scheme in previous studies (1-3) This reward threshold was used in all groups at all times during the study.</p><p>We have provided additional text in the Materials and methods section (subsection âVagus nerve stimulation parametersâ) and legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> to clarify reward thresholds. Additionally, we have added stimulation thresholds to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> as suggested to further illustrate the adaptive thresholding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) One reviewer commented that it appears that rats received an adaptive reward schedule, such that forces above a threshold resulted in a food reward.

However, all groups received rewards based on the same capped adaptive reward threshold (described above). Thus, given that the reward schedule was identical across groups, reward delivery cannot account for the differences in recovery and plasticity observed across groups. We have now clarified the reward threshold in the Materials and methods section (subsection âVolitional Forelimb Force Generation Assessmentâ) and the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Another reviewer commented that it did not seem that the 120g criteria was used during rehab (i.e. as opposed to healthy training). It appears that during rehab the animals got a reward even if they remained at low levels of force. Is that correct? What was the distribution of forces that typically made the top/bottom 20% during rehab? Did they attempt a less adaptive approach that required higher force levels?</p></disp-quote><p>The same adaptive reward threshold was in all groups at all times throughout the study, both during pre-training and during rehab after SCI. The capped adaptive reward threshold was set such that animals received a reward if the peak pull force on a particular trial exceeded the median peak pull force of the preceding 10 trials or exceeded a fixed 120 g threshold. Prior to injury, all animals easily exceeded the 120 g threshold on most trials, thus the reward threshold was typically stable at 120 g. The reviewer is correct that animals could receive a reward for lower levels of force. After injury, because of the substantial deficit in forelimb strength, animals very rarely exceeded the 120 g threshold. Thus, the vast majority of their rewards were delivered on trials that exceed the median of their previous ten trials, but fall below the 120 g threshold.</p><p>In general, following SCI, the bottom 20% of trials had pull forces of &lt;16g, while pull force on the top 20% trials was &gt;58g. The distributions of pull forces were similar for the Top 20% CLV and Bottom 20% CLV groups at the beginning of therapy. We now include a figure showing the distribution of pull forces for these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We elected not to use a less adaptive approach, because our previous study demonstrated that fixed, static reward thresholds result in comparable performance, but a reduced number of trials, compared to an adaptive threshold (3). Therefore, in order to balance the number of trials performed across groups, we limited our study to use of the adaptive threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What period during rehab does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> represent? It is interesting that animals seem to start at low values and then rapidly 'ramp up' only with stimulation. In other words, example G appears to show an animal that does not ramp up rapidly without stimulation. Is there always an acute effect of VNS on the ability to ramp up to higher forces? Does the ability to generate higher forces during training explain the final sustained benefits?</p></disp-quote><p>All examples are taken from the last week of rehabilitative therapy. The apparent ramp up is due to way in which thresholds are calculated. In all groups, the first ten trials of a session are rewarded regardless of pull force to encourage animals to perform the task when placed in the training apparatus. The reward threshold then adaptively scales (as described above) after the first ten trials, typically requiring greater pull forces to receive a reward. Because greater pull forces are required, performance typically does increase over the first 10-20 trials. This affect is independent of stimulation, as it is observed both prior to lesion and during rehabilitative training in animals that do not receive VNS (Rehab Alone). To provide a more comparable illustration with the other groups, we have replaced panel G with a different example.</p><p>Our previous studies demonstrate that there is no acute effect of VNS on performance (4, 5). In this study, no differences in performance are observed across groups after a single session of VNS, suggesting an absence of an acute effect (Peak Pull Force; One-way ANOVA, F[2,27] = 0.38, <italic>P</italic> = 0.69). Moreover, there was no trend toward increased pull forces within a session, nor differences in within-session pull force changes comparing groups that received VNS and groups that did not, at any time during therapy (Slope of peak pull forces over a session; One-way ANOVA, F[2,27] = 1.96, <italic>P</italic> = 0.16). Together, these findings confirm that VNS does not acutely change performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> are used to support the notion that timing is critical. This is because the 0 and 2s delays are clearly better than the 25 second delay. However, in addition to the 25s condition having a longer mean delay â it is a much more variable delay (relative to the top 20% movements) as stimulation in this condition is not tied to the top 20% movement (but instead to the bottom 20% movements). Therefore there is confound between mean delay and variability of temporal coupling between movement and stimulation. I therefore suggest that interpretation of this result should be cautious. For example, the statement in the Discussion that 'We confirmed that activation of the vagus nerve must occur within seconds of a successful movement' is not adequately supported by the data. The data show that precisely timed stimulation within 2 seconds is effective, and that imprecisely timed stimulation at &gt;20 seconds is not. That doesn't rule out the possibility that precisely timed stimulation at say 5 seconds may be effective.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the temporal variability may also contribute to the reduced recovery observed with Bottom 20% CLV. Changes to the text have been made to temper the conclusions as suggested (Results, second paragraph and Discussion, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref> are shown to illustrate similar number of trials and stimulated trials in the two stimulation groups.

To take into account differences in trial numbers would require, for example, including trial number as a confound in an ANCOVA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this qualification requires additional statistical support. We performed an ANCOVA on peak pull force and either trial number or stimulation number. After accounting for the number of trials, a significant group effect remains, consistent with the hypothesis that the number of trials cannot account for peak pull force (ANCOVA, effect of group: F[1,1] = 11.89, p = 0.0031). Similarly, a significant group effect on peak pull force remains after accounting for number of stimulations (ANCOVA, effect of group: F[1,1] = 9.57, p = 0.0066). We now include these statistical comparisons in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally, we have rephrased the statement to indicate that the groups performed a comparable, rather than matched, number of stimulations (Results, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is great that the authors list the number of animals that were excluded (n=87); 87 is a rather large number. Please list more specifically why. How was device failure assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>In an effort to increase the rigor and reproducibility of our studies, we have taken care to diligently report any dropouts and their associated causes, thus we appreciate the reviewersâ recognition. The exclusion criteria match our previous studies (6-11). Given the large total number of animals in the study, the chronicity of the study, and the use of a neurostimulation device with associated failure modes, the 87 animals excluded is roughly equivalent to previous studies evaluating chronic recovery of motor function with VNS after neurological injury (6-10) We now provide more detail as to the specific reason for exclusion in the Materials and methods section (subsection âExperimental Designâ). Additionally, we provide greater detail on the procedures used to assess device failure (subsection âVagus nerve stimulation cuff implantation surgeryâ).</p><p>References</p><p>1) Ganzer, P.
