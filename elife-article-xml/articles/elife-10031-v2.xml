Indeed, it is established that the ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms regulate energy expenditure and insulin resistance. However, the role of the neuron-specific isoform JNK3 is unclear. Here we demonstrate that JNK3 deficiency causes hyperphagia selectively in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. JNK3 deficiency in neurons that express the leptin receptor LEPRb was sufficient to cause HFD-dependent hyperphagia. Studies of sub-groups of leptin-responsive neurons demonstrated that JNK3 deficiency in AgRP neurons, but not POMC neurons, was sufficient to cause the hyperphagic response. These effects of JNK3 deficiency were associated with enhanced excitatory signaling by AgRP neurons in HFD-fed mice. JNK3 therefore provides a mechanism that contributes to homeostatic regulation of energy balance in response to metabolic stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10031.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10031.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10031.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Consuming the right amount of food is important for health. Eating too little for a long time causes damage to organs, and overeating can cause harm as well, in the form of conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several signaling molecules and brain regions are linked to controlling food consumption and ensuring the body receives the correct amount of nutrients to fuel its activities.</p><p>Previous studies have found that two proteins called JNK1 and JNK2, which are found in most tissues of the body, can reduce how much energy cells use. This can trigger insulin resistance and fat accumulation, and so suggests that blocking the activity of these proteins may help to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, the role of another JNK protein – JNK3, which is mostly found in the brain – was not known.</p><p>Now, Vernia, Morel et al. have investigated the role of JNK3 in metabolism. It was found that JNK3 reduced the amount of food consumed by mice provided with a cafeteria (high fat) diet. Mice that lacked JNK3 ate far more food and gained more weight on a high fat diet than normal mice. However, JNK3 played no role in food consumption when mice were fed a standard chow diet. Treating normal mice with leptin – an appetite-suppressing hormone – caused them to lose weight, but did not affect mice that lacked JNK3.</p><p>Examining the brains of the mice revealed that in normal mice, JNK3 in a specific sub-population of neurons decreases the production of proteins that promote eating. However, the proteins continued to be produced in mice that lacked JNK3, encouraging overeating.</p><p>Overall, the results suggest that blocking the activity of all the JNK proteins will not help treat obesity and diabetes as shutting down JNK3 could encourage overeating. Therefore, future investigation into treatments for these conditions should focus on drugs that specifically target JNK1 and JNK2, and not JNK3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10031.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10031.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>leptin</kwd><kwd>satiety</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK107220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Roger J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigatorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Roger J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24DK093000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jason K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic stress-induced activation of the JNK3 protein regulates excitatory transmission onto AgRP neurons to regulate food consumption.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulation of energy balance (food consumption and energy expenditure) is important for health and survival. Sustained negative energy balance caused by cachexia and anorexia is associated with serious injury to multiple organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyagi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mehler and Brown, 2015</xref>). Similarly, sustained positive energy balance caused by hyperphagia results in obesity associated with severe metabolic disorders (e.g. type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hepatitis, neurodegeneration and cancer) that represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flegal et al., 2013</xref>). The homeostatic maintenance of energy balance is therefore critically important.</p><p>It is established that the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in the hypothalamus plays a key role in the regulation of energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone, 2005</xref>). AgRP neurons in the ARC mediate orexigenic signals, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that project to POMC neurons in the ARC and to secondary response neurons in many brain regions, including the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. In contrast, POMC neurons mediate anorexigenic signals, including cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). POMC neurons project to many brain areas, including the PVN and LH in the hypothalamus where α-MSH acts as an agonist of the melanocortin receptors MC3R and MC4R on secondary response neurons to inhibit feeding and increase energy expenditure. Importantly, this action of α-MSH is antagonized by AgRP. Moreover, POMC neurons receive inhibitory GABAergic input from AgRP neurons. Consequently, AgRP and POMC neurons act together to balance food consumption, energy expenditure and nutrient homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone, 2005</xref>).</p><p>AgRP and POMC neurons integrate signals from nutrients (e.g. glucose and fatty acids) and peripheral hormones (e.g. leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and cytokines) to mediate opposite actions regulating downstream neuroendocrine circuits linking internal and environmental stimuli with the coordinated control of homeostatic satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blouet and Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). Thus, leptin activates POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>) and inhibits AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</xref>) leading to reduced food consumption and increased energy expenditure. These processes can be regulated by intracellular signaling networks, including the Janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2-STAT3) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Myers, 2003</xref>), Rho-associated coiled coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kocalis et al., 2014</xref>), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claret et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dagon et al., 2012</xref>), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niswender et al., 2003</xref>), that contribute to the fine-tuning of energy balance.</p><p>The anorexigenic hormone leptin plays a key role in the regulation of food consumption. Leptin can act directly on AgRP and POMC neurons, but leptin can also act on other neurons in several brain sub-regions, including mid-brain and brainstem nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patterson et al., 2011</xref>). Control of leptin signaling in these neurons is important for maintaining energy balance. For example, obesity causes an increase in the blood concentration of leptin, most likely because of increased adipose tissue mass. The increased leptin concentration can lead to tachyphylaxis and suppression of the anorexigenic actions of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frederich et al., 1995</xref>). This mechanism enables homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior in response to metabolic stress. Whether this mechanism represents “leptin resistance” is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Myers et al., 2010</xref>) because some biochemical aspects of leptin signaling are maintained in the obese state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ottaway et al., 2015</xref>). A requirement for leptin signaling may reflect the role of the leptin-stimulated JAK2-STAT3 pathway to increase expression of the negative regulator SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Myers, 2014</xref>). Negative regulation of leptin signaling may also involve the tyrosine phosphatases PTPN1 and PTPN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bence et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loh et al., 2011</xref>), reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diano et al., 2011</xref>), the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozcan et al., 2009</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaushik et al., 2011</xref>), and low-grade inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Git and Adan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the study reported here was to test whether the cJun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway regulates feeding behavior. Previous studies have established that the ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms play an important role in the metabolic stress response of peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>). However, loss-of-function studies have not identified a role for JNK in the control of food consumption. Here we demonstrate that the neuronal isoform JNK3 (encoded by the <italic>Mapk10</italic> gene) plays a key role in the maintenance of energy balance during consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) by promoting leptin signaling. <italic>Mapk10</italic> gene ablation studies identify AgRP neurons as a site of JNK3 function. JNK3 is therefore a key mediator of homeostatic regulation of energy balance in response to metabolic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Feeding a high fat diet causes JNK3 activation</title><p>Leptin is an anorexigenic hormone. Indeed, treatment of chow-fed mice with leptin suppressed feeding behavior and caused decreased body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, HFD-fed mice failed to respond to leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mechanism that accounts for this observation is unclear, but may involve both decreased leptin signaling and reduced signaling by down-stream mediators (e.g. MC4R). Tachyphylaxis may be a contributing factor and mutational analysis of leptin signaling components implicates functions of the leptin receptor, tyrosine phosphatases, reactive oxygen species, and SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Myers et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10031.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>JNK3 deficiency causes hyperphagia and obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT mice were fed (4 wk) a chow diet (CD) or a high-fat diet (HFD).

It is established that feeding a HFD causes activation of the ubiquitously expressed isoforms JNK1 and JNK2 in peripheral tissues, including liver, muscle, and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>). However, the regulation of JNK caused by feeding a HFD in the central nervous system is unclear because these ubiquitously expressed JNK isoforms in neurons are constitutively activated and are primarily localized to axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliva et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the neuron-specific isoform JNK3 exhibits low basal activity and can be activated in the nucleus when neurons are exposed to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). We therefore tested whether feeding a HFD caused activation of JNK3. This analysis demonstrated that feeding a HFD caused JNK3 phosphorylation and activation in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). JNK3 in the central nervous system is therefore responsive to diet-induced metabolic stress. This JNK3 pathway represents a possible mediator of altered leptin signaling in HFD-fed mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>JNK3 deficiency promotes obesity and insulin resistance</title><p>To examine the role of the JNK3 pathway, we investigated the effect of feeding a chow diet (CD) or a HFD to wild-type (WT) mice or <italic>Mapk10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (JNK3-deficient) mice.

Studies of the ubiquitously expressed isoforms JNK1 and JNK2 demonstrate that the JNK pathway is activated in peripheral tissues by feeding a HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirosumi et al., 2002</xref>). Consequences of HFD-stimulated JNK1 and JNK2 activation in peripheral tissues include promotion of insulin resistance in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sabio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabio et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vernia et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, central actions of JNK1 and JNK2 are mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by regulation of energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belgardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sabio et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vernia et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these studies indicate that JNK1 and JNK2 play important roles in metabolic stress responses by causing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and promoting obesity by suppressing energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>).</p><p>JNK3 is expressed in a limited number of tissues, including the brain and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 1996</xref>). Since JNK1 and JNK2 are expressed ubiquitously, the expression of JNK3 by neurons means that these cells express all three JNK isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis, 2000</xref>). To examine the role of JNK in neurons, the effects of ablation of the three genes that encode JNK (<italic>Mapk8, Mapk9</italic>, and <italic>Mapk10</italic>) in neurons have been examined. This analysis demonstrated that compound JNK-deficiency caused markedly increased survival responses associated with increased autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Roles for individual JNK isoforms in neurons have also been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coffey, 2014</xref>). JNK1 and, to some extent JNK2, are constitutively activated and are primarily localized to axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliva et al., 2006</xref>) where they play a major role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and axonal/dendritic morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coffey, 2014</xref>). In contrast, JNK3 exhibits low basal activity and is activated in the nucleus when neurons are exposed to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Studies of <italic>Mapk10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice demonstrate that JNK3 is required for stress-induced cJun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). This role of JNK3 in neurons is non-redundant with JNK1 and JNK2.</p><p>Here we report that JNK3 in LEPRb<sup>+</sup> neurons regulates feeding behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The mechanism of JNK3 function requires metabolic stress (e.g. feeding a HFD) to cause JNK3 activation. This distinguishes the JNK3 deficiency phenotype from other negative regulators of leptin signaling. Thus, JNK3 deficiency does not cause hyperphagia when mice are fed a chow diet, but JNK3 deficiency does cause hyperphagia when mice are fed a HFD. In contrast, PTPN1-deficiency causes hypophagia on both CD and HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bence et al., 2006</xref>). This analysis indicates that JNK3 is not required for fine-tuning leptin receptor signaling, but JNK3 is essential for determining the leptin signaling response during exposure to metabolic stress. JNK3 therefore serves a key role in the establishment of the set-point for the threshold of leptin signaling that controls feeding behavior in response to metabolic stress.</p><p>Gene ablation studies in sub-populations of LEPRb<sup>+</sup> neurons demonstrated that HFD (but not CD) hyperphagia was found in mice with JNK3 deficiency in AgRP neurons, but not POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data demonstrate that JNK3 deficiency in AgRP neurons is sufficient to cause HFD hyperphagia, although possible roles for JNK3 in other LEPRb<sup>+</sup> neurons cannot be excluded by this analysis. We conclude that orexigenic signaling by AgRP neurons contributes to the effects of JNK3 deficiency on HFD hyperphagia.</p><p>Molecular mechanisms that account for JNK3 function include altered excitatory transmission to AgRP neurons in HFD-fed mice. Our recordings measured glutamatergic transmission from all inputs to AgRP neurons and demonstrated an increase in mEPSC amplitude, but not frequency, from HFD-fed JNK3-deficient mice compared with HFD-fed control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This observation is consistent with a possible postsynaptic function of JNK3 in AgRP neurons whereby JNK3 affects AMPA and/or NMDA receptor activity within these neurons. Interestingly, glutamatergic input to AgRP neurons stimulates feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have established functional connections between the JNK signaling pathway and glutamatergic receptor signaling in neurons. For example, the JNK scaffold proteins JIP1/2 can regulate NMDA receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kennedy et al., 2007</xref>) and AMPA receptor phosphorylation by JNK regulates AMPA receptor function and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). Further studies are required to identify the complete spectrum of JNK3 targets in AgRP neurons. Nevertheless, since an increased AMPA response was detected in JNK3-deficient AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>), we conclude that JNK-mediated AMPA receptor regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>) may contribute to the hyperphagic phenotype of HFD-fed JNK3-deficient mice.</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that JNK3 plays a major role in the regulation of energy balance. This function of JNK3 to regulate feeding behavior differs from the roles of JNK1/JNK2 to regulate energy expenditure and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>). These conclusions are based on loss-of-function studies. A contrasting conclusion has been reported based on gain-of-function studies using transgenic expression of a MKK7-JNK1 fusion protein (that mimics constitutively activated JNK1) in AgRP neurons that causes a small increase in food consumption by CD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsaousidou et al., 2014</xref>). Since JNK1-deficient (<italic>Mapk8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice do not exhibit altered feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sabio et al., 2008</xref>) and endogenous JNK1 is constitutively activated in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coffey, 2014</xref>), it is unclear why transgenic over-expression of an activated <italic>Mapk8</italic> allele (encoding a MKK7-JNK1 fusion protein) in WT mice would cause a small change in feeding behavior. However, the pro-apoptotic function of this activated <italic>Mapk8</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lei et al., 2002</xref>) may cause defects in hypothalamic neuronal circuits that contribute to the reported phenotype. On balance, we favor the conclusion that JNK1 and JNK2 do not influence feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>), but JNK3 promotes leptin-mediated suppression of HFD feeding behavior (when JNK3 is activated), but not CD feeding behavior (when JNK3 is inactive).</p><p>The observation that JNK1 and JNK2 promote obesity (by inhibiting energy expenditure) and cause insulin resistance in peripheral tissues indicates that drugs that block JNK signaling may be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of pre-diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>). However, this study demonstrates that JNK3 inhibition causes HFD-dependent hyperphagia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This represents a potential problem for drug therapy. While JNK1/2 inhibition may be therapeutically beneficial, hyperphagia may therefore result from JNK3 inhibition. Consequently, the most effective drug strategy for the treatment of pre-diabetes may require a small molecule that inhibits JNK1/2, but not JNK3.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>We have described <italic>Mapk10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>).

However, the mechanism(s) by which JNK3 acts within AgRP neurons is not sufficiently developed. In particular the deficiency in Lepr signaling seems unlikely.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>For publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors need to delineate the mechanism by which loss of JNK3 signaling in AgRP neurons promotes obesity. The reviewers have suggested several approaches to address this issue. Alternatively, the authors may decide that publishing the more descriptive part of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) in another journal is the best option.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper provides evidence that lack of JNK3 expression in all cells, all neurons that express the leptin-receptor or just the sub-population of neurons that expresses AgRP leads to obesity when mice are reared on a high-fat diet (HFD) but not on a normal (control diet). The obesity is associated with elevated leptin, elevated insulin, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and many other parameters associated with obesity. The most important contribution is their systematic demonstration that the phenotype of global KO of the gene encoding JNK3 is replicated quite well by KO only in AgRP neurons. The authors go on to explore how loss of JNK3 function in AgRP neurons might lead to the hyperphagic obese phenotype, but those studies are less compelling.</p><p>1) The authors show that leptin receptors can be activated (phosphorylated) in the JNK3 KO but the dose-response is apparently shifted – LepR is fully activated (phosphorylated) with 2.5 mg/kg leptin but only partially activated with 0.1 mg/kg (Figure 7B). They attribute this hypo-sensitivity to a reduced level of Lepr mRNA (about half normal). They show that phospho-cJun (transcription factor) normally binds to an AP1 site in the promoter of Lepr gene and hence the lack of phosphorylation of c-Jun could impair transcription of Lepr gene. There are two problems with this analysis: (a) The Lepr mRNA (rather than protein) measurements were made in hypothalamic samples, not in AgRP neurons where it is relevant. (b) Complete loss of Lepr in AgRP neurons has a relatively small effect on obesity and heterozygous Lepr db/+ mice (with half the normal level of Lepr mRNA) do not become more obese on a HFD than WT mice. Thus, it seems unlikely that reduced levels of LepR account for the obesity observed in this JNK3 KO model.</p><p>2) Their data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are more promising. They show that mEPSCs amplitude in AgRP neurons is enhanced in slices, suggestive of enhanced excitatory signaling within AgRP neurons. If this enhanced excitability extends to in vivo situation, then that could drive the hyperphagia and ultimately the obesity. Thus, I suggest that the authors do whatever they can to demonstrate that AgRP neurons are hyperactive in vivo. First they need to demonstrate that the mice are hyperphagic <italic>before</italic> they become obese. The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> was performed after there was already a difference in body weight. A pair-feeding experiment would also be useful to demonstrate that the obesity is due to hyperphagia. Looking for markers of enhanced neuronal activity in AgRP neurons (e.g. Fos) might also be revealing. However, the ultimate experiment would be to use in vivo recording or calcium imaging of AgRP neurons – techniques that are available to this group.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Vernia and colleagues present an interesting paper in which the conclusion are based on a broad set of experiments and well justified. They show that the loss of the neuronally expressed JNK3 is associated with increased obesity due to increased food consumption. This is brought about by the elimination of JNK3 in leptin receptor expressing neurons. They narrow this down further by doing an AgRP-specific elimination and compare that to a POMC neuronal-specific elimination. They demonstrate hyperphagia to be present in only Agrp-specific nulls for JNK3. They go on to demonstrate that this is in fact due at least in part due to reduced leptin receptor expression on AgRP-neurons. All of this happens exclusively in the context of high fat diet exposure.</p><p>These are interesting findings that should be of broad interest to the field. It is surprising to find JNK3 necessary for leptin receptor expression and to see it distinct from the role of JNK1/2 in the periphery where their lack results in improvement in the metabolic phenotype due to reduced inflammatory tone.</p><p>There is very little to criticize here. The authors address an important question, find a surprising answer of broad interest and base their conclusion on a broad set of genetic data.</p><p>The only area that falls short is a further analysis of the signaling mechanisms in place. What other component of leptin signaling are affected by the lack of JNK3? The downstream analysis could be broader. Where does the cell specificity come in? How does JNK3 deficiency lead to reduce <italic>lepR</italic> expression in AgRP neurons, and it does not lead to reduced <italic>lepR</italic> expression in POMC neurons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Vernia et al. show that JNK3 plays a role in inhibiting high-fat diet-induced weight gain and does so through actions at AgRP/NPY neurons, which may include bolstering leptin actions. Overall, the metabolic studies convincingly show that JNK3 deficiency increases HFD-induced weight gain, hyperphagia, adipose hypertrophy, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The logical set of cell-type-selective JNK3 deletions provides compelling evidence that JNK3 actions specifically in AgRP neurons are necessary to reduce HFD-induced weight gain. Thus, the overall conclusion is well supported by the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</p><p>The primary weakness in the work is the cursory attempt to provide some mechanistic insight (Figures 6 and 7). The mEPSC recordings add very little to the paper as is. It is important to know that mIPSCs don't also increase and how the deletion affects basal regulation of POMC neurons. In Figure 7, the overall JNK3 knockout was used and thus, it is not possible to determine if leptin receptor expression is also reduced in POMC cells or rather, if maybe POMC cells do not express JNK3 or require JNK3 to bolster leptin sensitivity. In my opinion, these last 2 experiments do not need to be included to support the conclusions made, but if they are included, they need to be done more thoroughly so that they can be better interpreted.</p><p>JNK3 is the neuron-specific isoform of JNK and its activity is dynamically regulated rather than constitutive like the other 2 isoforms. Together with the compelling evidence provided here that JNK3 helps reduce high-fat diet-induced weight gain through actions in AgRP neurons, this work adds significant new insight into JNK3 function and the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance in the face of metabolic challenge.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Excitatory transmission onto AgRP neurons is regulated by cJun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase 3 in response to metabolic stress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have carefully considered the reviewers’ comments and we have thoroughly revised the manuscript by including new experiments to more fully establish our conclusions. Specifically, we demonstrate that JNK3 plays no role in the regulation of feeding behavior in chow-fed mice, but activated JNK3 in high fat diet-fed mice regulates excitatory transmission onto ARP/NPY neurons. Collectively, our data establish a new paradigm for the regulation of feeding behavior by metabolic stress.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1: This paper provides evidence that lack of JNK3 expression in all cells, all neurons that express the leptin-receptor or just the sub-population of neurons that expresses AgRP leads to obesity when mice are reared on a high-fat diet (HFD) but not on a normal (control diet).

This analysis demonstrates that hyperphagia is detected within 2 days of high fat diet consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H-MRS analysis on day 3 demonstrated no obesity phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the high fat diet hyperphagia phenotype occurs prior to the development of obesity.</p><p>B) We performed a pair-feeding study using high fat diet-fed WT and JNK3-deficient mice. This analysis demonstrates that no obesity phenotype was detected when the WT and JNK3-deficient mice consumed the same amount of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data demonstrate that the greater obesity of high fat diet-fed JNK3-deficient mice compared with WT mice is caused by increased food consumption.</p><p>C) We have not performed in vivo recording and calcium imaging of AgRP neurons, as requested; we believe that such studies are beyond the scope of the present manuscript. We did examine cFos staining, but no differences in the number of cFos-positive AgRP neurons were detected between WT and JNK3 KO mice. We have expanded the electrophysiological analysis of AgRP neurons from chow diet-fed mice and high fat diet-fed mice in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

In the revised manuscript, we have focused the data presentation and the central conclusions of our study on the finding that excitatory transmission onto AgRP neurons is regulated by the JNK3 signaling pathway in HFD-fed mice. This observation provides a mechanism for the HFD-specific hyperphagia of JNK3 KO mice.

The authors admit that &quot;further studies are required to identify the complete spectrum of JNK3 targets in AgRP neurons&quot;. I would argue that they have not identified any direct JNK3 targets in AgRP neurons.</italic> </p><p>Our focus on JNK3 function in AgRP neurons is based on the findings that:</p><p>1) JNK3-deficiency causes changes in <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> expression, but not <italic>Pomc</italic> expression, in the response to leptin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or feeding a HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>);</p><p>2) mEPSC amplitudes are increased in AgRP neurons of JNK3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); and</p><p>3) JNK3-deficiency in AgRP neurons is sufficient to cause hyperphagy on a HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data provide strong evidence for a function of JNK3 in AgRP neurons. We agree that electrophysiological studies of <italic>AgRP-cre<sup>+</sup> Mapk10<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup> NPY-GFP</italic> mice would be interesting, but these mice are not available in our colony; we consider these studies to be beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>We apologize for the poor presentation of the conclusions of our study in the Discussion section of our manuscript where we suggested that NMDA receptors may be regulated (based on the two papers we cited) without adequately addressing the role of AMPA receptors. We have revised the manuscript to make our presentation clearer. Moreover, we have included new data in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) that demonstrates the role of AMPA responses in the mEPSC recordings. These new data have enabled greater focus of the manuscript. <italic>These data represent a key finding that provides a mechanism for JNK3 function mediated by the regulation of AMPA responses</italic>. It is established that AMPA receptor phosphorylation by JNK controls AMPA receptor trafficking and function (Thomas et al. 2008).</p><p>Although an altered AMPA response in AgRP neurons contributes to the JNK3 phenotype, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is also an altered NMDA response. We feel that dissecting the specific contributions of AMPA and NMDA receptors, while interesting, is outside the scope of this study. In addition, while our recordings show alterations in mEPSC amplitudes, further studies are needed to identify the full spectrum of JNK3 targets that could potentially result in this observation. Such targets may include the JNK scaffold protein JIP1 (that inhibits NMDAR signaling) and JIP2 (that increases NMDAR signaling), but we consider studies of these scaffold proteins to be beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>At the very least, the authors need to discern whether AMPA or NMDA receptor signaling is altered in JNK3-deficient AgRP neurons and provide some data or reasonable hypothesis indicating how lack of JNK3 could lead to enhanced AMPA/NMDA signaling.</italic></p><p>We agree – this is an important point. We did not make conclusions about AMPA vs. NMDA currents in the previous version of this manuscript. We have therefore revised the manuscript to include new data documenting that the mEPSC currents that we detect are mediated by AMPA receptor responses, not NMDA receptor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data have enabled us to focus on AMPA responses and the established role of JNK phosphorylation to regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and function (subsection “JNK3 regulates excitatory transmission onto AgRP neurons of HFD-fed mice“). We believe that our revised manuscript has been substantially improved by incorporation of these changes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
