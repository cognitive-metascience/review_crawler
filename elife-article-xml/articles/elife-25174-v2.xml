cargos toward microtubule minus-ends. Recently, ciliobrevins were reported as selective cell-permeable inhibitors of cytoplasmic dyneins. As is often true for first-in-class inhibitors, the use of ciliobrevins has in part been limited by low potency. Moreover, suboptimal chemical properties, such as the potential to isomerize, have hindered efforts to improve ciliobrevins. Here, we characterized the structure of ciliobrevins and designed conformationally constrained isosteres. These studies identified dynapyrazoles, inhibitors more potent than ciliobrevins. At single-digit micromolar concentrations dynapyrazoles block intraflagellar transport in the cilium and lysosome motility in the cytoplasm, processes that depend on cytoplasmic dyneins. Further, we find that while ciliobrevins inhibit both dynein's microtubule-stimulated and basal ATPase activity, dynapyrazoles strongly block only microtubule-stimulated activity. Together, our studies suggest that chemical-structure-based analyses can lead to inhibitors with improved properties and distinct modes of inhibition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

Activities) superfamily is comprised of ~100 proteins in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>; Human AAA+ protein count was obtained as follows: in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/">supfam.org</ext-link>, search was performed for &quot;Extended AAA-ATPase domain&quot; and refined for proteins within the human genome). These ATPases are essential for many cellular processes, including DNA replication, proteostasis, membrane remodeling, and cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</xref>). Extensive cell biological and biochemical studies have revealed that these enzymes couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate remodeling and directional transport, processes that can occur on the timescale of seconds or minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</xref>). Thus, small molecule inhibitors that can modulate AAA+ activity on similarly fast timescales are likely to be valuable tools to probe their cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampson and Kapoor, 2006</xref>). Valosin-containing protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshaies, 2014</xref>) and dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>) are the only two human enzymes in this large superfamily for which well-characterized small molecule antagonists have been reported.</p><p>Dyneins are microtubule-based motor proteins in the AAA+ family that have been divided into two classes, axonemal and cytoplasmic. Axonemal dyneins are required for the beating of flagella. Cytoplasmic dyneins, of which there are two isoforms (hereafter, dynein 1 and 2), are present in metazoan cells and are required for a wide range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vallee et al., 2004</xref>). Transport of cargo along microtubules requires a balance of forces directed toward opposite ends of the filament. While multiple motor proteins in the kinesin family provide the plus-end directed force to drive this motion, their activity in many contexts is opposed by one of two cytoplasmic dyneins, the primary motor proteins transporting cargos toward the minus-end of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vale, 2003</xref>). Dynein 1 has many functions in the cytoplasm, where it moves diverse cargoes ranging from mRNA molecules to whole organelles. In contrast, dynein 2’s functions are restricted to cilia and flagella. The primary cilium is an antenna-like organelle that protrudes from the cell surface. Bidirectional transport in the cilium, known as intraflagellar transport, is required for Hedgehog signaling, a developmental pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Cargos of both dynein isoforms can move at rates of &gt;1 µm/s in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mijalkovic et al., 2017</xref>) and therefore, fast-acting, reversible chemical inhibitors are likely to be useful probes for dynamic dynein-dependent cellular processes.</p><p>Ciliobrevins were recently reported as the first selective, cell-permeable probes of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>). Although other chemical antagonists of dynein have contributed to understanding the biochemistry of dynein, their use in cell biology has been limited because they either have limited cell permeability (e.g. vanadate) or are non-selective in cells (e.g. EHNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbons et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard et al., 1981</xref>). Ciliobrevins were discovered as inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling and shown to block cytoplasmic dynein 1- and 2-dependent transport in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyman et al., 2009</xref>). Ciliobrevins have been used as tools to examine the role of dynein in a number of processes, including formation of the immunological synapse, transport of signaling proteins in the primary cilium, axonal transport of transcription factors, and axon extension and branching in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sainath and Gallo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). However, the use of ciliobrevins has been limited by their low potency and suboptimal chemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roossien et al., 2015</xref>), which is often noted for first-in-class compounds identified through high-throughput screening. Complete inhibition of dynein by ciliobrevins can require high doses (50–100 µM) and selective protein target inhibition can be difficult to achieve at such concentrations.</p><p>The ciliobrevins are based on a benzoylacrylonitrile-substituted quinazolinone scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This type of acrylonitrile has the potential to react with nucleophiles, and instability of ciliobrevins during storage has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sainath and Gallo, 2015</xref>). The benzoylacrylonitrile core is required for in vitro and cellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See et al., 2016</xref>). This functional group has the potential to isomerize, and the ciliobrevin scaffold may exist as either of two isomers about the benzoylacrylonitrile olefin (C2 - C9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The preferred isomer of this compound has not been determined and chemical modification of the quinazolinone or acyl groups, even distal to the acrylonitrile functionality, has the potential to affect the geometry of the compound's core. Together, these factors have made activity-guided modifications to improve compound potency challenging. Further, up to ~100 fold differences in potency have been noted between biochemical and cell based assays (0.2 µM – 30 µM for ciliobrevin D), raising concerns about target specificity. Design and chemical synthesis of alternative scaffolds that address these limitations and retain activity against dynein are needed.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25174.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the conformation of the ciliobrevin scaffold.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>E</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> isomers about the C2-C9 bond of ciliobrevin D are shown.

Many AAA+ enzymes function as homohexameric arrays of identical AAA domains, and thus all six of the ATPase sites can be biochemically equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>). However, for dyneins, the six unique AAA domains reside on a single polypeptide and each can have a specialized role in motor protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter, 2013</xref>). In the case of dynein 1, four of the six AAA domains contain the residues necessary for nucleotide binding; of these, only AAA1 and AAA3 substantially contribute to ATP hydrolysis and have been shown to be required for microtubule motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter, 2013</xref>). Dynein’s ATPase activity is stimulated by interactions with microtubules and is thought to occur mainly at AAA1, while hydrolysis at AAA3 plays a regulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhabha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicholas et al., 2015a</xref>). Earlier work suggested that ciliobrevins are ATP-competitive inhibitors of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>), but it remains unclear which of the six AAA sites are modulated, adding to the challenges of inhibitor optimization.</p><p>Here, we characterize the conformation of ciliobrevins and design tricyclic pyrazoloquinazolinone derivatives that are more potent inhibitors of dynein. One derivative, which we name dynapyrazole-A inhibits dyneins 1 and 2 with similar potencies in vitro and in cellular assays. Biochemical analyses of this compound showed that while it inhibits the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of dynein, it does not potently block the microtubule-independent basal activity. This mode of activity is unlike that of the ciliobrevins, which inhibit both basal and microtubule-stimulated hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To design new analogs with improved properties, we analyzed the conformation of the ciliobrevin scaffold. For these studies, we first used X-ray crystallography. Efforts to crystallize ciliobrevin D were unsuccessful; however, compound <bold>1</bold>, a derivative with a 2-morpholinoethyl ether substitution, was synthesized using a previously described procedure and was found to readily crystallize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See et al., 2016</xref>). The X-ray data suggest that compound <bold>1</bold> exists as a single isomer with an <italic>E-</italic>olefin configuration of the C2-C9 double bond. The measured bond lengths are consistent with electrons in a π-system delocalized across the benzoylacrylonitrile core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The C2-C9 bond length (1.44 Å), which is longer than that of a typical olefin, indicates significant single bond character. The proximity between O11 and N1-H suggests that the ciliobrevin structure is stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen-bond between N1 and O11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). A closely related acylacrylonitrile-substituted quinazolinone was found to favor an alternative conformation, corresponding to a Z-olefin at C2-C9, that was also stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milokhov et al., 2013</xref>). All these data together indicate it is likely that the isomeric preference of the pharmacophore is sensitive to distal substitutions.</p><p>As crystal packing may impact conformation, we turned to NMR spectroscopy to analyze the structure of the ciliobrevin scaffold in solution. A one-dimensional NMR spectrum of ciliobrevin D showed a peak at 13.5 ppm, which could be assigned to a proton at one of the quinazolinone nitrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milokhov et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of this broad, downfield peak suggests that one exchangeable N-H proton is stabilized by a hydrogen-bonding interaction. A NOESY spectrum of ciliobrevin D revealed all the expected resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, we detected a coupling between the proton at 13.5 ppm and the proton at the 8-position of the quinazolinone, consistent with the proton at N1 being involved in hydrogen bonding. Together, these data suggest that ciliobrevin D has similar orientation in solution to that of <bold>1</bold> in the crystal, and the benzoylacrylonitile functional group favors an <italic>E</italic>-isomer configuration that is likely to be stabilized by hydrogen bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that replacing the benzoylacrylonitrile core with a heterocyclic scaffold that maintained the observed ciliobrevin geometry could lead to improved dynein inhibitors. We reasoned that a tricyclic scaffold could replace the non-covalent N1-H-O11 interaction and maintain the overall ciliobrevin pharmacophore. We envisioned replacing the C2-C9 olefin and C10 ketone in ciliobrevin with either a pyrrole or pyrazole ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We adapted established procedures to synthesize <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, which differ from known compounds only in the substitution pattern of the D ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Süsse and Johne, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orvieto et al., 2009</xref>). We also devised a synthetic route to a series of tricyclic analogs exemplified by <bold>4</bold>. This synthesis relies on the condensation of a 2-fluorobenzoic acid methyl ester with a 4-cyano-aminopyrazole under basic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We first focused on human cytoplasmic dynein 2, the isoform involved in ciliary transport and Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>), as its inhibition in this assay by ciliobrevin D has not been previously demonstrated. We purified an N-terminally GFP-tagged motor-domain construct of dynein 2 using an insect cell expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). The GFP tag in this construct (GFP-dynein 2, amino acids 1091–4307) allowed the motor protein to be immobilized on passivated glass coverslips used in microtubule gliding assays. GFP-dynein 2 was obtained as a mono-disperse peak by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). In the presence of ATP (1 mM), this protein moved microtubules with a velocity of 128 ± 14 nm/s (mean ± SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and I</xref>). This activity is readily revealed by a time-series montage, which shows a fluorescently labeled microtubule being displaced ~3 µm in 20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This rate is comparable to previous analyses of this construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). Ciliobrevin D (20 µM) reduced the microtubule gliding velocity to 83 ± 10 nm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and I</xref>), consistent with its inhibition of dynein-2-dependent processes in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ye et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We next tested compounds <bold>2–4</bold> at 20 µM. Compound <bold>2</bold> did not substantially change microtubule gliding velocity (126 ± 17 nm/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> inhibited dynein-2-driven gliding to a velocity comparable to that observed in the presence of ciliobrevin D at this same concentration.</p><p>To improve the potency of compound <bold>4</bold>, we compared its structure with that of ciliobrevin derivative compound <bold>1</bold>. In particular, we superimposed the crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> with an energy-minimized structure of <bold>4</bold> computationally generated using Maestro (Schrödinger). This analysis revealed that the dichlorophenyl D ring of <bold>4</bold> projects from the pyrazoloquinazolinone core such that it is offset from the D ring of ciliobrevin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We reasoned that adding a single carbon atom between the pyrazoloquinazolinone and the phenyl ring may lead to closer alignment with ciliobrevin and that using a cyclopropyl spacer would restrict rotation of the resulting scaffold. Using our modular synthesis strategy for pyrazoloquinazolinones, we generated a set of ciliobrevin derivatives with a cyclopropyl group separating the aromatic ring systems (<bold>5–8</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Three of these compounds had substitutions at the 6-position of the quinazolinone (<bold>6</bold>, <bold>7</bold>, and <bold>8</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a modification that we have previously reported to improve the potencies of ciliobrevins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>).

Compound <bold>8</bold>, with a 6-iodo substituent at the A ring, showed comparable activity to <bold>6</bold> (6 ± 2 nm/s). For the two most active compounds (<bold>6</bold> and <bold>8</bold>) as well as ciliobrevin D, we performed dose-dependent analyses.

In cell culture, serum starvation results in the formation of primary cilia, which are required for Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Quiescent cells respond to the Hedgehog ligand or to a synthetic agonist and pathway activity can be measured using a Gli-driven luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taipale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>).

Cell death was observed at concentrations 10-fold above the IC<sub>50</sub> for dynapyrazole-A (20 µM) over the 28 hr time course of this experiment. In this assay, we have also observed cell death at high ciliobrevin D concentrations (200 µM,~10x above its IC<sub>50</sub>). To stimulate Hedgehog pathway activity, we used the synthetic agonist of smoothened (SAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), which competes with many known Hedgehog pathway inhibitors for binding to Smoothened, a key protein in this signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharpe et al., 2015</xref>). As dynapyrazole-A inhibits Hedgehog signaling at high SAG concentrations (500 nM), it is likely to act downstream of Smoothened, as was previously noted for ciliobrevins and consistent with inhibition of dynein 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Hedgehog signaling pathway depends on dynein-2-driven retrograde intraflagellar transport in the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>).

Previous analyses of the effect of dynein 2 inhibition using a temperature-sensitive mutant in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> revealed that dynein 2 depletion causes a ~60–70% reduction in retrograde velocities and a ~20% reduction in anterograde velocities as well as 30–60% reductions in the frequency of particle transport in both directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engel et al., 2012</xref>). Under control conditions (0.3% DMSO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), anterograde particles moved with a speed of 694 ± 117 nm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>, mean ± S.D., 429 particles, 38 cilia) and retrograde particles moved at 421 ± 156 nm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>, 244 particles, 38 cilia), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). Following addition of dynapyrazole-A to cells, the speed of retrograde particles was markedly reduced at five minutes, the fastest reliable time line for this experiment on our microscopy set-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E and F</xref>; 5 µM compound <bold>8</bold>: mean velocity 156 ± 107 nm/s, 211 particles, 52 cilia). In contrast, anterograde particle velocities were only reduced by ~18% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E and F</xref>, 5 µM <bold>8</bold>: 566 ± 116 nm/s, 443 particles, 52 cilia). After 10 min of treatment, reductions in velocities were similar to those at the 5 min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Treatment of cilia with a higher dynapyrazole-A concentration (10 µM) slowed both retrograde- and anterograde-directed motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Again, retrograde motion was more strongly inhibited. Dynapyrazole-A treatment (5 µM and 10 µM) also reduced the frequency, that is, the number of particles moving across a cilium per minute, in both anterograde and retrograde directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We note that dynapyrazole-A, at concentrations close to the IC<sub>50</sub> for inhibiting microtubule gliding in vitro, alters intraflagellar transport in a manner similar to what has been observed following dynein 2 loss-of-function in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether inhibition of intraflagellar transport by dynapyrazole-A was reversed following washout of the compound. Ciliated cells treated with dynapyrazole-A (5 µM compound <bold>8</bold>, 5 min) were transferred to solvent-control media with serum (0.3% DMSO, 10% FBS) and incubated for an additional 10 min. Both retrograde and anterograde velocities recovered to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>,velocities following washout: retrograde: 467 ± 136 nm/s, 173 particles, 18 cilia; anterograde: 697 ± 149 nm/s, 256 particles, 18 cilia) as did transport frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). When media with a lower serum concentration was used in washout experiments, retrograde velocities recovered only partially, suggesting that serum may accelerate the partitioning of this compound out of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest dynapyrazole-A is likely to be a useful reversible probe to study intraflagellar transport.</p><p>We predicted that dynapyrazole-A, like ciliobrevin D, should also inhibit cytoplasmic dynein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See et al., 2016</xref>). To examine the inhibition of dynein 1 by dynapyrazole-A in vitro we generated recombinant human protein. We expressed and purified a GFP-tagged human dynein 1 (AA 1320–4646) construct similar to the one we used for GFP-dynein 2. This protein migrated with a peak elution volume of 12.6 mL in size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis showed &gt;90% purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). GFP-dynein 1 moves microtubules at 508 ± 60 nm/s (n = 5 independent experiments, 191 microtubules analyzed), a velocity expected based on studies of other mammalian dynein 1 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>). Under these conditions, ~97% of the filaments analyzed had velocities &gt;50 nm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Montages showed that both ciliobrevin D and dynapyrazole-A slowed dynein-dependent microtubule gliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Dose-dependent analysis indicated that dynapyrazole-A blocked GFP-dynein-1-driven motility with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.3 ± 1.4 µM,~6-fold more potently than ciliobrevin D (15 ± 2.9 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Inhibition of dynein-1-dependent microtubule gliding by dynapyrazole-A was reversed following washout, as is also the case for dynein-2-dependent motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). As has been previously noted for ciliobrevin D, the potency of dynapyrazole-A was sensitive to the protein (e.g. blocking agent, serum) concentration in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), likely due to the hydrophobicity of these compounds (calculated logarithm of octanol:water partition coefficient [ClogP]: ciliobrevin D: 4.5; dynapyrazole-A: 4.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore focused our cell-based analyses of dynapyrazole-A on dynein-1-dependent processes in assays that do not require high serum concentrations.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25174.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of dynein 1 activity by dynapyrazole-A (compound <bold>8</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gel filtration trace (Superose 6) for GFP-dynein 1, with volume at elution peak indicated. <italic>V</italic><sub>o</sub>, void volume.

A coupling between anterograde and retrograde motion has been described for membrane-bound organelles, with disruption of dynein-driven motion blocking bi-directional organelle motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>). We imaged control solvent (0.1% DMSO) treated cells and observed bidirectional motion of LysoTracker-labelled puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,H,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Overlays of successive images from a time-lapse series, color-coded for displacement, reveal organelle displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>). Quantitative analysis using kymographs shows that ~20% of particles move at speeds below 25 nm/s in both anterograde and retrograde directions under control conditions and a similar fraction of particles have velocities above 250 nm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and N</xref>). Treatment with dynapyrazole-A suppressed bidirectional motion. In particular, the percentage of retrograde-directed lysosomes moving slower than 25 nm/s increased to ~47% (3.5µM) and ~59% (5µM) while the proportion of lysosomes moving at speeds &gt; 250 nm/s decreased to below 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N)</xref>. We observed equivalent effects of dynapyrazole-A on anterograde motion velocities (kymographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,L and M</xref>). In control cells, lysosomes with measureable displacements had trajectories that averaged 32 ± 11 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>). Dynapyrazole-A (3.5 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and L</xref>) reduced the average track length of moving particles to 15.7 ± 4.7 µm, which can be seen as white punctae that result from the overlay of multiple color-coded frames without particle translocation. A higher dose of dynapyrazole-A 5 µM) shortened the average track length of moving particles to 6.7 ± 2.7 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,M,O</xref>).

Therefore, to dissect the mechanism of inhibition of dynein by dynapyrazole-A, we focused on this isoform. The basal ATPase activity of GFP-dynein was 0.62 ± 0.2 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, n = 8 , mean ± S.D.). We also purified an N-terminally polyhistidine (His)-tagged dynein motor domain construct (AA 1320–4646) that was routinely obtained in five-fold higher yield than the GFP-tagged construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Following a three-step purification protocol, we obtained this protein with &gt;80% purity. The specific activity of His-dynein 1 (0.66 ± 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup>, n = 11, mean ± S.D. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) was similar to that of GFP-dynein. The basal ATPase rates of these human dynein constructs were within the range observed by others for mammalian dyneins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shpetner et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ori-McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicholas et al., 2015b</xref>). We examined the inhibition of dynein 1’s ATPase activity by dynapyrazole-A. Remarkably, a high concentration of dynapyrazole-A (40 µM) did not inhibit the basal ATPase activity of GFP-dynein 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and only partially inhibited His-dynein 1 (~30% inhibition <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Under similar conditions, ciliobrevin D (40 µM) inhibited the ATPase activity of both GFP-dynein 1 and His-dynein 1 by ~70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). The rather modest inhibition of dynein's ATPase activity by dynapyrazole-A was unexpected, as dynapyrazole-A can inhibit microtubule gliding at a 20-fold lower concentration.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25174.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the mechanism of dynein inhibition by dynapyrazole-A (compound <bold>8</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Basal ATPase activity of GFP-dynein in the solvent control (2% DMSO, n = 8) and in the presence of <bold>8</bold> (40µM, n = 4) and ciliobrevin D (40 µM, n = 4). (<bold>B</bold>) SDS-PAGE analysis (Coomassie blue stain) of His-dynein 1, ~0.5 µg protein loaded.

We find that human dynein’s ATP hydrolysis rate is stimulated in a microtubule concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, 2.5 µM: 1.2 ± 0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>, n = 3; 8 µM: 1.5 ± 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup>, n = 4; 15 µM: 2.2 ± 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup>, n = 4). Dynapyrazole-A (30 µM) inhibited the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity to a residual rate of ~0.5 s<sup>−1</sup> (8 or 15 µM microtubules, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Dose-dependent analysis was carried out at a microtubule concentration (2.5 µM) that gave two-fold stimulation of dynein. At increasing concentrations of dynapyrazole-A dynein’s microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity saturated at ~0.5 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Fitting to this non-zero plateau value gave an IC<sub>50</sub> of dynapyrazole-A of 6.2 ± 1.6 µM. In comparison, dose-dependent inhibition of dynein 1’s microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity by ciliobrevin D did not reveal a plateau up to the highest concentrations the compound remained soluble in these assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To better understand how dynapyrazole-A inhibits dynein activity, we monitored its effect on ADP-vanadate-dependent photocleavage of dynein. In this assay, an established read-out of nucleotide binding at dynein's AAA1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee-Eiford et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kon et al., 2004</xref>), ultraviolet irradiation leads to ADP-vanadate-dependent photocleavage of dynein at the AAA1 site, resulting in two protein fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibbons and Gibbons, 1987</xref>). Using His-dynein 1, 100 µM ATP, and 100 µM vanadate, we observed 42 ± 3% photocleavage (n = 3) of His-dynein 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>) and fragments consistent with cleavage at AAA1. At a dynapyrazole-A concentration near its IC<sub>50</sub> for in vitro dynein inhibition (4 µM), ADP-vanadate dependent photocleavage of dynein was reduced ~2.5-fold relative to controls (17 ± 2% photocleavage, n = 3). These data are consistent with dynapyrazole-A binding at the AAA1 site.</p><p>To further dissect how dynein is inhibited by dynapyrazole, we expressed and purified a construct with a Walker A lysine-to-alanine substitution at AAA3 (K2601A), a mutation that disrupts nucleotide binding at AAA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Silvanovich et al., 2003</xref>). We found that the mutant protein eluted during size exclusion chromatography with a major peak at a similar elution volume to that for the wild-type construct (12.4 mL for the mutant, 12.2 mL for wild-type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>), suggesting that the mutations do not disrupt overall protein folding. We also purified a comparable AAA1 (K1912A) mutant, but this protein had ~80–90% reduced ATPase activity, making analysis of its ATPase activity difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that the AAA3 mutant had basal activity that was elevated relative to wild-type (1.1 ± 0.2 s<sup>−1</sup>, n = 5), as has been previously shown for yeast dynein with a similar mutation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWitt et al., 2015</xref>). The ATPase activity of this mutant was stimulated by microtubules to 1.5 s<sup>−1</sup> (3 µM microtubules) and 1.7 s<sup>−1</sup> (11.5 µM microtubules) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). The reduced microtubule stimulation of the ATPase activity is consistent with findings for comparable dynein constructs from other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kon et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Across the range of microtubule concentrations tested, dynapyrazole-A (30µM) reduced the AAA3 mutant dynein’s ATPase activity by 70–80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Surprisingly, unlike what we observed for the wild-type protein, strong inhibition of the basal activity of this mutant construct was also observed (~70% inhibition; 30 µM dynapyrazole-A). A dose-dependent analysis showed that dynapyrazole-A inhibits the basal activity of the AAA3 mutant with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.5 ± 1.6 µM, while ciliobrevin D has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 38 ± 6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Even in the context of the AAA3 mutant enzyme, a residual ATPase activity of ~0.2 s<sup>−1</sup> was observed at the highest dynapyrazole-A concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). It is noteworthy that dynapyrazole-A inhibits basal activity of the AAA3 mutant and the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of the wild-type enzyme with similar potency, suggesting that a common ATPase site, likely AAA1, might be inhibited in both contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we analyzed the structure of the ciliobrevins and designed tricyclic derivatives in which the benzoylacrylonitrile of ciliobrevin was replaced with a cyanopyrazole. These compounds inhibited dynein in vitro and in cells more potently than ciliobrevins and have improved chemical properties. We also find that dynapyrazole-A inhibits dynein by a mechanism that is distinct from that of ciliobrevins.</p><p>The pyrazoloquinazolinone scaffold of the dynapyrazoles addresses many of the limitations of the ciliobrevins. First, activated acrylonitriles, such as the benzoylacrylonitrile at the core of the ciliobrevin scaffold, have been shown to be susceptible to attack by intracellular nucleophiles, raising the possibility of unwanted reactivity of these dynein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serafimova et al., 2012</xref>). While ciliobrevins have been observed to be unstable under standard laboratory storage conditions, the pyrazoloquinazolinone of the dynapyrazoles is unlikely to be reactive or unstable but retains many of the electrostatic and steric elements present in ciliobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sainath and Gallo, 2015</xref>). Second, the potency of dynapyrazole-A is similar across in vitro and cell-based assays, consistent with dynein being its cellular target. This was not consistently observed for ciliobrevin analogs. Dynapyrazole-A and -B inhibited dynein-dependent microtubule gliding six- to eight-fold more potently than ciliobrevins; however, different mechanisms of inhibition make it difficult to relate this change in potency directly to an increased binding affinity. Third, the ciliobrevin scaffold is present in chemical screening libraries and a close derivative has annotated anti-malarial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pillai et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, to our knowledge, the aryl-substituted or cyclopropyl-phenyl-substituted cyano-pyrazoloquinazolinone structure of compounds <bold>4-8</bold> has not previously been reported in a bioactive compound. The hydrophobicity of the dynapyrazoles remains a limitation that needs to be addressed. We note that the high ClogP value of dynapyrazole-A, which is similar to that of ciliobrevins, may explain why this compound, like ciliobrevin D, has reduced activity in the presence of high protein concentrations (e.g. serum). Likewise, acute reversal of intraflagellar transport inhibition was most effective using cell culture medium with serum. We believe that the dynapyrazole scaffold will be valuable for further optimization of these chemical probes.</p><p>In current models, the motion of membrane-bound organelles requires a balance of motors moving toward microtubule plus- and minus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>). Studies of different organelles across several cell types have established that depletion or inhibition of dynein reduces bidirectional organelle motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Waterman-Storer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 1999</xref>). Remarkably, organelle motion following dynein depletion can be restored by add-back of a minus-end directed kinesin, suggesting that micromechanical coupling is involved and an opposing force is needed to activate directional motion of the motor proteins that drive the directional motion of these cellular cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ally et al., 2009</xref>). These observations provide a plausible explanation for the bi-directional inhibition of lysosome motility upon dynapyrazole-A treatment. Although the individual cargos in the cilium are not likely membrane-bound, this intracellular transport is no less complex than organelle movement in the bulk cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prevo et al., 2017</xref>). We believe that dynapyrazole-A will be a useful tool to dissect how the length and shape of the cilium is linked to directional transport and to tease apart the contributions of active transport and passive diffusion of proteins that participate in Hedgehog signaling.</p><p>Dynapyrazole-A blocks both dynein 1 and dynein 2. As dynein 1 plays a critical role in numerous cellular processes, its persistent inhibition is expected to be toxic to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, acute inhibition may be useful in deciphering dynein function in different contexts. Can dynapyrazoles be chemically modified to develop inhibitors that are selective for dynein 1 or 2? Previously, we found that modest selectivity for inhibition of dynein 2 relative to dynein 1 can be achieved under certain conditions ([ATP] &lt;1 µM) by appending tolyl ethers at the 7-position of the ciliobrevin quinazolinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See et al., 2016</xref>). However, inhibition of dynein's ATPase activity by these ciliobrevin analogs is suppressed at higher ATP concentrations (e.g. 100 µM) in vitro. Studies of mammalian dynein 1 indicate that there are two ATP-binding sites with K<sub>m</sub> values separated by two orders of magnitude (~2 µM and ~600 µM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ross et al., 2006</xref>]). It is possible that the observed selectivity is achieved by targeting the high-affinity ATPase site and therefore, at higher, close to physiologic ATP concentrations, the inhibition by these ciliobrevin analogs is suppressed. In contrast, dynapyrazoles inhibit dynein at high ATP concentrations (1 mM), consistent with a different mode of inhibition. Also, substitution of this compound with a methyl ether at the 6-position abrogated dynein inhibition. These data suggest that the selectivity gains observed from appending tolyl ethers to the ciliobrevin scaffold are unlikely to be applicable to dynapyrazoles and developing a dynein isoform-selective dynapyrazole derivative will require more extensive structure-activity relationship studies.</p><p>Of the six AAA sites in dynein, only mutations at AAA1 and AAA3 have been found to block motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kon et al., 2004</xref>). In current models, ATPase activity at AAA1 is linked to rigid-body movements of subdomains during individual steps of the motor protein along microtubule tracks, while nucleotide state at AAA3 modulates the activity at AAA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter, 2013</xref>). Three lines of evidence indicate that dynapyrazole-A targets the AAA1 site. First, dynapyrazole-A blocks ADP-vanadate-dependent photocleavage at site 1. Second, dynapyrazole-A inhibits the activity of a dynein 1 construct with a mutation in the AAA3 domain (Walker A lysine). In this construct, the ATPase activity is expected to be mainly due to the AAA1 site. Third, sequence comparisons indicate that the AAA1 sites in dynein 1 and 2 are highly conserved, while the other AAA sites are less conserved. In fact, the residues within 4 Å of the bound nucleotide in AAA1 are identical between dynein 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). This sequence similarity and our observation that dynapyrazole-A inhibits dynein 1 and 2 with comparable potency are consistent with a model in which this compound selectively inhibits hydrolysis of dynein’s AAA1 site. However, further biophysical and structural studies will be required to determine whether dynapyrazole-A binds at or near the AAA1 site.</p><p>Our finding that dynapyrazole-A does not potently inhibit ATP hydrolysis in the absence of microtubules suggests that, for dynein 1, the AAA1 site contributes to only a small fraction of this enzyme’s basal activity. We posit that a separate site, likely AAA3, accounts for the majority of dynein’s ATPase activity in the absence of microtubules. This site likely remains active even when ATPase activity at AAA1 is inhibited by dynapyrazoles. Currently, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional ATPase sites, such as AAA4, may also contribute partially to the basal ATPase activity of dynein. The nucleotide state at AAA3 is known to regulate the ATPase cycle of AAA1 when microtubules are present, with the apo- and ATP-bound states of AAA3 slowing overall hydrolysis and the ADP-bound state of AAA3 leading to rapid hydrolysis at AAA1 in wild-type dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhabha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWitt et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that the AAA3 mutant has elevated basal activity relative to the wild-type is consistent with the protein being in a state that mimics one in which hydrolysis at AAA1 is activated. Although additional biophysical studies are needed to analyze this further, dynapyrazole-A is likely to be useful as tool for chemical ‘separation of function’ to distinguish between dynein’s microtubule stimulated and basal activities in different contexts.</p><p>While restricting conformational flexibility of ligands is a well-established strategy for improving potency, its successful application typically depends on structural data that reveal the compound conformation required to bind its target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babine and Bender, 1997</xref>). In the case of the ciliobrevins, the geometric constraints we designed were guided by conformational analysis of the compounds alone and afforded ~6–8 fold improvement in potency. We note that replacement of a scaffold prone to isomerization with a fixed tricyclic pyrazoloquinazolinone did not lead directly to improved potency. Rather, incorporation of a cyclopropyl group into the dynapyrazole scaffold was required, likely by better matching the shape of the ciliobrevin pharmacophore. Our unexpected finding that conformational restriction led to changes both in potency and mechanism of inhibition raises the question of whether alternative scaffolds with different conformational constrains could reveal still other modes of dynein inhibition. More broadly, conformational restriction may be an effective strategy for improving the few AAA+ inhibitors described to date. Compounds with distinct mechanisms of action, which may result from these efforts, will be especially valuable for these multi-site enzymes whose activity is often regulated by intricate allosteric communication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical synthesis</title><p>General chemical methods: Solvents and reagents were purchased from VWR or Sigma Aldrich.

This analysis was performed for each direction of motion.</p><p>Quantification of ADP-vanadate dependent photocleavage of dynein was performed as follows: Scanned gels were analyzed with FIJI, and fraction cleaved quantified as follows:</p><p>Fraction cleaved = (intensity of band at 250 kDa) /</p><p>(intensity of band at 250 kDa + intensity of band at ~350 kDa)</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Professor Erwin Peterman and Dr. Pierre Mangeol for assistance with analysis of intraflagellar transport data.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wilfred van der Donk, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study presents optimization of the chemical properties and potency of ciliobrevins for inhibiting of the microtubule (MT)-associated motor protein, cytoplasmic dynein. Based on conformational analysis of ciliobrevin, the authors covalently locked the preferred conformation in a series of analogs. The final result is an inhibitor, which the authors coin &quot;dynapyrazole&quot;, with improved chemical properties and up-to 10-fold higher affinity. It appears to act differently than the parent compound in that it appears to be specific for the microtubule-induced activity and not the basal activity of dyneins. The amount of new biology learned appears modest and inconclusive, but if the essential revisions can be achieved, this work would benefit the field given the steadily increasing demand for understanding dynein function in cells and cilia. With good physiological analysis of dynapyrazole inhibition and reversibility, the paper could be very strong. Unless the questions in point 5 below can be addressed, the reviewers suggest this contribution to be a Tools and Resources paper with omission of the currently insufficiently supported mechanistic data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Physiological analysis is limited to axonal transport of lysosomes. There is much potential information in these experiments, but much of this is currently lacking. The multicolor time projections of lysosomal movement are visually confusing. The reader will understand that the change from multicolored to white implies inhibition, but important details are missing. The lysosomal &quot;displacements&quot; are very long on average, and probably represent a composite of multiple +, –, and stalled behavior. The direction of movement is at minimum important as a test of dynapyrazole specificity – does it affect MT minus end -directed runs alone? Although the challenges to address this are acknowledged, if dynapyrazole is fast acting and physiologically specific, it should show initial dramatic minus end inhibition. At present, bidirectional inhibition is not addressed, but whether it occurs or not, and whether it sets in with increasing time of drug treatment, are important issues to clarify for the cell biological reader/user. Stalls are also important to quantify as evidence for coordinate +/- inhibition, but also as an indicator of cellular toxicity. Kymographs are a much better way to show detailed motile behavior and should be featured. The nature of inhibition can also be better defined for the community that would be using the new compound. Ciliobrevin is said to be a substrate competitor. How was this determined? Similar analysis should be performed for the new compound. Competition analysis between CB, dynapyrazole, and ATP might be useful. In order to show the reversible effect of dynapyrazole, washout experiments should be performed in a physiological setting e. g., lysosome transport.</p><p>2) At many places in the manuscript the statistical analyses is either not clear or not sufficient. Legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F,G,H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A,C,D,E and H</xref>: For each measurement, the authors should list the number of data values they used to calculate the reported mean values and standard deviations. For example, in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, the authors write &quot;ciliobrevin D: 20 μM (19-21 μM), n = 2&quot;, which could suggest that the authors performed one experiment at 19 μM ciliobrevin D and another at 21 μM. If so, how many microtubules were tracked for the reported velocities? Solely listing the number of replicates (&quot;n&quot;) is not sufficient. Similarly, legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>: If the second of two replicates was poorly fit (n = 2), why wasn't the experiment repeated more often to confirm that the second replicate was an &quot;outlier&quot;? Results, tenth paragraph: Also here, the authors should indicate whether the given &quot;n = 7&quot; corresponds to the number of replicates or the number of measured velocities. Results, ninth paragraph: In the cell-based assays, one cannot say that compound 4 inhibited the Hedgehog pathway with reduced potency compared to dynapyrazole since the two are within experimental error with the high error on the data for 4 (5.2 +- 5 μM).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The application of 5 μM dynapyrazole causes a reduction of the &quot;run length&quot; of lysosomes from ~32 μm to ~7 μm. While the ~32-μm runs can be seen in the color-coded image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, the ~7 μm runs do not appear in the color-coded frames. While the authors write that the ~7 μm runs &quot;can be seen as white punctate that result from the overlay of multiple color-coded frames without particle translocation&quot;, a significant fraction of the ~7 μm runs, which are only slightly shorter than the 10 μm scale bar <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, should appear color-coded. It is therefore not clear to a reader why one cannot see the ~7 μm runs in the color-coded frames as colored. As mentioned above, kymographs are a better way to show detailed motile behavior.</p><p>4) The authors should address the following experimental concerns: The dynein preparations used for this analysis appear to be less than ideal. Single-headed recombinant dynein-1 and -2 motor domains are each used, though ATPase levels are only reported for dynein 1. However, the measured ATPase activity, especially in the presence of microtubules, is very low compared to native higher eukaryotic cytoplasmic dynein. This implies that a substantial fraction of the dynein may be inactive. The effects of ciliobrevin and dynapyrazole on dynein binding to MTs should also be evaluated and shown. It is possible that these compounds, or contaminants, might serve to oxidize dynein active site residues, and cause formation of dead-heads. MT gliding behavior also needs to be more thoroughly shown. The% of moving MTs and the distribution of velocities (histograms) should be provided.</p><p>5) The arguments that dynapyrazole targets the AAA1 site specifically are confusing and not well supported. This part of the study should be eliminated, unless it can be performed in a manner that provides conclusive insight in drug and motor mechanisms. If the authors want to keep their mechanistic interpretation, the following questions need to be addressed: Ciliobrevin effects on MT-stimulated ATPase activity should be included for proper comparison with dynpyrazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The effects of dynapyrazole on the MT-activated ATPase activity of the AAA3 K/A mutant need to be analyzed. Also, if the effects of dynapyrazole on the basic ATPase activity of the AAA3 K/A mutant are mediated by AAA1, then the statement that dynapyrazole has only an effect of dynein's MT-activated ATPase activity is not correct. The authors should therefore present the effects of dynapyrazole on the MT-activated ATPase activity of the AAA3 K/A mutant and discuss the effects of dynapyrazole on the basal vs. MT-activated ATPase activity. The effect of blocking ATP binding to AAA3 on dynein's MT-activated ATPase activity should also be analyzed. While it is possible that the AAA3 K/A mutation abolishes the MT-activated ATPase activity of dynein, the authors should at least present and discuss this data. Also, if it is indeed microtubule-stimulated activity in the AAA1 site that is inhibited by dynapyrazole, would one not expect to see complete inactivation then in the AAA3 mutant? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> still seems to show incomplete inhibition. In addition, if AAA1 contributes only a small fraction of the basal activity, why can AAA1 activity then contribute significantly to the basal activity in the AAA3 K/A mutant? The authors don't discuss the possibility that AAA4 contributes significantly to the basal ATPase rate of dynein. The authors should at least discuss this possibility.</p><p>6) Based on the reduction in the velocity of dynein-based MT gliding as a result of the reduction in the MT-stimulated ATPase activity of dynein, the application of dynapyrazole is expected to cause a reduction in the velocity of lysosome movement. Why isn't the effect of dynapyrazole on the velocity of lysosome movement reported? It would be highly interesting if differential effects on transport distance and velocity were found.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25174.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Physiological analysis is limited to axonal transport of lysosomes. There is much potential information in these experiments, but much of this is currently lacking. The multicolor time projections of lysosomal movement are visually confusing. The reader will understand that the change from multicolored to white implies inhibition, but important details are missing. The lysosomal &quot;displacements&quot; are very long on average, and probably represent a composite of multiple +, -, and stalled behavior. The direction of movement is at minimum important as a test of dynapyrazole specificity – does it affect MT minus end -directed runs alone? Although the challenges to address this are acknowledged, if dynapyrazole is fast acting and physiologically specific, it should show initial dramatic minus end inhibition. At present, bidirectional inhibition is not addressed, but whether it occurs or not, and whether it sets in with increasing time of drug treatment, are important issues to clarify for the cell biological reader/user. Stalls are also important to quantify as evidence for coordinate +/- inhibition, but also as an indicator of cellular toxicity. Kymographs are a much better way to show detailed motile behavior and should be featured. The nature of inhibition can also be better defined for the community that would be using the new compound. Ciliobrevin is said to be a substrate competitor. How was this determined? Similar analysis should be performed for the new compound. Competition analysis between CB, dynapyrazole, and ATP might be useful. In order to show the reversible effect of dynapyrazole, washout experiments should be performed in a physiological setting e. g., lysosome transport.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising all these different points. The changes we have made to address these concerns are:</p><p>A) Physiologic analysis: The physiologic analyses in the original submission included inhibition of lysosome motility and Hedgehog signaling. To address your concern, we have now obtained cell lines from the group of Dr. Max Nachury and with their guidance have done live-cell imaging of intraflagellar transport in living cells. To obtain the level of detailed analysis you requested (velocity distributions, frequencies) we used computer-based tracking algorithms. The findings are presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The benefit of studying the effect of dynapyrazole-A on intraflagellar transport is that a comparable study using temperature sensitive alleles of dynein 2 was available, which provided us a valuable reference point for the activity of our compound. Briefly, we find that inhibition of intraflagellar transport by dynapyrazole at a concentration near its IC<sub>50</sub> for dynein 2-driven microtubule gliding is very similar to that observed in a previous study of the effects of temperature-sensitive mutants of dynein 2 on intraflagellar transport in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (Engel et al., J. Cell Biol. 2012, 199 (1): 151-167 DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201206068, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>]). Specifically, the authors noted that a ~60% reduction in retrograde velocity upon transfer to the restrictive temperature was accompanied by a modest (~10-20% reduction) in anterograde velocity, values that closely match those we observed. Furthermore, particle frequencies were reduced by 30-60% in both directions, a change that mirrors the effect we observed upon dynapyrazole-A treatment. Based on these data we believe that dynapyrazole will be a valuable tool to examine how dynein-2 driven transport within the cilium is linked to its dynamic structure and functions.</p><p>B) Lysosome motility: As requested, we have added new kymograph analysis of lysosome motility. With these analyses, we now show how the distribution of lysosome velocities is affected by dynapyrazole-A treatment. The kymographs reveal bidirectional inhibition of lysosome movement following treatment with dynapyrazole-A. This finding is consistent with other analyses of organelle transport that indicate a biochemical and/or mechanical coupling between different motors on a single cargo. Multiple groups have studied the coupling between retrograde- and anterograde-directed motion of organelles in cells, tissue preparations, and living organisms and have consistently observed that depletion or inhibition of dynein motors leads to reduction in bidirectional motion (Gross et al., J. Cell Biol. 2002, 156 (4): 715, DOI: 10.1083/jcb.200109047, Martin et al., Mol. Biol. Cell, 1999 Vol. 10, 3717, doi: 10.1091/mbc.10.11.3717, Waterman-Storer et al., PNAS, 1997 Vol 94, No. 22, 12180, Ally et al., J. Cell Biol. 2009, 187 (7): 1071, DOI: 10.1083/jcb.200908075). We further note that the ciliobrevins caused bi-directional reduction in peroxisome motion (Firestone et al.,Nature 2012, Apr. Vol 484, 125-129. DOI: doi:10.1038/nature10936 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-E</xref>]). Additional analyses, at fast temporal resolution to uncover a transient or &quot;initial dramatic minus end inhibition&quot; would be interesting, but we hope that you agree this result is outside the scope of this current manuscript that now includes additional physiological analyses, i.e. analyses of intraflagellar transport.</p><p>To address your concern that this bidirectional inhibition may reflect general toxicity on this time scale, we have also examined if intracellular ATP concentrations are reduced under the conditions of the lysosome imaging experiments. ATP levels are unchanged over 3 hours at dynapyrazole-A concentrations (5µM) that inhibit lysosome transport. We observed toxicity at 3 hours at higher dynapyrazole-A concentrations (15µM), but we cannot exclude that this toxicity is a result of inhibition of dynein, which has roles in many vital cellular processes. These data are included in the revised manuscript and should help others with the use of these inhibitors in cellular contexts.</p><p>C) Inhibitor reversibility: As per your request, we have now examined reversibility of dynapyrazole-A treatment in cells. We observed full reversal of inhibition of retrograde intraflagellar transport following washout of dynapyrazole-A. We note that the reversibility was more efficient if we included serum in the cell culture medium, consistent with the hydrophobic nature of these compounds. The text clearly describes these observations.</p><p>D) Competition with nucleotide binding. You also raise the question about competition with ATP and in response, to further characterize the mode of inhibition by dynapyrazole-A in vitro, we now include new data analyzing ADP-vanadate-dependent photocleavage of dynein. We now show that dynein photocleavage, which has been shown to occur at AAA1, is inhibited by dynapyrazole-A treatment, consistent with inhibition of nucleotide binding at AAA1 of dynein. We note that the concentration of dynapyrazole-A necessary to block photocleavage of dynein (4µM) is ~40 times lower than was reported for ciliobrevin A (Firestone et al.,Nature 2012, Apr. Vol 484, 125-129. DOI: doi:10.1038/nature10936 [supplementary figure 15]).</p><p>We believe that with these additions, we have both improved the analysis of the physiologic activity of dynapyrazole-A and strengthened our mechanistic analysis of how this compound inhibits dynein. It is our sincere hope that the reviewers will agree.</p><p><italic>2) At many places in the manuscript the statistical analyses is either not clear or not sufficient. Legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F,G,H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A,C,D,E and H</xref>: For each measurement, the authors should list the number of data values they used to calculate the reported mean values and standard deviations. For example, in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, the authors write &quot;ciliobrevin D: 20 μM (19-21 μM), n = 2&quot;, which could suggest that the authors performed one experiment at 19 μM ciliobrevin D and another at 21 μM. If so, how many microtubules were tracked for the reported velocities? Solely listing the number of replicates (&quot;n&quot;) is not sufficient. Similarly, legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>: If the second of two replicates was poorly fit (n = 2), why wasn't the experiment repeated more often to confirm that the second replicate was an &quot;outlier&quot;? Results, tenth paragraph: Also here, the authors should indicate whether the given &quot;n = 7&quot; corresponds to the number of replicates or the number of measured velocities. Results, ninth paragraph: In the cell-based assays, one cannot say that compound 4 inhibited the Hedgehog pathway with reduced potency compared to dynapyrazole since the two are within experimental error with the high error on the data for 4 (5.2 +- 5 μM).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their careful attention to our data.</p><p>We have added the number of microtubules whose velocities we quantified and have clarified the replicate number at several locations.

In particular, the numbers 19 and 21 µM denote the range between two independent measurements of the IC<sub>50</sub> of dynein 2-driven gliding by ciliobrevin D that allowed us to obtain the average IC<sub>50</sub> value.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The application of 5 μM dynapyrazole causes a reduction of the &quot;run length&quot; of lysosomes from ~32 μm to ~7 μm. While the ~32-μm runs can be seen in the color-coded image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, the ~7 μm runs do not appear in the color-coded frames. While the authors write that the ~7 μm runs &quot;can be seen as white punctate that result from the overlay of multiple color-coded frames without particle translocation&quot;, a significant fraction of the ~7 μm runs, which are only slightly shorter than the 10 μm scale bar <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, should appear color-coded. It is therefore not clear to a reader why one cannot see the ~7 μm runs in the color-coded frames as colored. As mentioned above, kymographs are a better way to show detailed motile behavior.</italic></p><p>We acknowledge the reviewers' concerns regarding the manner in which we have presented our data. We agree with the reviewers’ suggestion that a kymograph is a more suitable way to display these data and have made this change. In the new analysis we have provided of lysosome motility, we have added representative kymographs and velocity distribution histograms. We also wish to clarify that the 7µm run value reported at 5µM dynapyrazole-A reflects the displacement of only those particles that did move, not a mean displacement value for all particles. Our data show that, at the 5µM dynapyrazole-A dose, ~60% of particles have a velocity of &lt;25 nm/s in both retrograde and anterograde directions.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should address the following experimental concerns: The dynein preparations used for this analysis appear to be less than ideal. Single-headed recombinant dynein-1 and -2 motor domains are each used, though ATPase levels are only reported for dynein 1. However, the measured ATPase activity, especially in the presence of microtubules, is very low compared to native higher eukaryotic cytoplasmic dynein. This implies that a substantial fraction of the dynein may be inactive. The effects of ciliobrevin and dynapyrazole on dynein binding to MTs should also be evaluated and shown. It is possible that these compounds, or contaminants, might serve to oxidize dynein active site residues, and cause formation of dead-heads. MT gliding behavior also needs to be more thoroughly shown. The% of moving MTs and the distribution of velocities (histograms) should be provided.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers' concerns regarding the protein activity we report. Respectfully, we believe that the confusion about protein hydrolysis activity may arise from the common practice of presenting the ATPase activity of dynein in units of nmol/min/mg protein. When converted to these units (molecular weight of the construct is ~400kDa), the basal ATPase activity of our single-headed dynein 1 construct is ~90nmol/min/mg protein (~0.6s<sup>-1</sup>), which is in line with the basal ATPase rates reported by others for both native and recombinant mammalian dyneins (Shpetner et al., bovine dynein: ~40 nmol/mg/min, J Cell Biol. 1988 Sep;107(3):1001-9. [Figure 1A]; Nicholas et al., rat dynein ~6 s<sup>-1</sup> (per dimer), Nat Commun. 2015 Feb 11;6:6206 [Supplementary Figures 2A, 2B]; Ori-McKenney et al., mouse dynein, ~50 nmol/mg/min, Nat Cell Biol. 2010 Dec;12(12):1228-34 [Figure 1C]). We note that the ATPase activity observed here is lower than those observed in dyneins from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and, especially, from <italic>D. Discoideum</italic>. We observe modest stimulation (~2 fold) at 2.5µM microtubules, and have now added data showing that we observe up to 5-fold stimulation of ATPase activity at higher microtubule concentrations (20µM), which is within the 2- to 6-fold range of stimulation observed at high microtubule concentrations for rat, cow, and mouse dynein 1 constructs (Ori-McKenney et al., Figure 1C, Shpetner et al., Figure 1A, Nicholas et al., Supplementary Figure 2B). Therefore, we believe, and hope you agree, that the basal and microtubule-stimulated activities we report are in line with the range of activities reported by others for mammalian dyneins.</p><p>In addition, to address your concerns, we have added a deeper analysis of microtubule velocity. As requested, we now show histograms showing microtubule velocity in the DMSO controls as well as in the presence of a range of concentrations of dynapyrazole-A. We note that the fraction of stopped or very slow microtubules is low for both dynein isoforms tested.</p><p>We have also added an analysis of the effect of dynapyrazole-A on microtubule number in the dynein-driven microtubule gliding assays, which can be used as a readout of dynein-microtubule affinity. We observe that the effect of dynapyrazole-A on coverslip microtubule number is different for each dynein isoform: a marked reduction is noted for dynein 2, while a slight increase is noted for dynein 1. As dynapyrazole-A disrupts nucleotide binding to AAA1, which itself is critical for regulating dynein-microtubule affinity, it is not surprising that compound treatment affects this affinity. Dissecting the differences that lead to a divergent effect of dynapyrazole on the dynein 2-microtubule interaction compared to the dynein 1-microtubule interaction will require careful biophysical analysis that we hope you agree is outside the scope of this study. As we have noted in the manuscript, we focused on our detailed biochemical analyses on dynein 1, the better characterized isoform.</p><p><italic>5) The arguments that dynapyrazole targets the AAA1 site specifically are confusing and not well supported. This part of the study should be eliminated, unless it can be performed in a manner that provides conclusive insight in drug and motor mechanisms. If the authors want to keep their mechanistic interpretation, the following questions need to be addressed: Ciliobrevin effects on MT-stimulated ATPase activity should be included for proper comparison with dynpyrazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The effects of dynapyrazole on the MT-activated ATPase activity of the AAA3 K/A mutant need to be analyzed. Also, if the effects of dynapyrazole on the basic ATPase activity of the AAA3 K/A mutant are mediated by AAA1, then the statement that dynapyrazole has only an effect of dynein's MT-activated ATPase activity is not correct. The authors should therefore present the effects of dynapyrazole on the MT-activated ATPase activity of the AAA3 K/A mutant and discuss the effects of dynapyrazole on the basal vs. MT-activated ATPase activity. The effect of blocking ATP binding to AAA3 on dynein's MT-activated ATPase activity should also be analyzed. While it is possible that the AAA3 K/A mutation abolishes the MT-activated ATPase activity of dynein, the authors should at least present and discuss this data. Also, if it is indeed microtubule-stimulated activity in the AAA1 site that is inhibited by dynapyrazole, would one not expect to see complete inactivation then in the AAA3 mutant? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> still seems to show incomplete inhibition. In addition, if AAA1 contributes only a small fraction of the basal activity, why can AAA1 activity then contribute significantly to the basal activity in the AAA3 K/A mutant? The authors don't discuss the possibility that AAA4 contributes significantly to the basal ATPase rate of dynein. The authors should at least discuss this possibility.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive suggestions regarding our mechanistic analysis. We now include analysis of ADP-vanadate-dependent photocleavage of dynein, which sheds light on the mechanism dynein inhibition by dynapyrazole-A. We show that dynein photocleavage, which has been shown to occur at AAA1, is inhibited by dynapyrazole-A treatment, consistent with inhibition of nucleotide binding at AAA1 of dynein. The concentration of dynapyrazole-A necessary to block photocleavage of dynein (4µM) is ~40 times lower than was reported for ciliobrevin A (Firestone et al).</p><p>We have added many of the other analyses requested. We now show the effect of ciliobrevin D on the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of dynein, which reveals inhibition to ~40% residual activity at the highest concentration tested (40µM), with no saturation of the inhibitory effect observed. We compare the potencies of inhibition of the basal ATPase activity of the AAA3 mutant of dynein by ciliobrevin D and dynapyrazole-A and show that the new compound is ~8-fold more potent in this setting. We show that the AAA3 mutant of dynein is stimulated by microtubules, but to a lesser degree than observed for the wild-type enzyme, consistent with analyses of comparable mutants by others (Kon et al., Biochemistry. 2004 Sep 7;43(35):11266-74, [Table 1]). We show that dynapyrazole-A suppresses microtubule stimulation of both the wild-type and AAA3 mutant enzymes across a broader range of microtubule concentrations.</p><p>The new data we present support our previous assertion that dynapyrazole-A primarily blocks the microtubule-stimulated component of dynein’s ATPase activity while ciliobrevin D inhibits the basal and microtubule-stimulated activities of dynein. When taken together with the inhibition of ADP-vanadate-dependent photocleavage at AAA1 of dynein by low concentrations of dynapyrazole-A, we believe that our data now show more clearly that (A) dynapyrazole-A blocks ATP hydrolysis at AAA1, (B) dynapyrazole-A only weakly inhibits basal ATPase activity, (C) dynapyrazole-A strongly inhibits microtubule-stimulated hydrolysis by dynein. We believe these observations are best explained by a model in which AAA1 contributes minimally to the basal ATPase activity of dynein and contributes significantly (and in a microtubule concentration-dependent manner) to the microtubule-stimulated activity of dynein. In this model, inhibition by dynapyrazole-A of AAA1 only would be expected to give results consistent with those we observe. We have attempted to clarify the writing describing our conclusions.</p><p>The reviewers asked: “if AAA1 contributes only a small fraction of the basal activity, why can AAA1 activity then contribute significantly to the basal activity in the AAA3 K/A mutant?” In current models nucleotide occupancy within one ATPase sites of dynein regulates that at other sites. Thus, in the AAA3 mutant, this site is not only impaired in its own nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, but also its APO-like nucleotide state may be sensed and transmitted to other AAA sites, leading to their activation. We note in the manuscript that others have observed comparable and seemingly counterintuitive <italic>stimulation</italic> of dynein’s basal rate in constructs with a similar AAA3 walker A lysine-to-alanine mutation. We have added the following statement to the manuscript in the attempt to clarify our reasoning. “Our finding that the AAA3 mutant has elevated basal activity relative to the wild-type is consistent with the protein being in a state that mimics one in which hydrolysis at AAA1 is activated.”</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion that another site (likely AAA4) might also contribute hydrolysis activity in the setting of the AAA3 mutant. Our newly-added microtubule stimulation data for the AAA3 mutant further support this conclusion, and we have revised the text accordingly.</p><p><italic>6) Based on the reduction in the velocity of dynein-based MT gliding as a result of the reduction in the MT-stimulated ATPase activity of dynein, the application of dynapyrazole is expected to cause a reduction in the velocity of lysosome movement. Why isn't the effect of dynapyrazole on the velocity of lysosome movement reported? It would be highly interesting if differential effects on transport distance and velocity were found.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers' enthusiasm for the potential for dynapyrazole to illuminate the roles of dynein-driven motion in a cellular context. As mentioned above, we have included an expanded analysis of lysosome motility as well as a new analysis of intraflagellar transport. We demonstrate a reduction in the velocities of moving lysosomes in addition to the track shortening previously shown. We also now show that dynapyrazole causes reversible inhibition of intraflagellar transport.</p></body></sub-article></article>
