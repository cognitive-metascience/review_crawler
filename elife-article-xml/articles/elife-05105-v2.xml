observed across mammalian species, however, the underlying mechanisms driving these rhythms are unknown. We show that disruption of the dopamine transporter gene lengthens the period of ultradian locomotor rhythms in mice. Period lengthening also results from chemogenetic activation of midbrain dopamine neurons and psychostimulant treatment, while the antipsychotic haloperidol has the opposite effect. We further reveal that striatal dopamine levels fluctuate in synchrony with ultradian activity cycles and that dopaminergic tone strongly predicts ultradian period. Our data indicate that an arousal regulating, dopaminergic ultradian oscillator (DUO) operates in the mammalian brain, which normally cycles in harmony with the circadian clock, but can desynchronize when dopamine tone is elevated, thereby producing aberrant patterns of arousal which are strikingly similar to perturbed sleep-wake cycles comorbid with psychopathology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05105.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05105.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05105.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The sleep-wake cycle of mammals is controlled by a ‘circadian clock’ within the brain, which is synchronized to the day–night cycle. However, other aspects of mammalian physiology including alertness and activity levels, as well as appetite and body temperature—fluctuate in cycles that repeat every few hours. These cycles are known as ultradian rhythms, and they may offer survival benefits by enabling potentially risky behaviors, such as foraging, to be coordinated between members of a group.</p><p>Despite their widespread nature and the fact that they appear to be conserved in evolution, virtually nothing is known about the molecular basis of ultradian rhythms. Blum et al. have now identified a second internal clock within the brain, which they name ‘the DUO’, and shown that this clock normally works in concert with the circadian clock to regulate daily patterns of activity and alertness.</p><p>Experiments in mice revealed that the DUO uses the brain chemical dopamine to generate bursts of activity roughly every four hours. Moreover, it continues to work when the circadian clock has been destroyed. Measurements of dopamine in freely moving mice showed that levels of the chemical fluctuate in synchrony with the animals' activity levels. Moreover, drugs that flood the brain with dopamine, such as methamphetamine, disrupt the 4-hour cycle by lengthening the period between bursts of activity, whereas drugs that block dopamine receptors have the opposite effect.</p><p>As well as revealing a mechanism by which the brain coordinates processes that repeat several times per day, the identification of the DUO could also provide insights into the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. Conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are often accompanied by disturbances in patterns of activity and rest. While these have previously been attributed to the disruption of circadian rhythms, there is little direct evidence for this, which raises the possibility that these changes might instead reflect the disruption of ultradian rhythms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05105.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05105.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chronobiology</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>ultradian</kwd><kwd>oscillator</kwd><kwd>dopamine transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating Grants</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name><name><surname>Storch</surname><given-names>Kai-Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storch</surname><given-names>Kai-Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Graham Boeckh Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graham Boeckh Chair in Schizophrenia</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giros</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storch</surname><given-names>Kai-Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Research Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giros</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An internal clock based on brain levels of dopamine works with the circadian clock to maintain daily patterns of alertness and activity, and may be implicated in the altered behavioral patterns seen in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ultradian rhythms with periods ranging from one to several hours have been linked to various aspects of mammalian physiology. Usually superimposed on the 24-hr diurnal or circadian rhythm, ultradian oscillations have been observed in the context of locomotion, sleep, feeding, body temperature, serum hormones, and brain monoamines in species ranging from fruit flies to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tannenbaum and Martin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ibuka et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rusak, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daan and Slopsema, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honma and Hiroshige, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dowse et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rivkees, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Oort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dowse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seki and Tanimura, 2014</xref>). These physiological cycles most frequently exhibit periods of 2–6 hr, adopting harmonics of the 24-hr daily light–dark cycle or the endogenous circadian rhythm, when external timing cues are absent. However, the generation of such ultradian rhythms does not depend on a functional circadian system nor a light:dark cycle. Ultradian locomotor oscillations persist in rodents housed in constant darkness even upon ablation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the master circadian pacemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ibuka et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rusak, 1977</xref>), or genetic disruption of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vitaterna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). These ultradian activity cycles may not simply be driven by metabolic demand since the 2- to 3-hr rhythm in foraging activity observed in the common vole persists even in the absence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerkema and van der Leest, 1991</xref>). Studies in this species further indicate that one adaptive value of ultradian activity rhythms may lie in the facilitation of social synchrony, which is suggested to reduce predator risk in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerkema and Verhulst, 1990</xref>). However, despite their prevalence and hypothesized biological significance, ultradian locomotor rhythms have received little research attention, likely owing to their frequently masked expression and unstable periodicity in contrast with circadian activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schibler, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05105.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inter- and intra-animal variability of ultradian activity rhythms across time in circadian incompetent mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative double-plotted actograms of running wheel activity in SCN-lesioned (SCNx) and <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice in DD.

When provided in the drinking water, methamphetamines (Meth) induce a daily activity bout in addition to the expected circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honma et al., 1986</xref>). This Meth-dependent component—which typically adopts a period in the circadian range—is not abolished upon SCN lesion nor by genetic disruption of circadian clock function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honma et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohawk et al., 2009</xref>). It was thus concluded that a methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) outside the SCN exists which is capable of driving daily cycles of locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tataroglu et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the longstanding recognition of ultradian and Meth-dependent rhythms, the underlying cellular and molecular identity of the oscillator(s) driving them is unknown.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence for a highly tunable dopaminergic ultradian oscillator (DUO) which is continuously operative in the mammalian brain and which, together with the circadian clock, orchestrates the daily pattern of arousal. Our data suggest that dopamine acts as both the principal oscillator output as well as an integral component of the DUO, determining oscillator period. Our findings further indicate that the previously described MASCO represents a long-period manifestation of the DUO resulting from elevated dopamine tone. Importantly, our data support an intriguing proposition: that DUO, rather than circadian clock, dysregulation critically contributes to the sleep-wake abnormalities associated with psychopathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dopamine transporter deficiency results in ultradian locomotor period lengthening</title><p>To gain insights into the mechanistic basis of ultradian locomotor rhythm generation, we considered that locomotor activity is associated with an awakened state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Welsh et al., 1988</xref>) and consequently, the ultradian locomotor rhythms observed in mice that lack circadian clock function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) could be interpreted as rhythms of heightened wakefulness or arousal. In mammals, a key role in arousal promotion has been attributed to distinct monoaminergic neuronal populations located in the upper brainstem and midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). While altering extracellular levels of the arousal-associated monoamines serotonin, norepinephrine, or histamine by genetic manipulation has only limited effects on locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomas and Palmiter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parmentier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), depleting the brain of dopamine (DA) profoundly abrogates locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou and Palmiter, 1995</xref>). Moreover, increasing extracellular DA levels induces hyperlocomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giros et al., 1996</xref>) and lengthens the time spent awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wisor et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore speculated that altering DA tone may affect ultradian rhythm generation. To test this, we examined running wheel activity in mice carrying a disruption in the <italic>Slc6a3</italic> gene, which encodes the dopamine transporter (DAT). <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice exhibit hyperdopaminergia due to the lack of DAT-mediated DA reuptake into dopaminergic neurons, leading to a hyperactivity phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giros et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gainetdinov et al., 1998</xref>). As the presence of the circadian clock and/or a light:dark cycle frequently masks ultradian activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schibler, 2008</xref>), we assessed the locomotor behavioral consequences of DAT elimination in the absence of the master SCN circadian pacemaker. To do so, we electrolytically lesioned the SCN of <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice and their wildtype littermates and monitored their running wheel behavior in constant darkness (DD). While control mice (SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) exhibited ultradian activity rhythms with the expected ∼4-hr period, SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice showed rhythms whose periods were three times longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Analysis of mice that were deficient for both DAT and the essential clock component BMAL1 (<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>, Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) corroborated this finding. <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>, Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice exhibited ∼12–14-hr rhythms in locomotor activity, largely phenocopying the SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, while their <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>, Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates showed ∼4-hr periods as expected for isodopaminergic mice lacking circadian clock function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that DAT removal markedly increases ultradian cycle length. Alternatively, the ∼12-hr rhythms observed in SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>, Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals may originate from an independent oscillator, one that is activated by DAT elimination, while the short period ultradian oscillator that operates in DAT intact, SCNx <italic>or Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals is disengaged or otherwise obscured.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05105.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dopamine transporter knockout alters periodicity of ultradian locomotor rhythms in circadian incompetent mice under constant darkness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative, double-plotted actograms demonstrating marked lengthening of ultradian locomotor periods in SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice as compared to SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates.

Because Meth leads to increased extracellular DA concentrations as in the case of <italic>Slc6a3</italic> gene disruption, we speculated that Meth treatment would result in a, possibly gradual, period lengthening of the ultradian locomotor rhythms. Indeed when we treated <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals with increasing concentrations of Meth via drinking water in DD, we observed a gradual lengthening of the initial ∼4-hr locomotor oscillations and this was accompanied by a corresponding increase in activity bout length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Of note, the period increase in response to elevating Meth concentrations did not halt in the circadian range, rather, oscillations continued to lengthen with individual animals reaching periods of 100 hr or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Gradual period lengthening of ultradian locomotor rhythms was also observed in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals exposed to amphetamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), a drug similarly targeting DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howell and Kimmel, 2008</xref>), but with lower efficacy than Meth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodwin et al., 2009</xref>). These results argue that DAT targeting psychostimulants affect an endogenous ultradian rhythm generator by increasing period length. However, due to the mode of delivery (drinking water) and the rhythmic Meth uptake that may in turn result from it, it is conceivable that the Meth-dependent, long-period oscillations are ‘driven’ by rhythmic drug intake rather than being generated endogenously. To address this possibility, we subcutaneously implanted <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice with osmotic minipumps that continuously infused Meth over a period of 2 weeks.

While activity rhythms in the ultradian range are easily discernable in voles and hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerkema et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Veen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prendergast et al., 2012</xref>), the presence of such rhythms in mice or rats is much less obvious and this has been attributed to masking by the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schibler, 2008</xref>). Indeed, running wheel activity data from intact mice often do not provide strong indications of ultradian activity rhythms. However, when we recorded ambulatory behavior using telemetry, we frequently detected three, evenly spaced activity bouts during the active (night) phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The observed ∼4 hr peak-to-peak spacing is in line with a previous study on several circadian competent mouse strains where ultradian rhythms with similar period length were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dowse et al., 2010</xref>). The absence of a clearly discernable ∼4-hr rhythmic component during the light portion of the daily LD cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) is likely due to masking by the SCN and/or light. Unlike WT mice, <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice never showed a triple-peak activity pattern at night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and spectral density analysis in the ultradian (2–8 hr) range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) underscores that rhythm generation is significantly altered in these animals while total daily activity is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). When we provided C57BL/6 mice carrying a telemetry implant with Meth in their drinking water, we observed a gradual lengthening of the interval between the night-time activity peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>), resulting in the transformation of the triple peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref><italic>,</italic> white trace and white triangles) into a dual or single night-time activity peak pattern at the highest (100 mg/l) Meth concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, black trace and black triangles). This was corroborated by spectral density analysis revealing a marked reduction in ultradian frequencies upon Meth treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that blocking DA reuptake also lengthens ultradian activity bout intervals in circadian competent mice, arguing that an ultradian oscillator is not ‘activated’ by circadian disruption, but rather continuously operative alongside the circadian timer. As with <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, prolonged Meth-treatment in intact WT mice can lead to profound period lengthening of ultradian rhythms, often into the circabidian (48 hr) range (for examples see Figures 5E, 7F, 9B).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05105.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ultradian activity in SCN-intact <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice and their wildtype littermates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Ambulatory activity recorded by telemetry implants across multiple days (left) and averaged over 24 hr (right).

Hal selectively blocks the DA receptor D2 (DRD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strange, 2008</xref>), which is expressed on postsynaptic target sites of DA neuronal projections but also presynaptically as an autoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>).

The goodness of fit between the cosinor and the DA profiles indicated by the sum of squared errors (SSE = 0.050 ± 0.027, mean ± SEM, N = 7) suggests that the dialysate sampling procedure itself did not perturb the generation of the endogenous ultradian activity cycles. To determine the statistical significance of the observed agreement between the cosinor and the DA trace, we randomly permutated the individual time points of the DA trace and determined the percentage of permutated traces with an equal or better fit to the cosinor in comparison to the observed DA fluctuation.

We propose that under normal conditions, this DUO cycles in harmony with the circadian SCN pacemaker and that the rhythmic information of both the SCN and the DUO are integrated at a common downstream site to create the daily pattern in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). However, elevation of DA tone can lead to DUO period lengthening, which either results in DUO free-run (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,G</xref>) or reinstatement of oscillator synchrony albeit at a different harmonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, e.g., 48 hr). The DUO appears as a highly tunable oscillator, able to adopt period lengths from a few hours to multiple days. This is in stark contrast to the circadian timer which cannot adopt periods that are more than a few hours off from 24 hr when its limits of entrainment are tested experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aschoff and Pohl, 1978</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05105.011</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of circadian and ultradian oscillator output integration to govern daily locomotor behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Light input entrains the circadian (SCN) and (indirectly) the ultradian (DUO) oscillators creating a stable phase relationship.

Our finding that manipulations affecting extracellular DA levels alter oscillator period and that extracellular DA tone shows a remarkably high correlation with activity cycle length, strongly suggests that DA is a period determinant and therefore must be an integral component of the oscillatory mechanism itself. As all period-altering manipulations directly impinge upon DA neuronal physiology, this suggests that either (i) DA neurons are the site of ultradian rhythm generation or (ii) they are a key cog in the oscillatory mechanism. The chemogenetic activation experiments indicate that the relevant DA neuronal population is located in the midbrain as selective activation of DA neurons in this region had a period lengthening effect on the ultradian activity. Future experiments will be aimed at delineating the precise DA population(s) required for the ultradian rhythm generation process and how rhythmic synchrony between neurons is maintained, if the DUO is indeed composed of a population of cellular oscillators.</p><p>Our data indicate that the circadian and ultradian locomotor rhythms are normally harmonized (for instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), suggesting that the circadian pacemaker and the DUO interact. Of note, extracellular DA was reported to fluctuate diurnally in the rodent striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hood et al., 2010</xref>), which was abrogated in <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallardo et al., 2014</xref>). In these studies, only group averaged DA profiles were presented and DA was solely measured in circadian intact mice and rats, thus it is conceivable that any ultradian component (in WT) or infradian component (in <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) escaped detection. Critically, the observation that the DA levels, on average, followed a diurnal pattern with a night-time peak, together with the observation that ultradian locomotor period in female hamsters is longer in the dark vs the daily light phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prendergast et al., 2012</xref>), is consistent with the LD cycle and/or the circadian pacemaker affecting DUO rhythmicity by altering (extracellular) DA. Note however, that dopamine content in whole brain extracts from circadian-intact rats kept under LD showed a strong ultradian variation with no obvious evidence for a diurnal rhythmic component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheving et al., 1968</xref>). Also, microdialysis did not reveal a day:night difference in extracellular DA levels in the striatal NAcc region when measured in DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). This same study reported elevated DA levels and hyperactivity in mice lacking clock gene <italic>Rev-erbα</italic>, suggesting that the circadian clock, possibly intrinsic to DA neurons themselves, has a role in DA regulation. Indeed, knockdown of the core circadian clock component <italic>Clock</italic> in DA neurons of the murine VTA, increases electrical firing rate in VTA neurons and enhances locomotor response to novel objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukherjee et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe any systematic differences in ultradian locomotor period between SCNx and <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice in constant darkness conditions, regardless of DAT status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>), suggesting that extra-SCN circadian clocks have no role in DUO-mediated ultradian locomotor rhythm generation.</p><p>Our data also provide evidence that the postulated MASCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tataroglu et al., 2006</xref>) represents a long-period manifestation of the DUO as a result of methamphetamine's action on the dopamine transporter, blocking dopamine reuptake thereby increasing extracellular DA levels. Interestingly, the dopamine system has been also implicated with another behavioral timing system: the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO). This circadian independent oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pitts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pendergast et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>) drives food-anticipatory locomotor activity (FAA) that emerges when food access is restricted to a few hours each day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mistlberger, 2011</xref>). D1 (DRD1) and D2 (DRD2) receptor antagonists attenuate FAA additively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) while pharmacological DRD2, but not DRD1, activation altered the phase of FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smit et al., 2013</xref>). Most recently, using knockout mice, it was revealed that DRD1 but not DRD2 is necessary for the appropriate expression of FAA and that rescuing dopamine signaling selectively within the dorsal striatum was sufficient to restore FAA in dopamine-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallardo et al., 2014</xref>). Given the links to the dopaminergic system, it will be of interest to investigate whether the DUO has a role in the temporal regulation of FAA.</p><p>While these findings argue that food cues engage the dopamine system to alter daily locomotor activity patterns, it is clear that dopamine signaling also affects food intake as mice lacking dopamine are lethargic and do not actively consume food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou and Palmiter, 1995</xref>). Considering that the DUO is a universal driver of ultradian behavioral rhythms in mammals, the finding that ultradian bouts of running-wheel and feeding activity are co-expressed in the common vole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Veen et al., 2006</xref>) suggests that dopamine can synchronously drive food seeking and general activity, which is in line with the view that dopamine acts as a general promoter of motivated arousal.</p><p><italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice have been proposed as a model for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gainetdinov et al., 2001</xref>) and the DA hypothesis of schizophrenia states that DA elevation is causal to the behavioral symptoms of this psychiatric condition. Intriguingly, circabidian (48 hr) or free-running rhythms in locomotor activity reminiscent of the behavioral patterns we detected in <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> or Meth-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7 fig9">Figures 4F, 7C,F, 9B</xref>) have been observed in schizophrenic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wirz-Justice et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wulff et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that DUO dysregulation underlies the rest-activity aberrations associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, actigraphy recordings in schizophrenic patients also revealed that Hal treatment reduces circadian/diurnal locomotor amplitude and leads to the emergence of ultradian activity bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wirz-Justice et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2009</xref>), effects we likewise observed in <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice in response to Hal. Transient DUO period lengthening might equally account for the rest-activity pattern abnormalities observed during manic episodes in bipolar disorder, which has been also associated with altered DA tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berk et al., 2007</xref>). Bipolar subjects have been reported to show rapid, 48-hr cycling between mania and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilk and Hegerl, 2010</xref>), one to multiple 48-hr sleep–wake cycles when switching from depression to mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wehr et al., 1982</xref>), or a long-period ‘free-running’ rhythm of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wehr et al., 1998</xref>). Thus schizophrenic and bipolar subjects both appear to exhibit rest-activity cycle aberrations strikingly similar to those observed in <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> or Meth-treated mice, suggesting that DUO dysregulation is a common indicator for these psychopathologies and perhaps even a common disease cause.</p><p>A switch to sleep–wake cycles with a period much longer than 24 hr have also been observed in subjects that were studied in temporal isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschoff, 1965</xref>). Because other physiological parameters such as urine secretion and core body temperature showed phase-aligned, circadian fluctuations with a period much closer to 24 hr, the subjects were considered internally desynchronized. Notably, affected subjects tend to exhibit high scores of neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wever, 1979</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the observed internal desynchronization is also due to a dysregulation of the DUO.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turiault et al., 2007</xref>) mice were on a C57BL/6J genetic background, while <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giros et al., 1996</xref>) were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6JxDBA/2J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morice et al., 2004</xref>).

After perchloric acid extraction, the protein containing pellets were reconstituted in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide for protein quantification (Pierce BCA Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Chemogenetics</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized with isofluorane and placed in a stereotaxic aparatus (David Kopf Instruments).

Mice were subsequently maintained in individual housing for at least 2 weeks prior to CNO treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunostaining was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2013</xref>) using cryoprotected (30% Sucrose), free-floating coronal sections from fixed brains collected after intra-cardiac perfusion (4% paraformaldehyde) and cut at 40 microns using a cryostat (Leica, Solms, Germany). For fluorescent labeling, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies for mCherry (rabbit anti-RFP, 1:1000, Rockland, Limerick, PA) to enhance detection of the mCherry expression and antibodies for tyrosine hydroxylase (mouse anti-TH, 1:1000, EMD Millipore, Etibicoke, Canada). This was followed by 2 hr incubation with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 567 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647, 1:250, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) after which sections were mounted on superfrost slides (VWR, Radnor, PA), coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlington, Canada) and imaged by fluorescence microscopy (AxioObserver Z1, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Quantification of co-expression was performed on a single, medial, midbrain section from each behaviorally responsive mouse using the cell counter plugin of ImageJ (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) in order to determine the percentage of all TH-positive cells that also expressed the hM3Dq--mCherry fusion protein (N = 6 per genotype).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>One-way and repeated measures ANOVA, t-tests, and linear regression analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Planned comparisons for the repeated measures were carried out to determine significant period changes between subsequent measurements. Bonferroni correction was used for post-hoc testing of individual group differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>False discovery rate (FDR) and cosinor determination</title><p>To evaluate the probabilistic significance of the least-square fit between the DA trace and the cosinor model that was computed based on the animal's locomotor activity oscillations, a false discovery rate approach was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Storch et al., 2007</xref>). For cosinor computation, we first determined the locomotor period of <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice by Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of 20 hr of locomotor recordings following dialysate sampling. The determined period was then used as an input parameter for a least-squares cosinor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 1979</xref>) using a custom script and function written for Matlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/storchlab/Cosinor-FDR.git">https://github.com/storchlab/Cosinor-FDR.git</ext-link>). This procedure generated a best-fit (co)sine wave modeling the activity time-series. This model wave was then used to assess the concordance between the extracellular DA fluctuations and locomotor oscillations. To calculate FDR, we randomly permutated the temporal order of the measured DA concentrations 100,000 times, and assessed its fit to the cosinor. The permutation procedure will degrade the fit of any truly rhythmic signal but will have little to no effect on noisy or flat profiles. The probability of false discovery was calculated as the percentage of randomly permuted traces that show an equal or better fit to the cosinor than the measured DA fluctuation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Butterworth filtering</title><p>Low pass filtering (1-hr cut-off) of raw data was conducted using a Butterworth zero-phase filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butterworth, 1930</xref>) in Matlab. This allowed for better visualization of ultradian frequencies in the &gt;1-hr range, in a manner similar to recursive smoothing but without phase distortion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Period determination</title><p>Ultradian rhythms show variability in amplitude and period. We thus used Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis (Clocklab) to estimate ultradian period length as this method is relatively tolerant to noisy data and data gaps, which can result from intermittent ultradian rhythm expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Press and Rybicki, 1989</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, period length was determined by identifying the highest peak above the significance threshold (α = 0.01) in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Subsequent plotting of an actogram at the determined modulus was conducted in each case in order to visually confirm rhythmicity and rule out the false identification of harmonic frequencies or side-lobes due to leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Dongen et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Continuous wavelet transforms</title><p>To visualize and quantify the dynamics of period and amplitude in circadian incompetent mice, continuous wavelet transforms using the Morlet wavelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goupillaud et al., 1984</xref>) were performed for the 1–12-hr range using custom algorithms written in Matlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/storchlab/CWT.git">https://github.com/storchlab/CWT.git</ext-link>). Locomotor activity data of seven consecutive days per individual SCN-lesioned or <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mouse was used. For each spectrogram, a ridge identifying the peak amplitude of the spectrum was generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leise, 2013</xref>) and the associated values were used to calculate the average and standard deviation of the dominant ultradian frequency for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Amplitude spectral density (ASD)</title><p>To determine the prevalence of oscillations in a given period range we calculated the area under the curve of all significantly rhythmic periodicities (α = 0.01) in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, that is, the spectral density.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>All the individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Palmiter (Reviewing editor), Joseph Takahashi, and Andrew Steele (peer reviewers).</p><p>Because all three reviewers were impressed by the quality of the work presented and all agreed that the paper should be accepted there was no need for discussion among the reviewers. No additional experiments are required. The results are compelling, but there are a few loose ends to consider:</p><p>1) Manipulations of DA signaling will have many effects on physiology and behavior including food-entrained oscillations in activity. Thus, it seems important to know how the various DA signaling manipulations affect patterns of food intake. Acknowledgment of the potential interactions between feeding behavior and locomotion would be welcome.</p><p>2) It would be useful to include histograms comparing the overall locomotor activity of the comparison groups in addition to the histograms showing average period length. Why do DAT KO mice have lower activity on a running wheel compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but apparently more activity in their home cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)?</p><p>3) It seems most likely that DA is a “key cog in the oscillatory mechanism” rather than the generator of the oscillations because mice lacking DA can have robust bouts of activity. For example, mice lacking DA are, indeed, hypoactive and they become extremely hyperactive in response to drugs that restore DA, but then paradoxically they have another bout of DA-independent activity 24-30 hours later. When this experiment is performed in obese mice (leptin deficient), there can be several very robust bouts of DA-independent activity that appear to be circadian (Sczcypka et al., 1999, PNAS 96, 12138; Szczypka et al., 2000, Nat Genet 25, 102). These results suggest that bouts of activity can be entrained by surges in DA signaling but can be maintained without DA; thus, some other circuit must maintain the rhythms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05105.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In addition to the revisions in response to the reviewers’ comments, we would also like to propose the following additional changes to the manuscript, if you agree with it.</p><p>We changed the title to “A highly tunable dopaminergic oscillator generates ultradian rhythms of behavioral arousal” as we think it better reflects the nature of the oscillator system we describe (we also adjusted the main text at a few places accordingly). This request for a title change is particularly owed to our finding that the oscillator is capable to adopt period lengths from a few hours to multiple days by changing DA tone.</p><p>We now added running wheel data from <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>,Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> double KO mice and a respective bar graph reporting their ultradian periods. As these mice largely phenocopy the SCNx-<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals, these data critically strengthen our core finding which is ultradian period lengthening by <italic>Slc6a3</italic> disruption. It also provides additional support to our claim that extra-SCN clocks have no role in the ultradian rhythm generation process and that this process is not affected by the developmental absence of BMAL1 and thus clock function.</p><p>To accommodate the new data we split <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, extending the total Figure count to 9.</p><p><italic>1) Manipulations of DA signaling will have many effects on physiology and behavior including food-entrained oscillations in activity. Thus, it seems important to know how the various DA signaling manipulations affect patterns of food intake. Acknowledgment of the potential interactions between feeding behavior and locomotion would be welcome</italic>.</p><p>While we have not explicitly explored the temporal feeding pattern in our experimental models: there is data from the common vole demonstrating that ultradian feeding and locomotor activity rhythms are co-expressed, suggesting that the DUO (and thus dopamine) drives both synchronously. We have extended the Discussion section accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) It would be useful to include histograms comparing the overall locomotor activity of the comparison groups in addition to the histograms showing average period length. Why do DAT KO mice have lower activity on a running wheel compared to WT mice (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>), but apparently more activity in their home cage (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>?</p><p>While we appreciate that it might appear as though overall locomotion differs between groups this is not the case. Analysis of the datasets in question revealed that total daily activity was not significantly different in either the telemetry or the RW. These results have now been added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figure 4D and 7C</xref>). The erroneous impression of genotypic differences in activity levels is likely due to the fact that <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice typically exhibit fewer but longer and more consolidated (less fragmented) activity bouts, leading to higher peak activity levels (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, these bout-character differences likely account also for the erroneous impression of differences in daily running wheel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together, the new data supports our original analysis in that it is the pattern of locomotion, which is substantially altered by DAT removal, whereas the total daily activity is not.</p><p><italic>3) It seems most likely that DA is a “key cog in the oscillatory mechanism” rather than the generator of the oscillations because mice lacking DA can have robust bouts of activity. For example, mice lacking DA are, indeed, hypoactive and they become extremely hyperactive in response to drugs that restore DA, but then paradoxically they have another bout of DA-independent activity 24-30 hours later. When this experiment is performed in obese mice (leptin deficient), there can be several very robust bouts of DA-independent activity that appear to be circadian (Sczcypka et al., 1999, PNAS 96, 12138; Szczypka et al., 2000, Nat Genet 25, 102). These results suggest that bouts of activity can be entrained by surges in DA signaling but can be maintained without DA; thus, some other circuit must maintain the rhythms</italic>.</p><p>We are very aware of the very intriguing findings in Szczypka et al. (1999). However, we do not think that the results presented in this study (and the Szczypka et al., 2000 study) particularly refute the hypothesis that DA acts as a key element of the ultradian rhythm generation process. As the DD mice examined in these studies were circadian competent and given that the DA-independent activity bout emerged ∼24hrs after the previous bout, it seems plausible that this DA-independent bout is driven by the circadian clock in the SCN and/or other sites (possibly involving input to midbrain DA neurons, other ascending arousal nuclei, or striatal post-synaptic neurons).</p><p>We actually wish to critically test this, as a next step towards deciphering the DUO mechanism, by performing SCN lesion in DD mice and attempting to recapitulate the phenomena observed in Szczypka et al. Thus, the current state of knowledge suggests that DA acts as the key mediator of DUO action (in addition to being a period determinant), while other (circadian) cues are able to engage arousal/locomotion circuitry in a DA/DUO independent fashion (this view is e.g. also supported by the presence of a daily, night-time activity bout in addition to the circadian day-time activity bout in Meth-treated, wild-type mice; see actogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
