Only a few of these cells manage to travel up the female’s reproductive tract to reach the egg, and usually only one sperm fertilizes it. Freshly ejaculated sperm are incapable of fertilizing eggs and have to undergo several changes within the female to become able to do so. One crucial change occurs in the sperm tail, which starts to beat vigorously in a whip-like motion. This type of movement – known as hyperactivated motility – enables the sperm to swim towards the egg, push through a sticky coating that surrounds it, and then burrow into it.</p><p>Hyperactivated motility is triggered when calcium ions enter the sperm cell via a specific channel protein known as CatSper, which is found in the membrane that surrounds the cell. CatSper channels form groups (known as complexes) with several other proteins that are arranged in a unique pattern of four straight ‘stripes’ running down the tail of the sperm. This arrangement is necessary for hyperactivated motility and mutations in the genes that encode these proteins can lead to infertility in males. The CatSper channel complex is known to contain seven proteins: four that form a pore through which calcium ions can enter, and three accessory proteins whose roles in hyperactivated motility are less clear.</p><p>Chung <italic>et al</italic>. identified two genes in mice that encode new accessory proteins in the CatSper channel complex named CatSper epsilon and CatSper zeta. Further experiments analyzed the role of CatSper zeta in more detail. Mutant males that lack CatSper zeta have fragmented patterns of CatSper stripes in the tails of their sperm. Moreover, fewer calcium ions were able to pass through the channels to enter the cell. Together, this made the sperm tail more rigid, which prevented it from moving efficiently within the female, resulting in reduced fertility. Chung <italic>et al</italic>. also found that the mutant sperm were less able to penetrate the egg than normal sperm.</p><p>During evolution, the gene that encodes CatSper zeta appeared first in mammals and may represent an adaptation that improved the chances of a sperm fertilizing the egg inside the reproductive tract of female mammals. Future challenges will be to explore how the CatSper channel assembles on the membrane of sperm and find out exactly how calcium ions trigger hyperactivated motility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23082.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23082.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mammalian fertilization</kwd><kwd>sperm motility</kwd><kwd>rheotaxis</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ channels</kwd><kwd>super-resolution imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Xiaowei</given-names></name><name><surname>Clapham</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007184</institution-id><institution>Yale School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Goodman-Gilman Yale Scholar Award 2015-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Jean-Ju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new component, CatSper zeta, is required for continuous alignment of the calcium channel along the sperm's tail and is crucial for normal sperm swimming behavior and fertility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sperm hyperactivation, characterized by a large asymmetric lateral displacement of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishijima et al., 2002</xref>), is required for normal mammalian sperm navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demott and Suarez, 1992</xref>), rheotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>), and <italic>zona pellucida</italic> (ZP) penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stauss et al., 1995</xref>).

In hyperactivated spermatozoa, the transverse flagellar force is larger than the propulsive flagellar force due to the increase in mid-piece curvature (α angle), which enables a larger range of motion and typical figure-of-eight swimming trajectories compared to the nearly straight paths of non-hyperactivated spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishijima, 2011</xref>). Transverse force facilitates sperm penetration through the cumulus and ZP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishijima, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yanagimachi, 1966</xref>).

Rheotactic turning to reorient to directional flow depends on flagellar rolling, not the sperm head or its geometry, as demonstrated by the rheotaxis of headless mouse sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>). CatSper channels form unique Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains in linearly quadrilateral arrays along the principal piece of sperm flagella. The integrity of these domains is necessary to time and/or maintain hyperactivated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, <italic>CatSper1</italic>-null sperm cannot rheotax due to defects in rolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>), and presumably exert less lateral force in escaping from epithelial walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2009</xref>) or in pushing cumulus cells aside. In general, however, there is a lack of understanding of the steps between CatSper-mediated calcium entry, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modified phosphorylation cascades, and the resulting structural changes underlying orchestrated flagellar movement.</p><p>Here, we reveal that the murine <italic>Gm7068</italic> (<italic>C1orf101-like)</italic> and <italic>Tex40</italic> genes encode two new subunits of the CatSper ion channel complex, CatSper epsilon (ε) and zeta (ζ), respectively. In this study, we focus primarily on CatSperζ’s function. Genetic disruption of mammalian-specific CatSperζ reduces the CatSper current in the sperm flagellum and hyperactivated motility, resulting in severe subfertility. We use high speed video microscopy and digital image analysis to determine swimming trajectory and the flagellar waveform in detail. Surprisingly, abrogation of CatSperζ renders the proximal flagellum inflexible but preserves overall motility, thus resulting in restriction of the 3D flagellar envelope, inefficient sperm rheotaxis <italic>in vitro</italic>, and delayed sperm migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrated that the structurally distinct CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains along the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2014</xref>) becomes fragmented in the absence of <italic>CatSperz</italic>. We demonstrate that IVF failure of <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null spermatozoa is partially rescued by using ejaculated sperm recovered from the uterus of mated females, explaining the discrepancy between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilizing ability. Finally, we show that mouse and human spermatozoa have a similar macroscopic organization of the CatSper complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CatSper ε and ζ: Two new accessory proteins in the CatSper channel complex</title><p>We previously identified seven protein components of the CatSper channel complex (CatSper1-4, β, γ, and δ) from mouse testis using tandem affinity purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2011</xref>).

This includes many attempts in many cell types, including simultaneous injection of all 7 <italic>CatSper</italic> mRNAs into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Therefore, we continued to seek potential additional components to more thoroughly understand CatSper channel assembly and trafficking. We identified a mouse homolog of human <italic>C1orf101</italic> (<italic>C1orf101-like</italic>, currently <italic>Gm7068</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) based on its sequence homology to the C-terminal extracellular domain of CatSperδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This testis-specific gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) is predicted to encode a single transmembrane (TM) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). In addition, a small soluble protein encoded by another testis-specific gene, <italic>Tex40</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), was found to be associated with the CatSper channel complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

In wt spermatozoa, the CatSper channel forms four linear continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains confined to the principal piece of the flagella. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the CatSper channels potentiates sperm rotation during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>). With the resulting increased asymmetry and change in wave amplitude, the flagellar envelope is mapped out as a 3-dimensional cone in space, orienting sperm into the flow. Deficits in <italic>I<sub>CatSper</sub></italic> and loss of the continuity of the linear domains in <italic>CatSperz</italic>-/- null spermatozoa compromise Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and result in rigidity in the proximal region. The inflexibility of <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null spermatozoa from midpiece to halfway through the principal piece constrains the flagellar envelope to a narrower, rod like spatial map. The still active distal tail rotation then drives the more static rod-like structure. This causes the sperm to rotate faster but with less torque, thereby inefficiently orienting them into the flow and yielding less force in orthogonal directions needed to push aside the cumulus cells.

With four distinct pore-forming gene products (CatSper 1–4) and, now, five accessory subunits (β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ), the CatSper channel is the most complex of known ion channels. This may reflect the relatively high evolutionary pressure on spermatozoan evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swanson and Vacquier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Torgerson et al., 2002</xref>), and various adaptations to different modes of fertilization. Like many gamete-specific proteins and the other CatSper proteins reported so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai and Clapham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2011</xref>), mouse and human CatSper ε and ζ show signs of rapid evolutionary change with only 50% and 45% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. In particular, the sequence regions outside TM segments and the pore loop of CatSper proteins are poorly conserved across species, indicating these regions possibly convey species-specific modulation of flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). This is illustrated by striking differences in progesterone-elicited <italic>I<sub>CatSper</sub></italic> responses in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>). Here we have shown that CatSper ε and ζ are components of the highly organized CatSper complex, that CatSperζ is required for proper continuity of this complex along the flagellum, and that loss of ζ alters hyperactivation waveforms and reduces fertilizing capacity.</p><p>The conservation pattern of the lineage-specific gain and loss of the <italic>CatSpere</italic> gene is identical to those of <italic>b</italic> and <italic>g</italic>, suggesting that they likely belonged to an ancient CatSper channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling network before the divergence of unikonts and bikonts. Since their protein expression is strictly interdependent, we speculate that <italic>CatSpere</italic>-null mice will have the phenotype of <italic>CatSper1-4</italic>, or <italic>d</italic>-null mice. In contrast, <italic>CatSperz</italic> is conserved only in mammals, suggesting that this protein imparts some adaptation, perhaps as a method enabling rheotaxis in the mammalian female reproductive tract.</p><p>Interestingly, although CatSperζ has no putative transmembrane domains, it is localized in the same quadrilateral pattern as other CatSpers, but is not present elsewhere in sperm. An intriguing aspect of our observations is that, unlike <italic>CatSper1-4</italic> and <italic>d</italic>-null mice, which produce complete infertility, <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null males exhibit an incomplete loss of fertility. The CatSper current is reduced in <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null spermatozoa, and may have similar permeation properties (likely dominated by the CatSper1-4 pore subunits), but the effects of <italic>CatSperz</italic> on channel gating remain to be determined in future studies. This is reminiscent of the non-spermatozoan, voltage-gated Ca<sub>v</sub> channel auxiliary subunits, which are not required for expression but modulate expression levels and gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2005</xref>). Most tantalizing is the thinning and disruption of the linear CatSper signaling domains at repeat intervals in the absence of ζ.

We found that abrogation of <italic>CatSperz</italic> not only retards targeting of the CatSper complex to flagella, but also disrupts continuity of the linear domains, resulting in repeated fragmented domains with ~800 nm periodicity. In order for CatSper domains to form and function properly, interactions are needed between the CatSper channel complex in the flagellar membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal proteins. One speculation is that CatSperζ might adapt to cytoskeletal structures that traffic, distribute, and enable membrane insertion of CatSper.</p><p>The fibrous sheath (FS), a cytoskeletal structure unique to the mammalian sperm flagellum, defines the extent of the tail’s principal piece, in which all the CatSper proteins are specifically localized. The FS closely lies under the plasma membrane and its two longitudinal columns are connected by circumferential ribs. Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that the CatSper channels are distributed on the end of ribs, where they merge with the column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). It seems likely that the timing of occurrence and localization of CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains is coordinated with the assembly of FS proteins along the axoneme. The column appears early in spermiogenesis, forming from the distal tip of the tail along the axoneme, followed by subsequent rib formation in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oko, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oko and Clermont, 1989</xref>).

Here we report that the flagellar envelope is significantly altered in the absence of <italic>CatSperz,</italic> in part due to the inflexibility of the proximal tail.

In <italic>CatSper1</italic>-null spermatozoa, PP2B-Aγ remains localized primarily to the axoneme but disappears from the quadrilateral structures.

The integrity and distribution of CatSper channels in <italic>Ppp3cc-</italic>null spermatozoa remain to be examined and may clarify midpiece/principal piece disparities. In any case, inflexibility in the proximal regions of flagellum results in a flagellar envelope approximated as a rod with a distal propeller. The sperm can rotate faster but the smaller lateral deviation reduces torque. This limits the sperm’s ability to orient into the flow, as well as penetrate the cumulus and ZP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Physiological modulation of CatSper in sperm function and fertility</title><p>Gene-manipulated mice highlight the importance of <italic>in vivo</italic> observations and have reshaped the landscape of fertilization science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okabe, 2015</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> capacitation and fertilization systems underpin much of the study of sperm motility and fertilization potential. While ejaculated sperm are preferred for fertilization studies in larger animals and humans, epididymal sperm are commonly used in genetically tractable mouse studies.

This may explain why <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null spermatozoa are completely infertile in an IVF setting (COCs), but <italic>in vivo</italic> are merely subfertile. Perhaps natural modulators, absent in epididymal sperm IVF studies, partially rescue the fertilizing potential of <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null spermatozoa by activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity.</p><p>Interestingly, a transient pulse of Ca<sup>2+</sup> can greatly reduce the capacitation time required for wt sperm to develop hyperactivated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tateno et al., 2013</xref>).

These independent studies were interpreted to mean that the initial priming by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, perhaps above a certain threshold, is essential for sperm function. However, the linear quadrilateral CatSper complexes are not present in <italic>CatSper1</italic>-null spermatozoa and in <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null spermatozoa are disrupted by gaps. We hypothesize that the linear quadrilateral structure <italic>in vivo</italic> likely maintains, regulates, and distributes CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during hyperactivated motility. But it is important to point out that alterations in the structure should also result in changes in mechanical properties, movement of the flagellum, distribution of entering calcium, and downstream kinase activity and the motor elements they regulate. This complexity is illustrated <italic>in vivo</italic> sperm swimming trajectories, which are modulated by switching between pro- and anti-hook beating patterns. In the absence of CatSperζ, anti-hook beating predominates. Pro-hook motions are associated with intact CatSper-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Suarez, 2011</xref>). Finally, ejaculated sperm display more pro-hook hyperactivation than epididymal sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Future areas for investigation are the functional positioning of the remaining accessory subunits of the CatSper channel in assembly and domain organization, the testing of potential modifiers present in accessory sex gland secretions that may activate CatSper channels, and the determination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent molecules in the axoneme which eventually determine flagellar bending and its envelope. <italic>CatSperz</italic>-null mice, which are hypomorphic to the null-mutation of other CatSper genes with abrogated hyperactivation, and newly expanding animal models from recent advances in genome editing will serve as a foundation to this end. Advanced imaging techniques with higher time and spatial resolution will be necessary to carry this out. The present results also suggest that alterations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and/or dysregulated downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling affecting dynamic structures may be sufficient to compromise sperm function.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Kenton Swartz, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Christopher J Lingle (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this very interesting manuscript, Chung et al. report the discovery and the function of two novel subunits of the CatSper complex, CatSperε and CatSperζ. The CatSper channel has been known for &gt;10 years now to form the most important Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in sperm tail and is absolutely required for male fertility. However, the complex has been resistant to detailed functional studies by biophysicists because it somehow doesn't form &quot;functional&quot; channel in heterologous expression system. One explanation is that we don't have all the subunits in the complex yet despite the 4 pore-forming (CatSper1-4) and 3 &quot;auxiliary&quot; (CatSperβ, γ, δ) reported thus far. The discovery of another two subunits described in this paper is a major step forward. Intriguingly, CatSperζ doesn't have a transmembrane-spanning domain and is yet membrane-anchored (perhaps in a fashion similar to the β subunits of CaVs). The authors show that during evolution, CatSperζ was &quot;added&quot; to the complex in mammals and it presumably reflects an adaptation to the changes of environment of the site of fertilization in the female reproductive tract. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the new proteins are associated with CatSper (using biochemical methods), colocalized within the CatSper nanodomains (with STROM and conventional immuno-staining) and, for CatSperζ, are required for the continuity of the CatSper structural stripes along the sperm tail. Finally, the authors demonstrate that CatSperζ is required for normal sperm hyperactivated motility, egg penetration and male fertility (sub-fertile in the KO).</p><p>The findings in the paper are novel, interesting and convincing. The studies are remarkably comprehensive, and include data from the identification of new subunits to the biochemical characterization of interaction and whole-organism function. The following are suggestions the authors should carefully consider in preparing a revised manuscript.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;Auxillary&quot; subunits in other channels (e.g. CaV β and NaV β) usually affect the channel's voltage dependence of activation/inactivation kinetics. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the authors present the averaged amplitudes of <italic>I<sub>CatSper</sub></italic> in the KO and WT. It would be nice to have the averaged G-V relationships reconstructed from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>. In addition, it's useful to show the traces recorded with square wave stimulation, in addition to the ones with ramp protocols, to check whether there is any inactivation in the KO sperm. Finally, does the channel without CatSperζ have the same pH-dependence?</p><p>2) There was a concern that the authors have not carefully distinguished to what extent the sperm motility deficits in the zeta KO arise from reductions in <italic>I<sub>CatSper)</sub></italic>vs. structural changes in localization and association of the CatSper complex. In the minor comment 2 below, there is a suggestion for potential tests of this issue. At a minimum, some cautionary remarks on this potential distinction are required.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23082.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Suggested revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) &quot;Auxillary&quot; subunits in other channels (e.g. CaV β and NaV β) usually affect the channel's voltage dependence of activation/inactivation kinetics.

Unfortunately, the person who did those recordings, Kiyoshi Miki, had to return to his family in Japan. After going through all his data, we don’t have enough step protocol data to provide adequate G-V curves. With both of us, the lead authors, moving and starting new labs, we will have to leave this for future work. In any case, it will take many months, beyond the <italic>eLife</italic> limit, due to the slow pace of (our) sperm recording.</p><p><italic>2) There was a concern that the authors have not carefully distinguished to what extent the sperm motility deficits in the zeta KO arise from reductions in I(CatSper) vs. structural changes in localization and association of the CatSper complex.

We revised the text to clarify the reviewers’ point in subsection “Reduced CatSper Current in CatSperζ-null Spermatozoa.”, second paragraph and added a new section in the Results section “Compromised Ca2+ Signaling Alters the Sperm’s 3D Flagellar Envelope and Movement “. We now also reference work done by Navarette and colleagues—their work recently showed that motility and fertility could be rescued in CatSper KO spermatozoa via A23187 pulsed treatment to induce calcium transients (Navarrette et al., 2016). This directly addresses the question as it demonstrates that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients resulting from A23187 pulsed treatment are sufficient to induce sperm hyperactivation in vitro, bypassing not only the pore but also the spatial arrangement of the CatSper channel complex. We also performed additional motility experiments in varying concentrations of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or with A23187 pulses to determine whether these conditions rescue the observed phenotype of CatSperζ-KO sperm. These results are now added to the main text in the Results and Discussion sections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
