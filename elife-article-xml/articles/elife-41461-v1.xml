After initiating transcription at the transcription start site (TSS), Pol II often pauses 30–50 bp downstream of the TSS, before being released by p-TEFb into productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaertner and Zeitlinger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Genome-wide profiling of Pol II and nascent transcripts suggest that pausing is widespread across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>), and inhibition of p-TEFb blocks the productive elongation of the majority of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao and Price, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonkers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ni et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these results suggest that pause release is a general and obligatory step in transcription.</p><p>Despite evidence that pausing is a common feature of transcription, the stability of paused Pol II varies widely between genes. While the degree of pausing may be influenced by transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>), differences in Pol II pausing across the genome are, to a large extent, a property of the promoter. In the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, Pol II pausing is most frequently found at developmental control genes, and a large portion of these genes remain highly paused throughout embryonic development independently of their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaertner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>). The promoter sequences of such highly paused genes are notably enriched for specific core promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendrix et al., 2008</xref>), and promoter swapping experiments demonstrate that Pol II pausing depends on the promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lagha et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite the evidence that Pol II pausing depends on the promoter sequence, how core promoter elements regulate Pol II pausing remains elusive.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> is ideally suited to study the relationship between promoter sequences and Pol II pausing since a large fraction of promoters in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome have clearly defined core promoter sequences that are associated with strong Pol II pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilchrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendrix et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vo Ngoc et al., 2017b</xref>). Moreover, these highly paused promoters typically undergo focused initiation, during which Pol II begins transcription at a defined genomic position within a window of a few nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ni et al., 2010</xref>). These promoters are easier to study than those with dispersed initiation, where Pol II initiation occurs throughout a genomic region of ~100 bp. Finally, these highly paused promoters do not typically show strong +1 nucleosomes near the pause site, making Pol II pausing less likely to be dependent on chromatin context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamin and Gilmour, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bondarenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaertner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilchrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izban and Luse, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jimeno-González et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rach et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>These convenient and easy-to-study highly paused promoters in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have features that are similar to those of mammalian promoters. Their core promoter elements are recognized by the basal transcription factor TFIID, a highly conserved multi-subunit complex whose promoter binding specificity appears to be conserved across metazoans. For example, recent cryo-EM structures of TFIID show human TFIID bound to all core promoter elements of the synthetic <italic>Drosophila</italic> super core promoter, including the sequences enriched among highly paused promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Louder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that the highly paused promoters in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have more elaborate sequence elements, yet rely on conserved metazoan transcription machinery for their function.</p><p>TFIID interacts with sequence elements at three regions along the core promoter, which are spaced in a fixed distance from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Louder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vo Ngoc et al., 2017b</xref>). The first contact occurs at the TATA box, a well-studied core promoter element that is located ~30 bp upstream of the transcription start site and is bound by TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chasman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 1993b</xref>). The second contact occurs at the initiator (Inr) sequence, which overlaps the nucleotide where Pol II initiates transcription (referred to as the +1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalkley and Verrijzer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emami et al., 1997</xref>). The Inr is the most common core promoter element in metazoans and is often the only identifiable core promoter element in mammalian promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smale and Kadonaga, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vo Ngoc et al., 2017a</xref>). The third DNA region contacted by TFIID lies ~30 bp downstream of the transcription start site. It contains short sequence motifs such as the downstream promoter element (DPE), motif ten element (MTE), and the pause button (PB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke and Kadonaga, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendrix et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kutach and Kadonaga, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Purnell et al., 1994</xref>). Despite extensive studies on TFIID-promoter interactions, how core promoter elements affect Pol II pausing is not clear.</p><p>Measurements of paused Pol II across the genome, including with ChIP-seq, normally do not assess the duration of pausing directly, but rather represent steady-state Pol II occupancy across a population of cells, in which paused Pol II turns over at different rates. To measure the stability of paused Pol II more directly, a time-course analysis in response to triptolide treatment can be performed. Triptolide inhibits initiation globally and prevents new Pol II from reaching the pause position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonkers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Titov et al., 2011</xref>). After triptolide treatment, previously existing paused Pol II is lost over time, either by transitioning into elongation or due to premature transcript termination. The decay rate of paused Pol II under these conditions is then proportional to the stability of paused Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonkers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krebs et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We recently performed such time-course measurements of paused Pol II across the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome using a high-resolution exonuclease-based ChIP-seq protocol (ChIP-nexus). This assay has the advantage of distinguishing Pol II signal at the site of initiation and pausing, and thus the Pol II half-life calculations are based on paused Pol II, rather than total Pol II at the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017</xref>). These experiments confirmed the large differences in pausing stability across promoters and showed significant correlations with core promoter elements. However, whether these promoter sequences directly regulate Pol II pausing or whether they are statistically over-represented among promoters with high or low Pol II pausing stability is not known.</p><p>A better understanding of the relationship between the core promoter sequence and pausing behavior is difficult to obtain with current techniques. On one hand, traditional biochemical or reporter gene assays usually use gene expression and not Pol II occupancy as the readout since Pol II pausing was not yet known to be a general regulatory step in transcription when these assays were developed. As a result, in vitro assays for studying Pol II pausing are very limited, and it is not even clear whether Pol II pausing requires a natural chromatin context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamin and Gilmour, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bondarenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izban and Luse, 1991</xref>). On the other hand, Pol II pausing is readily detected by genomics techniques in vivo, but manipulating endogenous genomic promoter sequences to analyze their links to Pol II pausing is time consuming. Therefore, having an assay that measures Pol II pausing outside the normal genomic context would allow quick promoter mutagenesis and greatly facilitate studying mechanistic features in the regulation of Pol II pausing.</p><p>Although traditional reporter assays were not designed to detect Pol II pausing, it is nevertheless possible that Pol II pausing occurs in some of these assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamin and Gilmour, 1998</xref>). We reasoned that if paused Pol II occurred on a plasmid, it would be possible to combine the efficiency of plasmid-based sequence mutagenesis with Pol II ChIP-nexus to rapidly test how alterations in promoter sequences affect Pol II pausing. Unexpectedly, we found that paused Pol II can easily be detected on a plasmid by ChIP-nexus and its footprint closely recapitulates the Pol II footprint at the endogenous locus. Using this novel assay, termed reporter-ChIP-nexus, we analyzed the contribution of various core promoter elements and discovered that the Inr sequence, when containing a G at position +2, plays an unexpectedly large and dominant role in stabilizing paused Pol II. Taken together, we show that reporter-ChIP-nexus combines the ease of plasmid-based sequence mutagenesis with high-resolution ChIP profiling, thereby serving as a valuable tool for dissecting the role of specific sequences in Pol II pausing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Promoter-specific Pol II pausing properties are recapitulated on the reporter</title><p>To test whether Pol II pausing is recapitulated on a plasmid, we used a GFP reporter, which has moderate expression when transfected into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Kc167 cells and allows rapid insertion of any type of promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After transient transfection of the reporter construct, the entire cell extracts were used for ChIP-nexus since there is no straightforward method for isolating plasmids from fixed cells before chromatin immunoprecipitation. Due to the high number of plasmids per cell, we found that only moderate sequence coverage (~5 to 10 million unique reads per sample) was sufficient to obtain high ChIP signal from the plasmid. Sequencing the endogenous genome in addition to the plasmid also provided a convenient internal control for the ChIP quality and for normalizing samples with each other.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41461.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reporter-ChIP-nexus captures paused Pol II.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reporter-ChIP-nexus is performed by cloning <italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic> promoters or synthetic promoters into a simple GFP reporter and transfecting into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Kc167 cells.

This synthetic promoter contains correctly positioned TATA, Inr, MTE, DPE and PB core promoter elements such that they are recognized by TFIID and efficiently direct Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Juven-Gershon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Louder et al., 2016</xref>).

Measurements for the wild-type promoter are normalized to 1, and the relative values for the mutated promoters are shown next to it. Errors bars refer to standard error among two to three biological replicates. Note that the error is large due the variability in transfection efficiency between independent samples. Despite the variability, the change in Pol II pausing stability was in most cases inversely correlated with that of RNA transcription. Thus, a loss in Pol II pausing was usually associated with an increase in transcription. This is consistent with Pol II pausing having an inhibitory effect on transcription. We cannot exclude the possibility that the causality is reverse though, that is that an increase in promoter strength leads to a reduction in Pol II pausing. It is unclear, however, whether promoter strength can be uncoupled from Pol II pausing, and we cannot measure them separately. In our model, promoter strength and Pol II pausing are both determined by TFIID, which binds to both the upstream and downstream core promoter elements we studied.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41461-fig7-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Interestingly, the presence of TATA was still correlated with shorter Pol II half-lives (median ~13 min), but the variant of Inr that was present made a strong difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). While promoters with a combination of TATA and Inr-nonG had slightly shorter half-lives (median ~11 min), TATA in combination with the Inr-G variant showed very stable Pol II pausing (median ~59 min, Wilcoxon p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>). This suggests that the Inr acts dominantly over TATA in its effect on Pol II pausing, which explains our earlier observations that introducing a TATA upstream region alone only had a small effect on stably paused promoters.</p><p>These results strongly suggest that the G at the +2 position of the Inr is critical for stable Pol II pausing. To validate this experimentally, we specifically mutated the G into A or T at three stably paused promoters (<italic>dve, pk</italic> and the synthetic promoter SCP) and performed Pol II ChIP-nexus under control and triptolide treated conditions (1 hr treatment for <italic>dve</italic> and <italic>pk</italic>, 30-min treatment for SCP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Here, we found that Pol II pausing is remarkably well recapitulated on a plasmid and that its stability can be measured on the plasmid by treatment with triptolide. By taking advantage of this assay, which we call reporter-ChIP-nexus, we were able to test the contribution of individual core promoter elements to Pol II pausing. We found that replacement of core promoter regions bound by TFIID tended to change the stability of paused Pol II in the expected direction, but the overall sequence context of the promoter was still important.</p><p>Most notably, we found that the Inr sequence played a strong role in the stability of Pol II pausing. This is surprising because the Inr sequence is thought to function synergistically with both the TATA box and the pausing elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</xref>), which have opposite effects on the stability of Pol II pausing. Identifying the preferred Inr sequences in promoters with a TATA box and with pausing elements resolved this conundrum. Promoters with stable Pol II pausing are highly enriched for Inr sequences resembling the consensus TYAGTY, which closely matches the Inr derived from functional studies (TCAKTY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hultmark et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Purnell et al., 1994</xref>) and from computational analyses (TCAGTY and TCAGTT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stark et al., 2007</xref>). This in turn suggests that a strong consensus Inr sequence promotes Pol II pausing.</p><p>Promoters with a TATA box, in contrast, tend to have more degenerate Inr sequences. This explains why previous genomic sequence analyses have found these two elements to co-occur relatively infrequently in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vo Ngoc et al., 2017a</xref>), although biochemical experiments clearly show that they function synergistically in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emami et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malecová et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Shea-Greenfield and Smale, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This difference in Inr sequence between promoter types is best reflected in the presence or absence of a G at the +2 position. Although G and T at this position are equally functional in transcription assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo and Smale, 1996</xref>), stably paused promoters predominantly contain the Inr-G variant. Mutating this G to an A or T drastically reduced Pol II pausing in our assay, suggesting that the G is indeed important for stable Pol II pausing.</p><p>It is therefore possible that the degenerate Inr-nonG sequences in TATA-containing promoters represent a tradeoff. On one hand, these Inr sequences probably have sufficient sequence information to influence start site selection and promote TATA-dependent transcription. On the other hand, they may be weakened in their ability to stabilize Pol II pausing and thereby allow a mode of transcription with reduced Pol II pausing. Alternatively, TATA-containing promoters may function equally well with or without Pol II pausing, and therefore, the Inr sequences in these promoters may not have been under strong purifying selection during evolution.</p><p>Interestingly, an Inr-G variant (TCAGTT) was identified in comparative <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomics analyses as the most conserved Inr sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stark et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that the G variant may be under evolutionarily selection in paused promoters, consistent with Pol II pausing playing a critical role in keeping the promoter open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilchrist et al., 2008</xref>) and achieving coordinated gene expression during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lagha et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is important to point out that while the G is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, human Inr sequences are often more degenerate and do not show a significant enrichment of G at the +2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carninci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo and Smale, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vo Ngoc et al., 2017a</xref>). However, there are also Inr variants with a much longer consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yarden et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore possible that human Inr variants also differentially affect Pol II pausing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Promoter elements could be linked to Pol II pausing through TFIID</title><p>The promoter elements we tested here for Pol II pausing have traditionally been studied for their role in promoter recognition and transcription initiation by TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burley and Roeder, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Young, 2000</xref>). TFIID is a large, flexible multi-subunit complex that can simultaneously bind to the TATA box, the Inr, and the pausing elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Louder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2018</xref>), thereby promoting the assembly of the transcription initiation complex. More recent evidence, however, suggests that TFIID has a function beyond initiation. For example, there is accumulating evidence that TFIID promotes Pol II re-initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oelgeschläger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, genome-wide ChIP-nexus data show that TFIID binding extends beyond the pausing position in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility that TFIID plays a role in the coordination between consecutive rounds of Pol II initiation, pausing, and pause release.</p><p>If TFIID remains bound after initiation, it is possible that it influences the stability of Pol II pausing in a promoter-specific fashion. While TFIID can make contacts with all promoter elements on the super core promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Louder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2018</xref>), natural promoters contain fewer promoter element consensus sequences, such that the strength and position of TFIID-promoter contacts may vary between promoters. We therefore speculate that the core promoter elements recognized by TFIID contribute to the dynamics of Pol II transcription by influencing how Pol II enters and remains in the pausing position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). If TFIID binds tightly to the Inr and downstream promoter elements, Pol II may initiate and traverse the early transcribed region more slowly, and hence may be more likely to become stably paused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, if TFIID is more tightly bound to the promoter upstream through the TATA box, then Pol II initiation and early transcription may occur in a less constrained fashion, which may promote pause release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These tight DNA contacts in the presence of the TATA box is supported by biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Starr and Hawley, 1991</xref>), as well as more recent single-molecule footprinting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krebs et al., 2017</xref>). In summary, although all core promoter elements may help recruit TFIID, they may differentially affect the passage of Pol II and its release into productive elongation, dependent on their location at the promoter.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41461.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of how promoter sequences may influence Pol II pausing through TFIID Since the core promoter elements that we analyzed are bound by TFIID, we hypothesize that TFIID affects Pol II pausing dependent on the position it binds to the promoter.</title><p>(A)At stably paused promoters, pausing elements and consensus Inr sequences with a G at +2 position promote TFIID-downstream DNA interactions, which prolong Pol II pausing.

This plasmid-based assay recapitulates the endogenous Pol II dynamics at the promoters tested and has sufficient sensitivity to identify changes in Pol II pausing upon promoter sequence alterations. The simplicity of the assay will no doubt be helpful for further studies on the roles of individual promoter sequences in Pol II pausing, including those of promoter types not studied here.</p><p>In order to perform a more high-throughput analysis on promoter sequences, some improvements in the assay will be beneficial. First, we currently sequence Pol II ChIP-nexus reads genome-wide in order to capture the reads from the plasmid. Any prior enrichment for plasmid sequences will therefore lower the cost of sequencing. Second, if genomic reads can no longer be reliably used as internal control, a control plasmid that monitors transfection efficiency would be useful. Finally, the assay will greatly benefit from automation. This would not only enable more high-throughput analyses but also improve the scope of the assay. Currently, the accuracy and reproducibility of the assay is higher for promoters with longer Pol II half-lives since longer triptolide treatment times reduce experimental fluctuations in handling and drug penetration. If automated, the assay would allow more tightly spaced time-course experiment in multiple replicates, which could more accurately distinguish smaller differences in Pol II half-lives.</p><p>Taken together, reporter-ChIP-nexus promises to open new possibilities for measuring the stability of Pol II pausing at individual promoter sequences in the future. Together with complementary approaches such as live imaging analyses, such studies will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between promoter sequence, Pol II pausing, and the dynamic production of transcripts over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

<italic>Drosophila</italic> Gateway cloning collection was used as the backbone for the reporter plasmid. The <italic>Act5C</italic> core promoter (−41 to 103 bp around the transcription start site, not including the upstream Act5C regulatory sequences, which is −2470 to −42 bp from the transcription start site) and the downstream Gateway cloning cassette (sequence between attR1 and attR2) were removed by digesting with the SacI and AfeI restriction enzymes. A 6 x UAS sequence from pUASp (as found in DGRC #1189) was inserted between the SacI and Afel restriction sites using Gibson Assembly Master Mix. The resulting plasmid pAWG-UAS has the <italic>Act5c</italic> upstream regulatory region, 6 x UAS, a GFP coding sequence and an EcoRV restriction site between the UAS sequences and the GFP coding region. Promoter sequences of interests were inserted into pAWG-UAS at the EcoRV cutting site with Gibson Assembly Master Mix. Subsequent mutations of core promoter sequences were performed with the Q5 site-directed site mutagenesis kit. For plasmid amplification and purification, the DNA was transformed into NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli (High Efficiency) or One Shot ccdB Survival 2 T1R Competent Cells and purified with IBI High Speed Plasmid Mini Kit. Clones were validated with Sanger sequencing using the sequencing primer GCACCGTGACCATCACAGCATA.

Transcription inhibitors were added directly into culture media. Cells were treated with 500 μM Triptolide (TOCRIS Bioscience Cat. No. 3253 dissolved in DMSO) as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017</xref>). Equivalent amounts of DMSO treatment (2% v/v) were used as control. To best capture the stability of paused Pol II, cells were treated with Triptolide for different time after transfecting with different reporter constructs.

Fixed cells were washed with cold PBS, incubated with Orlando and Paro’s Buffer (0.25% triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, with freshly added Protease Inhibitor) for 10 min at room temperature with rotation, and then centrifuged and re-suspended in ChIP Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 140 mM NaCl; 0.1% SDS; 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.5% sarkosyl; 1% Triton X-100, with freshly added Protease Inhibitor). Sonication was performed with a Bioruptor Pico for five rounds of 30 s on and 30 s off. Chromatin extracts were then centrifuged at 16000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and supernatants were used for ChIP.</p><p>To couple Dynabeads with antibodies, 50 µl Protein A and 50 µl Protein G Dynabeads were used for each ChIP-nexus experiment and washed twice with ChIP Buffer. After removing all the liquid, Dynabeads were resuspended in 400 µl ChIP Buffer. 10 µg antibodies were added, and tubes were incubated at 4°C for 2 hr with rotation. After the incubation, antibody-bound beads were washed twice with ChIP Buffer.</p><p>For chromatin immunoprecipitation, chromatin extracts were added to the antibody-bound beads and incubated at 4°C overnight with rotation and then washed with Nexus washing buffer A to D (wash buffer A: 10 mM Tris-EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, wash buffer B: 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5.2% sucrose, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, wash buffer C: 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM HEPES, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM EDTA, wash buffer D: 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM EDTA). End repair and dA-tailing were performed using the NEBNext End Repair Module and the NEBNext dA-Tailing Module. ChIP-nexus adaptors with mixed fixed barcodes (CTGA, TGAC, GACT, ACTG) were ligated with Quick T4 DNA ligase and converted to blunt ends with Klenow fragment and T4 DNA polymerase. The samples were treated with lambda exonuclease and RecJ<sub>f</sub> exonuclease for generating Pol II footprints at high resolution. After each enzymatic reaction, the chromatin was washed with the Nexus washing buffers A to D and Tris buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 8.0, or 9.5, depending on the next enzymatic step).</p><p>After RecJ<sub>f</sub> exonuclease digestion, the chromatin was eluted and subjected to reverse crosslinking and ethanol precipitation. Purified single-stranded DNA was then circularized with CircLigase, annealed with oligonucleotides complementary to the BamHI restriction site and linearized by BamHI digestion. The linearized single-stranded DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and subjected to PCR amplification with NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix and ChIP-nexus primers. The ChIP-nexus libraries were then gel-purified before sequencing with Illumina NextSeq 500.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Reporter-ChIP-nexus</title><p>To transform cells with the reporter plasmid, 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> Kc167 cells were diluted in 10 ml SFX media and seeded into a 10 cm cell culture dish. A mixture of 2.5 µg reporter plasmids, 20 µl FuGENE HD reagent and 500 µl Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium was then added to the cell culture. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 hr at 25°C to allow proper expression of the reporter. ChIP-nexus was performed on the whole cell extracts from transfected cells following standard ChIP-nexus procedure as described above. After sequencing, reporter-ChIP-nexus samples were aligned to the combined genome of dm3 and the specific reporter construct. Only reads that uniquely aligned to the reporter sequence were used for analysis and PCR duplicates with the same ChIP-nexus barcode were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Reporter expression quantification</title><p>Expression of the reporter was quantified by calculating the expression of GFP RNA from the reporter over the expression of the endogenous RNA from the <italic>RpL30</italic> locus, after normalizing for the difference in copy number between the reporter and the endogenous genome.</p><p>For cDNA preparations, 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> transfected cells were transferred into 1.5 ml tubes and washed with cold PBS.

Then, 2 µl Protease K was added to the mixture and incubated at 65°C for 2 hr. The DNA was then purified with an ethanol precipitation. qPCR on both the cDNA and DNA was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix and primers against GFP and <italic>RpL30</italic>.

Two technical replicates (the same biological sample were split into two and processed side by side) were performed during qPCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Gene-specific 5’ RNA sequencing</title><p>This method is similar to 5’ RNA amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) but uses reagents and steps from ChIP-nexus. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> transfected cells as above, and cDNA was generated from the GFP RNA using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and a primer against GFP that has partial TruSeq P5 sequences at the 5’ end (GFP_reversetx_primer). The cDNA was purified by treatment with RNAse A and RNAse H at room temperature for 30 min, followed by ethanol precipitation. The cDNA circularization, cutting and PCR amplification was then performed as in the ChIP-nexus protocol (thus without rolling circle amplifications), except that a new BamHI cutting oligo (reversetx_BamHI_cutting) was annealed before BamHI cutting, and a barcoded P7-GFP fusion primer (reversetx_barcode_primer_#1) was used in the PCR. After sequencing with TruSeq primers, the reads were aligned to the dm3-reporter combined genome, and the first bases of the P5 sequenced reads were recorded as the stop bases of the reverse transcriptase and correspond to the 5’ ends of the GFP RNA from the reporter plasmid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Normalization of Pol II signal on the plasmid</title><p>Due to variations in the transfection efficiency, absolute Pol II signal on different plasmids is not comparable. As a result, paused Pol II stability needs to be accessed by comparing Pol II signal under control and triptolide-treated conditions. Because control and triptolide-treated samples come from the same pool of transfected cells, they have the same transfection efficiency and the same plasmid/Kc167 genome ratio. Therefore, Pol II signal on the plasmids under control and triptolide-treated conditions can be directly compared after normalizing for read counts.</p><p>The changes in Pol II signal after triptolide treatment is calculated in the following way:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Each sample is first normalized to reads/millions to account for differences in read coverage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For each sample, the total Pol II signal is calculated in a 301 bp window around the promoter region on the plasmid (termed Total_Pol_sig).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The change in Pol II signal on the plasmid in response to triptolide treatment is then calculated as the ratio between Total_Pol_sig from the triptolide-treated sample over Total_Pol_sig from the corresponding DMSO-treated control sample.</p></list-item></list><p>It is likely that this method underestimates the changes of Pol II signal between control and triptolide-treated condition since the total occupancy of Pol II is slightly reduced after triptolide treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017</xref>), yet we normalize both samples to equal read counts. However, since the relative loss of Pol II after triptolide treatment is similar across all samples in the Kc167 genome, the relative differences in the above calculated ratio between different plasmids is preserved. For this analysis, two biological replicates (cells were transfected and processed on different dates) were performed using 10<sup>7</sup> transfected cells each.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Correlation between paused Pol II half-lives and core promoter elements</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, promoters with previously measured paused Pol II half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017</xref>) were separated into groups with either one or two of the following core promoter elements: TATA box (STATAWAWR), Inr (TCAKTY) and pausing elements (CSARCSSA, KCGGTTSK or KCGRWCG). Only motif matches at the expected canonical position and with up to one mismatch were allowed (Table S1).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Reporter-ChIP-nexus reveals contribution of initiator sequence to RNA Polymerase II pausing&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the Zeitlinger lab uses ChIP-nexus (a high-resolution form of ChIP-seq developed in the Zeitlinger lab) combined with a reporter system to study the contribution of promoter DNA sequence to the stability of paused polymerase. Using <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> promoters in the reporter plasmid in a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genomic background, they show that initiation, pausing, and the stability of pausing are recapitulated on the plasmids. This is important validation of the usefulness of the system. Promoter swapping and targeted mutagenesis of reporter promoters then yielded three main results: 1) the downstream region of promoters was important for pause stability, 2) a TATA-box is associated with pause instability, and 3) a strong initiator consensus with a G at +2 was critical for pause stability.</p><p>The reviewers all found the ChIP-nexus technique to be powerful, with the potential for high throughput screens with this strategy. However, as presented here, the assay is very low throughput. Incredibly, most of the authors conclusions are drawn from a single perturbation of single test promoter sequence. The work herein is thus considered preliminary, and requires additional validation prior to publication.</p><p>In short, the very limited, highly context-dependent data presented in this manuscript reduces enthusiasm for both the assay and the strength of the authors' conclusions. If concerns can be addressed with additional experiments, however, the reviewers are happy to consider a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must test each of the promoter mutations in several promoter contexts to validate findings. We recommend that every mutation be tested in at least 3 different promoter backgrounds to allow for reasonable confidence in conclusions.</p><p>2) The drug triptolide has been used by a number of groups to measure the stability of paused RNAPII and all data thus far converges towards a median half-life of paused RNAPII on the order of around 5-10 min. Genes that have polymerase remaining at 1 h of triptolide treatment are thus extreme outliers. As such, it is a shame that the authors have selected this type of hyper-stable promoter for use in their assay, as it makes it very difficult- if not impossible- to extrapolate from this extreme case to normal promoter behavior. In the absence of experiments on a more typical promoter, the reviewers are concerned that the results presented here will not be broadly applicable. Thus, when additional promoters are tested, we strongly recommend that the authors select promoters with decay rates more in line with the average gene, and use a more relevant time point for triptolide treatment, on the order of 5-20 min.</p><p>3) To better support the authors claims, they should perform a genomic analysis with their existing data on the stability of pausing at promoters with various combinations of the TATA and Inr elements. They already have the <italic>melanogaster</italic> data from Kc cells +/- triptolide and should have plenty of sequencing depth given the number of plasmids analyzed. Thus, in theory, this would simply require analysis of the genomic reads without additional experimentation. This would serve to corroborate the results and generalize the model to more promoters.</p><p>4) The claim that the reporter assay recapitulates the genomic assay could also use strengthening. This point is supported by 8 genes in the current manuscript, which is probably not enough for statistically rigorous conclusions. Figure 2—figure supplement 2 shows the 8 examples, and there is quite some variability in them. The question is how much variability, how to quantify it, and whether or not conclusions can be made given this variability. Given that a lot of conclusions are drawn from comparing the shapes of these promoter distributions, I would think the extent to which they can be reliably made is important. dve, the gene selected for the majority of mutational tests, is an example that shows differences between genomic and reporter contexts.</p><p>One idea is to bin the promoters into, say 10-20bp bins, and compare the normalized read counts across the bins for the reporter and genomic assay. Then the mean squared error or the correlation coefficient can be computed comparing the reporter and the genomic assay, and the degree of variability can be measured across more genes. This would at least give us some context for how much variability can be expected, and if the differences observed due to the mutations are significantly more than that baseline difference. This analysis or something similar is considered critical.</p><p>5) The novelty of finding a strong initiator at highly paused genes is severely over-exaggerated and previous literature is inadequately cited. The connection between Initiator consensus elements, highly focused transcription initiation and high levels of paused RNAPII has appeared multiple times in the literature previously, at least as far back as 2008 (Hendrix et al., 2008), and also in 2010 (Gilchrist et al., 2010).</p><p>Further, pausing has been recapitulated on DNA sequences in vitro, thus we already know that DNA sequence is a major contributor to pausing. See many in vitro studies from the Gilmour lab (some cited) and also Adelman and Lis (2005).</p><p>Finally, the authors mention in the Discussion that functional data supporting a role for promoter sequences and pausing are missing. While they are correct that there is a dearth of these important functional studies, the Lis lab did a functional analysis pause elements in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hsp70 promoter, by inserting sequences that changed the position of these elements. See Kwak et al., 2013. Given that there are so few studies like this and the level of detail covering other aspects of the literature, I think this experiment is worth discussing in this context.</p><p>It doesn't take anything away from the authors' accomplishments to adequately cite previous research in a scholarly way. Appropriate citations must be added.</p><p>6) Also related to the ambiguity in the number of promoters involved in each analysis: In the section &quot;The Inr strongly contributes to the degree of Pol II pausing&quot;, I think it would be enhanced if the text listed the number of promoters examined for each group. For example, the text says &quot;We first analyzed the naturally occurring Inr sequences from TATA-containing promoters versus those of stably paused promoters&quot;. I would like to know when reading this how many promoters are in each set leading to the observations e.g. that TATA-containing promoters have fewer Gs at the +2 position. In particular, when reading the caption for Figure 5A, it says n=132, and this implied that the other panels also used 132 promoters. However I expect that the other panels were based on a larger set (at least panel B). Ideally, more than 132 promoters would have been used for this analysis. Overall, added clarity on the number of promoter for Figure 5B and elsewhere would be helpful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reporter-ChIP-nexus reveals strong contribution of initiator sequence to RNA Polymerase II pausing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. This evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This revised version of the manuscript &quot;Reporter-ChIP-nexus reveals strong contribution of initiator sequence to RNA Polymerase II pausing&quot; is improved over the previous version as concerns the number of promoters and mutations analyzed. However, the way in which the data is discussed is still lacking in clarity, the caveats to interpretation are still not made clear, and the citation of prior literature is still lacking.</p><p>Thus, the manuscript is not determined to be acceptable in its current format. However, at this point the main criticisms of the work can all be addressed with text changes. Thus, we invite a resubmission if such changes are comprehensively made.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the authors acknowledge in the Introduction, pausing takes place at all (or nearly all) genes. The duration and stability of pausing varies, but pausing appears to be an obligate part of the transcription cycle. Thus, the statement in the Abstract that &quot;a G at the +2 position, is critical for Pol II pausing&quot;, is not accurate. The authors should change this to clarify that they mean 'stable pausing' or something of this sort. But a G and +2 is certainly not critical for the fundamental process of pausing itself.</p><p>2) The authors should note early in the Results section that 1h Triptolide treatment is a very long treatment, and that secondary effects are likely to occur during such extended intervals of transcription inhibition. Most labs use 2-20 minutes of Triptolide treatment to avoid such potential artifacts. We appreciate that the authors must rely on very long treatments to overcome the considerable noise in their assay, but this should be acknowledged as a potential source of artifact, and as a potential limitation to this study. This idea is briefly mentioned in the Discussion, but it must be noted in the Results section to make readers aware of this caveat.</p><p>3) The Bentley lab has recently questioned the interpretation of Triptolide data (in particular that using ChIP-based strategies such as in Shao et al. 17), noting that at some genes the Triptolide-mediated block to initiation traps Pol II at the TSS. This effect is evident at the Pino and pepck genes in this study. The authors should cite the recent work from the Bentley lab, and explain whether their ChIP-nexus assay gives them the spatial resolution needed to separate paused from un-initiated Pol II. This will help place the current work in a proper context, and will be clarifying for the field.</p><p>4) Based on the limited number of experiments aimed at testing the role of downstream promoter sequences, and the limitations in interpreting such experiments, the authors should be more circumspect in the conclusions drawn from these studies. We find it to be an over-reach that the authors conclude that downstream sequences affect pausing less than expected. Given the lack of data to this point, it is safest to note that this wasn't rigorously evaluated, and leave it at that.</p><p>5) We understand that the authors went into this study expecting the TATA box to elicit a strong effect on pausing, and that they were surprised that this is not the case. However, the large amount of inconclusive data presented on this topic, and the discussion thereof, is confusing. If the main conclusion is that TATA doesn't seem to have a strong effect on pause stability, and that any effect is highly context dependent and easily over-ridden by other sequences, then there is a much more straightforward way to present this. We strongly suggest that the authors simplify the presentation of the TATA data to focus on the main conclusion, rather than enumerating all the inconclusive or contradictory findings they obtained.</p><p>6) Given that computational assays have routinely defined the Inr consensus to have a G at +2, should this really be called the Inr-G variant? Instead, we recommend that this be considered the consensus. It should be clarified that this is the 'norm' and not something that deviates from the norm.</p><p>7) The discussion of pausing in its genomic context versus on a plasmid at the beginning of the Discussion is difficult to understand in light of the literature.</p><p>First, there have been a number of studies demonstrating that stable pausing does not involve downstream nucleosomes. The clearest of these demonstrations was Li and Gilmour, EMBO J, 2103). This paper should be cited and the authors should edit the first paragraph to reflect this work, and the fact that it is not at all surprising that pausing could take place on a plasmid or outside of the chromatin context.</p><p>8) It was demonstrated many years ago that pausing is rarely inhibitory in its endogenous context, because of the positive effect of the paused polymerase on maintaining open chromatin (Gilchrist G and D 2008). In this study, it was specifically demonstrated that the positive effect of pausing was clear in the endogenous context, but did not occur on a plasmid. Thus, it has been previously established that the effect of pausing on gene output is different on a plasmid than in the genome, and that any minor inhibitory effect seen on a plasmid is NOT borne out in the endogenous locus. Thus, it is perplexing that the authors claim that pausing is inhibitory based on their reporter assay- since this is known to be an inaccurate read-out of endogenous activity. Thus, the comments in the Discussion suggesting that the +2 G version of Inr would be inhibitory to transcription because it promotes pausing are unfounded and should be removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41461.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must test each of the promoter mutations in several promoter contexts to validate findings. We recommend that every mutation be tested in at least 3 different promoter backgrounds to allow for reasonable confidence in conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now tested 9 additional promoters (2 for downstream pausing elements, 4 for upstream TATA regions, 2 for Inr mutations, 1 ribosomal gene promoter). In addition to these experiments, we have dissected the role of various promoter combinations computationally in more detail and found that these data strengthen and refine our conclusions.</p><p>As expected, we found that the downstream pausing elements stabilize pausing and that addition of a TATA box may reduce pausing. Interestingly though, the effect of TATA is not as strong and consistent as expected, and this can be explained by the strong effect of the Inr sequence (with a G at position +2). Mutating the G at the Inr on the other hand strongly reduces Pol II pausing. Consistent with such strong role in pausing, the type of Inr variant has the strongest correlation with the half-life of paused Pol II among all analyzed elements, an analysis we now added. Therefore, we have not only added additional experiments to support our conclusions, but we have strengthened our finding that the Inr plays an important role in Pol II pausing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The drug triptolide has been used by a number of groups to measure the stability of paused RNAPII and all data thus far converges towards a median half-life of paused RNAPII on the order of around 5-10 min.

However, in order to detect significant differences in half-lives between hybrid promoters, we have to use the more stable paused promoters. This is because the accuracy and reproducibility of the assay is higher for promoters with longer half-lives. For promoters with shorter half-lives, we have to use shorter drug treatment times. As a result, small fluctuations in drug treatment time and drug penetration can produce considerable variability in the results. To accurately measure a half-life in the order of 5-20 min, we would need to perform tightly spaced time-course experiment in many replicates. In the future, this might be possible as we plan to automate the assay and reduce sequencing cost by isolating plasmid DNA. However, with the current low-throughput method, using sequences from stably paused promoters is a more feasible approach for obtaining clear and interpretable results.</p><p>In fact, this is one of the reasons we pioneered this assay in <italic>Drosophila. Drosophila</italic> has a much larger fraction of promoters with clearly defined core promoter sequences that are associated with stable Pol II pausing. While pausing may not be as stable in mammalian genomes, the role of core promoter elements and the interaction between core promoter elements and TFIID is nevertheless conserved. For example, the excellent Cryo-EM structures of TFIID derived by Eva Nogales (Louder et al., 2016, Patel et al., 2018) is human TFIID on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> super core promoter (which includes “pausing elements” such as DPE and MTE). For this reason, we believe that the insights obtained from stably paused promoters will be broadly relevant.</p><p>We have now extensively rewritten the Introduction to better explain our reasoning behind the choice of promoters. In short, they are easy to study and due to known interactions with TFIID, are relevant for mammalian promoters. Finally, we point out current limitations of the assay in our Discussion at the end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To better support the authors claims, they should perform a genomic analysis with their existing data on the stability of pausing at promoters with various combinations of the TATA and Inr elements.

Thus, in theory, this would simply require analysis of the genomic reads without additional experimentation. This would serve to corroborate the results and generalize the model to more promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>We liked the idea of performing a more combinatorial analysis of the promoter elements with regard to the paused Pol II half-lives, and this approach turned out to be very fruitful. While we had previously analyzed the genome-wide relationship between core promoter elements and paused Pol II half-lives (see Shao et al., 2017), we had not specifically looked at how various combinations correlate with Pol II pausing. This new analysis now revealed that the Inr sequence with a G at the +2 position most strongly correlates with pausing, independently of which other core promoter elements are found in the promoter.</p><p>We have now added the results from this new analysis to Figure 4A and Figure 7A with additional information found in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Table S6 in Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The claim that the reporter assay recapitulates the genomic assay could also use strengthening.

They range from 0.77 to 0.96 (mean 0.92), which is very high given that we are not even binning the data into 10-20 bp bins (binning would presumably smooth the data and give higher correlations).</p><p>To strengthen this point even further, we have now in the revised manuscript compared these correlation coefficients to those obtained between biological replicate experiments on the plasmids (Table S2 and S3 in Supplementary file 1). Overall, we found the correlations between plasmid and genomic context to be only slightly lower than those between replicates (on average 0.86 versus 0.92), suggesting that the plasmid recapitulates the genomic Pol II pausing profile remarkably well despite possible differences in chromatin or regulatory context. We have added this result to the main text (subsection “Promoter-specific Pol II pausing properties are recapitulated on the reporter”, fourth paragraph), as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The novelty of finding a strong initiator at highly paused genes is severely over-exaggerated and previous literature is inadequately cited.

However, this association could have been indirect since another pausing element, the DPE, requires the Inr to function properly (see review by Kadonaga, Dev Biol 2012). Due to the possible indirect effect, while the association between DPE (or PB) and pausing is more evident, the role of the Inr has been much less clear. In addition, the role of the Inr in Pol II pausing is further complicated by the observation that the Inr functions synergistically with the TATA box, which is associated with reduced Pol II pausing.</p><p>Regardless of how one interprets these statistical associations, a causal role in Pol II pausing had not been adequately shown for any core promoter element. We believe our results are novel and significant as we provide strong evidence that core promoter elements impact Pol II pausing individually. To the best of our knowledge, such direct functional examinations have not been done before (the spacing experiments by the Lis lab are interesting but do not address which promoter element mediates the observed effects). Furthermore, in the revised manuscript, we not only provide evidence for a direct role of the Inr in Pol II pausing, but we also show that statistically speaking, the G in the Inr plays a dominant role in Pol II pausing, which is quite surprising.</p><p>To provide more clarity for the reader, we have now rewritten the manuscript to better describe what was (or was not) known about the Inr, while citing the requested papers (Introduction, subsection “The Inr strongly contributes to the degree of Pol II pausing”, and subsection “The Inr plays an important role in Pol II pausing”).

To make it easier for the reader, we now describe the selection of the promoters briefly in the main text (subsection “The Inr strongly contributes to the degree of Pol II pausing”) and the Figure 5 legend. Furthermore, we perform a more general analysis of the combinatorial relationship between core promoter elements and pausing half-life (Figure 4A and 7A), which places the above-mentioned figure into context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the authors acknowledge in the Introduction, pausing takes place at all (or nearly all) genes.

However, we have not observed concerning side effects of treating our cells with triptolide for 60 min (see Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017) and note that many investigators have used such extended treatments:</p><p>- The Bentley lab paper cited below used 10-60 min;</p><p>- The Shilatifard lab paper (Chen et al.) used a time-course of up to 120 min and performed most of their further analysis on the 60 min timepoint. Like ours, their control gels on polymerase abundance and phosphorylation show no detectable side effects;</p><p>- The John Lis lab paper (Jonkers et al.) used 12.5 min, 25 min and 50 min timepoints.</p><p>We did not mean to convey the impression in our last response letter that our assay has “considerable noise”. As can be seen from the small error bars in the figures, biological replicates are very reproducible, even when treating for 5 min (Figure 3). Shorter triptolide treatment times may have more noise than longer treatment times, but this could be addressed by performing more replicates. In other words, using 60 min triptolide treatment was not born out of necessity, but a strategic choice, since it allowed us to choose promoters with maximal differences in Pol II pausing stability (and we had not encountered variability or other concerning side effects with 60 min treatment times).</p><p>To be sure, we now mention the better accuracy for longer Pol II half-lives in the Results section: “… we found these measurements to highly reproducible across biological replicates, although the reproducibility is somewhat lower with shorter treatments times of triptolide, presumably because small experimental fluctuations have a larger effect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Bentley lab has recently questioned the interpretation of Triptolide data (in particular that using ChIP-based strategies such as in Shao et al. 17), noting that at some genes the Triptolide-mediated block to initiation traps Pol II at the TSS. This effect is evident at the Pino and pepck genes in this study. The authors should cite the recent work from the Bentley lab, and explain whether their ChIP-nexus assay gives them the spatial resolution needed to separate paused from un-initiated Pol II. This will help place the current work in a proper context, and will be clarifying for the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is curious that this paper seems to suggest that the long Pol II half-lives we observe are due to us measuring Pol II at the initiation site. As we clearly describe in our paper, the high resolution of ChIP-nexus allows us to distinguish paused Pol II from Pol II at the initiation site (Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017). While we observe increased Pol II at the site of initiation after triptolide treatment (this is not a novel finding in the Bentley lab paper), we are specifically measuring the exponential decay of paused Pol II at the site of Pol II pausing to determine the half-life of paused Pol II (the position of pausing is determined based on Pol II pausing after flavopiridol treatment).</p><p>To make this clear in the present paper, we have made the following changes:</p><p>- Introduction: “We recently performed such time-course measurements of paused Pol II across the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome using a high-resolution exonuclease-based ChIP-seq protocol (ChIP-nexus). This assay has the advantage that it distinguishes between Pol II at the site of initiation and pausing, and thus the Pol II half-life calculations are based on paused Pol II, rather than total Pol II at the promoter (Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017).”</p><p>- When we first describe the Pol II profiles after triptolide treatment, we now point out the increased Pol II at the initiation site and cite our paper and the Bentley lab paper: “After 1 hour triptolide treatment, promoters with a Pol II half-life of ~5-10 min show strongly reduced Pol II pausing at the pause position and often show increased levels of Pol II at the site of initiation as previously observed (Shao and Zeitlinger, Erickson et al., 2018). In contrast, stably paused promoters maintain high levels of Pol II at the pausing position with no noticeable increase of Pol II at the site of initiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Based on the limited number of experiments aimed at testing the role of downstream promoter sequences, and the limitations in interpreting such experiments, the authors should be more circumspect in the conclusions drawn from these studies. We find it to be an over-reach that the authors conclude that downstream sequences affect pausing less than expected. Given the lack of data to this point, it is safest to note that this wasn't rigorously evaluated, and leave it at that.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed this section from the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We understand that the authors went into this study expecting the TATA box to elicit a strong effect on pausing, and that they were surprised that this is not the case. However, the large amount of inconclusive data presented on this topic, and the discussion thereof, is confusing. If the main conclusion is that TATA doesn't seem to have a strong effect on pause stability, and that any effect is highly context dependent and easily over-ridden by other sequences, then there is a much more straightforward way to present this. We strongly suggest that the authors simplify the presentation of the TATA data to focus on the main conclusion, rather than enumerating all the inconclusive or contradictory findings they obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extensively revised the text for clarity and have taken out any unnecessary commentary or discussion of the effect of TATA (we also removed TATA from the Abstract). Instead, we focused on the role of the Inr.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given that computational assays have routinely defined the Inr consensus to have a G at +2, should this really be called the Inr-G variant? Instead, we recommend that this be considered the consensus. It should be clarified that this is the 'norm' and not something that deviates from the norm.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a good question, but based on biochemical studies, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Inr consensus motif is TCAKTY, where K stands for T or G, and both the T and G at +2 are equally functional. Furthermore, the G is not over-presented among mammalian promoters, suggesting that the G is not the better nucleotide for Pol II initiation <italic>per se</italic>. The reason computational studies have predominantly found the G variant is presumably because the Inr-G variant is less degenerate, easier to identify and shows increased conservation. Therefore, we believe it is important to point out and emphasize the presence of the G at the +2 position and feel that it conveys the information more precisely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The discussion of pausing in its genomic context versus on a plasmid at the beginning of the Discussion is difficult to understand in light of the literature.</p><p>First, there have been a number of studies demonstrating that stable pausing does not involve downstream nucleosomes. The clearest of these demonstrations was Li and Gilmour, EMBO J, 2103). This paper should be cited and the authors should edit the first paragraph to reflect this work, and the fact that it is not at all surprising that pausing could take place on a plasmid or outside of the chromatin context.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, there are many papers supporting a role for nucleosomes in Pol II pausing, but we agree that this is not a resolved issue and the field is quite split. Since this is not an important point in the paper, we therefore decided to take out this entire section from the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It was demonstrated many years ago that pausing is rarely inhibitory in its endogenous context, because of the positive effect of the paused polymerase on maintaining open chromatin (Gilchrist G and D 2008). In this study, it was specifically demonstrated that the positive effect of pausing was clear in the endogenous context, but did not occur on a plasmid. Thus, it has been previously established that the effect of pausing on gene output is different on a plasmid than in the genome, and that any minor inhibitory effect seen on a plasmid is NOT borne out in the endogenous locus. Thus, it is perplexing that the authors claim that pausing is inhibitory based on their reporter assay- since this is known to be an inaccurate read-out of endogenous activity. Thus, the comments in the Discussion suggesting that the +2 G version of Inr would be inhibitory to transcription because it promotes pausing are unfounded and should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this part of the Discussion as well.</p></body></sub-article></article>
