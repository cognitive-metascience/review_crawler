The ISR can be stimulated by a range of physiological or pathological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brostrom et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dever et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wek et al., 2006</xref>), including hypoxia, amino acid deprivation, glucose/nutrition deprivation, viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dever et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rzymski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Ye et al., 2010</xref>) and intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harding et al., 1999</xref>), which is caused by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins within ER. Furthermore, in the context of cancer biology, oncogene activation can also trigger the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoyelle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hart et al., 2012</xref>). Although the ISR is primarily a pro-survival homeostatic program, aiming to optimize the adaptive cellular response to stress, exposure to severe stress, either in intensity or duration, will overwhelm the capacity of this adaptive response and drive signaling toward cell death.</p><p>The key early controlling step in the ISR is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) by one of four members of eIF2α kinase family: protein kinase R (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), and Heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dever et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2001</xref>). These kinases phosphorylate serine 51 in eIF2α, promoting the formation of a p-eIF2α and eIF2B complex, consequently inhibiting the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sudhakar et al., 2000</xref>). Inactivation of the eIF2 complex leads to a shutdown of global protein synthesis but also the induction of preferential translation of transcripts notably the mRNAs of transcription factors, Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, encoded by <italic>Ddit3</italic>), and other factors with both pro-survival and pro-death functions which aid cell adaption and recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). eIF2α phosphorylation is transient and can be reversed by PPP1R15A (GADD34) or CReP1, the regulatory subunit of eIF2α phosphatases, acting in a negative feedback loop that allows protein synthesis to restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harding et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>). When the stress is intense or prolonged, cells fail to adapt, and apoptosis is triggered. It is likely that the duration and level of eIF2α phosphorylation, as well as ATF4 regulation, determine the balance between cell survival and cell death.</p><p>There are more than 400 human genetic skeletal disorders caused by disrupted cartilage and bone development and growth, commonly resulting in dwarfism and skeletal deformities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geister and Camper, 2015</xref>). Many of these disorders are caused by mutations in genes for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geister and Camper, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonafe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briggs and Chapman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Warman et al., 1993</xref>), and some mutations cause inappropriate folding, processing or export, leading to retention in the ER, affecting the secretory and stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tsang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Posey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">PirogPiróg-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boot-Handford and Briggs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Fertala, 2013</xref>). Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER can overwhelm the protein quality control mechanism, causing proteotoxicity, cell cycle arrest and cell death. Cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which mediates cell survival by slowing protein translation, promoting proteostasis via the proteasome and activating transcription factors that upregulate the production of protein chaperones (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hotamisligil and Davis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horiuchi et al., 2016</xref>]). The UPR employs three arms of sensors in the ER to mediate cell adaptation and survival under ER stress: the key component of the ISR, PERK, inositol-regulated enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hotamisligil and Davis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horiuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Upon ER stress, the PERK-p-eIF2α signaling modulates the cell adaptation via translational control. ATF6 family factors move from the ER to the Golgi, are processed by S1 and S2 proteases, and translocate to the nucleus to activate ER quality control genes such as <italic>Hspa5</italic> (encodes BiP) and <italic>Xbp1</italic> (X-box binding protein 1). IRE1α has kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activities. It catalyzes the splicing of <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA, generating the UPR transcription factor XBP1<sup>S</sup> that upregulates genes encoding chaperones and proteins involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD).</p><p>Human metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS; MIM156500) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the NC1 domain of type X collagen, encoded by <italic>COL10A1</italic> in hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Warman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mäkitie et al., 2005</xref>). In an MCDS transgenic mouse model (13del), carrying a 13 bp deletion in <italic>Col10a1</italic> equivalent to the human mutation, misfolded mutant collagen X induces ER stress suggesting the primary role of ER stress in MCDS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>). Although the chondrocytes survive, their differentiation is reversed by an unknown mechanism to a more juvenile state characterized by the re-expression of prehypertrophic chondrocyte markers (<italic>Ppr</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Col2a1</italic>), disrupting endochondral ossification, and skeletal dysplasia ensues. The causative role of ER stress in MCDS is further supported by studies showing that expression of an exogenous misfolded protein in HCs can induce an MCDS-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rajpar et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the skeletal defects caused by mutations that induce stress or inactivate critical transducers of the stress response in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Julier and Nicolino, 2010</xref>) and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horiuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rajpar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Julier and Nicolino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nundlall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cameron et al., 2015a2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2015b</xref>) strongly implicate components of ER stress-induced UPR pathways involved in chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tsang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horiuchi et al., 2016</xref>). Expression of misfolded cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes results in chondrocyte disorganization and causes Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH), suggesting triggering the UPR may underlie many chondrodysplasias where mutations cause accumulation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Posey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Piróg et al., 2014</xref>). Another example that links ER stress signaling to chondrocyte differentiation is illustrated by studies on BBF2H7, an ER stress transducer. <italic>Bbf2h7</italic> null mutants show severe chondrocyte abnormality due to proliferation and differentiation defects, indicating its essential role for chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, BBF2H7 has been shown to suppress chondrocyte hypertrophy by direct regulation of IHH signaling and the IHH-PTHrP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Saito et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacological stimulation of intracellular proteolysis of mutant collagen X in another MCDS mouse model reduces the level of ER stress, partially ameliorating the dwarfism phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mullan et al., 2017</xref>). However, the rescue of the chondrocyte differentiation defect, expansion of the hypertrophic zone and bone growth was incomplete, suggesting stimulating degradation of misfolded protein alone is not sufficient to address the impact of the ER stress on aberrant cell differentiation.</p><p>The relative contribution of the arms of the UPR and its constituent components to the pathology and a molecular understanding of the consequences of activation of ER stress on cell fate and differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> is lacking. Here by studying MCDS in a mouse model, we sought to clarify the mechanism(s) by which the UPR/ISR causes aberrant differentiation defects which may provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic target(s) for treating this disorder, or other ER stress-related skeletal disorders. We reveal by genetic, biochemical and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional approaches in mouse models, ISR-mediated preferential translation of ATF4 directly activates inappropriate expression of the key transcription factor SOX9. This ectopic SOX9 expression in HCs reverts chondrocyte differentiation, thereby causing MCDS. By targeting the ISR early, at the level of p-eIF2α induction of ATF4, we ameliorate the pathology, thereby providing a rationale pharmacological strategy for treating MCDS and other skeletal disorders caused by activation of the ISR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ER stress-induced UPR disrupts global transcriptome patterns in the chondrodysplastic growth plate</title><p>The mammalian growth plate comprises four major sub-populations of chondrocytes: resting, proliferating (PC), prehypertrophic (pHC) and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC).

Consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>) that the activity of ISRIB is independent of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>), the expression of p-eIF2α was not affected in ISRIB-treated 13del HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Given the fact that translational regulation of ATF4 by p-eIF2α is central to the activation of PERK signaling, the protein expression level of ATF4 in p10 vehicle-treated WT, vehicle- and ISRIB-treated 13del HCs were examined via immunoblotting. As expected, ISRIB evidently inhibited the preferential translation of ATF4 in ER-stressed 13del HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The proximal growth plates from above mentioned groups of mice were further fractionated into sub-populations (PC, pHC, UHC, MHC, and LHC), and the transcriptional expression levels of major components of p-eIF2α signaling (<italic>Atf4, Atf3, Ddit3</italic> and <italic>Fgf21)</italic>, <italic>Xbp1<sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>Hspa5</italic> (<italic>Bip)</italic> were examined by qRT-PCR.

The expression patterns and levels of examined factors involved in the p-eIF2α signaling pathway were further validated via <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Notably, the expression of CHOP and FGF21 was significantly lowered but still detectable. On the other hand, the expression level of total <italic>Xbp1</italic> (<italic>Xbp1<sup>T</sup></italic>) and spliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> (<italic>Xbp1<sup>S</sup></italic>) in ISRIB-treated 13del HCs was comparable to vehicle-treated HCs, indicating IRE1/Xbp1 signaling was barely affected and confirmed the selectivity of ISRIB action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus, the effects of ISRIB on ameliorating 13del MCDS phenotype is Xbp1<sup>S</sup>-independent, and it further supports the redundancy of IRE1/Xbp1 signaling in the pathogenesis of MCDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2015b</xref>). Also, the transcriptional and translational expression levels of ER chaperone BiP(encoded by<italic> Hspa5</italic>) were relatively attenuated in ISRIB-treated 13del HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>), consistent with previous studies showing that PERK-p-eIF2α signaling is required for the activation of BiP upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scheuner et al., 2001</xref>).

Interestingly, inhibition of p-eIF2α signaling by ISRIB at indicated dosage did not induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>) in 13del HCs, with a lowered expression level of ATF4, CHOP and FGF21. This finding highlights the importance of level titration of these factors in the prevention of de-differentiation without causing the death of the stressed chondrocytes.

Taken together, it was therefore essential to address whether manipulating the PERK-p-eIf2α pathway in the scenario of a congenital abnormality caused by the deleterious impact of the ER stress/ISR on skeletal development, could be useful.</p><p>Our findings also illustrate the importance of where in the PERK pathway a therapeutic approach should be taken. Global inhibition of CHOP will not be effective because its inactivation exacerbates the defect. By the same token, given the importance of ATF4 to normal development simply preventing its expression globally would not work therapeutically. Instead, a viable approach would be to target the translational control that leads to its overexpression.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that for a disorder that is caused by the impact of the p-eIF2α signaling on cell fate and differentiation during development, a practical therapeutic approach is to target early in pathway, at the level of p-eIF2α-mediated translation control by specific inhibitors, such as ISRIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). By that, we have shown that ISRIB enfeebled the induction of ATF4 and its downstream target SOX9, prevented the aberrant cell differentiation and consequential dwarfism without obvious side effects. Previously, the selectivity of ISIRIB in targeting translational control of p-eIF2α has been studied by different reports, where it has been used in studies in mice such as treatment of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halliday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wong et al., 2018</xref>), aggressive prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>), in enhancing memory and memory consolidation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>), cognitive deficits after traumatic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2017</xref>) and in rescuing impaired sociability and anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kabir et al., 2017</xref>). ISRIB has also been used to address expression of OPHN1 as a translational downstream target of p-eIF2α that is associated with mGluR-LTD-linked cognitive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>). Here, the effect of ISRIB on the aberrant differentiation of ER-stressed HCs reveals its action on antagonizing preferential translation of ATF4, and consequent SOX9 induction to reverse or prevent the abnormal cell fate change in disease.</p><p>Interestingly, by the treatment of ISRIB at the indicated dosage, the enfeebled action of p-eIF2α did not induce apoptosis, with lowered but detectable expression of ATF4, CHOP and downstream target FGF21. This finding reveals, in the context of the 13del mutation, the dominance of dedifferentiation in the pathogenesis of MCDS. Notably, PERK was reported to have a role in pancreatic β cells under physiological ER stress conditions, via regulating β cell proliferation/development, proinsulin production/trafficking, insulin secretion and protecting the cells from tolerable ER stress in an ATF4-dependent manner. However, continuous eIF2α phosphorylation induces β cell death via activating ATF4-CHOP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Oslowski C and Urano, 20102011</xref>). These findings strongly suggest PERK/ISR signalling pathway may behave as a binary switch between life and death in organ homeostasis. By finding the dosage of ISRIB that titrates ATF4-CHOP levels and is protective for de-differentiation, without causing the death of the stressed chondrocytes, the dualism inherent in the PERK signaling may be exploited therapeutically. Our study may also reflect the possibility that other potential translational downstream target(s) of p-eIF2α may be involved in the cell death induction in 13del HCs upon stress and act upstream of CHOP and FGF21.</p><p>The inability of FGF21 expressing 13del HCs to protect 13del;<italic>Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs from apoptosis in mouse chimeras suggests FGF21 cell autonomously protects HCs from apoptosis. Interestingly, our microarray analyses show that <italic>blk</italic>, the gene encoding beta-klotho, which is required for FGF21-mediated receptor binding and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kurosu et al., 2007</xref>), is not expressed in 13del HCs, suggesting that ISR-induced FGF21 may function in a FGFR1/beta-klotho-independent manner to enable the HCs survival. The lack of <italic>blk</italic> expression in 13del HCs suggest the pro-survival role of FGF21 in ER stressed HCs could be non-canonical. It has been reported that FGF21 reduces the concentrations of the active form of STAT5, a major mediator of growth hormone actions, lowers the expression of IGF-1, but induces the expression of IGF-1 binding protein one to blunt growth hormone signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inagaki et al., 2008</xref>). Our microarray data show that the expression levels of these FGF21 targets were comparable between WT and 13del HCs. FGF21 is a biomarker for mitochondrial translation and mtDNA maintenance disorders, and a stress-induced myokine in mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lehtonen et al., 2016</xref>). FGF21 is also proposed to be a critical metabolic mediator of ISR presumably causing systemic metabolic improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keipert et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, FGF21 has been reported to protect the mouse liver and brain against d-gal-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis via activating Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yu et al., 2015a2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yu et al., 2015b2015b</xref>). Analyses of the proteome of 13del HCs has implicated the potential role of the ER-mitochondria pathway in chondrocyte survival by a mechanism whereby changes in ER-mitochondria communication reduce import of calcium coupled to maintenance of mitochondrial membrane polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kudelko et al., 2016</xref>). Our transcriptome data show that oxidative stress was triggered in 13del HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). It will therefore be important to study the intrinsic roles of ISR-induced FGF21 in mitochondria homeostasis and in regulating oxidative stress-related apoptosis.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that while ISRIB treatment significantly improved the pathological phenotype of 13del MCDS mice, mutant type X collagen was still detectable and therefore some residual ER stress was present. Consistent with residual ER stress in ISRIB-treated HCs is the persistent expression of ATF4, albeit at lowered levels, which may account for incomplete rescue. Likewise rescue by CBZ treatment was only partial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mullan et al., 2017</xref>). It would be important in future to test whether a strategy of addressing both aberrant cell differentiation and enhancing mutant protein degradation by combined treatment with ISRIB and CBZ, could achieve complete rescue of MCDS and other skeletal disorders associated with the UPR/ISR. In addition, the relative poor solubility of ISRIB might have limited its bioavailability <italic>in vivo</italic>. A recent study of ISRIB treatment in prostate cancer model showed improved bioavailability of ISRIB by using HPMT vehicle solution (0.5% w/v hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose dissolved in water plus 0.2% v/v Tween80, adjusted to pH 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). For future studies, it would be important to test whether ISRIB dissolved in HPMT will result in improved alleviation of MCDS and other ISR-related disorders.</p><p>Our studies have shown that ISRIB is effective in ameliorating the chondrodysplastic defects by treatment in the fetal and postnatal periods where the growth plate is most active as rapid growth occurs. We did not test if ISRIB treatment would be able to reverse the dwarfism, if given after maturity and cessation of skeletal growth. It should be noted, however, that the expression of 13del transgene reduces postnatally around 3 weeks and stops expressing in HCs at around 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>). We previously showed that postnatally, the intensity of ER stress signalling correlates with levels of 13del expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>). This would mean that in a scenario where the ER stress is relieved, treating adult 13del mice with ISRIB may not be effective in overcoming the dwarfism. Therefore, prevention of aberrant HC differentiation during the growth phase should be more effective therapeutically than once growth has ceased in maturity.</p><p>Our study has implications for other disorders. ER stress and the ISR are also implicated in intervertebral disc degeneration, which is very common in humans, and a major cause of low back pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, an important question arising is whether activation of the ISR and its associated ectopic expression of ATF4 and its downstream targets such as <italic>Sox9</italic> may underlie common skeletal diseases such as intervertebral disc degeneration and osteoarthritis.</p><p>The direct activation of <italic>Sox9</italic> by ATF4, also may have broad implications for other diseases. SOX9 is a potent transcription factor with critical roles in cell fate determination, not only in chondrocytes but also in many different cell types, notably stem cells (dermal papilla, gonads, intestinal and neural, etc.)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Posey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pritchett et al., 2011</xref>) and is activated in other common and acquired diseases such as cancer and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pritchett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athwal et al., 2017</xref>). Ectopic expression of SOX9 has been widely reported to mediate ECM deposition, such as collagens and other structural proteins, in the pathology of fibrosis in multiple organs, including the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athwal et al., 2017</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 1864</xref>), lung and myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lacraz et al., 2017</xref>). These observations of ectopic and/or over expression of SOX9 raise questions about the upstream role of the ISR in the pathogenesis and/or progression of these diseases. Also, SOX9 directly activates the ER stress transducer BBF2H7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hino et al., 2014</xref>) with added implications for those diseases where ectopic or over-expression of SOX9 has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pritchett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lacraz et al., 2017</xref>) Therefore, whether targeting eIF2a-mediated translation control could be a general therapeutic strategy for ISR-associated common human diseases is another important question that should be addressed in future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Cultured cells or limbs dissected from E15.5 WT and <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> embryos were homogenized and crosslinked. DNA was sonicated and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-ATF4 (sc-200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-CHOP (sc-575, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. The pull-down DNA was purified and analyzed by PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis</title><p>Cartilages isolated from the mice were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and then lysed with RIPA buffer. The lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and probed with FGF21 and beta-actin antibody. For drug-treated animals, the proximal part of the tibia was embedded in RIPA buffer for cryosection. Transverse sections (5 μm thick) were cut and pooled into fractions consisting of 10 sections per fraction to ensure separation of each cell type in the growth plates before further lysed in RIPA. The lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and probed with ATF4, BiP (ADI-SPA-826, Enzo) and beta-actin (A2228, Sigma) antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Dual-luciferase reporter assay</title><p>Luciferase assays were conducted using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Different promoter fragments of <italic>Sox9</italic> or <italic>Fgf21</italic> were cloned into a pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to drive the expression of firefly luciferase. ATDC5 (RCB0565, RIKEN, Wako, Japan) or NIH3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were plated at 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 24-well plates. After 18 hr incubation, the cells were transfected with tested constructs with <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase vector, which served as an internal control. Data presented are ratios of Luc/Renilla activity from at least three different experiments, and each experiment was performed in triplicate for each DNA sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR-Green master mixture according to the manufacturer's instruction (Takara). Appropriate amounts of cDNA (or DNA) and primers were mixed with distilled water up to 10 μl and combined with an equal amount of SYBR-Green master mixture. The reaction was run on the StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, A and B). The Ct (cycle threshold) is defined as the cycle number required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold. The relative expression levels of target genes are calculated by normalizing to the expression level of GAPDH using delta-delta-Ct (Relative expression level = 2^ - (Ct<sub>target</sub>- Ct<sub>Gapdh</sub>)). The melting curve was also measured to detect the specificity of the primers. The primers used for qRT-PCR were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ISRIB treatments</title><p>ISRIB (SML0843, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 5 mg/ml stock and stored at 4-degree.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Clifford J Rosen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor (BRE) has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There was general enthusiasm for this manuscript from all four reviewers. It breaks new ground in understanding the reversion of chondrocyte hypertrophy via the PERK pathways and enhanced secretion of ATF4 and CHOP and transactivation of <italic>Sox9</italic>. However, there were concerns that need to be addressed in the full revision as noted below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify whether FGF-21 works in a cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous manner on chondrocytes and whether there is a phenotype in the <italic>Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice.</p><p>2) Redo the statistics using ANOVA rather than t- tests, which are not appropriate.</p><p>3) Specify the selectivity of ISRIB and how it was solubilized; also address whether the authors used it in older mice at skeletal maturity.</p><p>4) Clarify mouse backgrounds, sex, numbers and age.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, Wang and colleagues exploited a mouse model of Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) to examine provide the impact of the (Integrated Stress Response) ISR on cell fate. They showed the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway that mediated preferential synthesis of ATF4 and CHOP, dominated the mechanism of dysplasia by reverting chondrocyte differentiation via ATF4 directed transactivation of <italic>Sox9</italic>. Chondrocyte survival is enabled by CHOP, often considered a death promoter, and transactivation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> by the dual action of CHOP and ATF4. Treatment of mutant mice with a chemical inhibitor of PERK signaling prevented the differentiation defects and ameliorated chondrodysplasia. The authors concluded that inhibition of the ISR could become the cornerstone of a rationale therapeutic strategy for stress-induced skeletal disorders.</p><p>Overall the paper is well written, the methods are clearly spelled out and the genetic studies are well described and logical. The mechanisms of the integrated stress response are complex, but the authors have systematically approached this by using network and pathways analysis to identify downstream pathways related to PERK, particularly ATF4 and CHOP to induce de-differentiation but excluding XBP1 in the UPR. The mouse model of 13del MCDS provides a useful model of misfolded mutant collagen X inducing an ER stress suggesting its primary role in the pathogenesis of the mutation. Their data that increases in ATF4 and CHOP through FGF21 contribute to the de-differentiation phenotype are relatively compelling; loss of function and gain of function studies provide further support for their central tenet. However, there are a few concerns:</p><p>Of major importance there is no sex mentioned for the mice; the mouse numbers are small (n=5) and the mouse backgrounds are quite different. All this may contribute to some phenotypic differences; The Chop<sup>-/-</sup> mice are either 129 or CD1 mixed backgrounds, crossed with the 13del which are B6xCBA F1 hybrids; and then the crosses with <italic>Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> that are on a B6 background. And there are no data on the <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> Tg. So much more explanation of the crosses is required and how the mixed background that result from these crosses could contribute to the growth plate phenotypes.</p><p>FGF21 plays a critical role in the mutational phenotype in respect to survival; it would be useful to show the absence of a growth plate phenotype in the FGF21 null mice. Also, for Figure 6D qRT-PCR should be shown rather than the relative expression by micro array.</p><p>It’s not clear from the figure if in the 13del mice only <italic>Sox9</italic> is upregulated; particularly relevant would be changes in Gli 2,3 which have promoter sites for binding by ATF4; moreover, were the gene expression changes checked by qRT-PCR or only by micro array; that needs clarification in the legend.</p><p>How specific is ISRIB as an inhibitor of the Integrated stress response?</p><p>Also, the rescue of 13del wit ISRIB was not complete and as noted there was still mutant collagen X present. Can the authors provide some insight into other potential mechanisms for the incomplete skeletal rescue if indeed the major pathway is through PERK?</p><p>The body length phenotype is of interest in the <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> Tg; is it due to increases in vertebrae growth plate; intervetebral discs? Can the authors elaborate on that phenotype.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I am very supportive of this study, but feel some minor revisions would improve the manuscript.</p><p>This study addresses the role of eIF2α phosphorylation and its downstream effects in the pathogenesis of chondrodysplasia caused by a 13 bp deletion within the <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene. The authors identify the unfolded protein response to be induced in bone growth plates from mutant mice; ectopic expression of ATF4 is then shown to phenocopy some features of the chondrodysplasia by driving loss of chondorcyte differentiation; and haploinsufficiency for <italic>Sox9</italic> (a target of ATF4) is shown to rescue the bone defects cause by mutant <italic>Col10a1</italic> or over-expression of ATF4. In contrast, loss of Chop (another ATF4 target) is shown to exacerbate the bone growth defect. Induction of FGF21 by ATF4 and CHOP is shown to promote the survival of hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing mutant <italic>Col10a1</italic>. The eIF2B-activating drug ISRIB is then used to rescue much of the bone phenotype of <italic>Col10a1</italic> mutant mice. Finally, evidence is presented suggesting ISRIB reduces signalling downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation.</p><p>This is a substantial piece of work comprising many well-conducted experiments. It will be of interest to researchers in the fields of the integrated stress response and of bone development. The beneficial effects of CHOP on chondrocyte survival are especially interesting since they chime with previous studies (see below).</p><p>1) Some of the experiments are presented as single examples (Figure 2A and E, Figure 3A and C, Figure 6A-D, Figure 8) albeit sometimes at multiple time points. Are repeats available and, if so, can the reproducibility of these effects be displayed in a quantitative form with statistical analysis? This is especially relevant to Figure 8B where the data quality is less good than elsewhere in this manuscript.</p><p>2) Could the authors comment on any solubility issues with ISRIB that may have impacted its bioavailability? This drug is somewhat notorious for its difficulty to dissolve in biologically compatible solutions.</p><p>3) The wording &quot;ATF4 was also insignificantly lowered&quot; subsection “The PERK-p-eIF2α signaling pathway is downregulated explicitly by treatment of ISRIB” should probably be changed if the statistical test showed no difference. There is no need for Atf4 mRNA to be affected since the effects of ISRIB would be on ATF4 translation rather than transcription.</p><p>4) I am not convinced that Student's t-tests, which are used frequently herein, are always appropriately used. Statistical advice ought to be sought, and at the very least adjustments made for multiple comparisons. Analysis of variance with a subsequent post-hoc test would seem more appropriate to this reviewer. This is especially true for Figure 8 but is relevant in several other experiments where t-tests alone appear to have been employed.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study, the authors have further examined the pathogenesis of Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS), using the 13del mouse model. The mutant mice carry a 13 bp deletion in <italic>Col10a1</italic> and mimic the human condition genetically and phenotypically, including intracellular accumulation of misfolded Col X that leads to ER stress, growth plate chondrocyte malfunction and skeletal growth retardation. Using a combination of transcriptome, biochemical and transgenic approaches, the authors found that the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway -a component of the integrated stress response (ISR)- was activated in mutant growth plates and was associated with increased expression of ATF4 and CHOP. Aberrant ATF4 production likely caused broad and excessive <italic>Sox9</italic> expression, delaying growth plate chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophy, causing chondrocyte accumulation and growth plate lengthening, and impairing endochondral ossification and skeletal growth. Indeed, conditional ablation of <italic>Sox9</italic> using ColX-cre mice ameliorated the skeletal and growth plate phenotype of the 13del mice. The authors tested a pharmacological ISR inhibitor that blocks the action of phosphorylated eIF2α and found that systemic drug administration ameliorated the growth plate and skeletal phenotype of juvenile 13del mice. The authors conclude that pharmacological inhibition of the ISR may represent a rational therapeutic strategy for stress-related skeletal conditions.</p><p>The study is of significant interest since the pathogenesis of MCDS and related pathologies remains poorly understood. The study describes a very large and impressive body of experimental studies and provides several lines of evidence that the aberrant behavior of growth plate chondrocytes in the 13del mice is due to excessive and lingering expression of <italic>Sox9</italic>, a key transcription factor that is normally tightly regulated to permit growth plate chondrocyte maturation and a seamless transition from hypertrophic cartilage to endochondral bone. Providing evidence that a pharmacological agent targeting ISR elicits beneficial effects on skeletal growth in the mutants adds significant translational medicine value and relevance to the study.</p><p>Concerns are minor.</p><p>The authors should provide details of how the growth plate chondrocytes were fractionated into 3 or 4 subpopulations before their use in the transcriptome analyses. Because the data are used to reach mechanistic implications, it is important to show that each fraction was in fact composed by a distinct subpopulation. This is particularly important for 13del samples; given that the mutant growth plates contained abnormal distribution of <italic>Sox9-, col2</italic>- and <italic>Ihh</italic>-expressing cells, the cells may have been more difficult to separate into distinct subpopulations if they had intermediate cell phenotypes (volume, shape, etc.).</p><p>The data on FGF21 are of particular interest. <italic>Fgf21</italic> was found to be the most up-regulated gene in 13del hypertrophic chondrocytes, and <italic>Fgf21</italic> deletion in 13del mice led to increased apoptosis in the hypertrophic zone. The authors suggest that the excess levels of FGF21 protected the 13del mutant chondrocytes from apoptosis. Do the authors have data on how such protection occurred and whether the fate of hypertrophic cells was altered in the compound mutant mice, including possible consequences on primary spongiosa? Based on data presented, it appears that FGF21 has no role in WT growth plates. Could the authors comment on this?</p><p>The apparent beneficial effects of the ISR inhibitor on the 13del skeletal phenotype are promising, but appear to be modest. Also, only juvenile mice (up to p20) were examined. Did the authors try different drug regimens or administration routes to improve efficacy? Could beneficial effects be elicited in older mice up to skeletal maturity around 2-3 months of age? If treatment was stopped at P20 and mutant mice were followed over time, what happened to their skeletal phenotype?</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>This study uses a mouse model of Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) to investigate how the integrated stress response affects chondrocyte cell differentiation. This is a comprehensive and insightful study that begins to address the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which 13del mutation in <italic>Col10a1</italic> causes skeletal dwarfism. The authors identify protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) as a molecule that regulates ATF4 and CHOP to regulate chondrocyte differentiation and survival. The authors show that activation of the unfolded protein response leads to expression of ATF4 and activation of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression, which represses chondrocyte differentiation. They also show that ATF4 and CHOP promote chondrocyte survival by activating FGF21 and that FGF21 is necessary for cell survival. Finally, they show that a small molecule inhibitor, ISRIB, reduces the dwarfism phenotype of 13del mice.</p><p>When Atf4 is overexpressed, Col10a1 expression is greatly decreased. How is the HC zone actually defined in this model? Why is <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> not itself downregulated?</p><p>If chondrocytes have impaired differentiation, does this mean that they retain features of proliferating or prehypertrophic chondrocytes? Does chondrocyte proliferation extend into this undifferentiated and expanded HC zone?</p><p>The expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> could be quantified in Figure 5C. Is expression per cell changed or just number of cells?</p><p>Figure 6D does not make sense. The text says 40% decrease in <italic>Fgf21</italic> in 13del; CHOP<sup>-/-</sup> mice; however, the red line is above the green line in the figure?</p><p>The potential role of FGF21 in cell survival is interesting; however, given the long range signaling abilities of FGF21, it should be shown whether FGF21 is acting locally on HCs or indirectly through another factor and non HC tissue. Is beta-klotho expression changed in HCs and is <italic>FGFR1</italic> responsible for supporting cell survival in 13del HCs? Given that <italic>Fgf21</italic> was highly increased, could it have effects other that mediating the ISR? Does FGF21 regulate growth hormone signaling through STAT5, IGF-1, or IGF-1 binding protein (see PMC2575072, PMC3406689).</p><p>Although probably beyond the scope of this study, it may be interesting to see how the 13del mouse responds to FGF21 treatment at the growth plate. Is there a direct effect on ERK phosphorylation?</p><p>Figure 8B Blot is of low quality. The actin bands are not consistent. This could explain the differences seen between UHC and LHC. Quantification of this expression data would help especially for BIP.</p><p>Figure 9. It would be helpful to also indicate the suppressive effect of ISRIB on eIF2B and subsequently ATF4.</p><p>Figure 9—figure supplement 1D.

In our paper we have shown that expression of <italic>Fgf21</italic> is activated as a consequence of ER stress in 13del HCs and this has a survival effect. To determine whether the pro-survival role of FGF21 was cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous in 13del hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs), we tested the survival of 13del HCs carrying an <italic>Fgf21</italic> null mutation, in mouse chimeras. We utilised compound mutants carrying the 13del transgene and a <italic>Col10a1<sup>Egfp</sup></italic> allele [<italic>Egfp</italic> knocked into the <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene (Tsang et al., 2007)] so that all 13del HCs are marked by GFP expression. We created mouse chimeras by aggregating <italic>13del;Col10a1<sup>Egfp</sup></italic>and <italic>13del;Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> morulae. In the ensuing chimeras, 13del HCs are marked by EGFP expression, and express <italic>Fgf21</italic>. Mice with different degrees of <italic>13del;Col10a1<sup>Egfp</sup>:13del;Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chimerism, were analysed for HC survival. We found that <italic>13del;Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCsadjacent to <italic>13del;Col10a1<sup>EGFP</sup></italic>HCs expressing FGF21 still underwent apoptosis. In Figure S9D-F, we also show that the differentiation defect in 13del HCs was unchanged in HCs unable to express <italic>Fgf21</italic> at p10, indicating the observed cell fate change was FGF21-independent. These results are described in subsection “ATF4 and CHOP mediate chondrocyte survival by activating <italic>Fgf21”</italic>.</p><p>This inability of <italic>13del;Col10a1<sup>Egfp</sup></italic> to rescue <italic>13del;Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCssuggests that FGF21 works in a cell autonomous manner to protect the cell from apoptosis (new Figure 7C-E). We further show that <italic>Fgf21</italic> null mice have normal growth plates and HC viability (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These results are described in subsection “ATF4 and CHOP mediate chondrocyte survival by activating <italic>Fgf21”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Redo the statistics using ANOVA rather than t- tests, which are not appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment and advice. We have used Two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test to test for statistical significance in all mouse phenotypic analyses. This is a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that it is equally likely that a randomly selected value from one sample will be less than or greater than a randomly selected value from a second sample. Using this test, there is no change in outcome. We used Unpaired Two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test in the luciferase assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Specify the selectivity of ISRIB and how it was solubilized; also address whether the authors used it in older mice at skeletal maturity.</p></disp-quote><p>The specific action of ISIRIB in targeting the translational control of p-eIF2α has been reported by different studies viz neurodegeneration (Dever et al., 1992; Harding et al., 2003), prostate cancer (Ron, 2002), memory enhancing (Wek, Jiang and Anthony, 2006; García, Meurs and Esteban, 2007), cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury (Rzymski et al., 2010) and in rescuing of impaired sociability and anxiety-like behaviour (Ye et al., 2010). Biochemically, via a cell-base screen for inhibitors or PERK signaling, ISRIB (Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor) was identified as an effective inhibitor of ISR, that potently (IC<sub>50</sub>=5nM) reverses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation (Wek, Jiang and Anthony, 2006).</p><p>In our paper we show ISRIB selectively functions as an inhibitor of ATF4 induction under ER-stress induced PERK signalling pathway (Figure 9). Consistent with the specific action on the PERK arm of the UPR, the ER stress induced degradation pathway mediated by IRE1, is not affected, as reflected by the unchanged expression level of XBP1<sup>S</sup>, as well as the persistent intracellular accumulation of 13del mutant protein.</p><p>In this study, the ISRIB was dissolved in DMSO to make a stock solution of 5mg/ml which was freshly diluted 10-fold with saline, for daily injection. We agree that the solubility of ISRIB has room for improvement, which may give a better therapeutic efficacy. In a recent prostate cancer study, we note that HPMT vehicle solution (0.5% w/v hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose dissolved in water plus 0.2% v/v Tween80, adjusted to pH 4) was used with favourable effect (Ron, 2002). This point has been discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>In our current study we have focused on using ISRIB to identify the upstream cause of the chondrocyte differentiation defect and also to test the utility of ISRIB in ameliorating or preventing the skeletal defect. We agree it would be interesting to know if treating mature MCDS mice with ISRIB could have utility in arresting or reversing the dwarfism but such study would take a long time and is outside the scope of our current study. It should be noted however that the 13del transgene reduces postnatally around 3 weeks and stops expressing in HCs at around 4-wk (Brostrom et al., 1996). We previously showed that the intensity of ER stress signalling correlates with levels of 13del expression (Brostrom et al., 1996). This would mean that in a scenario where the ER stress is relieved, such experiment on 13del mice may not be informative. Certainly, prevention of aberrant HC differentiation during the growth phase should be more effective therapeutically than once growth has ceased in maturity. This point has been discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clarify mouse backgrounds, sex, numbers and age.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we compared 13del vs. <italic>13del;Ddit3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, 13del vs. <italic>13del;Sox9<sup>c/c</sup>, C10-Atf4</italic> vs. <italic>C10-Atf4;Sox9<sup>c/c</sup></italic>and <italic>13del</italic> vs. <italic>13del; Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup></italic>. These comparisons were conducted between littermates only, so that any animal of desired genotype is only compared to its control littermates Furthermore, for each compound double or triple mutant mice, we used mice that had been inbred for &gt;10 generation before any evaluation, to avoid genetic background issues. For clarification, we have described the genetic background and sampling methodology in the revised manuscript (subsection “Genetically modified mice and mutant analysis”). We did not observe any sex-associated phenotypic differences in MCDS, and the sex of test animals was randomized in this study. The number and age of test animals are now clarified in the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Of major importance there is no sex mentioned for the mice; the mouse numbers are small (n=5) and the mouse backgrounds are quite different.

And there are no data on the <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> Tg. So much more explanation of the crosses is required and how the mixed background that result from these crosses could contribute to the growth plate phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential Revision #4.

To improve the efficacy of ISRIB, the HPMT vehicle solution (as discussed in response to comment 3) could be tested in future studies. We thank the reviewer for the comment and have further elaborated on all these points in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The body length phenotype is of interest in the <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> Tg; is it due to increases in vertebrae growth plate; intervetebral discs?

The drawfism of <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> is correlated with the abnormalities in the growth plates of both the appendicular and axial skeleton (subsection “ATF4 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes reprogrammes differentiation”).

Are repeats available and, if so, can the reproducibility of these effects be displayed in a quantitative form with statistical analysis? This is especially relevant to Figure 8B where the data quality is less good than elsewhere in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. All these experiments were biologically repeated (n=3 or 5) and the representative figures were shown.

Statistical advice ought to be sought, and at the very least adjustments made for multiple comparisons. Analysis of variance with a subsequent post-hoc test would seem more appropriate to this reviewer. This is especially true for Figure 8 but is relevant in several other experiments where t-tests alone appear to have been employed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment and advice. We have used Two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U-</italic>test to test for statistical significance in all mouse phenotypic analyses and Unpaired Two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test in the luciferase assay.

Because the data are used to reach mechanistic implications, it is important to show that each fraction was in fact composed by a distinct subpopulation. This is particularly important for 13del samples; given that the mutant growth plates contained abnormal distribution of Sox9-, col2- and Ihh-expressing cells, the cells may have been more difficult to separate into distinct subpopulations if they had intermediate cell phenotypes (volume, shape, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. The fractionation methodology is described in our recent paper (Tan et al., 2018), and is now elaborated on in the revised Materials and methods section as below: In brief, chondrocyte sub-populations in transverse sections of the proximal tibia of 10-day-old WT or 13del mouse were obtained by cryosectioning. 5-micron sections were prepared and pooled into fractions consisting of 10 sections per fraction to ensure separation of each cell type in the growth plate. Samples were dissolved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. To guide the subdivision of chondrocyte populations into zones, every 10th section was examined histologically and 10% of the RNA isolated from sections selected at regular intervals was used for the detection of known growth plate markers by RT-PCR analyses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data on FGF21 are of particular interest. Fgf21 was found to be the most up-regulated gene in 13del hypertrophic chondrocytes, and Fgf21 deletion in 13del mice led to increased apoptosis in the hypertrophic zone. The authors suggest that the excess levels of FGF21 protected the 13del mutant chondrocytes from apoptosis. Do the authors have data on how such protection occurred and whether the fate of hypertrophic cells was altered in the compound mutant mice, including possible consequences on primary spongiosa? Based on data presented, it appears that FGF21 has no role in WT growth plates. Could the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our detailed response to Essential Revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The apparent beneficial effects of the ISR inhibitor on the 13del skeletal phenotype are promising, but appear to be modest. Also, only juvenile mice (up to p20) were examined. Did the authors try different drug regimens or administration routes to improve efficacy? Could beneficial effects be elicited in older mice up to skeletal maturity around 2-3 months of age? If treatment was stopped at P20 and mutant mice were followed over time, what happened to their skeletal phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising up these critical points for optimizing the preclinical study of ISRIB in MCDS treatment, which are also our current research goals. The mice at different stages will be studied and followed-up for different time periods. Please note our response in Essential Revision #3 above to improve the vivo bioavailability of ISRIB and testing ISRIB in older mice. Please note that 13del transgene expression is greatly diminished at around 4 weeks. However by that age the dwarfism is well established and the 13del mice remain dwarfed. This is consistent with a permanent impact of the ER stress during the developmental period and the phase of rapid postnatal growth mediated by the growth plate. Therefore after growth slows, the level of ER stress should be reduced and one would not expect any further change. This point has been discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4: […] When Atf4 is overexpressed, Col10a1 expression is greatly decreased. How is the HC zone actually defined in this model? Why is <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> not itself downregulated?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>C10-Atf4</italic> is a BAC transgene in which <italic>Atf4</italic> is inserted into <italic>Col10a1</italic> but is controlled by the regulatory elements of the <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene. We have shown that the BAC transgene recapitulates the HC specificity of expression. However, <italic>Col10-Atf4</italic> was not downregulated probably because the transgene may have integrated into a transcriptionally active site and could be in multiple copies, hence the expression of ATF4 is robust. However, in these transgenic mice the expression level of the endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene (diagnostic of the HC identity) is decreased in <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> mice because this is a reflection of the abnormal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation caused by ATF4 over-expression. However, since its expression was not totally abolished, we used this to help us to define the HZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If chondrocytes have impaired differentiation, does this mean that they retain features of proliferating or prehypertrophic chondrocytes? Does chondrocyte proliferation extend into this undifferentiated and expanded HC zone?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have performed BrdU labelling analysis on <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> mice (two hours before sacrifice) and observed that these <italic>C10-Atf4</italic> HCs were BrdU-negative (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F) (subsection “ATF4 reprograms chondrocyte hypertrophy by directly activating <italic>Sox9”</italic>).

We have corrected this labelling mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The potential role of FGF21 in cell survival is interesting; however, given the long range signaling abilities of FGF21, it should be shown whether FGF21 is acting locally on HCs or indirectly through another factor and non HC tissue. Is beta-klotho expression changed in HCs and is FGFR1 responsible for supporting cell survival in 13del HCs? Given that Fgf21 was highly increased, could it have effects other that mediating the ISR? Does FGF21 regulate growth hormone signaling through STAT5, IGF-1, or IGF-1 binding protein (see PMC2575072, PMC3406689).</p><p>Although probably beyond the scope of this study, it may be interesting to see how the 13del mouse responds to FGF21 treatment at the growth plate. Is there a direct effect on ERK phosphorylation?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response in Essential Revision #1 above. Interestingly, HCs do not express beta-klotho and the expression level of STAT5, IGF-1 and IGF-1 binding protein was not changed in 13del HCs, examined by microarray (data not shown), suggesting that the pro-survival role of FGF21 in ER stressed HCs could be noncanonical.

This is the only remaining issue prior to acceptance and we ask that the authors more fully justify the use of the Mann-U Whitney test, particularly as it relates to multiple comparisons in Figure 8 vs the more standard and accepted one way or in some cases two way ANOVA. We recommend that you consult a statistician for your response. Once this is resubmitted, we can rapidly make a final decision.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment and advice. We have consulted a biostatistics expert. He pointed out that ANOVA (or t-test) is very robust to non-normality as long as the group sizes are close to being equal. He would only advise the use of Mann-Whitney when there is very gross violation of normality (e.g. clear outlying observations) and when the group sizes are grossly unequal. In our data the groups being compared are of similar size and there are no clear outliers. Thus, we expected ANOVA to be robust. Indeed, when we performed ANOVA on our ISRIB treatment data, we found that all the results are very similar to our previous results from Mann-Whitney. As ANOVA is the more commonly used procedure and has the advantage that it can be used to compare 3 or more groups in a single test, the expert considers it reasonable to present the ANOVA results only. Thus, following both the reviewer’s suggestion and our expertise advice, we have presented the p-values obtained from ANOVA in Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
