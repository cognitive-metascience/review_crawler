However, defining the roles of specific microbial activities and metabolites on host phenotypes has proven challenging due to the complexity of the microbiome-host ecosystem. Here, we identify strains from the abundant gut bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes that display selective bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Using isogenic strains of wild-type and BSH-deleted <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic>, we selectively modulated the levels of the bile acid tauro-β-muricholic acid in monocolonized gnotobiotic mice. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> BSH mutant-colonized mice displayed altered metabolism, including reduced weight gain and respiratory exchange ratios, as well as transcriptional changes in metabolic, circadian rhythm, and immune pathways in the gut and liver. Our results demonstrate that metabolites generated by a single microbial gene and enzymatic activity can profoundly alter host metabolism and gene expression at local and organism-level scales.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37182.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The microbiome, the collection of bacteria that live in and on human bodies, has a strong influence on how well the body works. However, the diversity of the microbiome makes it difficult to untangle exactly how it has these effects. For example, it is poorly understood how the hundreds of species of bacteria that live in the gut affect metabolism – the chemical processes that make life possible. But they are known to influence how metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity develop.</p><p>When we eat a meal, the body releases compounds called bile acids to help to digest the food. Once the bile acids reach the colon, the bacteria residing there use enzymes to chemically modify the compounds. Imbalances in the resulting pool of over 50 different bile acids may accelerate how quickly people develop metabolic disorders. It is not clear, however, which bile acids have helpful or harmful effects on metabolism.</p><p>Yao et al. first identified a selective version of a prevalent gut bacterial enzyme called a bile salt hydrolase. This enzyme was then deleted from a common gut bacterium using genetic tools. Finally, Yao et al. colonized mice lacking any bacteria (i.e., germ-free mice) with either the original bacterium or the hydrolase-deleted bacterium. Mice colonized with the hydrolase-deleted bacteria gained less weight on a high fat diet and had lower levels of fat in their blood and liver. These mice also shifted to burning fats instead of carbohydrates for energy.</p><p>The changes in the bile acid pool produced in mice colonized with hydrolase-deleted bacteria did not only affect metabolism. Yao et al. found differences in the activity of genes important for other biological processes as well, such as those that control circadian rhythms and immune responses.</p><p>Further research is needed to investigate whether limiting the activity of the bile salt hydrolase enzyme has similar effects in humans. If so, developing drugs or probiotics that target the enzyme could lead to new treatments for people with metabolic diseases like obesity and fatty liver disease. Investigating the biological effects of other bacterially modified bile acids may identify other possible treatments as well.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human microbiome</kwd><kwd>bile salt hydrolase</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK034854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Lina</given-names></name><name><surname>Seaton</surname><given-names>Sarah Craven</given-names></name><name><surname>Ndousse-Fetter</surname><given-names>Sula</given-names></name><name><surname>Adhikari</surname><given-names>Arijit A</given-names></name><name><surname>DiBenedetto</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Bry</surname><given-names>Lynn</given-names></name><name><surname>Devlin</surname><given-names>A Sloan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellington Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Lina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006919</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics – Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adhikari</surname><given-names>Arijit A</given-names></name><name><surname>Devlin</surname><given-names>A Sloan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Karin Grunebaum Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Faculty Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devlin</surname><given-names>A Sloan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The deletion of a single gene encoding a selective bile salt hydrolase from the abundant human gut bacterium <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> significantly alters host metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human gut microbiome is known to play a crucial role in human energy harvest and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BäckhedBackhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>). Lean and obese people harbor different gut bacterial communities, suggesting that developing gut bacterial imbalances may contribute to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turnbaugh et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, transplantation of the fecal microbiota from obese humans to germ-free (GF) mice has been shown to result in the development of obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes in recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ridaura et al., 2013</xref>). These studies establish a causal relationship between gut bacteria and host metabolic status. The molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes regulate host metabolism, however, remain largely unknown. This lack of mechanistic understanding regarding the functions of microbial species and their metabolic capabilities has limited the effectiveness of both dietary and therapeutic approaches to improving host physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The investigation of microbial metabolite production represents both an important opportunity and a challenge in the search to uncover the causal underpinnings of the effects of gut bacteria on host metabolism. One of the most concrete effects that human-associated bacteria have on the host is the production of small molecule metabolites, some of which accumulate to levels in the body higher than that of a typical drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donia and Fischbach, 2015</xref>). Recent research suggests that bacterial metabolites play important roles in host metabolism by regulating host glucose and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Vadder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Todesco et al., 1991</xref>). The complexity of gut microbial ecosystems and associated microbial and host-derived microbial metabolites, however, presents significant obstacles on the path to defining how individual compounds elicit specific in vivo effects. Means to control specific metabolites is critical to understanding how these molecules affect host physiology. In this work, we selectively modulate the in vivo levels of bile acids and demonstrate that this controlled alteration of the metabolite pool exerts distinct effects on host physiology.</p><p>Bile acids are steroidal natural products that are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and constitute an important part of the molecular environment of a healthy human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ridlon et al., 2006</xref>). Upon ingestion of a meal, bile acids are secreted from the liver and gallbladder into the duodenum where, with the activities of pancreatic enzymes, they form micelles that solubilize lipids and fat-soluble vitamins that are otherwise poorly absorbed. Remaining free bile acids are efficiently reabsorbed from the ileum via the action of bile acid transporters and recirculated back to the liver. Approximately 3–5% of bile acids escape enterohepatic recirculation and enter the colon at a rate of 400–800 mg/day, forming a concentrated pool of metabolites (200 to 1000 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamilton et al., 2007</xref>). In the colon, these molecules are modified by the resident bacteria in near-quantitative fashion, forming a class of on the order of 50 different metabolites called secondary bile acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to their role in digestion, many primary and secondary bile acids act as ligands for host nuclear receptors, including the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the pregnane X receptor (PXR), the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the liver X receptor (LXR) and the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorucci and Distrutti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katsuma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Makishima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Staudinger et al., 2001</xref>). By acting as agonists or antagonists for these receptors, bile acids further impact the regulation of glucose tolerance and homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and energy expenditure by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorucci and Distrutti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Modica et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, bile acids regulate their own biosynthesis via an FXR-mediated negative feedback mechanism, which affects downstream nutrient availability for the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Modica et al., 2010</xref>). As a result of these interactions, bile acid imbalance has been implicated as having a causal effect in the development of diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorucci and Distrutti, 2015</xref>). Conversely, modification of the bile acid pool by commensal bacteria has been suggested to induce beneficial changes in host metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joyce et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37182.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enzymatic activity of gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) BSH cleave the amide bond linking primary bile acids to taurine or glycine.

Due to the large number of compounds and receptors involved as well as the additional role of bile acids as biological detergents, the in vivo roles of specific bile acids have been difficult to untangle. Our novel approach to deconvoluting the physiological role of structurally distinct bile acids is to control the in vivo activity of selective bacterial bile salt hydrolases (BSH). BSH hydrolyze conjugated bile acids that have been linked to either taurine or glycine by host liver enzymes, revealing unconjugated bile acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This deconjugation step occurs prior to subsequent bacterial conversion of primary bile acids (e.g. cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) to secondary bile acids (e.g. deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ridlon et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Prior work suggests that BSH play a critical role in regulating host metabolism. However, these studies have not yet uncovered how specific bile acid metabolites exert their in vivo effects on host metabolism, and conflicting results have been reported regarding whether BSH activity should be increased or decreased to achieve host metabolic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joyce et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Research efforts to date have either examined correlative relationships between BSH activities, bile acid levels, and metabolic indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2013</xref>) or investigated the metabolic effects of ‘unconjugated’ versus ‘conjugated’ groups of bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joyce et al., 2014</xref>). It is imperative to be able to differentiate bile acids in vivo based on their structure in order to understand their effects on host metabolism. As an important example, taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA) are both conjugated bile acids but exert different physiological effects: TCA is an FXR agonist, while TβMCA is an FXR antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we uncover a group of bacteria within the abundant human gut commensal genus <italic>Bacteroides</italic> that possess selective BSH activity. We then identify the gene responsible for this activity in <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> and construct a knockout strain. By monocolonizing germ-free (GF) mice with the wild-type or BSH-deleted strain, we demonstrate that we can predictably alter the in vivo bile acid pool using this selective enzyme and that this change has significant effects on host metabolic status. Our results demonstrate that the deletion of a single bacterial gene can exert significant effects on host metabolism in a gnotobiotic environment and highlight the importance of modulating specific compounds when seeking to understand the effects of bacterial metabolites on host physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selected species of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> accept distinct bile acid cores as BSH substrates</title><p>BSH (EC 3.5.1.24) are found across a wide range of bacterial genera from the two dominant gut phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). However, the structural and activity characterization of these enzymes has been largely limited to Gram-positive species (i.e. <italic>Clostridia</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossocha et al., 2005</xref>). These enzymes largely demonstrate non-selective activities, cleaving all conjugated bile acids independent of either the bile acid core or amino acid conjugate (taurine or glycine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ridlon et al., 2006</xref>). While differential reactivity toward conjugated substrates has been observed in some Gram-positive strains, in these cases, the selectivity has been based on a preference for one amino acid over the other, not on the structure of the steroidal core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Boever P and Verstraete, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grill et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ridlon et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the activity of Gram-negative bacteria has been largely underexplored. While <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> ATCC 25285 was reported to exhibit non-selective BSH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stellwag and Hylemon, 1976</xref>), some <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> strains were observed to cleave taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and TβMCA but minimally cleaved TCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikai et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawamoto et al., 1989</xref>), thus exhibiting a degree of selectivity based on the hydroxylation pattern of the steroid. These results suggested to us that perhaps other strains within the phylum Bacteroidetes might display steroidal core-based selectivity. To investigate this question, we performed a screen of the BSH activity of twenty Bacteroidetes strains found in the human gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kraal et al., 2014</xref>). We also tested <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, two Gram-positive species with known non-selective BSH activities, for comparison. We incubated pre-log phase cultures of individual strains with a group of either the most abundant tauro- or the most abundant glyco-conjugated bile acids found in the human and murine GI tracts. We monitored deconjugation over time by UPLC-MS and determined that all hydrolysis reactions had reached steady state by 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Strikingly, the majority of Bacteroidetes strains tested displayed some degree of selectivity for conjugated bile acid substrates, with a preference for deconjugating tauro- over glyco-conjugated substrates. A subset of these strains (<italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> VPI-5482, <italic>B. caccae</italic> ATCC 43185, <italic>B. fragilis</italic> 638R, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> sp.

In mice, the two most abundant primary bile acids are TCA and TβMCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the observed selectivity for deconjugating C12 = H but not C12 = OH core primary bile acids, we predicted that colonization with a BSH wild-type strain would result in lower levels of TβMCA (C12 = H) relative to knockout colonized mice, while the levels of TCA (C12 = OH) in both groups would remain constant. All the five Group I strains displayed weak-to-moderate deconjugation of TβMCA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, we did not detect any products of TCA deconjugation from any of these strains. This result suggested that the levels of deconjugated CA in mice colonized with these bacteria would remain low to undetectable, while the levels of deconjugated βMCA could build up due to enterohepatic recirculation. We decided to focus our efforts on generating paired isogenic strains in one of these species, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> (Bt). Although this strain displayed relatively weak TβMCA-deconjugating activity, Bt had been previously shown to be amenable to genetic manipulation, allowing knockout of putative BSH genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cullen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koropatkin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We performed a BLASTP search of the characterized BSH from <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ridlon et al., 2006</xref>) against the Bt genome and identified two genes, BT2086 and BT1259, as putative BSH. We constructed unmarked deletions of these genes using allelic exchange and then tested the resultant mutants for their ability to deconjugate bile acids in whole cell culture using UPLC-MS. The BtΔ2086 mutant (henceforth referred to as Bt KO) had lost the ability to cleave conjugated bile acid substrates. In contrast, the BtΔ1259 mutant displayed no loss-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Complementation of the Bt KO strain with BT2086 restored BSH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming that BT2086 is necessary for bile acid deconjugation in Bt. Since bile salt hydrolases and penicillin V amidases (PVA) both belong to the cholylglycine hydrolase (CGH) family and share a high degree of sequence homology, it is possible that BT1259 is a PVA, although additional experiments would be needed to definitively establish this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Panigrahi et al., 2014</xref>).

Strikingly, Bt KO-colonized mice gained less weight on the high-fat diet than Bt WT-colonized mice in the monocolonization experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This result is notable because it has been shown that GF mice are more resistant to weight gain when fed a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäckhed et al., 2007</xref>).

After a 24 hr acclimation period, we monitored metabolic inputs and outputs for 6 days. We observed significant metabolic differences between the three groups of mice. Both Bt KO-colonized mice and GF mice displayed a lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER) than Bt WT-colonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). RER is calculated as the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed and is used as a measurement of the relative utilization of carbohydrates versus lipids as an energy source (carbohydrate utilization RER = 1, lipid RER = 0.7). Thus, our data indicate that both the Bt KO-colonized and GF mice are utilizing more lipids for energy than carbohydrates relative to the Bt WT-colonized mice. While Bt KO-colonized mice consumed more oxygen than Bt WT-colonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), there were no significant differences in carbon dioxide production between groups (full day, Bt WT vs Bt KO p=0.4041; Bt WT vs GF p=0.3239; Bt KO vs GF p=0.0606) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These data are consistent with the lower RER observed in Bt KO-colonized mice. No statistically significant differences in locomotor activity were noted between the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then used linear regression to investigate the relationship between metabolic rate and body weight in the three groups of mice. Conventionally raised mice as well as humans display a positive linear correlation between energy expenditure and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fricker et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moruppa, 1990</xref>).

This result indicates that decreased caloric intake may be a contributing factor in the former group’s decreased weight gain. Since bile acids act as biological detergents that aid in digestion, it is conceivable that the differences in bile acid pools between the groups could alter caloric extraction efficiency. To test this hypothesis, we performed a detergent assay in which we determined the ability of the bile acid pools to solubilize a mixture of fats representative of lipolysis products in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hofmann, 1963</xref>).

We decided to focus our analysis on the distal ileum for three reasons. First, while known bile acid receptors are highly expressed in both liver and intestinal tissue, we observed larger differences in bile acid pool composition in the GI tract (i.e. small intestine, cecum, feces) than the liver and blood, suggesting that differences in bile-acid-mediated signaling effects will likely be greater in the small intestine than in the liver. Second, bile acid concentrations are significantly higher in the small intestine than the cecum and colon, the other sites at which we observed differences in bile acid pool composition (approximately 5-fold and 100-fold higher, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>). Third, following passage through the small intestine, bile acids are absorbed and recirculated back to the liver primarily in the distal ileum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>), making this site the nexus for bile acid sensing and transport in the GI tract.</p><p>Global transcriptional analysis of the distal ileum identified 12,432 genes, of which 428 genes were differentially expressed (adjusted FDR ≤ 0.05, fold-change ≥±1.5) between the Bt KO- and Bt WT-colonized mice.

The relative changes in circadian rhythm regulation genes were validated using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). These data indicate that tissues in the distal ileum of Bt KO-colonized mice exist in an altered circadian synchronization state compared to those of Bt WT-colonized mice. Genes involved in immune homeostasis and histone modifications were also differentially expressed.

Taken together, these data suggest that bile acid pool alteration elicited a broader scope of changes in the host beyond those directly related to energy production and lipid synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Bile acid pools alter the expression of FXR-dependent and FXR-independent genes in the liver and distal ileum</title><p>We next sought to investigate the hypothesis that the two bile acid pools would differentially and predictably affect FXR signaling in the small intestine and the liver. Prior work has shown that the gut microbiome mainly affects FXR targets in the ileum but not the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, activation of ileal FXR leads to production of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15 in mice and FGF19 in humans). FGF15 then translocates to the liver where it binds to the FGFR4/β-Klotho complex and represses the expression of <italic>Cyp7a1</italic>, which encodes an enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). In this way, activation of FXR in the ileum downregulates bile acid synthesis in the liver. In our system, the levels of the FXR antagonist TβMCA were higher in the cecal contents of Bt KO- versus Bt WT-colonized mice, while the levels of the FXR agonist TCA remain constant between these two groups. Based on these results, we predicted that we would observe inhibition of FXR-dependent pathways in the distal ileum and perhaps the liver in Bt KO-colonized mice. We measured expression of FXR-dependent genes in these tissues using qPCR. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe a significant difference in genes downstream of FXR, including <italic>Nr0b2</italic>/<italic>Shp</italic> (p=0.2018), <italic>Fgf15</italic> (p=0.6213), and <italic>Fabp6</italic>/<italic>Ibabp</italic> (p=0.6425), in the distal ileum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We did observe a downregulation of <italic>Nr0b2</italic>/<italic>Shp</italic> and upregulation of <italic>Cyp7a1</italic> in the liver of Bt KO-colonized mice, results that are consistent with increased TβMCA-mediated FXR antagonism in Bt KO-colonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The total bile acid pool concentration in cecal contents was higher in Bt KO-colonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with an increase in <italic>Cyp7a1</italic> transcription resulting in an increase in bile acid synthesis. We also observed decreases in the expression of other genes in the liver that are regulated by FXR, including <italic>Apoc2</italic>, which encodes a protein that is secreted into plasma and activates lipoprotein lipase, as well as increases in genes that are negatively regulated by the FXR target gene <italic>Nr0b2</italic>/<italic>Shp</italic>, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (<italic>Srebf2/Srebp2</italic>) and glucose-6-phosphatase (<italic>G6pc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). While the former gene regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, the later gene catalyzes the final step in gluconeogenesis. The increase in <italic>G6pc</italic> in the liver of Bt KO-colonized mice is notable because this gene is significantly downregulated in the distal ilea of these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Taken together, our data are consistent with a scenario in which bile-acid-mediated FXR antagonism is affecting pathways in the liver but not the ileum of Bt KO-colonized mice.</p><p>While some patterns of gene expression in the liver may be explained by FXR signaling, changes in the expression levels of certain notable pathways are not consistent with FXR-controlled regulation. We would expect to see an increase in the expression of the gene encoding sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c (<italic>Srebf1/Srebp1c</italic>) as well as the downstream genes <italic>Fas</italic> and <italic>Acc</italic>, which are involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis, in the liver of Bt KO-colonized animals. No significant differences in expression of these genes, however, were observed between Bt KO- and WT-colonized mice (<italic>Srebf1/Srebp1c</italic>, p=0.5018; <italic>Fas</italic>, p=0.3292; <italic>Acaca</italic>, p=0.1302) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In addition, we observed significant decreases in genes not known to be under the control of FXR, including <italic>Cd36</italic> (p=0.0015), a gene encoding a fatty acid transporter, the immune-related genes tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf/<italic>Tnfα</italic>, p=0.0225) and EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 (<italic>Adgre1</italic>/<italic>Emr1</italic>, p=0.0011), and the G-protein-coupled receptor S1pr2 target gene sphingosine kinase 2 (<italic>Sphk2</italic>, p=0.0274) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagahashi et al., 2015</xref>), in the liver of Bt KO-colonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These results indicate that other host receptors may be involved in the transcriptional changes and metabolic differences observed. Taken together, our data suggest that changing the in vivo bile acid pool using selective expression of a bacterial bile salt hydrolase results in significant alterations in host gene expression, and that these changes are due not to the detergent properties of bile acids but rather to their activities as signaling molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we identified a group of gut strains from the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes that exhibit selective bile salt hydrolase activity. These bacteria selectively hydrolyze conjugated bile acid substrates based on the hydroxylation pattern of the steroidal core as opposed to the amino acid conjugate. Since the majority of BSH characterized to date from Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are promiscuous and do not display selective deconjugation activity based on the bile acid substrate, it is possible that selective BSH activity may be an evolved trait. The lack of distinct clustering of Group I (i.e. steroidal core-selective) BSH at both the strain and protein levels suggests this activity that may have arisen multiple times in evolutionary history from different bacterial hydrolase precursors. Structural comparisons of closely related BSH with different selectivity profiles may reveal individual amino acids that could be responsible for the activities observed. It is also possible that differential trafficking of either the bile acid substrate or product or of the BSH protein itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begley et al., 2006</xref>) in these Bacteroidetes strains may be responsible for some of the differences in reactivity. Additional microbiological, biochemical, and structural studies will be needed to answer these questions.</p><p>After identifying the gene responsible for BSH activity in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and generating a mutant (Bt KO), we leveraged these isogenic strains in order to manipulate the in vivo bile acid pool in a highly specific manner in monocolonized GF mice. Bt KO-colonized mice, which contained significantly higher cecal TβMCA levels than Bt wild type (WT)-colonized mice, gained less weight on a HFD, had lower liver and plasma lipid levels, and displayed a respiratory exchange ratio that was shifted toward lipid utilization. These changes in host metabolism are particularly striking in light of the fact that the only difference between these two groups of mice was the presence or absence of a single bacterial gene. Remarkably, the presence of this BSH gene in BT WT-colonized mice was able to recover the positive linear correlation between energy expenditure and lean body mass normally observed in both conventional mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fricker et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moruppa, 1990</xref>). This result suggests that specific genes in the gut microbiome may contribute to the establishment of host phenotypes not previously considered to be affected by the resident microbiota.</p><p>At a transcriptional level, genes related to metabolic pathways, circadian rhythm, immune modulation, and histone modifications were significantly altered in Bt KO- compared to Bt WT-colonized mice. Since TβMCA is a known FXR antagonist, we expected to observe changes in host gene expression that were consistent with downregulation of FXR-mediated pathways in Bt KO-colonized mice. The decreased expression of FXR target genes <italic>Nr0b2</italic>/<italic>Shp</italic> and <italic>Apoc2</italic> as well as the increased expression of <italic>Cyp7a1</italic>, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, are consistent with a regime of FXR antagonism in the livers of Bt KO- compared to Bt WT-colonized mice. These transcriptional changes suggest that the observed increase in total bile acids in the cecal contents of Bt KO-colonized mice is due to FXR-dependent bile acid biosynthesis in the liver.</p><p>Other phenotypic and transcriptional differences observed between Bt KO- and Bt WT-colonized mice are not readily explained by FXR antagonism, however. Conventionally colonized FXR knockout (<italic>Nr1h4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice display less weight gain on a high-fat diet than wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prawitt et al., 2011</xref>) and also have decreased liver expression of <italic>Nr0b2</italic>/<italic>Shp</italic> and increased expression of <italic>Cyp7a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with our results in Bt KO-colonized mice. <italic>Nr1h4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, however, exhibit increased triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cariou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lambert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinal et al., 2000</xref>) and low blood glucose and delayed intestinal glucose absorption when fasted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cariou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). Bt KO-colonized mice displayed the opposite phenotypes, including increased glucose and decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma and a shift toward increased expression of glucose uptake and utilization genes in the distal ileum when fasted. While the expression of the FXR target genes <italic>Nr0b2</italic>/<italic>Shp</italic>, <italic>Fgf15</italic>, and <italic>Fabp6</italic>/<italic>Ibabp</italic> in the ileum are decreased in <italic>Nr1h4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>), we observed no transcriptional differences in these genes in Bt KO- and Bt WT-colonized mouse ilea. In addition, while the expression of hepatic gluconeogenesis genes is decreased in FXR-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cariou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duran-Sandoval et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), we observed an increase in the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (<italic>G6pc</italic>) in the liver of Bt KO-colonized mice. Taken together, these comparisons may indicate that many of the phenotypic and transcriptional differences noted in BT KO-colonized mice are either FXR-independent or not directly dependent on FXR-mediated signaling.</p><p>These results raise the possibility, then, that bile acid signaling through other host receptors may be in part responsible for the observed differences in host metabolism. Returning to the RNA-Seq data, we noted that there were significant differences in the expression of ileal genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism in Bt KO-colonized compared to BT WT-colonized mice. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) has been shown to play a central role in the response to xenobiotics, and in particular, in the transcriptional regulation of cytochrome P450 3A (<italic>Cyp3A</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertilsson et al., 1998</xref>). The expression of <italic>Cyp3a11</italic>, a mouse gene known to be regulated by PXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kliewer et al., 1998</xref>), was significantly decreased (3.7-fold) in Bt KO-colonized animals. This result indicates that PXR-dependent pathways may be suppressed in these mice compared to Bt WT-colonized mice.</p><p>PXR also plays an important role in glucose and lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao and Xie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kodama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kodama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). PXR knockout (<italic>Nr1i2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice gain less weight on a high-fat diet than wild-type mice and also display decreased liver steatosis and hepatic triglyeride levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spruiell et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, in contrast to FXR knockout (<italic>Nr1h4<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> mice, <italic>Nr1i2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice fed a high-fat diet exhibit increased fasting blood glucose levels and unchanged fasting insulin levels compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spruiell et al., 2014</xref>). These metabolic phenotypes are consistent with those observed in Bt KO-colonized mice. Finally, PXR has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the activation of the fatty acid transport gene <italic>Cd36</italic> in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>), and we observed a decrease in hepatic <italic>Cd36</italic> expression in BT KO-colonized mice. Taken together, our data are consistent with a regime of reduced PXR activation in Bt KO-colonized mice and perhaps suggest that PXR signaling may be involved in some of the metabolic phenotypes observed.</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that host receptors beyond FXR and PXR may be involved in the differences noted between Bt KO- and Bt WT-colonized mice. Exploration of bile acids as modulators of host metabolic, circadian rhythm, and immune response via binding to nuclear receptors and GPCRs is an experimental trajectory that warrants further investigation. Moreover, although our results support the conclusion that the observed changes in host metabolism are mediated by signaling properties of bile acids and not by their detergent activities, it is not yet clear which gene-level changes are driving the organism-level metabolic effects. Although our biochemical, transcriptional, and CLAMS data are consistent with a regime of decreased food intake in Bt KO- compared to Bt WT-colonized mice, we did not observe significant differences in plasma levels of leptin (p=0.4648, Bt WT vs Bt KO) and ghrelin (p=0.7783, Bt WT vs Bt KO), hormones regulating satiety and hunger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Additional studies are needed to explore the contributions of bile acid signaling to host energy expenditure and feeding behavior.</p><p>Finally, because mice and humans possess different primary bile acids, there is the question of whether the observed changes in both bile acid composition and host metabolism are relevant for humans. While the major primary bile acids in mice are TβMCA and TCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sayin et al., 2013</xref>), humans produce glyco- and tauro-conjugated CDCA and CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Russell, 2003</xref>). Our in vitro results show that selective <italic>Bacteroides</italic> strains cleave conjugated C12 = H (e.g. βMCA, CDCA) but not C12 = OH (e.g. CA) primary bile acids. Based on our in vivo results, one would predict that these strains would cleave conjugated CDCA while leaving conjugated CA untouched in the human gut. Furthermore, analysis of data from the first and second phases of the Human Microbiome Project has revealed that the composition of the human gut community, specifically species of Bacteroidetes, is highly personalized. While Firmicutes were more temporally variable within individuals, Bacteroidetes species, and in particular the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genus, displayed mainly inter-individual variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kraal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lloyd-Price et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species status in individuals may in part determine downstream bile acid pool composition in these people. Finally, the FXR pathway as well as other host receptor pathways that may act as bile acid targets are highly conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reschly et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that discoveries about fundamental host signaling in mice are also likely to be operable in humans. Future studies in mice with humanized bile acid pools may reveal how selective <italic>Bacteroides</italic> BSH activity is likely to affect metabolism in the human host.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

All experiments were conducted on 8–9 week old male mice. GF status prior to the gavage was confirmed on a bi-weekly basis microbiologically through culturing mouse stool on broad-spectrum plates in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as Gram staining homogenized mouse stool in 1xPBS. TSA Blood Agar plates were used for aerobic conditions, while Brucella Blood Agar plates were used for anaerobic conditions. Monocolonization or GF status following gavage was confirmed by plating of fecal pellets (described below) and by 16S rRNA gene PCR and 16S sequencing. All experiments involving mice were performed using IACUC approved protocols under Brigham and Women’s Hospital Center for Comparative Medicine.</p><p>For the monocolonization experiment, 12 weight-matched mice per group were colonized with either <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> wild type (Bt WT) or the Δ2086 mutant (Bt KO) by oral gavage of overnight cultures as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcobal et al., 2011</xref>). Frozen feces (day 2 post-colonization) were plated to determine CFU/g. The mice were co-housed in their respective groups in gnotobiotic isolators for the entire duration of the experiment. The mice were fed a standard diet containing 24% of calories from fat, 23% from protein, and 53% from carbohydrates (Autoclavable Mouse Breeder Diet 5021; LabDiet) for the first 4 days after gavage. After a 4-day acclimation period post-gavage, the mice were switched to a high-fat diet (Research Diets D12492) with 60 kcal% of fat sterilized by 10–20 kGy of gamma-irradiation. Mouse feces were collected 2 days after colonization to check bacterial colonization efficiency. This was achieved by homogenizing 1–2 fecal pellets in 1 mL PBS and then plating out 1:10 serial dilutions of the homogenate on BHI+ agar plates in the anaerobic chamber. BSH enzyme activities in different experimental groups were also checked via UPLC-MS for validation purposes. Fecal samples were collected on days 2, 4, 11, 18, 25 and 32 post-colonization and frozen at −80˚C prior to analysis. Mice were fasted for 4 hr prior to sacrifice, at which point tissues and blood were collected.</p><p>For the CLAMS experiment, GF mice were colonized as above with a third group of age- and weight-matched GF mice used as an additional control group (eight mice per group).

The limits of detection for individual bile acids are as follows: βMCA, 0.03 picomol/μL in serum or 0.1 picomol/mg wet mass in tissues; TβMCA, 0.01 picomol/μL, 0.04 picomol/mg wet mass; CA, 0.04 picomol/μL, 0.17 picomol/mg wet mass; TCA, 0.01 picomol/μL, 0.04 picomol/mg wet mass; UDCA, 0.04 picomol/μL, 0.16 picmol/mg wet mass; TUDCA, 0.01 picmol/μL, 0.04 picmol/mg wet mass; CDCA, 0.04 picmol/μL, 0.14 picomol/mg wet mass; TCDCA, 0.01 picomol/μL, 0.03 picomol/mg wet mass.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Liver histological analysis</title><p>Histology of the liver samples for steatosis was performed using a reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rao et al., 2016</xref>) in the Harvard Rodent Histopathology Core. Briefly, a portion of liver sample was cut and formalin-fixed, trimmed, cassetted and embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Liver histology was assessed for steatosis on blinded sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fecal bomb calorimetry</title><p>To determine the remaining caloric content in the mouse feces, bomb calorimetry was carried out using the Parr Oxygen Bomb equipped with a Parr 6725 Semimicro Calorimeter module and aParr 6772 Calorimetric Thermometer module at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) Metabolic Core facility. Briefly, 30–100 mg of pooled fecal samples from the sample mice were dehydrated at 60˚C for 48 hr in a micro centrifuge tube. Calculated heats (cal/g) take into account diurnal variations in fecal output as well as any contaminants that had entered into the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Detergent assay</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Synthesis of the sodium salt of β-muricholic acid</title><p>To a solution of β-muricholic acid (6.0 mg, 0.0147 mmol) in 1.47 mL of methanol:toluene (1:1), 1M sodium hydroxide solution (0.15 μL, 0.016) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 60°C for 18 hr. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and concentrated using a rotovap. The mixture was azeotroped thrice using toluene to ensure removal of water and the residue was dried thoroughly before being used in the assay.</p><p>The detergent ability of bile acid pools was investigated using a modified fat solubility assay described by Hofmann and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hofmann, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lillienau et al., 1992</xref>). Briefly, stock solutions of respective fats and bile acids of known concentrations were made by dissolving them in methanol. The fats were then mixed in 1:1:1 ratio in a 96-well plate to obtain the required final concentrations. Respective amounts of different bile acid stock solutions were then added to each of the wells to reconstitute the bile acid pool concentrations observed in vivo (Bt WT bile acid pool: 8.7 mM total, including 7.1 mM TβMCA; Bt KO bile acid pool: 14.0 mM total, including 11.9 mM TβMCA). For comparison, the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a positive control at its critical micellar concentration (8.2 mM). SDS was added as a solution in methanol to obtain the required final concentration. The plate was then dried overnight. The dried residue was then suspended in freshly prepared 0.15 M sodium phosphate at pH 6.3. In order to account for the slight difference in the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> ions arising from the difference in concentrations of the bile acids in the two pools, exogenous sodium chloride was added to maintain similar concentrations. The plate was then sealed and incubated at 37°C for 24 hr after which the absorbance was measured at 400 nm using a SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate Reader spectrophotometer. At the lowest fat concentration (2 mM), this assay was performed in 1 mL of 0.15 M sodium phosphate in a 1 mL cuvette in order to obtain accurate OD<sub>400</sub> measurements. The solutions of fats and detergents were prepared in a similar manner as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>RNA-Seq analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from frozen mouse distal ileum obtained from the monocolonization experiment using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and DNA was removed by on-column DNase digestion using RNAse-free DNAse Set (Qiagen) (n = 6). RNA quality was checked on Bioanalyzer before proceeding to library preparation and RNA-sequencing (paired-end, 100 bp read length) on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by the Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School. Illumina's Ribo Zero H/M/R kit was used to perform ribosomal reduction. Agilent Tapestation 4200 was used for post-prep QC with the High Sensitivity D1000 assay. The data from the Tapestation assay was combined with the data from KAPA library quantification qPCR on the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio seven instrument. The libraries were pooled equimolar and were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 at 8.0pM with 5% PhiX.</p><p>Reads were assessed for quality using FastQC and aggregated in MultiQC (Cambridge, UK: Babraham Institute, 2011, n.d.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewels et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jason Ridlon (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers were very enthusiastic about this manuscript and are in principle supportive of its publication pending revision in the upcoming <italic>eLife</italic> microbiome special issue. In this report, Yao et al. screened <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. for bile salt hydrolysis activity against a panel of conjugated bile salts and decided on <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> which deconjugated TβMCA (FXR antagonist) but not TCA (FXR agonist). Since <italic>B. theta</italic> has a well-defined genetic system, the authors knocked out the gene encoding bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Finally, they performed studies of gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with wildtype <italic>B. theta</italic> or an isogenic mutant lacking a candidate BSH gene. The two colonization groups exhibited altered metabolism in many aspects, suggesting that the ability of gut microbes to carry out this activity could impact host biology. This model is a great starting point for a more detailed dissection of the role of specific bacterial genes and metabolites in diet-induced obesity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While there are many potential areas for future study, the reviewers agreed that one major issue that is necessary to address prior to publication is that the authors do not complement any of their mutations. It is unclear whether the genetic deletions cause phenotypes due to the absence of the targeted gene, polar effects on other genes, or random mutations that occurred elsewhere in the genome during the genetic engineering process. While it could be argued that such events are unlikely, complementation is an important part of any bacterial genetic analysis.</p><p>Additional caveats can likely be addressed in the Discussion section without the need for more experiments. This includes the unclear relevance of these findings to humans. The focus is on a primary bile acid (TβMCA) that is unique to mice and mono-colonized mice are obviously an artificial system. The authors should include more discussion about why human gut bacteria would have evolved enzymes that target mouse bile acids; perhaps consistent with some degree of enzyme promiscuity. The in vivo mechanism of action remains unclear, necessitating future studies. The authors should comment on the degree to which these phenotypes may be dependent or independent of FXR and discuss alternative mechanisms of action. The authors should also include a more in-depth discussion of the identified <italic>Bacteroides</italic> BSH and the potential mechanism that determines its specificity. Are there any distinguishing characteristics of selective versus non-selective strains, either in terms of primary sequence, genetic neighborhood, or other factors?</p><p>The screen presented in Figure 2 is a major part of the paper but needs to be presented in more detail. It was not clear why 25% was used as the threshold instead of presenting the actual% conversion. No time curves are shown making it hard to evaluate if 48 hours represents steady state for these reactions. There are also no replicates shown making it impossible to determine the reproducibility of these results. It also seems important to test the full panel of compounds against the isogenic strains to enable a more definitive test of selectivity. This experiment should be done in replicate and include appropriate statistics (traces aren't sufficient). The authors should also address the major caveat that <italic>B. theta</italic> was actually a poor metabolizer of Tβ MCA in Figure 2A, which is the focus of all the subsequent experiments.</p><p>Finally, the manuscript needs a careful round of revisions. Multiple inconsistent results and non-significant &quot;trends&quot; can be trimmed down substantially. The host phenotype sections were particularly difficult to read and interpret due to the mixing of non-significant and significant results. It was also hard to keep track of which results were reproduced across both mouse experiments, which could be addressed by a supplemental table or summary diagram.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Yao et al. present an analysis of bile salt hydrolase activity by human gut <italic>Bacteroides</italic>. The major advance here is that unlike in other bacteria <italic>Bacteroides</italic> encode hydrolases selective for specific types of conjugated bile acids. They then go on to identify the gene responsible based on sequence homology to well-characterized enzymes, to confirm this gene by genetic deletion in <italic>B. theta</italic>, and to show that this gene is relevant in vivo using mono-association studies in gnotobiotic mice. This model is a great starting point for a more detailed dissection of the role of specific bacterial genes and metabolites in diet-induced obesity.</p><p>A major limitation to the study, as mentioned by the authors in their discussion, is the unclear relevance of these findings to humans. The focus is on a primary bile acid (TβMCA) that is unique to mice and mono-colonized mice are obviously an artificial system. The latter might be addressed by colonizing mice with a defined gut microbiota or introducing these genetically engineered strains to SPF animals. I think it's also important to discuss why human gut bacteria would have evolved enzymes that target mouse bile acids; perhaps consistent with some degree of enzyme promiscuity.</p><p>I also would have liked to see a more in-depth analysis of the identified <italic>Bacteroides</italic> BSH and the potential mechanism that determines its specificity. Are there any distinguishing characteristics of selective versus non-selective strains, either in terms of primary sequence, genetic neighborhood, or other factors? One way to get at this would be to express both types of genes in the same host to determine if this selectivity is intrinsic to the gene itself or depends on the background genetic context.</p><p>The screen presented in Figure 2 is a major part of the paper but could be presented in more detail and potentially multiple figures. It was not clear why 25% was used as the threshold instead of presenting the actual% conversion. No time curves are shown making it hard to evaluate if 48 hours represents steady state for these reactions. There are also no replicates shown making it impossible to determine the reproducibility of these results. It also seems important to test the full panel of compounds against the isogenic strains to enable a more definitive test of selectivity. This experiment should be done in replicate and include appropriate statistics (traces aren't sufficient).</p><p>The host phenotypic data was remarkable especially given the fact that only a single gene was altered (assuming no background mutations; see comment below). However, the mechanism of action gets pretty murky. The authors seem to rule out FXR, despite using it as a rationale for these experiments, raising the question of what the signaling pathway actually is. A couple of candidates are mentioned, but I'm skeptical as to the ability to definitively implicate these pathways based only on the transcriptional profiling data. Experiments in transgenic mice would go a long way towards testing the role of FXR or other nuclear receptors.</p><p>I was also concerned about some inconsistent results throughout the paper and the inclusion of a lot of non-significant &quot;trends&quot;. In my opinion, one cannot assign any meaning to trends for these types of metabolic experiments, especially without any independent replication experiments. It also made the host phenotype sections really difficult to read and interpret due to the mixing of non-significant and significant results. It was also hard to keep track of which results were reproduced across both mouse experiments. Another major caveat is that <italic>B. theta</italic> was actually a poor metabolizer of TβMCA in Figure 2A, which is the focus of all the subsequent experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Yao et al., screened <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. for bile salt hydrolysis activity against a panel of conjugated bile salts and decided on <italic>B. theta</italic> which deconjugated TβMCA (FXR antagonist) but not TCA (FXR agonist). Since <italic>B. theta</italic> has a well-defined genetic system, the authors knocked out the gene encoding bile salt hydrolase (BSH). They then colonized germ-free C57BL/6 mice with WT vs. BSH KO vs. GF and determined that weight loss in the KO colonized mice was not due to differential colonization, nor differences in fecal caloric profile, nor differences in detergent properties of ileal bile acids between groups. This makes sense because it is likely that <italic>B. theta</italic> will colonize cecum, rather than ileum. Instead, the effects were due to signaling (FXR-dependent and FXR-independent) which may or may not be directly related to bile salt composition rather than say alterations in <italic>B. theta</italic> physiology upon loss of BSH activity. This is a well-executed study and well-written manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this report, Yao et al., characterize the contribution of microbiome bile salt hydrolase activity through studies of gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with wildtype <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> or an isogenic mutant lacking a candidate BSH gene. The authors report that these mice exhibit altered metabolism in many aspects, suggesting that the ability of gut microbes to carry out this activity could impact host biology.</p><p>1) The authors do not complement any of their mutations. It is unclear whether the genetic deletions cause phenotypes due to the absence of the targeted gene, polar effects on other genes, or random mutations that occurred elsewhere in the genome during the genetic engineering process.

In Figure 7B (global transcriptional analysis), the authors conclude that &quot;samples form distinct clusters based on colonization status&quot;. It is unclear how the data proves this, as the samples do not show this clustering in the figure. Statistical support for this claim should be provided to demonstrate that the optimal number of clusters is two, and that these clusters separate samples based on colonization status.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37182.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers were very enthusiastic about this manuscript and are in principle supportive of its publication pending revision in the upcoming eLife microbiome special issue.

We thank the reviewers for their time and careful reading of this manuscript and figures. Below please find the reviewers’ comments and concerns addressed in a point-by-point fashion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While there are many potential areas for future study, the reviewers agreed that one major issue that is necessary to address prior to publication is that the authors do not complement any of their mutations.

We did not originally perform this experiment as complementation is not standard practice for <italic>B. theta</italic>, perhaps due to the incomplete understanding of transcriptional and translation control in this organism (examples of papers where complementation was not performed for a <italic>B. theta</italic> knockout: Jacobson et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2013; Taketani et al., 2015.)</p><p>There are examples, however, in which <italic>B. theta</italic> has been successfully complemented (Cullen et al., 2015; Mishra and Imlay, 2013, Molec. Micriobiol.). Using the method of the Goodman and co-workers, we were able to successfully complement BT2086. We have added this result to Figure 2C and the figure legend: “Representative UPLC-MS traces showing that <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> wild-type (Bt WT) and BtΔ1259 deconjugate TUDCA whereas BtΔ2086 does not. BtΔ2086,2086<sup>+</sup> recovered the deconjugation function while the BtΔ2086,CTRL<sup>+</sup> control strain containing an empty pNBU2 vector did not, demonstrating that BT2086 is responsible for bile salt hydrolase activity in Bt.”</p><p>We have also made the following changes to the main text and Materials and methods section:</p><p>Changed subsection heading from “BT2086 is a BSH in <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic>” to “BT2086 is responsible for BSH activity in <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron”.</italic></p><p>Including the following in subsection “BT2086 is responsible for BSH activity in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron”: “Complementation of the Bt KO strain with BT2086 restored BSH activity (Figure 2C), confirming that BT2086 is necessary for bile acid deconjugation in Bt.”</p><p>Including the following in subsection “Construction of <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> complementation strains”: “The <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> complementation strains were constructed using a previously described method with slight modifications.

The authors should include more discussion about why human gut bacteria would have evolved enzymes that target mouse bile acids; perhaps consistent with some degree of enzyme promiscuity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to expand and clarify the sections of the text discussing the question of human relevance. In our interpretation, it is not that human gut bacteria have evolved enzymes to target mouse bile acids. Previously known gut bacterial BSH hydrolyze all conjugated bile acids (regardless of host source). Rather, the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species uncovered here display some selectivity and this means that they can cleave C12=H but not C12=OH primary bile acids. Mice and humans both possess bile acids within the “cleaved” and “not cleaved” groups.</p><p>We have added the following text to the Discussion section to clarify this point and also further expand on the human relevance of our findings:</p><p>“Since the majority of BSH characterized to date from Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are promiscuous and do not display selective deconjugation activity based on the bile acid substrate, it is possible that selective BSH activity may be an evolved trait. The lack of distinct clustering of Group I (i.e., steroidal core-selective) BSH at both the strain and protein levels suggests this activity that may have arisen multiple times in evolutionary history from different bacterial hydrolase precursors. Structural comparisons of closely related BSH with different selectivity profiles may reveal individual amino acids that could be responsible for the activities observed.”</p><p>“While the major primary bile acids in mice are TβMCA and TCA (Sayin et al., 2013), humans produce glyco- and tauro-conjugated CDCA and CA (Russell, 2003). […] Our results suggest that <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species status in individuals may in part determine downstream bile acid pool composition in these people.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The in vivo mechanism of action remains unclear, necessitating future studies. The authors should comment on the degree to which these phenotypes may be dependent or independent of FXR and discuss alternative mechanisms of action.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Discussion section to include a more detailed explanation of the FXR-dependence or FXR-independence of the phenotypes observed. We have also expanded the discussion of alternative mechanisms:</p><p>“The decreased expression of FXR target genes <italic>Shp</italic> and <italic>Apoc2</italic> as well as the increased expression of <italic>Cyp7a1</italic>, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, are consistent with a regime of FXR antagonism in the livers of Bt KO- compared to Bt WT-colonized mice. […]</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that host receptors beyond FXR and PXR may be involved in the differences noted between Bt KO- and Bt WT-colonized mice.”</p><p>In terms of which bile acids may be affecting PXR pathways, that remains an open question that we plan to tackle in subsequent research. The secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA) is a PXR agonist (Staudinger et al., 2001). As expected, we did not detect LCA in any mice in our studies, as none of these mice were colonized with bacteria known to produce this molecule (Ridlon et al., 2006). It is possible, then, that bile acids that were found at significantly different levels between Bt KO-colonized and Bt WT-colonized mice may play a role in PXR regulation. The further exploration of bile acids as either ligands for PXR or molecules that affect pathways that regulate PXR activation falls outside the scope of the current work and will be addressed in a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also include a more in-depth discussion of the identified Bacteroides BSH and the potential mechanism that determines its specificity. Are there any distinguishing characteristics of selective versus non-selective strains, either in terms of primary sequence, genetic neighborhood, or other factors?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to explore the question of the origin of selectivities observed in our 20-strain Bacteroidetes screen, we performed phylogenetic analyses at both the strain and protein levels. To help the reader follow our logic, we have now placed these 20 strains into 4 groups (now outlined in the Figure 2 legend): “Group I (red): Bacteroidetes species that deconjugate primary bile acids based on steroidal core structure (C12=H but not C12=OH); Group II (gray): species that deconjugate based on amino acid conjugate; Group III (blue): species that deconjugate all bile acid substrates; Group IV (black): no deconjugation observed.” We then analyzed the phylogenetic clusterings of these 4 groups. We added a new Figure (now Figure 3) describing the results. The lack of clustering observed limits further interpretations at this time. However, as we suggest in our Discussion section, these phylogenetic trees reveal groups or pairs of BSH that could be subject to future structural analyses.</p><p>The subsection “Bacteroidetes BSH exhibit evolutionary diversity” was added to Results section.</p><p>The following was added to the Discussion section: “Since the majority of BSH characterized to date from Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are promiscuous and do not display selective deconjugation activity based on the bile acid substrate, it is possible that selective BSH activity may be an evolved trait. […] Structural comparisons of closely related BSH with different selectivity profiles may reveal individual amino acids that could be responsible for the activities observed.”</p><p>The subsection “Phylogenetic analysis of candidate BSHs and Bacteroidetes strains” was added to Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The screen presented in Figure 2 is a major part of the paper but needs to be presented in more detail. It was not clear why 25% was used as the threshold instead of presenting the actual% conversion.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially presented the data in a crude heat map (no deconjugation, less than 25% deconjugation, more than 25% deconjugation) because our goal was to obtain a “yes/no” answer for whether a given Bacteroidetes strain deconjugated a given bile acid. Obtaining these “yes/no” answers for deconjugation abilities then allowed us to separate the 20 strains into groups based on their substrate preferences. We agree that adding more detail will make these heatmaps more useful to the reader. We now present the data as “full” heatmaps, with mean deconjugation values represented by colored shading (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No time curves are shown making it hard to evaluate if 48 hours represents steady state for these reactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to discuss why we decided to plot our heatmaps at a 48 hour timepoint. By taking timepoints from bacteria from the different activity groups, we ascertained that all metabolism had ceased by 48 hours. We have added a new panel (now 2B) to Figure 2 showing representative timecourses from a Group I strain (<italic>B. theta</italic>) and a Group III strain (<italic>Bacteroides</italic> sp. 1_1_6) to illustrate this finding. We have also added deconjugation heat maps from a 24 hour timepoint as a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>In addition, we made the following change to the main text (subsection “Selected species of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> accept distinct bile acid cores as BSH substrates”): “We monitored deconjugation over time by UPLC-MS and determined that all hydrolysis reactions had reached steady state by 48 hours (Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We then quenched the cultures and profiled bacterial bile acid metabolism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also no replicates shown making it impossible to determine the reproducibility of these results. It also seems important to test the full panel of compounds against the isogenic strains to enable a more definitive test of selectivity. This experiment should be done in replicate and include appropriate statistics (traces aren't sufficient).</p></disp-quote><p>We included UPLC-MS traces in our initial submission because the use of representative traces is the standard way to represent data in the field of metabolite production by bacteria (examples: Yan et al., <italic>eLife,</italic> 2017. Figure 4B; Dodd et al., 2017. Figure 2D and H, Figure 3; Ganley et al., 2018. Figure 2.). We agree with the reviewers that it is important to show the reproducibility of these results. In our original Figure 2 legend, we specified that “Assays were performed in at least biological duplicate.” We have replaced the Figure 2 supplements showing representative UPLC traces with graphs showing the% conversion of these biological duplicates. As stated in above, the goal of these experiments was to obtain a “yes/no” deconjugation answer for each strain for a given substrate. There were no instances where in one experiment, a strain did not deconjugate a bile acid at all and in the second experiment, deconjugation was detected (or vice versa). As such, a “tie-breaker” third experiment was not necessary.</p><p>We tested the full panel of bile acid substrates against the isogenic strains (BtΔ2086 and BtΔ1259) and have added these results to the bottom of the heatmaps as well as Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2, and 3. As expected, BtΔ2086 did not deconjugate any of the bile acid substrates and BtΔ1259 displayed Bt WT deconjugation abilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also address the major caveat that <italic>B. theta</italic> was actually a poor metabolizer of TβMCA in Figure 2A, which is the focus of all the subsequent experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this caveat and explained why we chose to focus on <italic>B. theta</italic> in the following text added to the Results section:</p><p>“All of the five Group I strains displayed weak to moderate deconjugation of TβMCA in vitro (Figure 2A).[…] Although this strain displayed relatively weak TβMCA-deconjugating activity, Bt had been previously shown to be amenable to genetic manipulation, allowing knockout of putative BSH genes (Cullen et al., 2015; Koropatkin, Martens, Gordon, and Smith, 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the manuscript needs a careful round of revisions. Multiple inconsistent results and non-significant &quot;trends&quot; can be trimmed down substantially. The host phenotype sections were particularly difficult to read and interpret due to the mixing of non-significant and significant results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully revised the main text and corresponding figures in order to increase the clarity of this work and to cut down on the discussion of “trends.” We have also added labels to our figure panels to aid the reader in switching from the main text to the figures and back again. Major changes are as follows:</p><p>Figure 1: Highlighted C12, the key site of recognition for the selective Bacteroides BSH; wrote out “deoxycholic acid” and “lithocholic acid”.</p><p>Corresponding textual changes: Converted all references to R=H and R=OH to C12=H and C12=OH.</p><p>Figure 4 (was Figure 3): Added a schematic timeline for the monocolonization and CLAMS GF experiments (new A). Enlarged the bile acid bar graphs to make them easier to read. Moved liver and plasma bile acids to Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Corresponding textual changes: Added references to Figure 4A to main text. Streamlined discussion of bile acid analyses and removed references to trends in cecal contents: “As we predicted, Bt KO-colonized mice displayed higher levels of TβMCA in cecal contents than Bt WT-colonized mice in the monocolonization experiment (Figure 4B). […] We observed the same significant difference in βMCA levels in feces (Figure 4C, red highlight boxes).”</p><p>We are still including our discussion of trends in the distal ileum because we feel that we explain how biological differences may explain the variation in bile acid values observed.</p><p>Figure 5 (was Figure 4): In Figure 5B, converted CFU/g from a linear to a log scale and removed the GF condition from these plots. Added the words “plasma” and “liver” to Figure 5C and D, respectively, for a quick visual reference of tissue type for the lipid analyses.</p><p>Figure 6 (was Figure 5): Moved the locomotor activity panels to Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Switched the CO<sub>2</sub> production and O<sub>2</sub> consumption panels to correspond to the reworded main text.</p><p>Corresponding textual changes: Removed the discussion of trends in locomotor activity, clarified the CO<sub>2</sub> / O<sub>2</sub> discussion as related to RER:</p><p>(Subsection “Bt BSH status affects host metabolic indications”) “While Bt KO-colonized mice consumed more oxygen than Bt WT-colonized mice (Figure 6B), there were no significant differences in carbon dioxide production between groups (full day, Bt WT vs Bt KO p=0.4041; Bt WT vs GF p=0.3239; Bt KO vs GF p=0.0606) (Figure 6C). These data are consistent with the lower RER observed in Bt KO-colonized mice. No statistically significant differences in locomotor activity were noted between the three groups (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Figure 8 (was Figure 7): Enlarged the pictures and text in panels Figure 8A and B. Moved plasma glucose to new Figure 9 and rearranged Figure 8C and D (now panels C, D, and E). Split panel D into two panels (now D and E) based on the biological functions of the genes. Added labels to panels C (Distal ileum, RNA-Seq), D (Distal ileum, glucose and lipid metabolism gene expression), and E (Distal ileum, circadian rhythm gene expression).

Added not significant (ns) bars where relevant to clarify statistical outcomes. Added a p value to liver <italic>Srebp2</italic>. Added labels to panels B and C (Distal ileum, FXR-mediated gene expression; Liver, FXR-mediated gene expression and Liver, FXR-independent gene expression).</p><p>Corresponding textual changes: Changed the concluding sentence of the first paragraph in the Results section (subsection “Bile acid pools alter the expression of FXR-dependent and FXR-independent genes in the liver and distal ilem”): “Taken together, our data are consistent with a scenario in which bile acid-mediated FXR antagonism is affecting pathways in the liver but not the ileum of BT KO-colonized mice.”</p><p>Clarified and shortened the paragraph discussing FXR-independent signaling in the Results (subsection “Bile acid pools alter the expression of FXR-dependent and FXR-independent genes in the liver and distal ileum”): “In addition, we observed significant decreases in genes not known to be under the control of FXR, including <italic>Cd36</italic> (p=0.0015), a gene encoding a fatty acid transporter, the immune-related genes tumor necrosis factor α (<italic>Tnfα</italic>, p=0.0225) and EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 (<italic>Emr1</italic>, p=0.0011), and the G-protein coupled receptor S1pr2 target gene sphingosine kinase 2 (<italic>Sphk2</italic>, p=0.0274) (Nagahashi et al., 2015), in the liver of Bt KO-colonized mice (Figure 9C). These results indicate that other host receptors may be involved in the transcriptional changes and metabolic differences observed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was also hard to keep track of which results were reproduced across both mouse experiments, which could be addressed by a supplemental table or summary diagram.</p></disp-quote><p>(See above): We added a schematic timeline for the monocolonization and CLAMS GF experiments (new Figure 4A).</p><p>We also included a new table (Figure 4—table supplement 1) outlining which analyses were performed using which mouse experiment(s).</p><p>Reviewer 1 had also raised this point: <italic>[…] The host phenotypic data was remarkable especially given the fact that only a single gene was altered (assuming no background mutations; see comment below). However, the mechanism of action gets pretty murky. The authors seem to rule out FXR, despite using it as a rationale for these experiments, raising the question of what the signaling pathway actually is. A couple candidates are mentioned, but I'm skeptical as to the ability to definitively implicate these pathways based only on the transcriptional profiling data. Experiments in transgenic mice would go a long way towards testing the role of FXR or other nuclear receptors.</italic> </p><p>We considered performing an experiment in germ-free FXR knockout mice but decided against it for two main reasons (one biological, the other technical). First, research has shown that on both normal chow and a high-fat diet, FXR KO mice gain significantly less weight than wild-type mice (Prawitt et al., 2011, Figure 5A). HFD-fed FXR KO mice also display lower glucose and insulin levels. The difference in phenotype of FXR KO mice monocolonized by Bt KO compared to Bt WT would likely be masked by this strong metabolic FXR KO phenotype, therefore eliminating the usefulness of performing this experiment. Second, there would be considerable cost, time, and expertise required to re-derive FXR KO mice germ-free and also to maintain a breeding colony of these FXR KO mice once they were GF. Based on these two factors, we decided against performing an experiment in GF FXR KO mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
