Aβ aggregation is thought to occur at early stages of the disease, and ultimately gives way to the formation of tau tangles which track with cognitive decline in humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of an Aβ core segment determined by MicroED and in it, note characteristics of both fibrillar and oligomeric structure. Using this structure, we designed peptide-based inhibitors that reduce Aβ aggregation and toxicity of already-aggregated species. Unexpectedly, we also found that these inhibitors reduce the efficiency of Aβ-mediated tau aggregation, and moreover reduce aggregation and self-seeding of tau fibrils. The ability of these inhibitors to interfere with both Aβ and tau seeds suggests these fibrils share a common epitope, and supports the hypothesis that cross-seeding is one mechanism by which amyloid is linked to tau aggregation and could promote cognitive decline.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyloid

prevalent form of dementia, there are limited treatments to alleviate symptoms and none that halt its progression. Histological features of AD are extracellular senile plaques of amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glenner et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goedert et al., 2017</xref>). While Aβ aggregation is thought to occur at the early stages of AD, tau aggregation correlates better to disease progression, with characteristic spreading along linked brain areas, and severity of symptoms correlating to the number of observed inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanzi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manczak and Reddy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seward et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2016</xref>). Structural information about the aggregated forms of Aβ and tau is accumulating, but to date this knowledge has not led to successful chemical interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A link between the appearance of Aβ and tau pathologies has been noted in transgenic mouse models generated by crossing or co-expressing mutant Aβ and mutant tau, but the mechanism is not yet understood at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oddo et al., 2003</xref>). By injecting Aβ seeds derived from synthetic peptide, transgenic mouse or AD patient tissue, tau pathology can be found both at the site of injection, and also in functionally connected brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolmont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Götz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morales et al., 2015</xref>). Tau aggregation has also been reported to follow Aβ seeding in 3D neuronal stem cell cultures that express early onset hereditary mutations to drive overproduction and aggregation of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). In spite of these observations, the molecular linkage of Aβ to tau remains unresolved. Proposed hypotheses include Aβ causing downstream cellular changes that trigger tau phosphorylation and eventual aggregation, and/or a direct interaction and seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ittner and Götz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stancu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morales et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the direct interaction model, although questions still remain; for example, how such an interaction could occur since Aβ plaques deposit extracellularly, while tau neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular. One possible model for intracellular aggregation could be that Aβ is cleaved from APP inside endosomes, and then exported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rajendran et al., 2006</xref>). Another model proposes that smaller diffusible Aβ oligomers are the toxic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lesné et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lambert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benilova et al., 2012</xref>); indeed oligomers of Aβ isolated from AD serum are sufficient to induce tau aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). Aβ has also been found co-localize intra-neuronally with tau as well as at synaptic terminals, with increased interactions correlating with disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manczak and Reddy, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, soluble and insoluble complexes of Aβ bound to tau have been detected in AD tissue extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manczak and Reddy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2006</xref>). In vitro, soluble complexes of Aβ and tau have been found to promote aggregation of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2006</xref>), while another study found that Aβ fibrils can seed tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). Taking the evidence together, we hypothesize that cross-seeding of tau by Aβ promotes tangle formation in AD, which could be prevented not only by inhibiting Aβ aggregation, but also by disrupting the binding site of Aβ with tau.</p><p>A number of interaction sites have been proposed on both proteins. In Aβ, both the amyloid core KLVFFA, along with region spanning the carboxy terminal residues were found to bind tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely peptides from regions of tau in exons 7 and 9, well as aggregation prone sequences VQIINK and VQIVYK located at the beginning of repeat 2 (R2) and repeat 3 (R3) of the microtubule domain (K18), respectively, were found to bind Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2006</xref>). A computational seeding model predicts that the amyloid core of Aβ can form intermolecular β-sheet interactions with VQIINK or VQIVYK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>On this basis, we hypothesized that an inhibitor capable of targeting the amyloid core, which itself is an important sequence for Aβ aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tjernberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>), might block both Aβ aggregation and tau seeding by Aβ. However, this segment has been observed in multiple conformations in steric zipper structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colletier et al., 2011</xref>) and fiber models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lührs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>), impeding structure-based inhibitor design. In an effort to characterize a toxic conformation of this sequence, we focused our efforts on determining the structure of the segment 16–26, containing the Iowa early onset hereditary mutation, D23N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Nostrand et al., 2001</xref>). Based on this structure, we designed several inhibitors and found that they indeed blocked aggregation of Aβ, prevented cross-seeding of tau by Aβ, and surprisingly, also blocked tau homotypic seeding. We suggest that the efficacy of these structure-based inhibitors against both proteins, but not other amyloid fibrils, implies there is a similar binding interface displayed on both Aβ and tau aggregates, supporting the cross-amyloid cascade hypothesis in AD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Atomic structure of Aβ<sub>16-26</sub> D23N determined using MicroED</title><p>With crystals only a few hundred nanometers thick, we used micro-electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the structure of Aβ residues 16–26 containing the hereditary mutation D23N, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), KLVFFAENVGS.

When co-incubated with monomeric Aβ, the shorter D1 inhibitor was as effective as D1b and D1d at reducing toxicity; however, when added to pre-formed Aβ assemblies, only the longer inhibitors D1b and D1d were effective at reducing toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both of the longer inhibitors could fully ameliorate toxicity of aggregates at 10 μM, but D1d is more potent, with effective reduction of toxicity to 1 μM.

We suspect the difference in efficacy is conferred from residue 6, because both inhibitors contain positively charged residues at position 7, but at position 6 D1b contains a Gln while D1d has a much bulkier Trp.

We aggregated 10 μM Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> for 72 hr at 37°C under shaking conditions, then added inhibitors at 100 μM and incubated overnight. As the fibers are still present, we presume that our inhibitors are indeed capping or coating the fibers at toxicity inducing interfaces, thus preventing further seeding or toxic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To investigate the capping ability of our inhibitors, we added the inhibitors to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> during the exponential phase of fibril growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that even at the lowest concentration of inhibitor, 10 μM Aβ: 1 μM inhibitor, we see minimal increase of signal for inhibitors D1b and D1d. Additionally, we observed a slight lowering of ThT signal samples with a 1:1 inhibitor addition, possibly due to inhibitors displacing ThT molecules bound to the fibrils. As the inhibitors do prevent monomer aggregation as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we are cautious to overinterpret the result of this experiment, as the inhibitor could feasibly be sequestering free monomer or small assemblies from adding to the fibrils.</p><p>We performed SPR to verify that our inhibitors bind to fibers.

This cell line, referred to hereafter as tau-K18 biosensor cells, has been used to demonstrate prion like seeding from transfected tau fibrils to cells and has been used as a model system to test tau inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seidler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kfoury et al., 2012</xref>). We transfected biosensor cells with tau40 or Aβ fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to a final concentration of 250 nM. We found that Aβ was able to produce intracellular aggregates significantly greater than the vehicle alone, but only at around 2.5% efficiency of tau40. It is not altogether surprising that Aβ has such a low efficiency of cross-seeding; this mirrors a previous result in a similar system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that tau fibrils contain multiple polymorphs and interfaces capable of homotypic seeding, whereas Aβ may have a more limited number of tau seeding-competent conformations. Additionally, in vitro Aβ aggregation may create disproportionate ratios of assemblies compared to those present in AD. Regardless, it remains that some Aβ species is tau-seeding competent. The finding that Aβ is indeed able to seed aggregation in tau-K18 expressing cell lines suggests that the cross-interacting region of tau is located on this microtubule binding domain. We found other amyloid protein fibrils and non-fibrillar Aβ are not seeding-competent in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating the biosensor cell assay can faithfully differentiate between fibrils of amyloid proteins, which differ in their underlying structures and sequences.</p><p>If our inhibitors block the interface responsible for seeding, we would expect Aβ treated with inhibitors to no longer to be seeds for tau. To test this hypothesis, we treated 250 nM Aβ fibers with indicated concentrations of inhibitor for 1 hr and transfected these into the biosensor cell line. All of our inhibitors were able to reduce seeding at 20 μM final concentration, while D1b showed a reduction in seeding at a concentration as low as1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DE</xref>). While both D1b and D1d reduced Aβ aggregate toxicity on N2a cells, D1d was the more effective inhibitor of Aβ toxicity, whereas D1b is the more effective inhibitor at reducing tau seeding.</p><p>We next sought to verify that the region of Aβ used to design inhibitors is important in seeding tau, and could be targeted by inhibitor D1b.

We found that similar to our Aβ-mediated tau biosensor seeding experiment, D1b was the best inhibitor, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.5 μM.

We postulated that regions know to be drivers of tau aggregation could share structural features with the Aβ core, and thus be inhibited by D1b.

The first three mutants were engineered to block the VQIVYK aggregation interfaces in addition to all but 1 of the three different known VQIINK interfaces. Mutant 1 (Q276W, L282R, I308P) leaves only interface A of VQIINK available for aggregation, mutant 2 (Q276W, I277M, I308P) leaves only interface B for aggregation, and mutant 3 (I277M, L282R, I308P) leaves only interface C accessible for aggregation. Constructs 4 and 5 were designed to test the effect of blocking VQIINK and all but 1 of the VQIVYK surfaces. Mutant 4 (Q276W, I277M, L282R, Q307W, V309W) leaves only the dry interface of VQIVYK available for aggregation and mutant 5 (Q276W, I277M, L282R, I308W) leaves only the solvent accessible surface for aggregation. In addition, we tested the effect of D1b on blocking seeding by 3R tau, which lacks the VQIINK aggregation segment and leaves the VQIVYK interface intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>).</p><p>To test if specific interfaces are inhibited by D1b, fibrils were formed from all of the different mutants, and then each was incubated with the indicated concentration of D1b and used to seed wild type tau-K18 biosensor cells, as described previously with wild type tau fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). We found that D1b was most effective at inhibiting seeding by fibrils of mutants that left intact: interface A of VQIINK which is thought to involve aggregation at site I277 of tau, the solvent accessible interface of VQIVYK as well as 3R tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). D1b also showed moderate inhibition of several other tau mutants, but required high concentrations to inhibit seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As a control, we tested seeding by a mutant of tau40 that combined all of the different mutations, and found this mutant did not induce any seeding in tau-K18 biosensor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), despite forming fibrils when incubated with heparin, indicating that at least one of the known interfaces is needed for seeding. Control inhibitor LC has little to no effect on seeding from any construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these data show that both the VQIINK and VQIVYK aggregation segments of tau are inhibited by D1b, and suggest that each may share common structural features with the Aβ core that could allow for cross-seeding of tau by Aβ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Designed inhibitor D1b targets disease relevant conformations</title><p>Amyloid polymorphs may differ depending on whether they were aggregated in vitro or extracted from human brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falcon et al., 2018</xref>). We sought to determine if our inhibitors are capable of blocking pathological forms of either tau, or Aβ. As suggested previously in our conformational antibody assay and structural alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we hypothesized that our inhibitors would block disease-relevant amyloid polymorphs. Since we also found that our inhibitors blocked both homotypic and heterotypic tau seeding by aggregated tau and Aβ, we tested our inhibitor series on crude lysate from AD donor patient brain tissue.</p><p>We homogenized tissue from three different brain regions of a single AD patient brain, the hippocampal region, affected early as classified by Braak staging, and frontal and occipital lobe regions, which are affected later in disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2016</xref>). We also prepared samples from patient tissue with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which is a tau aggregation disease that displayed no Aβ aggregation by immunostaining. We prepared samples from tissue of a non-diseased patient, as well as tau-immunodepleting PSP tissue. We transfected brain lysates into the biosensor cells; samples with inhibitor were treated with 10 μM D1, D1b, or D1d.</p><p>We found that treating the brain-derived lysates with D1b significantly reduced seeding by all tested brain tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The tau aggregate load from the different tissues has not been controlled, and this is likely the reason for different seeding efficiencies that are observed from different tissue types. Although our inhibitor D1b showed reduction of seeding in the hippocampal sample, the fibril load of this region may have been too great to have been efficiently halted by the dose used. Interestingly, the PSP tauopathy tissue was also responsive to treatment with each of the inhibitors, with D1b displaying the most pronounced inhibition. We surmise that D1b recognizes a common toxic epitope found in both Aβ, and in a variety of tau polymorphs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46924.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Peptide inhibitors reduce seeding by crude brain-extract from tauopathy donor tissue.</title><p>Brain lysate was prepared in TBS buffer from three brain regions of one AD patient, and from a one sample of a PSP patient lacking Aβ plaques.

On top of this, Aβ, the apparent initiator of the disease, aggregates into a wide variety of species, from soluble oligomers ranging from dimers to those that contain dozens of copies, to polymorphic fibril deposits. While there may be numerous toxic assemblies, targeting a specific sequence or structure of a toxic motif that is present in a variety of these assemblies could be an effective strategy for designing pharmaceuticals.</p><p>We targeted the amyloid core segment of Aβ due to its defined amyloidogenicity, and putative interaction with the late-stage aggregating protein, tau. We focused our efforts on the Aβ<sub>16-26</sub> segment with a hereditary mutation D23N, whose structure we determined by MicroED. Although the crystalline structure of this segment is fibril-like, and resembles a previously observed zipper interface as well as an interface in full length fibrils, the out-of-register interface of the β-strands suggests that portions of this conformation may be present in a number of toxic oligomeric intermediates as well as in fibrils. We successfully used this structure to design a series of related inhibitors that reduce toxicity of Aβ in model N2a cells.</p><p>Our biochemical and toxicity studies indicate that these inhibitors function in two ways. The first is by preventing monomeric Aβ from aggregating. The second is by reducing toxicity of pre-formed oligomeric Aβ, possibly by binding to and blocking a surface that is responsible for conferring toxicity or seeding. While all of our designed inhibitors prevent monomeric Aβ from aggregating, only the longer D1b and D1d versions are effective at reducing toxicity of preformed assemblies. These two peptides were designed by extending the C-terminus. D1b and D1d could conceivably act by obscuring resides important for conferring toxicity, as supported by early onset hereditary mutations clustering at residues 21–23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our data implicate an extended Aβ core in the spread of the disease, because targeting inhibitors to this region appears to block the templating interface needed to cross-seed tau. Aβ fibers treated with D1b showed a dramatic reduction of cross seeding in tau-K18 biosensor cells. Tau fibers treated with D1b showed similarly inhibited seeding in biosensor cells. The dual efficacy of the inhibitor D1b designed against the 16–23 region of Aβ suggests that these two pathological aggregates, Aβ and tau, share a common structural motif in AD. Indeed, we find that solvent accessible residues K16, V18, and E22 of Aβ are important for tau seeding. Conversely, by using mutant constructs of tau with only one available amyloid interface, we were able to determine two interfaces on tau where seeding was highly reduced by D1b. Both the R2 and R3 amyloid-prone regions of tau contain a D1b sensitive interface. Of note, the surface of R2 blocked by D1b contains residue I277, which previously has been shown to be critical for tau aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirschner et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>We find that overlaying our Aβ segment crystal structure with structures of tau R2 and R3 reveals a high degree of structural similarity both in the backbone, and also apparently in the complementarity of sidechains from each to intrinsically interdigitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, Aβ overlays well with these regions of tau in both parallel and anti-parallel orientations, suggesting that either fiber or smaller oligomers could be capable of cross seeding on the ends of fibrils. Another mode of seeding could be facilitated along the side of the Aβ fibril using the solvent accessible interface from residues 16–22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). While the modeled interface with tau is calculated to form with a favorable energy, burying of polar and charged residues (TauQ307/AβK16) could cause this interaction to be transient. Additionally, the differences in overall structure and stacking twists of the two fibrils could also explain why fibrils incorporating both proteins or fibril bundles containing both Aβ and tau fibrils are not observed. On this basis, we suggest that the amyloid core of Aβ and the regions VQIINK and VQIVYK can form similar structures in AD that are biochemically capable of cross-seeding.</p><p>Consistent with our finding that regions of Aβ and tau share structural similarities, we found that the Aβ inhibitor D1b is able to reduce seeding from brain homogenates, indicating that the inhibitor is recognizing a disease-related structural motif, while D1 and D1d are much less effective. It is curious that seeding by both AD and PSP is greatly reduced by the inhibitor D1b, as PSP pathology does not include Aβ aggregates. It is thought that different disease phenotypes, which display distinct fiber morphologies commonly referred to as strains, are determined by the formation of different steric zipper cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, PSP fibers may contain a different core than our in vitro aggregated tau or AD derived tau. However, our tau mutagenesis results suggest that inhibitor D1b can recognize at least two unique core interfaces, and thus could be able to act on multiple strains of tau fibers. There may exist other fibril polymorphs with different structural conformations which are not sensitive to D1b. Furthermore, it is unknown how different co-factors and post-translational modifications, such as tau phosphorylation, could affect the ability of Aβ to seed tau, and thus efficacy of D1b on tau seeding. Aβ cross-seeding may represent one of many possible stimuli of tau aggregation.</p><p>Similar to other peptide-based amyloid inhibitors, the effective dose to reduce toxicity of aggregated species is higher than to delay aggregation of monomeric species. This is emphasized by the differing efficacies of our related inhibitor series, where some inhibitors were able to prevent initial aggregation, but not toxicity or seeding from various assemblies. It appears that inhibitors to prevent an aggregation nucleus are much more promiscuous than those that ameliorate toxicity by binding to a distinct structure. This trend was observed in both Aβ and tau, suggesting a common inhibitory mechanism for both proteins, and highlights the need for multiple experimental measures to validate inhibitor efficacy.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that a direct interaction between the Aβ core and the amyloid-prone regions of tau facilitates cross seeding. Our inhibitors designed for the Aβ core segment prevent cross seeding of tau, as well as tau homotypic seeding. The entwined nature of these two proteins in AD suggests it is necessary to control aggregation of both in order to treat the disease. Early detection is still crucial, but these data provide a platform on which further inhibitors can be designed for optimized inhibition of amyloid seeding in Alzheimer’s disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293 -K18 (P301S)-EYFP</td><td valign="top">Diamond Laboratory</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Neuro-2a cell line</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat # CCL-131 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0470">CVCL_0470</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Mouse IgG H and <break/>L (FITC) secondary antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab7064, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_955234">AB_955234</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG H and <break/>L (FITC) secondary antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_955259">AB_955259</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">A11 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# AB9234 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11214948">AB_11214948</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">OC (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# AB2286 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1977024">AB_1977024</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>6E10 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>Cat# 803003, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2564652">AB_2564652</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>A11-09 mOC 64 <break/>mOC 24 mOC 116 <break/>mOC 104(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Glabe Laboratory, <break/>Abcam</td><td/><td>WB 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant Amyloid Beta 1–42 (pET15b-MBP-AB)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods section</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>(D)-LYIWVQ</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td>&gt;95% purity</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>(D)-LYIWIWRT</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td>&gt;95% purity</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>(D)-LYIWIQKT</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td>&gt;95% purity</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>(L)-LYIWVQ</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td>&gt;95% purity</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant Tau40 (1–441, pET22b)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods section</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant K18(244-372) <break/>K18+ (244-380) <break/>(PNG2)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods section</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>KLVFFAENVGS</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td>&gt;98% purity</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)−2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat# M5655</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ThioflavinT</td><td>Sigma</td><td>CAS ID: 2390-54-7</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>XDS</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/">http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015652">SCR_015652</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>CCP4</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/">http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007255">SCR_007255</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">PHENIX</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124702">20124702</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phenixonline.org/">http://www.phenixonline.org/</ext-link>;

Cells were allowed to adhere to the plate for 20–24 hr. Aβ1–42 samples were incubated at 10 μM with or without inhibitors at varying ratios for 12 hr at 37°C and then applied to N2a cells. 10 μL of sample was added to cells. By doing this, samples were diluted 1/10 from in vitro stocks.

The MTT dye stock is 5 mg/mL in Dulbecco’s PBS. Next, the plate was removed from the incubator and the MTT assay was stopped by carefully aspirating off the culture media and adding 100 μL of 100% DMSO to each well. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a SpectraMax M5. A background reading was recorded at 700 nm and subsequently subtracted from the 570 nm value. Cells treated with vehicle alone (PBS+0.1% DMSO) were designated at 100% viable and cells treated with 100% DMSO designated as 0% viable, and cell viability of all other treatments was calculated accordingly. We employed one-way ANOVA as our statistical test for significance. Extended ANOVA data included as a supplementary file.

Aβ42 fibrils/tau K18 fibrils were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. The fibrils of Aβ42 were prepared by placing a sample of 50 µM Aβ42 in PBS pH 7.4 in two wells of a Nunc 96-well optical bottom plate (Thermo Scientific), 150 µl/well and incubating the plate in a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech) at 37°C with double orbital shaking at 600 rpm overnight. Sample from the two wells were pooled together and Aβ42 fibrils were isolated from the incubation mixture by centrifuging it at 13,000 xG, 4°C for 45 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was re-dissolved in an equal volume of PBS as that of supernatant. The isolated fibrils were sonicated using a probe sonicator for 1–2 min at 18% amplitude with 2 s on, 5 s off pulses. The sonicated fibrils were filtered through a 0.22 µ filter to remove large aggregates. The sonicated and filtered fibrils were diluted to 60 µg/ml in 10 mM NaAc, pH 3 and then, immobilized immediately on a CM5 sensor chip using standard amine coupling chemistry. Briefly, the carboxyl groups on the sensor surface were activated by injecting 100 µl of 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 M NHS mixture over flow cells 1–2. The fibrils were then injected at a flow rate of 5 µl/min over flow cell 2 of the activated sensor surface for 900 s. The remaining activated groups in both the flow cells were blocked by injecting 120 µl of 1 M ethanolamine-HCl pH 8. 5.. For the binding assay each peptide inhibitor was dissolved in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 1 mM and diluted in PBS pH 7.4+1.2% DMSO to concentrations ranging from 5 µM to 260 µM. Each peptide was injected at a flow rate of 30 µl/min over both flow cells (1 and 2) at increasing concentrations (in running buffer, PBS, pH 7.4+1.2% DMSO) at 25°C. For each sample the contact time and dissociation time were 120 s and 160 s, respectively. 3 M NaCl was used as regeneration buffer. The data were processed and analyzed using Biacore T200 evaluation software 3.1. The data of flow cell 1 (blank control) was subtracted from the data of flow cell 2 (with immobilized fibrils/monomers). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by fitting the plot of steady-state peptide binding levels (Req) against peptide concentration (C) with 1:1 binding model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">q</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>R<sub>max</sub> = Analyte binding capacity of the surface</p><p>RI = Bulk refractive index contribution in the sample</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Recombinant Tau purification</title><p>K18, K18+, Human Tau40 (residues 1–441) WT, 3R and mutants: interface A (Q276W, L282R, I308P), interface B (Q276W, I277M, I308P), interface C (I277M, L282R, I308P)interface 1 (Q276W, I277M, L282R, Q307W, V309W), interface 2 (Q276W, I277M, L282R, I308W), were expressed in pET28b with a C-terminal His-tag (tau40) or or PNG2 (K18, K18+) in BL21-Gold <italic>E. coli</italic> cells grown in TB to an OD600 = 0.8.

Tau40 WT and interface mutation fibrils were prepared by shaking 50 μM tau40 in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.5 mg/ml heparin (Sigma cat. no. H3393) and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 3–6 days. Fibrillization was confirmed with an endpoint ThT reading, and fibrils were then diluted 20-fold to 1.25 μM in OptiMEM (Life Technologies, cat. no. 31985070). Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO were added to 20 μl of diluted fibrils at a concentration 20-fold greater than the final desired concentration. Fibrils were incubated for ~16 hr with the inhibitor, and subsequently were sonicated in a Cup Horn water bath for 3 min before seeding the cells.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sara Linse (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors report the structure of D23N-Ab(16-26) in an antiparallel cross-β form, design and optimize peptide-based inhibitors based on this structure, and demonstrate inhibition of Aβ aggregation, cross-seeding of tau aggregation by Aβ, and tau aggregation itself. The work is exciting because it suggests that Aβ and tau share a common structural feature responsible for both Aβ toxicity and cross-seeding of tau, which could directly link early Aβ aggregation to late tau aggregation – a major question in how aggregation is linked to degeneration in Alzheimer's.</p><p>The work is fundamentally important and a revised manuscript can be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, but there are issues that need to be addressed in order for the work to reach to the <italic>eLife</italic> standard of reliability and impact. As summarized below, these fall into three categories: 1) Establishing general reliability of the assembly reactions performed in the presence of a polystyrene surface. 2) Explaining better the logic of using an antiparallel cross-β structure as the basis for designing inhibitors of Aβ2 fibrils, which have parallel structures. 3) Concerns about technical aspects of the study and the extent to which different aspects of the system have been characterized adequately.</p><p>Significant issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Influence of the reaction matrix.</p><p>Please explain why Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation is so slow and specify the surface material of the 96 well. If this is plain polystyrene then the reaction could be dominated by the effect of polystyrene and that it is this effect that the inhibitors are interfering with (polystyrene is avoided in most current studies as it either catalyzes or retards aggregation depending on peptide concentration to surface area ratio and even makes the reaction concentration-independent with the polystyrene surface being limiting for the reaction rate). The basic kinetic measurements should be repeated in non-binding plates. Related issues include:</p><p>i) The small effect of 10% Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> seed (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Is this an artefact of polystyrene? ii) Please specify the container in which Aβ or Aβ plus inhibitor was incubated and the surface material used during aggregation reactions for other proteins. Could we be looking here at polystyrene-catalyzed aggregation?</p><p>2) Inhibitor design strategy</p><p>Please explain earlier in the text the rational for using an antiparallel cross-β structure as the basis for developing inhibitors. The inhibitors appear to inhibit the formation of Aβ42 fibrils, which have parallel cross-β structures. Why, if the inhibitors were designed to cap an antiparallel structure? [In related work, Wei Qiang recently showed that structure-based inhibitors could direct D23N-Ab(1-40) self-assembly toward either antiparallel or parallel structures (see J. Phys. Chem. B, vol. 121, p. 5544, 2017)]</p><p>3) System characterization</p><p>i) Aggregation of tau is studied both in vitro and in a cellular model system. In none of these conditions was the phosphorylation status of tau determined/discussed. Certainly, in the in vitro conditions employed there is no phosphorylation of tau. Given that tau phosphorylation is a hallmark of tau neurofibrillary tangles, it is highly likely that both the biophysical properties and interactions of tau will be highly coupled with its phosphorylation status. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether and how the phosphorylation status of tau affects inhibitor activity.</p><p>ii) The authors try to establish whether inhibitors affect oligomer formation by the use of antibodies against specific oligomeric/fibrillar conformations. An effect of the inhibitors can only be appreciated at a 1:10 molar ratio of Aβ:inhibitor. Yet, the ThT data suggest that inhibitors are very effective at 1:1 molar ratio (reduction of more than 80% of ThT signal amplitude). Only one of the antibodies used (A11-O9) probes oligomers. All the other antibodies probe against fibrillar assemblies. These last antibodies are expected not to work (ThT is negative in the presence of inhibitors). Therefore, the whole argument that oligomer formation is being affected is based on a single antibody western-blot result. There is no quantification of these results and the authors should specify how many times the experiment was performed. There are commercially available dyes that detect oligomeric assemblies of Aβ, which the authors should use to validate their single observation.</p><p>iii) The authors attempt to establish whether inhibitors cap fibril ends as predicted by their design or if they disassemble fibrils. The experiment is to add inhibitors at 72 hours post fibrillation begins. The analysis is performed through negative stain TEM. The result shows no difference between control or inhibitor treated samples (Figure 4B). It is then assumed that inhibitors cap or coat fibrils. A better experiment would be to add the inhibitors during exponential phase of fibril formation. In this case, if the hypothesis is true, fibril elongation should stop and this could be analyzed using fibril yield/ThT/AFM or negative stain TEM analysis of fibril length distribution.</p><p>iv) Subsection “Inhibitors bind and reduce toxicity of Aβ aggregates”: the authors report the Kd value for D1d inhibitor binding to Aβ fibrils. The IC50 value for toxicity reduction of Aβ fibrils with the same inhibitor is about 50 times lower. This makes it difficult to rationalize how 50% of activity is acquired at such small fraction of inhibitor bound given the reported Kd.</p><p>v) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce tau aggregation and seeding”: the effect of mutagenesis is not evaluated over propensity of mutated tau to form fibrils. In fact, not all mutants seed with the same efficiency. The authors should provide evidence (negative stain TEM, fibril yield) that tau fibrils are still formed so as to demonstrate that the effects observed are due to specific alterations of binding epitopes and not to a general effect over fibril formation caused by the mutations.</p><p>vi) Several elements in this experiment need to be controlled. First, the amount of tau aggregate load might not be equal in the different tissues. This would explain the different seeding efficiencies observed (Figure 7A) and would allow the results to be interpreted in terms of disease progression correlated with tau deposit load. An immuno-depletion control of tau is necessary to support a claim for a direct effect of inhibitors over tau and tau-mediated seeding.</p><p>Issues for the authors' consideration</p><p>1) Please describe the starting state for the ThT assays? How was monomer isolated?</p><p>2) How does the D23N-Aβ(16-26) crystal structure compare with the antiparallel D23N-Aβ(1-40) fibril structure described in reference 32? A brief discussion may be appropriate. The hydrogen-bond registry appears to be different.</p><p>3) In Figure 4A, are the pre-formed Aβ42 assemblies fibrils, or are they non-fibrillar oligomers? The text is ambiguous about this point.</p><p>4) The Discussion makes that point that structures of tau and Aβ fibrils are similar, based on crystal structures of tau peptides and Aβ peptides (Figure 6). These crystal structures are indeed similar, but are the structures of fibrils formed by full-length Aβ and tau also similar? Multiple fibril structures are now available from solid state NMR and cryoEM, so it would make sense to compare these fibril structures directly because fragments beyond the amyloid core apparently play an important role in modulating the final fibril conformation achieved. This makes it very difficult (if not dangerous) to make conclusions about the behavior of effects of Aβ of physiological length with the conformation observed in this work for Aβ16-26-D23N. At least this should be pointed out as a potential major caveat of the work.</p><p>5) Is the effect of the inhibitors on seeding of tau aggregation by Aβ fibrils due to capping or coating of the Aβ fibrils, or is it due to direct inhibition of tau aggregation (which the authors also demonstrate)?</p><p>6) The paper concludes with the idea that &quot;a direct interaction between the Aβ core and the amyloid-prone regions of tau facilitates cross-seeding&quot;. Can the authors be more specific about what this interaction is and how it facilitates cross-seeding, and about how their data support this idea? Do tau fibrils grow from the ends of Aβ fibrils? Or on the sides of Aβ fibrils? Or is a non-fibrillar state of Aβ important? Or perhaps a non-parallel structure that exists only at the ends of Aβ fibrils? Or perhaps tau oligomers form on the ends or sides of Aβ fibrils, and then tau fibrils nucleate in these tau oligomers?</p><p>7) The work does not provide direct evidence that a common surface or motif exists in Aβ, as was found for tau. This could have been done simply by mutating Aβ, in the way that tau was mutated in this study and repeating the Ab seeding study of tau.</p><p>8) The conclusions of this study are based on the development of peptide inhibitors that the authors demonstrate affect the formation of Aβ fibrils, with concomitant effects on toxicity and seeding. However, there is no assessment of the concentration of monomer or oligomers that remain in solution: these would be expected to increase as a consequence of impaired fibrillation. Such data would help to understand the mode of action of the presented inhibitors.</p><p>9) Why is the crystalline arrangement of Aβ16-26 peptide described in this work considered to be a fibril? It is no different from previous steric zippers that are understood to be in a crystalline arrangement, such as those already described by the same group as steric zippers Class 7.</p><p>10) Subsection “Efficacy of inhibitors of Aβ aggregation designed against Aβ 16-26 D23N”: please specify how IC50 was estimated.</p><p>11) Subsection “Reduction of toxicity by designed inhibitors is explained by a reduction of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation”: The use of negative stain TEM to demonstrate the absence of fibrils is prone to over-interpretation. A more quantitative method, such as fibril yield (or soluble species yield) by centrifugation would strengthen the authors' argument.</p><p>12) A related issue is that there is a general lack of characterization of which particles are induced by interaction with inhibitor. DLS data would help to make the point regarding which species (monomers, oligomers, small fibrils) the inhibitor is binding to.</p><p>13) A better use of Kd value for D1d inhibitor binding to Aβ fibrils would be to compare it with the Kd of D1b peptide which is less active than D1d. Also, there are other experimental methodologies such as microscale thermophoresis that have been reported to cope better with self-aggregation of the analytes that the authors claim to disturb their SPR based binding experiments.</p><p>14) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”: the authors claim that in their experiments, fibrils of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> seed tau aggregation as efficiently as fibrils from tau K18. Yet the results don't show a clear reduction on Tlag (Figure 5A) that is expected and clearly observed in the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> self-seeding (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, panel B)</p><p>15) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”: the authors imply that fibrils from hIAPP, TDP43, α-synuclein, and TTR are morphologically similar. This is incorrect.</p><p>16) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”: the observed inhibition of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> fibril seeding of tau aggregation seems not to be dose dependent, except for inhibitor D1b. More experimental points in the dose response to inhibitors should be provided (Figure 5D).</p><p>17) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce tau aggregation and seeding”: control LC peptide (L-amino acid version of D1 peptide) does increase aggregation in vitro (reduced Tlag in ThT) and in cellular assays (increased number of seeded aggregates in tau-K18 biosensor cells). Can the authors comment how the stereochemistry of the peptides influences aggregation induction/inhibition?</p><p>18) Discussion paragraph four: in this work there is no characterization of the aggregation pathways of Aβ and tau. It thus is inappropriate to suggest that both molecules share a common aggregation pathway based on responsiveness to a peptide inhibitor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46924.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report the structure of D23N-Ab(16-26) in an antiparallel cross-β form, design and optimize peptide-based inhibitors based on this structure, and demonstrate inhibition of Aβ aggregation, cross-seeding of tau aggregation by Aβ, and tau aggregation itself.

Could we be looking here at polystyrene-catalyzed aggregation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for alerting us to the possible interactions of polystyrene with Aβ. Our original kinetic measurements were performed in polystyrene plates, and the Materials and methods section has been corrected to state this. As suggested, to ensure that the effect of our inhibitors on Aβ was not influenced by the plate material, we repeated the experiments as shown in Figure 3A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We found that the lag time was decreased to ~8 hours in the polypropylene plates from around 11.5 hours in the polystyrene plates. The inhibition results were similar using polypropylene plates to the results from experiments performed in polystyrene plates, as displayed in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. As the inhibition was consistent regardless of plate type, we did not repeat the measurements for aggregation of our other proteins (tau, hIAPP, α-synuclein). All additional experiments requested by reviewers were performed in polypropylene plates.</p><p>We are not overly concerned regarding the long lag time in our assays. We have found that Aβ aggregation lag times are quite variable based on the purification method, as well methodology of the assay, as time point readings perturb the plate and increases aggregation rate. Variable lag times from minutes to days have been reported in the literature for Aβ42 at concentrations that are comparable to those used in our experiments. Our recombinant preparation of Aβ yields reproducible lag times across preparations (see Krotee et al., 2017). We do not remove salts, such as TFA, from HPLC purification, so the inclusion of these in our starting material could be influencing the lag times in comparison the faster aggregation rates of SEC isolated monomers, in which have these salts have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Inhibitor design strategy</p><p>Please explain earlier in the text the rational for using an antiparallel cross-β structure as the basis for developing inhibitors.

B, vol. 121, p. 5544, 2017)]</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text in the Results section to further clarify our rational for inhibitor design. We have edited the text in the Results section (subsection “Atomic structure of Aβ16-26 D23N determined using MicroED” paragraph two) to include the 1-42 structure determined by cryoEM (5OQV), as a way to better explain how the inhibition of Aβ42 fibrils could occur by targetingAβ 16-26. We have added a structural overlay of Aβ16-26 and Aβ42 fibrils in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Whereas we used the antiparallel structure to design the inhibitors, our goal was to inhibit a common structural motif that occurs in variety of larger assemblies, both antiparallel and parallel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) System characterization</p></disp-quote><p><italic>i) Aggregation of tau is studied both</italic> in vitro <italic>and in a cellular model system.

Furthermore, such analysis would still be speculative, since it is not even established if or how post-translational modifications alter the biophysical properties and interactions of tau fibrils, and whether post-translational modifications of tau are even known comprehensively, or the frequency of those that have been observed.</p><p>Most importantly, the majority of AD related phosphorylation sites identified thus far occur outside of the K18 region. In the K18 region, phosphorylation of amino acids 258,262, 289 and 356 is observed in AD derived tau, (Martin, L., Latypova, X., and Terro, F. (2011) Post-translational modifications of tau protein: Implications for Alzheimer’s disease. Neurochemistry International. 58, 458–471; Duka, V., Lee, J. H., Credle, J., Wills, J., Oaks, A., Smolinsky, C., Shah, K., Mash, D. C., Masliah, E., and Sidhu, A. (2013) Identification of the Sites of Tau Hyperphosphorylation and Activation of Tau Kinases in Synucleinopathies and Alzheimer’s Diseases. PLoS ONE. 8, 1–11) none of which lie in the sequence regions we have identified for inhibitor binding. Furthermore, phosphate groups or other PTMs are not seen in the near-atomic structures of tau fibrils, which were solved at resolutions where it is possible to recognize density for such modifications. (Kenner, L. R., Anand, A. A., Nguyen, H. C., Myasnikov, A. G., Klose, C. J., McGeever, L. A., Tsai, J. C., Miller-Vedam, L. E., Walter, P., and Frost, A. (2019) eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and phosphoregulation by the integrated stress response. Science. 364, 491 LP – 495). We suggest that although hyperphosphorylation may play a role in the tau aggregation pathway (monomer to aggregate), it likely does not play a major structural role in stabilizing the fibril core, and that the binding of the D1b inhibitor does not directly rely on any given PTM.</p><p>Therefore, we find it most prudent to limit our analysis to immunopathologically confirmed cases of tau pathology, and to avoid speculating about how post-translational modifications might affect the properties of seeding and inhibition. We add to our discussion a statement pointing out the caveat that “different co-factors and/or post-translational modifications, such as tau phosphorylation, could affect the ability of Aβ to seed tau, and the efficacy of D1b on tau seeding”, as cited in conjunction to our response to an issue that was raised below in point #4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The authors try to establish whether inhibitors affect oligomer formation by the use of antibodies against specific oligomeric/fibrillar conformations. An effect of the inhibitors can only be appreciated at a 1:10 molar ratio of Aβ:inhibitor. Yet, the ThT data suggest that inhibitors are very effective at 1:1 molar ratio (reduction of more than 80% of ThT signal amplitude). Only one of the antibodies used (A11-O9) probes oligomers. All the other antibodies probe against fibrillar assemblies. These last antibodies are expected not to work (ThT is negative in the presence of inhibitors). Therefore, the whole argument that oligomer formation is being affected is based on a single antibody western-blot result. There is no quantification of these results and the authors should specify how many times the experiment was performed. There are commercially available dyes that detect oligomeric assemblies of Aβ, which the authors should use to validate their single observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation, and agree that reduction of oligomer formation is not adequately characterized. We have repeated our dot blot experiment and quantified the results of A11 (polyclonal) binding to Aβ samples incubated with inhibitor, included as Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We have also added a line in the text (Subsection “Reduction of toxicity by designed inhibitors is explained by a reduction of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation” paragraph two) stating that we have not determined what distinct oligomeric assemblies are being reduced by addition of our inhibitors.</p><p>We tried to analyze oligomer formation using the dye bis-ANS, which detects hydrophobicity and is commonly used to monitor oligomer formation. Other oligomer specific dyes such a as BD-oligo and other modified BODIPY molecules are not commercially available yet. We found that bis-ANS produced a very strong signal with our inhibitors alone, possibly due to their hydrophobic character and self-association, as well as their limited solubility necessitating preparation in DMSO. Thus, this dye could not be used to monitor Aβ oligomer formation with addition of the inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The authors attempt to establish whether inhibitors cap fibril ends as predicted by their design or if they disassemble fibrils. The experiment is to add inhibitors at 72 hours post fibrillation begins. The analysis is performed through negative stain TEM.

In this case, if the hypothesis is true, fibril elongation should stop and this could be analyzed using fibril yield/ThT/AFM or negative stain TEM analysis of fibril length distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. The primary purpose of the experiment in the Figure 4B was to show that the fibril structures are not dissolved, as this could be one mechanism for inhibition of toxicity and seeding. We have performed the suggested experiment and found that addition of inhibitors at 1:1 completely stops fibril growth, and at 10 Aβ:1inhibitor can slow fibril growth as monitored by ThT, and included this as Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. We are cautious not to overinterpret the result of this experiment, as the inhibitor could feasibly be sequestering free monomer or small assemblies from adding to the fibrils and not just capping the fibrils already present and have noted this in the text (subsection “Inhibitors bind and reduce toxicity of Aβ aggregates” paragraph two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Subsection “Inhibitors bind and reduce toxicity of Aβ aggregates”: the authors report the Kd value for D1d inhibitor binding to Aβ fibrils. The IC50 value for toxicity reduction of Aβ fibrils with the same inhibitor is about 50 times lower. This makes it difficult to rationalize how 50% of activity is acquired at such small fraction of inhibitor bound given the reported Kd.</p></disp-quote><p>We do report an IC50 that is around 1μM for when the inhibitors are added to monomer, which prevents fibrillization. The Kd we report is for the inhibitor D1d binding to fibrillar Aβ. A better experiment to compare to our reported Kd is our experiment of fibrillar Aβ seeding tau biosensor cells (Figure 5C), or Aβ aggregates treated with inhibitor on N2a cells. We report the IC50s for both of these processes to be at a minimum ~5μM, or ~10 times lower than our reported Kd. We also see a variability in D1d efficacy on pre-aggregated structures, with it being a better inhibitor for oligomeric toxicity rather than seeding from fibrils, the process for which our experimental Kd is more applicable. This is not an uncommon trend: peptide inhibitors are much better at preventing aggregation of the monomer than of reducing toxicity of already formed aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce tau aggregation and seeding”: the effect of mutagenesis is not evaluated over propensity of mutated tau to form fibrils. In fact, not all mutants seed with the same efficiency. The authors should provide evidence (negative stain TEM, fibril yield) that tau fibrils are still formed so as to demonstrate that the effects observed are due to specific alterations of binding epitopes and not to a general effect over fibril formation caused by the mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that we have not presented sufficient evidence of fibrillization of our mutants. To provide evidence, we include in our revised manuscript the characterization of the mutated tau by ThT and EM in Figure 6—figure supplement 2. The mutants do cause differences in maximal ThT signal, which is not correlated to seeding efficiency. It could be due to altered binding of ThT to the different fibril structures being formed, rather than differences in fibril load. Nevertheless, these data confirm that tau fibrils are still formed for each mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi) Several elements in this experiment need to be controlled. First, the amount of tau aggregate load might not be equal in the different tissues. This would explain the different seeding efficiencies observed (Figure 7A) and would allow the results to be interpreted in terms of disease progression correlated with tau deposit load. An immuno-depletion control of tau is necessary to support a claim for a direct effect of inhibitors over tau and tau-mediated seeding.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the tau aggregate load probably is not equal in the different tissues, and this is likely the reason for different seeding efficiencies that are observed from different tissue types; we have noted this in the revised text (subsection “Designed inhibitor D1b targets disease relevant conformations” paragraph two). However, our point is not that D1b works differently at different stages of disease progression, but simply that D1b reduces tau seeding by tissue from each of the various regions sampled, and could be of use treating patients of various stages of the disease. We merely point out that seeding power, in this case, corresponds to the pattern expected based on Braak staging. The hippocampus, which is affected prior to the neocortical regions including the frontal and occipital lobes, could thus have more aggregated tau. We do observe stronger seeding from the hippocampal section and this could explain the relative reduced fractional efficacy of D1b.</p><p>We have included seeding data for both a control non-diseased patient brain, as well as an immune-depleted PSP brain in Figure 7A to confirm that misfolded tau from the tissue mediates seeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issues for the authors' consideration</p><p>1) Please describe the starting state for the ThT assays? How was monomer isolated?</p></disp-quote><p>Aβ for ThT was prepared by resuspending lyophilized Aβ from HPLC purification in NH<sub>4</sub>OH and filtering as described in the Materials and methods section.

A brief discussion may be appropriate. The hydrogen-bond registry appears to be different.</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas both D23N-Aβ(16-26) and D23N-Aβ(1-40) fibril are antiparallel structures, the former stacks with β sheets out of register, the latter is in register, which we have now described in the text (subsection “Atomic structure of Aβ16-26 D23N determined using MicroED”. So yes, the hydrogen bond registry is different. It is this registration difference that makes the D23N-Aβ(16-26) structure have similarities to oligomers, rather than just fibrils.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 4A, are the pre-formed Aβ42 assemblies fibrils, or are they non-fibrillar oligomers? The text is ambiguous about this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added in the revised manuscript a dot blot (A11, OC, 6E10) to show the species used in the sample in Figure 4A as Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The preformed aggregates are primarily non-fibrillar oligomers, but some fibrillar aggregates are present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion makes that point that structures of tau and Aβ fibrils are similar, based on crystal structures of tau peptides and Aβ peptides (Figure 6). These crystal structures are indeed similar, but are the structures of fibrils formed by full-length Aβ and tau also similar? Multiple fibril structures are now available from solid state NMR and cryoEM, so it would make sense to compare these fibril structures directly because fragments beyond the amyloid core apparently play an important role in modulating the final fibril conformation achieved. This makes it very difficult (if not dangerous) to make conclusions about the behavior of effects of Aβ of physiological length with the conformation observed in this work for Aβ16-26-D23N. At least this should be pointed out as a potential major caveat of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the smaller peptide structures do not always reflect the structures of full-length fibrils. However, while the inhibitors were designed against the Aβ16-26-D23N segment, all further characterization on their efficacy was done using Aβ <sub>1-42</sub>. We have added to the revision a comparison of β16-26-D23N segment to full length structure determined by cryoEM, showing the similarity to the region used for inhibitor design in subsection “Atomic structure of Aβ16-26 D23N determined using MicroED”.</p><p>We have amended the Discussion (paragraph four) to make it clear that the overall structure of full-length fibrils of Aβ and tau are not similar, but rather that they contain surfaces that are similar. We have added a model of Aβ <sub>1-42</sub> and tau [Figure 6—figure supplement 2], in which we highlight an interface that could facilitate cross-seeding and be targeted by our inhibitor.</p><p>We also have pointed out (Discussion paragraph five) that it is possible that D1b could be efficacious for only some subtypes of aggregated tau, and that there may exist other fibril polymorphs with different structural conformations that might not be sensitive to D1b inhibition. Moreover, it is not known how co-factors and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, might affect seeding of tau by Aβ, or D1b inhibitor efficacy. Thus, Aβ cross-seeding may represent one of many possible different structural stimuli of tau aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is the effect of the inhibitors on seeding of tau aggregation by Aβ fibrils due to capping or coating of the Aβ fibrils, or is it due to direct inhibition of tau aggregation (which the authors also demonstrate)?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot rule out that excess inhibitor could be interacting with tau monomer, as we do see inhibition of tau monomer aggregation induced with heparin in vitro for all of our inhibitor designs. However, we see a difference in the seeding inhibition of D1, D1b, and D1d when added to fibrils of Aβ or tau. Whereas all inhibitors affect tau monomer aggregation similarly, D1b is much more effective than the other inhibitors on fibril induced seeding. Additionally, inhibitors D1 and D1d mitigate Aβ seeding of tau aggregation at 20μM, whereas Tau induced seeding is not reduced at this concentration, suggesting that this is due to interaction with Aβ fibrils and not a direct inhibition of tau aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The paper concludes with the idea that &quot;a direct interaction between the Aβ core and the amyloid-prone regions of tau facilitates cross-seeding&quot;. Can the authors be more specific about what this interaction is and how it facilitates cross-seeding, and about how their data support this idea? Do tau fibrils grow from the ends of Aβ fibrils? Or on the sides of Aβ fibrils? Or is a non-fibrillar state of Aβ important? Or perhaps a non-parallel structure that exists only at the ends of Aβ fibrils? Or perhaps tau oligomers form on the ends or sides of Aβ fibrils, and then tau fibrils nucleate in these tau oligomers?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not deduced the exact mechanism for cross-seeding, and cannot conclusively state the interaction that facilitates cross-seeding. Based on the results from our mutagenesis experiments, we have included a model as to how seeding could occur from sides of Aβ fibrils as Figure 6—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The work does not provide direct evidence that a common surface or motif exists in Aβ, as was found for tau. This could have been done simply by mutating Aβ, in the way that tau was mutated in this study and repeating the Ab seeding study of tau.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree that we did not provide sufficient experimental evidence to provide a common surface in both Aβ and tau. We have included K18 biosensor seeding data and analysis for two Aβ mutants, Aβ L15R/F17R, and K16A/V18A/E22A in the text starting in subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”, and in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Residue F20 was not altered, as it has been shown both buried and surface accessible in full length structures. We found that fibrils of the L15R/F17R seed tau, while fibrils of K16A/V18A/E22A do not. Furthermore, seeding from fibrils of L15R/F17R is reduced upon addition of D1b. Together, we interpret this as indication that residues 16/18/22 are important for seeding and these residues are blocked by D1b,</p><p>We have also included the Ab<sub>16-26</sub>D23N segment in our in vitro seeding experiment (Figure 5A) of tau K18+, and found that it can seed, but less efficiently than K18 or Aβ42 fibrils.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The conclusions of this study are based on the development of peptide inhibitors that the authors demonstrate affect the formation of Aβ fibrils, with concomitant effects on toxicity and seeding. However, there is no assessment of the concentration of monomer or oligomers that remain in solution: these would be expected to increase as a consequence of impaired fibrillation. Such data would help to understand the mode of action of the presented inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an assessment of species could help understand the mode of action of the presented inhibitors. When monomer is treated with inhibitor we see a reduction of A11 detected species and toxicity from the sample, implying oligomer formation is reduced. We have also added a line in the text (subsection “Reduction of toxicity by designed inhibitors is explained by a reduction of <sub>Aβ1-42</sub> aggregation”) stating that we have not determined what oligomeric assemblies are being reduced by addition of our inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Why is the crystalline arrangement of Aβ16-26 peptide described in this work considered to be a fibril? It is no different from previous steric zippers that are understood to be in a crystalline arrangement, such as those already described by the same group as steric zippers Class 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to call it a crystalline, fibril-like arrangement. Although crystalline, these structures are in fact fibrils by all criteria, except that they have no twist. We and others term these structures amyloid-like fibrils. They form elongated structures that can grow to contain infinite copies of the monomer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Efficacy of inhibitors of Aβ aggregation designed against Aβ 16-26 D23N”: please specify how IC50 was estimated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the figure legend and Materials and methods sections to state how the IC50 estimate was calculated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “Reduction of toxicity by designed inhibitors is explained by a reduction of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation”: The use of negative stain TEM to demonstrate the absence of fibrils is prone to over-interpretation. A more quantitative method, such as fibril yield (or soluble species yield) by centrifugation would strengthen the authors' argument.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and agree that negative stain TEM can be over-interpreted in determining a presence or absence of fibrils. However, we are using this technique as a second method to validate our ThT results showing presence or absence of fibril formation. As this test is already a second verification, we do not feel that it is necessary to further validate our result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) A related issue is that there is a general lack of characterization of which particles are induced by interaction with inhibitor. DLS data would help to make the point regarding which species (monomers, oligomers, small fibrils) the inhibitor is binding to.</p></disp-quote><p>From our cellular and biochemical assays, the inhibitors appear promiscuous and could be binding to many forms of Aβ. The limited solubility and self-aggregation of the inhibitors has made the characterization of what distinct Aβ particles it binds to challenging. We have done our best to characterize the inhibitors’ effects on the various species (monomer, oligomer, fibril) despite not deducing the specific assemblies to which they bind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) A better use of Kd value for D1d inhibitor binding to Aβ fibrils would be to compare it with the Kd of D1b peptide which is less active than D1d. Also, there are other experimental methodologies such as microscale thermophoresis that have been reported to cope better with self-aggregation of the analytes that the authors claim to disturb their SPR based binding experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the authors for this comment. We agree that a comparison with inhibitor D1b would be informative, D1b was not soluble enough for this experiment. We attempted to measure binding using ITC, but solubility and self-aggregation of the inhibitors continues to disrupt our experiments. We are working to add solubility tags to our inhibitors, which could help with some of the difficulties in measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”: the authors claim that in their experiments, fibrils of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> seed tau aggregation as efficiently as fibrils from tau K18. Yet the results don't show a clear reduction on Tlag (Figure 5A) that is expected and clearly observed in the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> self-seeding (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, panel B)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation, and agree that the results of seeding of full length tau40 were ambiguous. We have replaced the current experiment in Figure 5A with seeding by fibrils of K18+. This experiment in the revised manuscript does not require the addition of heparin, which could influence the seeding from added fibrils of the tau monomer. We see a clear reduction of lag times seeding with K18, Aβ42 and Aβ16-26D23N. Our original Figure 5A is now included as Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, and we have included t<sub>1/2</sub> calculations in the figure legend, showing a small seeding effect on the lag time of tau40 aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”: the authors imply that fibrils from hIAPP, TDP43, α-synuclein, and TTR are morphologically similar. This is incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point, we have amended the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce seeding of tau by aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>”: the observed inhibition of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> fibril seeding of tau aggregation seems not to be dose dependent, except for inhibitor D1b. More experimental points in the dose response to inhibitors should be provided (Figure 5D).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more data points could be used to determine dose dependency and IC50s of the less effective inhibitors. However, we do not feel that inclusion of these additional data points would change our conclusion that D1b is more effective that the other inhibitors.</p><p><italic>17) Subsection “Inhibitors reduce tau aggregation and seeding”: control LC peptide (L-amino acid version of D1 peptide) does increase aggregation</italic> in vitro <italic>(reduced Tlag in ThT) and in cellular assays (increased number of seeded aggregates in tau-K18 biosensor cells). Can the authors comment how the stereochemistry of the peptides influences aggregation induction/inhibition?</italic></p><p>It could be that the capping interaction of the D-peptide is out of register, translated by ½ a bond distance perpendicular to the fibril axis, in order to maximize H-bonding with the amide backbone. This translation causes steric overlap between the side chains and incoming β sheets, which is the proposed mechanism of inhibition that is exploited by the D-peptide. For the L peptide, since H-bonding is satisfied by in register stacking, no steric overlap would be expected between the R groups of the L peptide, and incoming β sheets. Thus, it should not inhibit. In fact, we see some level of increased aggregation by LC, as the reviewer points out. It could be that the manufactured interaction of R groups in LC with the native Aβ sequence happen to be more hospitable to the native Aβ chain, than the homomeric stacking interactions that are native to the uninhibited fibril.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Discussion paragraph four: in this work there is no characterization of the aggregation pathways of Aβ and tau. It thus is inappropriate to suggest that both molecules share a common aggregation pathway based on responsiveness to a peptide inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that we showed no characterization of the aggregation pathways of Aβ and tau, and have removed this from the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
