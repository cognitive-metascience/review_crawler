Because high salinity is lethal to offspring, correctly evaluating water purity is a crucial parenting decision.

This suggests that <italic>ppk301</italic> is instructive for egg-laying at low-salt concentrations, but that a <italic>ppk301-</italic>independent pathway is responsible for inhibiting egg-laying at high-salt concentrations. Water is a key resource for insect survival and understanding how mosquitoes interact with water to control different behaviors is an opportunity to study the evolution of chemosensory systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43963.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When they bite humans, mosquitoes can transmit dangerous diseases.

Many strains of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are anthropophilic, meaning that they target humans as their preferred blood source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ponlawat and Harrington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McBride et al., 2014</xref>). Once proteins and other nutrients in the blood have been converted into eggs, a female mosquito must find a suitable body of freshwater to lay these eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day, 2016</xref>). Larval and pupal stages of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are aquatic and thus the choice of egg-laying site is a primary determinant of offspring survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christophers, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Powell and Tabachnick, 2013</xref>). In the field, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> often lay eggs in small containers of freshwater, such as drinking water storage containers, discarded tires, clogged gutters, and other by-products of human settlement, likely contributing to their pernicious ability to adapt and colonize human settlements across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraemer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The act of choosing an egg-laying site in many insects, including <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, is a deliberate and evaluative behavior. A female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito with a fully developed batch of eggs will use elevated humidity and bacterial volatiles to locate water at a distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley and Day, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa et al., 2010</xref>). Once in close-range, a mosquito contacts water to evaluate its suitability for egg-laying by sensing a wide variety of cues that include salinity, food, bitter toxins, and animal-derived chemical signals indicating the density of conspecific larvae and pupae or the presence of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hudson, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benzon and Apperson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley and Day, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zahiri and Rau, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pamplona et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afify and Galizia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zuharah et al., 2016</xref>). The physiological mechanisms by which a mosquito senses the presence of water and evaluates its composition to safely nurture her offspring remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that the DEG/ENaC channel <italic>ppk301</italic> is required for mosquitoes to exploit freshwater egg-laying substrates. When <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant females contact water, they do not lay eggs as readily as wild-type animals and are more likely to make aberrant decisions between freshwater and saltwater at concentrations that impair offspring survival. We developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic knock-in strategy to build genetic tools for labeling and imaging molecularly defined populations of neurons and generated a reporter line expressing the QF2 transcriptional activator from the endogenous <italic>ppk301</italic> locus. We found that <italic>ppk301</italic> is expressed in sensory neurons in legs and proboscis, appendages that directly contact water, and that sensory afferents from these <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing neurons project to central taste centers. Using in vivo calcium imaging with the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s at the axonal terminals of <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing neurons in the ventral nerve cord, we found that <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons respond to freshwater and that this response was almost entirely abolished in <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant animals. Surprisingly, these projections were also activated by salt in both wild-type and <italic>ppk301</italic> animals. We propose that <italic>ppk301</italic> drives egg-laying at low-salt concentrations and that egg-laying is inhibited by a <italic>ppk301-</italic>independent pathway at high-salt concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We observed <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> egg-laying behavior in the laboratory to understand the range of sensory information that is integrated to guide the final decision to lay an egg. A female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito with a fully developed batch of eggs will first evaluate a potential egg-laying site by physical contact with some combination of sensory tissues that include all three pairs of legs and her proboscis. If a site is deemed suitable, she will lay eggs singly on the moist substrate above the waterline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hudson, 1956</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). When we used a mesh barrier to block access to liquid water, females did not lay eggs, even though they had free access to the moist filter paper substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Together, this suggests that direct contact with liquid water is necessary to stimulate egg-laying in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and we set out to probe the molecular and cellular basis of this water-sensation to better understand this critical mosquito behavior.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43963.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes use freshwater contact to guide egg-laying, ensuring offspring survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Still video frames of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> female with newly laid eggs (yellow triangles) and contact between sensory appendages and liquid water (red circles) indicated.

For example, they can be found in abundance in a number of coastal regions rich with standing saltwater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramasamy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Brito Arduino et al., 2015</xref>). To mimic the choice between freshwater and seawater in the lab, we developed a two-choice assay in which individual blood-fed females were placed in a container with a divided Petri dish filled with deionized water on one side and varying concentrations of a chemically defined artificial seawater solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kester et al., 1967</xref>) on the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Mosquitoes showed no significant preference between deionized water and dilute seawater up to 10%, with individual mosquitoes either picking a solution at random or distributing their eggs between both solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, they showed a strong dose-dependent aversion to higher concentrations of seawater, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 12.25% seawater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Females showed near-complete aversion to 25–100% seawater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These choices have consequences for the offspring. When we measured survival of offspring reared in varying concentrations of seawater, we found dose-dependent lethality (LD<sub>50 = </sub>25.23%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To simplify the stimulus, we used sodium chloride (NaCl), the predominant salt in artificial seawater, in all subsequent experiments. Females showed dose-dependent inhibition of egg-laying with increasing concentrations of NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) when they were only given access to a single concentration, suggesting that the preference for freshwater may be driven in part by an aversion to laying eggs in saltwater. Similar to artificial seawater, NaCl produced a dose-dependent decrease in offspring survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This demonstrates that the female mosquito’s choice of freshwater or saltwater correlates with the survival of her offspring, making this an essential decision for the propagation and fitness of the species.</p><p>In a search for genes that control <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> freshwater egg-laying, we reasoned that animals carrying a mutation in an egg-laying preference gene would fail to lay eggs in freshwater, inappropriately lay in saltwater, or both. <italic>pickpocket</italic> (<italic>ppk</italic>) genes are members of the Degenerin/ENaC channel superfamily and encode cation channel subunits that function as putative mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors for a wide array of stimuli including pheromones, liquid osmolality, and salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalfie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zelle et al., 2013</xref>). Through manual curation of geneset annotations, we predict that the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>) contains 31 <italic>ppk</italic> genes. These are unevenly distributed across its three chromosomes. Whereas chromosome 1 has only three <italic>ppk</italic> genes, chromosome 3 has 22, including three clusters of 3–7 <italic>ppk</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Even when <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant animals laid eggs, they laid fewer eggs than wild-type on water and more eggs than wild-type on 200 mOsm/kg NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We assayed these four <italic>ppk</italic> mutant strains across a range of NaCl concentrations and found a significant reduction in aversion to salt solution only in the <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant, as measured by the proportion of animals laying eggs primarily on salt solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Together, these data support the conclusion that mutations in <italic>ppk301</italic> disrupt freshwater egg-laying in two distinct ways: by dramatically reducing the drive to lay eggs in suitable, low-salt, substrates and reducing the aversion to concentrations of NaCl that are lethal to their offspring.</p><p>If <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant animals fail to sense water, which normally triggers mosquitoes to lay an entire clutch of eggs in a short timespan, we hypothesized that these mutants would show a delay in onset and a reduced egg-laying rate when housed in close proximity to water for many days. To ask if <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant animals will lay eggs on water given sufficient time, we introduced individual blood-fed females into egg-laying vials containing water and monitored the number of eggs laid per female per day over 7 days. While the vast majority of wild-type and <italic>ppk301</italic> heterozygous animals laid all their eggs within the first 2 days of being introduced into egg-laying vials, <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant animals did not. Instead, the mutants showed increased variability in the time of egg-laying initiation and a tendency to spread egg-laying out over many days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>). This slow, sustained, and variable egg-laying behavior on freshwater is consistent with a defect in sensing the water that triggers egg-laying.</p><p>If <italic>ppk301</italic> directly senses the osmolality or salinity of liquid, we would expect it to be expressed in the sensory appendages that contact water.

These data show that <italic>ppk301</italic> is required for the activation of these neurons by freshwater and that a <italic>ppk301</italic>-independent pathway activates these neurons in response to salt. This suggests that mosquito <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing afferents are either multi-modal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zocchi et al., 2017</xref>) and each neuron responds to both water and salt, or that there is a functionally heterogeneous population of <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing afferents with distinct neurons responding to water and salt.</p><p>To test if <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing neurons are activated by any solution with increased osmolality, we performed imaging experiments with two additional solutes that are not ionic salts, L-serine and D-(+)-cellobiose.

Intrigued by these findings, we performed egg-laying preference assays where mosquitoes were given a choice to lay eggs on freshwater and either L-serine or D-(+)-cellobiose.

To understand how female mosquitoes interact with these different stimuli, we monitored real-time behavior of individual females offered either water or 300 mOsm/kg NaCl over 40 min by scoring their contact with liquid and individual egg-laying events. Both wild-type and <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant mosquitoes contacted water, but only wild-type females consistently transformed these touches into egg-laying events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Sensory neurons in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> proboscis that express the orthologous <italic>ppk28</italic> gene are maximally activated by water but inhibited by dissolved solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the afferents of the <italic>ppk301-</italic>expressing cells in the mosquito tarsi are not tuned specifically to osmolality but rather encode multimodal responses to liquid (<italic>ppk301</italic>-dependent) and to high concentrations of salt (<italic>ppk301</italic>-independent). Whether or not individual neurons within this population exhibit distinct tuning properties remains to be determined. In addition to the tarsi, <italic>ppk301</italic> is expressed in the proboscis and pharynx. It will be important to evaluate whether these populations of <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing cells are strictly tuned to water, as are <italic>D. melanogaster ppk28-</italic>expressing labellar sensory neurons, and lack the multimodal responses seen in the tarsal <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing neurons.</p><p>How does <italic>ppk301</italic> regulate egg-laying? We favor a model in which <italic>ppk301-</italic>dependent activation of sensory neurons by liquid provides a permissive signal required for egg-laying, while high concentrations of salt activate noxious salt pathway(s) that can override this signal and prevent egg-laying. Together, these opposing signals are integrated to sculpt egg-laying preference and allow a mosquito to exploit freshwater substrates while preventing eggs from being laid on high-salt substrates that are lethal to their offspring.</p><p>It will be interesting to discover the biophysical mechanisms by which <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons respond to water. <italic>ppk301</italic> encodes a single subunit of a trimeric DEG/ENaC channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). One possibility is that <italic>ppk301</italic> ion channels are homomers that respond to osmotic pressure, similar to <italic>D. melanogaster ppk28</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>ppk301</italic> could encode a promiscuous subunit that could be part of multiple heteromeric PPK channels with different ligands that account for some of the multimodal tuning properties seen in <italic>ppk301-</italic>expressing tarsal sensory neurons. In this scenario, genetic ablation of <italic>ppk301</italic> could result in a novel set of PPK channels that are composed of the remaining subunits, thereby shifting the composition of channels on the membrane and influencing overall neuronal tuning properties.</p><p>Water- and salt-sensing are critically important because all animals must regulate fluid and ion homeostasis for the proper functioning of their physiological systems. Terrestrial insects such as mosquitoes are small and have a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, meaning that they are susceptible to desiccation. Therefore, both male and female adult mosquitoes must seek out liquid for survival. It is not known if sensory systems used for determining the physical properties of liquids during fluid ingestion in male and female mosquitoes are the same as those used by the female for evaluating water quality during egg-laying. Our data show that <italic>ppk301</italic> is expressed in both male and female appendages, and that neurons expressing <italic>ppk301</italic> project to similar areas of the brain and ventral nerve cord. Studying the effects of <italic>ppk301</italic> mutations on liquid ingestion in adult <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> will provide insight into whether the same molecules and sensory neurons are being used in distinct behavioral contexts. It will also be interesting to investigate if the activity of <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons is modulated by physiological state, including the presence of developed eggs or elevated thirst due to dehydration or desiccation stress. Previous studies have shown the existence of a canonical ‘water’ cell in the apical labral chemoreceptor sensilla of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner-Reiss et al., 1999</xref>), but we do not see <italic>ppk301</italic> expression in this tissue, indicating that there may be additional osmosensitive receptors encoded in the mosquito genome.</p><p>A complete cellular and molecular understanding of salt sensation in mosquitoes remains to be elucidated and the ‘noxious salt sensor’ proposed in our model remains to be discovered. We note that a distributed coding of salt taste in which distinct populations of sensory neurons are modulated by salt is not unprecedented. A recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reveals that in the proboscis, salt can activate or inhibit every class of gustatory receptor neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>). Salt is also a key component of blood and understanding the mechanisms of salt sensation during blood-feeding, egg-laying, and other critical mosquito behaviors is an important future goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner-Reiss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanford et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of egg-laying preference both within <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and in other mosquito species is a critical determinant of the types of environments and ecological niches that they are able to exploit. Indeed, some strains of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have begun to exploit brackish water for egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramasamy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Brito Arduino et al., 2015</xref>). Such an adaptation requires co-evolution of the shifting preference of females for salty water and larval tolerance of high salinity environments into which they are deposited. Investigating the underlying genetic changes that support the coordination of these shifting phenotypes in both larvae and adults will be important for understanding how <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adapts to novel breeding sites across the globe, which has greatly increased their capacity as a disease vector.</p><p>The advances described here depended critically on new genetic tools we developed that did not previously exist in this non-model insect. These techniques now make it possible to visualize neuronal anatomy and activity within molecularly identified cell types and to identify the genetic and neural circuit substrates of many mosquito behaviors. These behaviors contribute to the spread of deadly pathogens and understanding their underlying biology could contribute to mosquito control efforts. The development of similar tools and reagents in other insect species of public health, agricultural, or ethological interest will broaden our view of insect biology and facilitate comparative studies of the genes and circuits underlying evolutionary adaptations in insects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Brp (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Developmental <break/>Studies <break/>Hybridoma Bank</td><td valign="top">DSHB:NC82 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2314866">AB_2314866</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GFP (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">Molecular Probes: <break/>A11122 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221569">AB_221569</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-serine</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Sigma:s4500</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">D-(+)-cellobiose</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Sigma:22150</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">NaCl</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Sigma:s7653</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ppk301</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NCBI:LOC5564307</td><td valign="top">previously known as <break/><italic>AAEL000582, ppk582</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ppk204</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NCBI:LOC5573846</td><td valign="top">previously known as <break/><italic>AAEL010779, ppk10779</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ppk316</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NCBI:LOC5567201</td><td valign="top">previously known as <break/><italic>AAEL000926, ppk00926</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ppk306</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NCBI:LOC5563925</td><td valign="top">previously known as <break/><italic>AAEL014228, ppk14228</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ppk301 -/-</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID:25818303</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">previously generated and referred to as<italic>AAEL00582 ECFP</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kistler et al., 2015</xref> <break/>(PMID:25818303).

Confocal images were processed in ImageJ (NIH).</p><p>3xP3 was used as a promoter to express fluorescent markers for transgene insertion, and care was taken to distinguish 3xP3 expression from the expression of the <italic>ppk301-QF2</italic> driver line. 3xP3 labels the optic lobes, as well as some cells in the dorsal brain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,D,F,H,J</xref> were cropped to remove 3xP3 expression. In some cases, we saw projections from the optic lobes that traversed the brain. These were sometimes seen in the driver alone and effector alone controls, both of which contain a 3xP3 marker transgene. We speculate that these projections derive from cells marked by 3XP3 expression and are unrelated to <italic>ppk301</italic> expression. These patterns of 3xP3 are worth noting, but due to the distance from the subesophageal zone and ventral nerve cord, they do not have an impact on the results of this study. In some brains, we observed faint unilateral projections from the subesophageal zone to the antennal lobe. We examined eight female brains and eight male brains for these projections and saw these projections in 5/8 brains. In males we did not see this projection in any of the eight brains examined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Reference brain 3D-Reconstruction</title><p>A reference <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> brain from a 7 day old wild-type female mosquito was fixed and immunostained for Brp as described above. It was imaged as described above except with 1 μm voxels and as a tiled scan with 10% overlap. Thirty-nine brains were analyzed and the most complete and symmetric brain was chosen to serve as the template. Blind deconvolution was performed with AutoquantX3 software. The female brain was manually annotated using the segmentation and 3D reconstruction software ITK-SNAP. Regions were identified by the anatomical boundaries defined by Brp staining, and by homology to other insects, and named in accordance with revised insect brain nomenclature standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). Structures without clear boundaries were excluded. A surface mesh of each region was exported into the data analysis and visualization software ParaView, which was used to generate the 3D reconstruction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Mosquitobrains.org</title><p>The reference brain raw data and reconstruction are available on the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mosquitobrains.org">http://mosquitobrains.org</ext-link>.

This construct was expressed in a few cells in the adult brain, as well as in larval body-wall cells. We focused our analysis on the body-wall cells because their flat and compact shape made them amenable to examining the expression of our membrane and nuclear proteins.</p><p>Larvae were dissected by pinning the head and the tail to Sylgard plates (DowDupont) with insect pins, and a long longitudinal cut was made along the dorsal surface of the body wall. The body wall was filleted open with four additional insect pins, and the organs were removed. The animals were fixed for 25 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M Millonig's Phosphate Buffer (pH 7.4), 0.25% Triton X-100 at room temperature, and then rinsed 3 times in PBS. Larvae were transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and washed with PBT 6 times for 15 min while nutating at room temperature. Larvae were then incubated in Vectashield with DAPI overnight and mounted in Vectashield for imaging. Larvae were imaged on a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal with a 40X/1.2 NA oil immersion objective. The cells were imaged at a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels in a single confocal slice for a pixel size of 0.0692 × 0.0692 µm.

GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu) were used to collect emitted fluorescence. Images were acquired with a 60X/1.0N.A. Long Working Distance Water-Immersion Objective (Olympus) at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels.</p><p>Calcium imaging experiments were performed on female mosquitoes that were 7–11 days post-eclosion. Mosquitoes were fed a human-blood-meal 96–108 hr prior to imaging and were not giving access to an egg laying substrate so that they were gravid at the time of imaging. Gravid females were anesthetized at 4°C for dissection. The wings were removed and the mosquito was fixed to a custom Delrin plastic holder with UV-curable glue (Bondic). The mosquito was inserted into a hole in the holder, such that the ventral thorax, including all coxae, were exposed above the surface of the holder, with the rest of the mosquito below. The mosquito was secured with a few points of glue (Bondic) on the abdomen, thorax and head. The leg that was presented with water remained free of glue to prevent damage to the tissue. Once the mosquito was secured to the plate, one of the forelegs was inserted into a small diameter tube that was secured to the bottom of the plate and could later be attached to the fluidics apparatus used for stimulus delivery (described below). The top of the dish was then filled with external saline. The recipe we used is based <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> imaging saline:103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM 2-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]−2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES), 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3, osmolality adjusted to 275 mOsm/kg). The coxae were gently spread from the midline and secured in dental wax. The cuticle was removed above the prothoracic ganglia using very sharp forceps. Opaque non-neural tissue, primarily fat cells and muscle, was removed if they obstructed the ventral nerve cord. Great care was taken not to damage the <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing nerves running from the legs into the ventral nerve cord. These run up the posterior-ventral region of the leg and are extremely superficial. dTomato fluorescence was examined before imaging to verify that the nerves were intact. If an animal did not respond to water, 200 mOsm/kg, or 300 mOsm/kg NaCl it was discarded.</p><p>The preparation was secured to the stage using a custom laser cut acrylic holder. A single plane through the center of the prothoracic neuropil was scanned at 4.22 fps with a 920 nm excitation wavelength imaged through a 680 nm shortpass infrared (IR) blocking filter, a 565 nm longpass dichroic and 595/50 nm or 525/70 nm bandpass filters. GCaMP6s and dTomato emission was collected simultaneously for 70 frames per trial. Each concentration was delivered at least three times per animal, and each animal was exposed to a series of either 0, 200, and 300 mOsm/kg NaCl, or 200 mOsm/kg NaCl, 200 mOsm/kg L-serine, 200 mOsm/kg D-(+)-cellobiose and freshwater. All wild-type and PPK301 mutant animals were reared and imaged in parallel.</p><p>Imaging remained stable during the duration of the imaging session in all animals that were included in this study. We did not notice a decrease in the response to stimuli over time. Before beginning the experiments using multiple concentrations of salt, we imaged animals with repeated water delivery, and saw no desensitization to the response to water over 10 presentations (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Liquid delivery</title><p>Liquids were delivered to a single foreleg of the mosquito using a custom built low-volume fluidics device. Piezoelectric diaphragm micropumps and their controller (Servoflo) were run by an Arduino using a code written for this purpose. A custom manifold was milled for small volume liquid delivery. The mosquito was illuminated with an IR light and liquid delivery was monitored using an IR camera. The liquid coated the tarsal and tibial segments and was retracted immediately after imaging each sweep. We waited at least 1 min between each trial. We only observed responses in the prothoracic region ipsilateral to the stimulus delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All image processing was done using FIJI/ImageJ (NIH). Further processing was done using Excel and Prism (GraphPad). Regions of interest were selected based on the dTomato fluorescence intensity and used for analysis of GCaMP6s signal. All traces with motion, as determined by dTomato fluorescence instability, were discarded. A Gaussian blur with a sigma value of 1 was performed on the GCaMP6s signal. In the calculation of ΔF/F, six frames were averaged before stimulus presentation to determine the baseline fluorescence. To determine F<sub>max</sub>, the average of 3 frames at the peak after stimulus delivery was determined for each sweep.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad) or R version 3.5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">R Development CoreTeam, 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kristin Scott as Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Tracey (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a fascinating study that examines the molecular and cellular control of egg laying in the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. The study is a technical tour-de-force, developing new behavioral assays for egg laying preferences in water vs salt water in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitos, generating new genetic tools for the study of 4 ppk channels, and establishing an imaging preparation for tarsal taste receptor neurons. The basic finding is that neurons that express <italic>ppk301</italic> are located in gustatory sensilla and that female mosquitos with the <italic>ppk301</italic> mutation show reduced in egg laying near water and a tendency to lay more eggs in salt. A model is presented where <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons gate egg laying by feeding into command circuits that both increase egg laying in the presence of water and decrease egg laying in the presence of high salt. Overall, this work represents a strong conceptual and technical achievement, and is certainly worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once appropriate revisions are made.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more in-depth characterization of <italic>ppk301</italic> neuron tuning, using calcium imaging, is necessary to address whether the &quot;salt&quot; response is specific to salt, or a general response to solutes. The minimum number of stimuli to determine whether these neurons respond to changes in osmolarity or specifically to salt and water should be examined.</p><p>The crux of the problem is that, at the moment, there is no stimulus demonstrated to give a smaller response than water. Thus, we don't know what property of the water <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons are responding to. The implication is that it is the low osmolality, but this is not explicitly demonstrated. It is formally possible that these neurons respond to all liquids, and that water actually gives the smallest response of any liquid stimulus. A broader examination of the receptive fields of these neurons is necessary to resolve this issue.</p><p>2) Calcium imaging of <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons in <italic>ppk301</italic> mutants in response to salt and water, which would presumably show a change in the water response compared to controls. This would greatly assist in linking the mutant behavior with the physiology of the neurons.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) This study clearly demonstrated that <italic>ppk301</italic> is involved in egg-laying behavior in females. But it is unclear if <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing neurons have instructive or permissive signals for this behavior. The authors favor an instructive model where the activation of <italic>ppk301</italic> is directly linked to egg-laying. However, based on the functional data (Figure 5), <italic>ppk301</italic>-expressing neurons may simply transmit liquid information (e.g., existence of liquid) regardless of salinity, which provides permissive signals for egg-laying behavior. Subsequently, other pathways may mediate instructive signals for laying or not laying eggs based on salt concentration. These two models are testable by gain-of-function manipulation on <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons: if the authors' model is correct, artificial activation of these neurons would drive egg-laying behavior without proximal water. Nevertheless, these experiments require a generation of new reporter line. If this is not feasible, it is worth considering a permissive model in Figure 5G.</p><p>2) To more easily compare the results with artificial seawater to those with NaCl, it would be nice if the salt concentration were given for each percentage of artificial seawater.</p><p>3) The authors should cite:</p><p>Gustatory receptor neuron responds to DEET and other insect repellents in the yellow-fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti</p><p>By: Sanford, Jillian L.; Shields, Vonnie D.

We have carried out new imaging experiments with two additional non-ionic solutes: L-serine and D-(+)-cellobiose at 200 mOsm/kg. This osmolality gives the greatest response to NaCl and is a concentration of NaCl that is very aversive in the context of the egg-laying behavior that we are studying. The results indicate that neither L-serine nor D-(+)-cellobiose activated <italic>ppk301</italic> neurons to the level seen with NaCl. The response to D-(+)-cellobiose was comparable to water and the response to L-serine was only slightly reduced in comparison to water.</p><p>To accompany these experiments, we also conducted new egg-laying behavior experiments to determine the preference for 200mOsm/kg L-serine and D-(+)-cellobiose in comparison to water. We saw that animals prefer to lay on freshwater when presented with 200 mOsm/kg NaCl, as we had previously reported. However, animals displayed no preference for water over either 200 mOsm/kg L-serine or D-(+)-cellobiose, indicating that the behavior is salt-specific and not driven by osmolality at this osmotic pressure.</p><p>While we cannot rule out that ppk301-expressing cells are inhibited by very high dissolved solute concentrations as is seen in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (&gt;400mOsm), it is far outside the range of the behavior that we tested and cannot account for the egg laying preference against NaCl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Calcium imaging of ppk301 neurons in ppk301 mutants in response to salt and water, which would presumably show a change in the water response compared to controls.

We are pleased that we ultimately succeeded in building the strain required to image activity of neurons labeled in the <italic>ppk301</italic>-QF2 strain in the context of a homozygous <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant background. The new results show that the response to freshwater is almost entirely abolished in the <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant. While there is some reduction in the response to NaCl, the overall salt response remains intact in the <italic>ppk301</italic> mutant animals. These data are consistent with the model that ppk301 is necessary for the water component of the response and that there is a non-<italic>ppk301</italic> dependent salt response in these cells. The identity of this non-<italic>ppk301</italic> salt receptor remains to be elucidated. We expand upon these findings in detail in a revised discussion with a new model that incorporates our additional experimental data.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions and feel that in combination these new experiments substantially strengthen the original conclusions of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) This study clearly demonstrated that ppk301 is involved in egg-laying behavior in females.

The reviewer is also correct that carrying out this experiment would require substantial effort in generating, testing, and validating new transgenic mosquito strains. We are at the early stages of generating optogenetic tools in the mosquito, but these are not at the point that we would feel confident interpreting the results. In lieu of carrying out the requested experiments, we have edited the model and discussion in Figure 5G as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>2) To more easily compare the results with artificial seawater to those with NaCl, it would be nice if the salt concentration were given for each percentage of artificial seawater</italic>.</p><p>We have generated a supplementary table with the molarity of each ion in the artificial seawater solutions and the NaCl solutions used in behavior. There are 11 distinct ions in the artificial seawater solution derived from 10 salts, and we have included each individual ion and the molarity of that ion in each dilution of artificial seawater, since this is the property that is most likely to affect the behavior of the mosquito. We do not expect that the behavior will track perfectly with Na<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration because artificial seawater contains many other salts that are known to affect physiology. However, a direct comparison can be made from the numbers listed in the table. The entire description of its composition is also in the cited reference (Kester et al., 1967). The complexity of artificial seawater is what prompted us to switch to NaCl for all future experiments.</p><p>It should be noted that for all other behavior and imaging experiments, solutions were made and the osmolality was empirically measured and adjusted using an osmometer. The preference for accuracy in osmolality rather than expected molarity based on weight means that the molarities listed for the NaCl solutions are the expected values for these solutions and not the measured values. We chose not to make any theoretical corrections based on environmental conditions, as we did not measure these at the time of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should cite:</p><p>Gustatory receptor neuron responds to DEET and other insect repellents in the yellow-fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti</p><p>By: Sanford, Jillian L.; Shields, Vonnie D.
