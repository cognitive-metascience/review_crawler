Here, we present evidence that the <italic>BLADE-ON-PETIOLE</italic> (<italic>BOP</italic>) genes, which have previously been shown to control leaf and flower development in Arabidopsis, are involved in controlling the abundance of PIF4.

In red-light-grown seedlings PIF4 ubiquitination was reduced in the <italic>bop2</italic> mutant. Moreover, we found that BOP proteins physically interact with both PIF4 and CULLIN3A and that a CULLIN3-BOP2 complex ubiquitinates PIF4 in vitro. This shows that BOP proteins act as substrate adaptors in a CUL3<sup>BOP1/BOP2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting PIF4 proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>light signalling</kwd><kwd>E3 ligase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>PIF4</kwd><kwd>PHYB</kwd><kwd>BOP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>Ove</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>Ove</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001858</institution-id><institution>VINNOVA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>Ove</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fankhauser</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The abundance of the PIF4 transcription factor, central in light and temperature signaling, is controlled by an E3 ligase encoded by BOP proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key element of plant adaptive responses is their ability to make morphological changes by adjusting the regulatory processes controlling their growth and development patterns in response to environmental stimuli such as changes in light and temperature. Members of the phytochrome light receptor family have the unique ability to sense red (R) and far-red (FR) light. They control germination, early seedling development, stem and internode elongation, the balance between leaf lamina and petiole formation (part of the shade avoidance syndrome) and the transition to flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franklin and Quail, 2010</xref>). All higher plants possess multiple phytochromes (phyA-phyE in Arabidopsis) with phyB being the primary photoreceptor mediating seedling de-etiolation in red light. A major function of phyB is to prevent the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS) in sunlight, an environment that is rich in red light and thus leading to phyB activation. In Arabidopsis phyB controls the SAS with major contributions from phyD and phyE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devlin et al., 1998</xref>). Recently, it was also shown that phyB can integrate light and temperature signals by acting as a thermosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Legris et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Once activated, phytochromes are transported from the cytosol to the nucleus, where they interact with a group of transcription factors from the Phytocrome Interacting Factor (PIF) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leivar and Monte, 2014</xref>). PIFs act as inhibitors of phytochrome-induced responses in a partially redundant manner and the phytochromes promote these responses by inhibiting the PIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorrain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leivar et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leivar et al., 2012</xref>). Different members of the PIF family display different functions in light and temperature regulated development. For instance, PIF1 is a repressor of seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oh et al., 2004</xref>), PIF4 plays a crucial role in the response to high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koini et al., 2009</xref>) and PIF4 and PIF5 induce leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakuraba et al., 2014</xref>). PIF4, PIF5 and PIF7 promote elongation of hypocotyls and petioles in response to shade cues (low R:FR and low blue light) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorrain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Wit et al., 2016</xref>). PIFs also display different modes of regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. For instance, phosphorylation of all studied PIFs is light regulated and in most cases lead to rapid protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leivar and Monte, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leivar et al., 2008a</xref>). The nature of the protein kinase(s) and the ubiquitin E3 ligase(s) involved in the regulation of PIF stability in response to light have just started to be explored. A recent paper suggests that phytochromes may phosphorylate the PIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2016</xref>). Also, the BR signaling kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) has been shown to phosphorylate PIF4 and subsequently affect PIF4 protein abundance, but in a non-light-inducible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardo-García et al., 2014</xref>). As for ubiquitin E3 ligases, the degradation of PIF3 by light was reported to be mediated by the Light Response Bric-a-Brack/Tramtrack/Broad (BTB) proteins (LRBs) interacting with Cullin3 (CUL3), while PIF1 degradation is controlled by a CUL4-COP1-SPA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that the degradation of different PIF proteins might be controlled by specific E3 ligase complexes. However, which E3 ligases that control PIF4 degradation has so far been unknown.</p><p>The CUL3-based E3 ligase complexes are composed of a CUL3 backbone, an E2-Ub-docking RING Box1 (RBX1) protein and a member from the large family of BTB-domain containing proteins that serve as target-recognition adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genschik et al., 2013</xref>). The Arabidopsis genome contains two <italic>CUL3</italic> genes, called <italic>CUL3A</italic> and <italic>CUL3B</italic> and about 80 genes encoding BTB domain proteins, which could be possible interactors with CUL3A and CUL3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gingerich et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Besides LRBs proteins, two other BTB domain containing proteins, NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES3 and 4 (NPR3 and 4), were shown to function as substrate adaptors in a CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to mediate degradation of the co-transcription factor NPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Two close homologs of NPR proteins, BOP1 and BOP2, were previously shown to redundantly regulate leaf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>). In Arabidopsis <italic>bop1 bop2</italic> double mutants the leaf lamina extends along the petioles and leaves one and two become massively elongated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>), phenotypic alterations that are reminiscent of responses to changes in light quality and light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franklin and Quail, 2010</xref>). <italic>bop1 bop2</italic> double mutants are also defective in the suppression of bract formation, do not form floral organ abscission zones and display alterations in floral organ identity and positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McKim et al., 2008</xref>). The molecular function of BOP proteins is not known but they have been suggested to act as co-transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) or to inhibit transport of transcription factors to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimada et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we report that BOP proteins act as substrate adaptors in a CUL3 E3 ligase complex to control the degradation of PIF4. This regulatory activity has a strong influence on the role of PIF4 during responses to light and temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BOP2 promotes photomorphogenesis in red light</title><p>First, we explored the possibility that <italic>BOP</italic> genes may be involved in the regulation of light signaling by analyzing their role in the light-dependent suppression of hypocotyl elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).

One recent study has shown that high temperature increases the rate of reversion from the active Pfr form to the inactive Pr form of phyB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Legris et al., 2016</xref>).

All together, these data suggest that BOP-mediated control of PIF4 abundance is important to control not only the light-mediated but also the temperature-mediated growth response in Arabidopsis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PIF4 is now established as a central component in the regulation of plant growth in response to many different environmental and hormonal signaling pathways, such as the response to light, temperature, gibberellins and brassinolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakuraba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardo-García et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lucyshyn and Wigge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pedmale et al., 2016</xref>). For light signaling it has been known for quite some time that this involves the regulation of PIF4 stability through ubiquitination targeting the protein for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorrain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorrain et al., 2008</xref>). However, the nature of the E3 ligase complex mediating this ubiquitination has been unknown. Here we show that the BOP proteins can act as substrate adaptors in a CUL3<sup>BOP1/BOP2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that can ubiquitinate and target PIF4 for degradation. This has a significant contribution in regulating the levels of PIF4 particularly during de-etiolation in red light and when growing plants at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). However, other E3 ligases or proteases are likely to contribute since PIF4 ubiquitination and degradation is not completely abolished in <italic>bop</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENES 1 (HOS1) was shown to interact with both phyB and PIF4. However, instead of mediating PIF4’s protein degradation, HOS1 was found to suppress transcriptional activity of PIF4 without affecting its protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we show that the degradation of PIF4 is mediated by a novel Cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase. All these findings suggest a complexity of the regulation of PIF protein abundance by different E3 ubiquitin ligases. Interestingly, apart from the light-triggered protein degradation, the CUL4-COP1-SPA E3 ligase was suggested to be involved in PIF1 degradation in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Recent reports also show that DELLA proteins in the GA signaling pathway mediate PIF3 degradation in a non-light-inducible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and that PIF4 protein abundance can be regulated in a non-light-inducible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardo-García et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, we observed that PIF4 protein abundance is higher in <italic>bop2</italic> mutant background in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) suggesting that the CUL3-BOP E3 ubiquitin ligase might also be involved in the regulation of PIF4 protein stability in the dark.</p><p>In previous studies, BOP proteins have been suggested to act as co-transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) and to have a role in directing BZR1 protein translocation from the cytosol to the nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimada et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that the BOP proteins can act as substrate adaptors in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes raises the interesting question whether BOP proteins act in the same way in these previously described processes and, if so, what are their targets? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>BOP1/2 belongs to the BTB-ankyrin protein family containing 6 members, including NRP1/2/3/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khan et al., 2014</xref>). NPR1 was also first identified as a co-transcription factor, acting as a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mou et al., 2003</xref>). Further studies found that NPR1 and its paralogs NPR3/4 are actually the receptors of the immune signal salicylic acid(SA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, NPR3/4 were shown to serve as substrate adaptors in a Cullin3 E3 ligase complex targeting NPR1 for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings provide further evidence of E3 ligase activity in this gene family. However, compared to NPR proteins, BOP1/2 play roles in multiple developmental processes.</p><p>The BTB-ankyrin family belongs to the BTB domain containing protein super family with about 80 members in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gingerich et al., 2005</xref>). Another subfamily of the BTB proteins, including LIGHT-RESPONSE BTB1, 2, and 3 (LRB1, 2, and 3), were shown to interact with CUL3 and have been suggested to be part of a CUL3 E3 ligase complex with probable targets in the phyB and phyD signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christians et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study proved that LRB1 and LRB2 can target PIF3 for degradation in a light-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). The degradation of PIF1 was shown to be mediated by a CUL4-COP1-SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, both <italic>spa</italic> and <italic>lrb</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to light, which is somewhat counterintuitive given that they control the degradation of PIFs which promote elongation. One explanation for those phenotypes is that LRBs and SPAs also control the degradation of other targets that play an opposite role in the control of hypocotyl elongation. Indeed, the LRB-PIF3 interaction induced the degradation of phyB, and SPAs also control the degradation of proteins such as HRF1 and HY5 which promote de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheerin et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, <italic>bop2</italic> mutants are hyposensitive to red light associated with enhanced accumulation of its target PIF4 and show no alterations in phyB levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b,c</xref>) suggesting that BOP2 plays a less pleiotropic role in the control of de-etiolation than LRBs and SPAs.</p><p>It is common among substrate adaptors in Cullin E3 ligase complexes to form both homo- and hetero-dimers, something that can potentially increase their target range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosu and Kipreos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hua and Vierstra, 2011</xref>). One can speculate, as has been done for other BTB substrate adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christians et al., 2012</xref>), that BOPs sometimes work as homodimers, which would explain the unique role of BOP2 in controlling red light suppression of hypocotyl elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), while sometimes BOP1 and BOP2 can work as heterodimers to control other environmental response, which would explain the role of both BOP1 and BOP2 in controlling high temperature induction of hypocotyl elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these findings suggest that E3 ligases with different substrate adaptors target proteins for degradation at different steps in the phytochrome/PIF signaling pathway. This working model is also confirmed from our studies of phyB/BOP interactions during later stages of development. When grown in constant red light <italic>phyB</italic> mutants displayed a constitutive shade-avoidance response with long petioles but maintained a normal rosette habit with no internodal elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, dramatic elongation of rosette internodes was observed in all combinations of <italic>phyB</italic> and <italic>bop</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The <italic>phyB bop</italic> mutant combinations appeared similar to <italic>phyB phyD phyE</italic> triple mutants, which also show rosette internodal elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devlin et al., 1998</xref>). This suggests that <italic>BOP1</italic> and <italic>BOP2</italic> are involved in phyB/D/E-mediated suppression of the shade avoidance syndrome in red light and, in contrast to the regulation of hypocotyl elongation, <italic>BOP1</italic> and <italic>BOP2</italic> are needed together in this suppression. This suggests that the BOP proteins can also affect other phytochrome signal transduction pathways, besides the phyB pathway.</p><p>One outstanding question relates to the role of phosphorylation in the BOP-directed PIF4 ubiquitination and degradation. Our data indicate that PIF4 phosphorylation is not a pre-requisite for BOP2-mediated PIF4 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a very low level of PIF4-HA polyubiquitination in dark, which was clearly reduced in the <italic>pif4 bop2</italic> background compared to the <italic>pif4</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that although BOP-mediated PIF4 degradation is stronger in the light, it also occurs in darkness. However, the physiological consequences of this regulatory mechanism are particularly strong during de-etiolation and growth at elevated temperatures. It has been shown that protein phosphorylation is absolutely required for the interaction of PIF3 with its E3 ligase LRB2 (20). Phosphorylation also affects the stability of PIF4 during brassinolide signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardo-García et al., 2014</xref>), although it is unclear if this is absolutely required for PIF4 degradation. Our in vitro results using recombinant (unphosphorylated) <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced proteins suggest that phosphorylation is not required for BOP2 binding to, and ubiquitination of, PIF4. This is then in contrast to the situation with PIF3. This does not exclude that phosphorylation will further enhance BOP binding to PIF4 in vivo, or that it has an effect on ubiquitination and degradation following BOP binding. This will be an important question for future research. Our results show that BOP controls PIF4 stability in both light- and temperature responses suggesting that BOP might serve as a more general regulator of PIF4 accumulation, also affecting other pathways acting through PIF4.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The mutants and transgenic plants used in this study have been previously described, and were: <italic>bop1-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>), bop1-6D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>), bop2-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepworth et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>)</italic>, <italic>35S::BOP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>), 35S::BOP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norberg et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>pif4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorrain et al., 2008</xref>)</italic>, <italic>35S::PIF4-HA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorrain et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>cry1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mockler et al., 1999</xref>)</italic>, <italic>cry2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mockler et al., 1999</xref>)</italic>, <italic>phyA</italic> (Salk line N520360), <italic>phyB</italic> (Salk line N569700), the two Salk lines were obtained from NASC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

After three times washing with the binding buffer, proteins were eluted with 2x laemli loading buffer then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>TUBEs analysis</title><p>The Immunoprecipitateion of ubiquitinated proteins from <italic>pif4;PIF4p::PIF4-HA</italic> and <italic>pif4 bop2;PIF4p::PIF4-HA</italic> seedlings using Tandem Ubiquitin Binding Entities (TUBEs) agarose (tebu-bio, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France) were performed as previously described with slight modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). 3-day-old dark-grown seedlings were irradiated with 6 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup> red light for 2 min followed by 8 min in the dark before harvesting. Proteins were extracted with a buffer containing 100 mM MOPS, pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM Iodoacetamide, 1 mM PMSF, 2 μg/l aprotinin, 40 µM MG132, 5 µM PR-619, 1 mM 1,10-Phenanthroline, and 2X Complete protease inhibitor Cocktail and PhosStop cocktail (Roche). 30 µl Agarose-TUBE2 was incubated with 2 mg total protein from each sample for 6 hr at 4°C. The agarose beads were washed with extraction buffer four times and eluted with 2x laemli loading buffer then subjected to Western blot analysis with the 16B12 anti-HA-POD antibodies (Roche) for detection of PIF4-HA and anti-ubiquitin antibodies (sc-8017, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for detection of ubiquitinatied protein. The intensities of western blot band signals collected from the LAS-3000 Imaging System (Fuji) and were measured using Image J. Quantification was performed with the measurements of 6 independent experiments using anti-ubiquitin antibodies as loading controls. Statistical analysis and blot-whisker plots were done using the GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro ubiquitination assays</title><p>His-GST-PIF4, His-GST-GFP, His-MBP-BOP2, and His-MBP-GFP were generated from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 cells and purified using Ni-NTA Agarose from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Human Cullin3/Rbx1 recombinant proteins were purchased from Ubiquigent (UK). The Neddylation of the Cullin3 was performed as previously described using a NEDD8 Conjugation Reaction Buffer Kit from R&amp;D Systems Europe (Abingdon, UK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duda et al., 2008</xref>). The recombinant human ubiquitin-activating enzymes (UBE1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UbcH5b) were purchased from R&amp;D Systems Europe. Ubquitination reactions were performed as described previously with slight modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). About 100 nM UBE1, 1 µM UbcH5b, 100 nM Cul3/Rbx1, 290 nM GST-PIF4, 500 nM MBP-BOP2, were incubated at 30°C for 1 hr in a buffer containing 40 µM biotin-ubiquitin, 5 mM Mg-ATP, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 Unit Inorganic pyrophophatase, and 1 mM DTT. Reactions were then pulled down with 10 µl Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads. GST-PIF4 and ubiquitinated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-GST antibodies and streptavidin-HRP conjugates, respectively. Anti-MBP antibodies were used for detection of the MBP proteins after pulldown. The reactions without E1, E2, or Cul3/Rbx1, and the reactions with MBP-GFP or GST-GFP were used as negative controls.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council, The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, and the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems to ON and from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 310030B141181) to CF.

Your article has been reviewed by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Hao Yu (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

In this manuscript, Zhang et al. identifies the BOP proteins as CUL3-based substrate receptors that target PIF4 for the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation. They first showed that BOP2 is important in red light-mediated photomorphogenic responses and that pif4 is epistatic to bop2. Then, they demonstrated that the red light-induced reduction of PIF4 proteins are dampened in bop2. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo interaction assays, they further showed that BOPs can interact with CUL3A and PIF4, that the level of ubiquitinated PIF4 is reduced in bop2 and that PIF4 can be ubiquitinated in the presence of BOP2 and the CUL3 machinery. Finally, they reported that in contrast to pif4, bop mutants are hypersensitive to heat and bop2 has a higher level of PIF4 proteins.</p><p>Taken together, this manuscript is well-written with a clear logic and provides important insights into regulation of PIF4 abundance in response to light and temperature. However, based on the previous findings on various E3 ligase complexes for other PIFs, justification of this manuscript to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> should be strengthened by more convincing and solid data as stated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One important question that the authors have not addressed is the effect of phosphorylation of PIF4 on the proposed recognition and degradation. It is well-established that light induces rapid phosphorylation and degradation of PIFs, including PIF4, and the more recent work on PIF3 demonstrated the importance of PIF3 phosphorylation in mediating the light-dependent interaction with its substrate receptors (Ni et al., Science 2014). Thus, it is important to test how PIF4 phosphorylation affects its binding to BOPs. This shall help reveal the functional role of the BOP-mediated degradation and potentially address how the degradation is controlled by light.</p><p>2) Based on the phenotypes of bop1, bop2 and their double mutants, BOP1 and BOP2 may preferentially mediate PIF4 abundance under different environmental conditions. This manuscript at this stage does not present consistent biochemical data along with the genetic data. Almost all biochemical data are focused on BOP2, while genetic data usually include both bop1 and bop2.

However, the situation is very different for PIF3 and PIF4. For PIF3 there are phospho-dead and phospho-mimic multisite mutants available that show the absolute requirement of PIF3 phosphorylation for binding to the E3 ligase LRB2 (Ni et al. 2014). However, no such mutants are available for PIF4. Bernardo-Garciá et al. (2014) have shown that mutations at three different putative phosphorylation sites somewhat modulates the stability of the PIF4 protein at dawn, probably associated with a brassinolide response. But it is not clear whether phosphorylation is an absolute requirement for degradation. Based on the western blot presented in this paper this mutant still presents clear light-induced phosphorylation as observed by the presence of a slower migrating band in the light. Because this PIF4 mutant is still phosphorylated in response to light we believe that it is not an efficient tool to address the role of PIF4 phosphorylation for binding to BOP and BOP-mediated degradation. Furthermore, our data clearly show that the situation is very different for the BOP-PIF4 interaction compared to the LRB2-PIF3 interaction since in our in vitro experiments phosphorylation is not required for binding (our <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced recombinant proteins are non-phosphorylated). This does not exclude that phosphorylation might be important to modulate the binding activity in vivo, but at least show a clear difference in the basal requirements for binding. We have expanded the Discussion in order to be clearer about this point.</p><p>Also, although the effect of BOPs on PIF4 accumulation is most visible in the light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), our data is consistent with a role of BOPs that is not restricted to the light. Indeed, we observed a very low level of PIF4 ubiquitination in the dark, and we have included a new supplementary figure to show this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This ubiquitination was very much reduced in the <italic>bop2</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore conclude that BOP2-mediated PIF4 degradation is not strictly dependent on light-induced PIF4 phosphorylation, however this regulatory mechanism has a strong influence on PIF4 abundance in the light. This situation is therefore profoundly different from LRB-mediated PIF3 degradation.</p><p><italic>2) Based on the phenotypes of bop1, bop2 and their double mutants, BOP1 and BOP2 may preferentially mediate PIF4 abundance under different environmental conditions. This manuscript at this stage does not present consistent biochemical data along with the genetic data. Almost all biochemical data are focused on BOP2, while genetic data usually include both bop1 and bop2. As the authors have by default included BOP1 and BOP2 in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, they should present evidence that BOP1 also affects PIF4 protein abundance under certain conditions.</italic> </p><p>We initially characterized <italic>bop</italic> mutants in response to different light qualities and found out that BOP2 has a dominant role, which led us to concentrate on BOP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, as the reviewers have pointed out, we have also found that BOP1 plays a role in other conditions, for example in 12/12 hour-grown plants and in high temperature. To be consistent we have now included data from 12/12 hour-grown plants to show that under these conditions PIF4 accumulation is also controlled by BOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors should preferably provide co-IP data for the interaction between BOP1/2 with PIF4 and CUL3A using protein extracts from transgenic lines rather than Arabidopsis protoplasts.</italic> </p><p>We agree that in general such data is preferable. However, such data have been very hard to generate because of the weak and specific expression of BOPs when expressed from their endogenous promoters. We have been able to generate data from transgenic plants for the BOP-CUL3 interaction using a CUL3 antibody (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but for the BOP-PIF4 interaction this would require protein extracts from transgenic plants simultaneously overexpressing tagged BOP and PIF4 proteins and unfortunately no such plants are yet available. However, we have confirmed the interaction between BOP2 and PIF4 with four independent methods (co-IP from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts, BiFC in Nicotiana leaves, in vitro interactions with purified recombinant proteins and yeast 2-hybrid assays). We have also demonstrated the interaction with the in vitroubiquitination assay. Since theses interaction data are consistent with both the genetic and other biochemical data we hope that this will be convincing enough.</p></body></sub-article></article>
