As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5’ untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14663.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14663.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>HIV-1 is the virus that causes AIDS – short for acquired immune deficiency syndrome – in humans. When HIV-1 infects a person, it targets cells of the immune system, which normally act to defend the body against infections. As the virus spreads from one immune cell to the next, it weakens the immune system so that individuals become more vulnerable to other illnesses. A cell infected with HIV-1 creates new virus particles at its surface and then releases the particles so that they can infect other cells.</p><p>HIV-1 viruses encode their genetic information as molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA). However, the host cell also makes many other RNA molecules that do not contain virus genes so there must be a mechanism in place to ensure that the new virus particles only contain viral RNA. An HIV-1 protein called Gag is responsible for assembling new virus particles and several Gag proteins come together on the cell membrane to form a honeycomb-like structure called the immature lattice. However, it is not clear how Gag is able to select the right RNA molecules.</p><p>To study how RNA is packaged into new HIV-1 particles, Carlson et al. used artificial versions of the cell membrane, viral RNA and the virus protein Gag to create a simple cell-free system. This system shows that all that is needed for viral RNA to be correctly packaged into new HIV-1 particles is for Gag to be attached to the cell membrane in such a way that the lattice forms correctly. Disturbing the immature lattice by altering the Gag proteins can result in a drastic loss of RNA selectivity. Further experiments show that other molecules in host cells called transfer RNAs enhance the ability of Gag to select the RNAs that encode virus genes.</p><p>Carlson et al.’s findings reveal a link between the formation of the Gag lattice and the packaging of virus genes into new virus particles. Drugs that inhibit this process could have the potential to be used as therapies against HIV-1. A future challenge will be to re-create the entire process of HIV-1 assembly in a cell-free system, which would make it easier to develop new drugs that target the process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14663.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14663.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>virus assembly</kwd><kwd>viral genome packaging</kwd><kwd>SHAPE</kwd><kwd>giant unilamellar vesicles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI112442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurley</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM082250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM103297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keane</surname><given-names>Sarah C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro reconstitution shows how HIV-1 Gag assemblies on membranes can package the RNA genome in the presence of a vast excess of competing cellular RNAs, and that selectivity and immature lattice assembly are deeply intertwined with one another.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Packaging the correct genetic material is a key event in the assembly of an infectious virus. In the case of HIV-1, both the recognition of the genomic RNA, its targeting to the plasma membrane, and assembly of a membrane-enveloped virus around it is carried out by the viral protein Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freed, 2015</xref>). The nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag has two zinc knuckle motifs which together with adjacent residues interact with the viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkowitz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2011b</xref>). Mutations in NC that interfere with RNA binding lead to formation of non-infectious viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorelick et al., 1990</xref>). Transcription of the integrated HIV-1 provirus results in both spliced and unspliced transcripts, coding for different viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffin et al., 1997</xref>). Gag selectively packages unspliced, full-length genomic RNA through interactions with its 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR), which is different in spliced and unspliced constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzembayeva et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to sequences that mediate the packaging of the genomic RNA, the 5’UTR also has sequence elements related to transcription processivity (TAR), binding of tRNA<sup>Lys-3</sup> as a primer for reverse transcription (PBS), and genome dimerization (DIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Telesnitsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzembayeva et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Single-virion fluorescence assays indicate that &gt;90% of released HIV-1 particles have packaged genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), and packaging of a dimeric genome appears to be strongly preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuragi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nikolaitchik et al., 2013</xref>). The packaging of a single dimeric genome is independent of RNA mass, since genomes with altered lengths are always packaged as single dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nikolaitchik et al., 2013</xref>). Genomic RNAs with sequence differences are efficiently packaged as heterodimers as long as they have identical DIS sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The ψ/SL3 stem loop region in the 5’UTR was initially identified as a sequence required for efficient packaging of genomic RNA into HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lever et al., 1989</xref>). Later work characterized a more extended core encapsidation signal (CES) which also includes the U5:AUG and PBS stems, the dimerization signal (DIS) and the splice donor (SD) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heng et al., 2012</xref>). Unpaired and weakly paired guanosines in several regions of the CES, including but not limited to ψ/SL3 were identified as important for packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenyon et al., 2015</xref>). Structures of NC complexed with ψ/SL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Guzman et al., 1998</xref>) and other smaller fragments from the 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2011b</xref>) have provided atomic details of how the two zinc knuckles and adjacent motifs of NC interact with RNA. A crystal structure of the DIS:DIS dimerization complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ennifar et al., 2001</xref>) along with an NMR structure of the entire CES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keane et al., 2015</xref>) put these structures in the context of a larger RNA. Thus, we now have a detailed understanding of RNA structural determinants for packaging at the level of individual 5’UTR dimers.</p><p>A single released HIV-1 virus contains one dimeric genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) and 2400 ± 700 Gag molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that the selective genome packaging may depend on more than just the binary NC-CES interaction. Indeed, cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) revealed a strikingly different RNA preference of cytosolic and membrane-bound Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>). Cytosolic Gag binds tRNA through its otherwise membrane-binding matrix (MA) domain, and associates mainly with cellular RNAs through its NC domain. The minor fraction of cytosolic Gag which binds viral RNA has a strong preference for the 5’UTR but also binds to the Rev-responsive element (RRE), whose main function is thought to be in nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzembayeva et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, Gag in the membrane fraction has lost its tRNA association and is strongly enriched for viral RNA, interacting with equal probability with all parts of the genomic RNA. Existing structural and biochemical data are not sufficient to explain how a pool of cytosolic Gag, binding mainly cellular RNA, assembles into virus particles which package dimeric viral genomes with 90% probability.</p><p>Here, we have reconstituted the selective genome packaging of HIV-1 in a minimal system using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), recombinant myristoylated HIV-1 Gag and purified RNAs. Gag assembling on GUV membranes selectively packages the HIV-1 5’UTR at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA. We find that the RNA selectivity of Gag is abolished by mutations that subtly affect its ability to cluster on a membrane. Using SHAPE analysis, we find that membrane recruitment of the 5’UTR by Gag does not lead to drastic changes in its secondary structure, and we further demonstrate that the association of soluble Gag with tRNA confers additional RNA packaging selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro reconstitution of selective RNA packaging by membrane-bound HIV-1 Gag</title><p>We previously reported an in vitro reconstitution of HIV-1 assembly using recombinant myristoylated Gag protein and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson and Hurley, 2012</xref>). We showed that GUV-bound Gag clusters mimic the behavior of cellular HIV-1 budding sites in their lipid requirements for assembly, nucleic acid- and ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) protein binding. We reasoned that this system could also be used to study the RNA selection of an assembling HIV-1 virus. The 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) and the Rev-responsive element (RRE) of the HIV-1 genome (nucleotides 1–345 and 7259–7612, of the genomic RNA of HIV-1 strain NL4-3 and ARV-2/SF2, respectively), along with a nominally unstructured 378 nt single-stranded control RNA (RNA378), were produced by in vitro transcription. The 1–345 construct was previously shown to dimerize even in the absence of Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heng et al., 2012</xref>). RNAs were labeled with the fluorophore Alexa488 on random guanosines, at measured average labeling efficiencies of ~1.1–1.2 fluorophores per RNA molecule. 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 was premixed with 0.5 nM fluorescent RNA, and added to GUVs which were imaged by confocal microscopy starting 10 min after addition of protein and RNA. Due to the reported Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the 5’UTR dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was included in the final buffer. The addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the imaging buffer made the GUV morphology more variable, but this increased morphological heterogeneity did not hamper the experiments nor the image quantification.</p><p>In order to quantitate the RNA occupancy of assemblies, ten confocal z-stacks were recorded at random positions on each sample, with each data set containing an average of 50–100 GUVs. Strong RNA fluorescence was consistently observed at Gag clusters on GUV membranes, regardless of which RNA was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c,g</xref>). This RNA recruitment was dependent on the NC domain of Gag since neither a ΔNC Gag nor Gag treated with the Zn-finger disrupting drug AT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rossio et al., 1998</xref>) was able to recruit fluorescent RNA to GUV membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To study the RNA selectivity of assembling Gag in the reconstituted system, we included a ten fold excess (5 nM) of non-fluorescent RNA378 when premixing RNA and Gag. After assembly on GUVs, the fluorescent 5’UTR was still visible at most Gag clusters in the presence of ten fold excess competitor RNA, whereas RRE was present at fewer Gag clusters and at lower fluorescence intensities, and fluorescent RNA378 was virtually absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f,g</xref>). Image analysis based on automatic segmentation of Gag clusters and measurement of their average RNA fluorescence confirmed the visual impressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vitro reconstitution of selective RNA packaging by HIV-1 Gag.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Confocal fluorescence micrograph of GUVs containing 5% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. 100 nM HIV-1 Gag-ATTO594 and 0.5 nM HIV-1 5’UTR-Alexa488 were premixed and added to the exterior of the GUVs which were imaged 10 min later.

This set of mutations was previously found to reduce packaging in a cellular packaging assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keane et al., 2015</xref>). 5’UTR mono has the GCGCGC sequence in DIS replaced by GAGA, creating a monomeric 5’UTR. 5’UTR 3way1-mono combines the 3way1 and mono mutations. Lastly, 5’UTR env-1 represents the first 345 nt of a spliced viral RNA, with the nucleotides after splice donor site G290 replaced by the nucleotides after splice acceptor site A5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoltzfus, 2009</xref>). In a competition assay similar to the one reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 was premixed with 0.5 nM 5’UTR-Alexa488 and 5 nM of either non-fluorescent 5’UTR construct, and added to GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–f</xref>). In the presence of 5 nM 5’UTR very little fluorescent 5’UTR could be seen at Gag clusters on GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,g</xref>). However, in the presence of either of the altered constructs, more fluorescent 5’UTR was visible at Gag clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f,g</xref>). Thus, the in vitro packaging assay is able to detect the lower affinity of assembling Gag for monomeric, 3way1-mutated, and spliced 5’UTRs.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of 5’UTR alterations on packaging by HIV-1 Gag.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the HIV-1 5’UTR indicating introduced mutations.

The 5’UTR is strongly selected for in a competition assay, whereas the RRE is only partially selected for after addition of competitor. 5’UTRs that are either monomerized, have packaging-critical guanines mutated to adenines, or represent a spliced viral RNA are less favored in the competition assay. Given the low concentrations at which this selectivity is observed, below the reported 17 nM affinity constant for 5’UTR-NC association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heng et al., 2012</xref>), we turned our attention to potential avidity effects due to Gag multimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNA selectivity depends upon intact CA domain lattice contacts</title><p>We next sought to determine whether there was a connection between RNA selectivity by Gag, and its assembly into the membrane-bound hexagonal 'immature' lattice found in viral budding sites and released immature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freed, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To this end, we produced Gag proteins mutated at symmetry contacts in its lattice-forming CA domain. The W316D,M317D mutation (&quot;Gag two-fold&quot;) alters a motif at the two fold symmetry contact in the CA C-terminal domain (CA-CTD), which is described in the literature to be important for virus assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamble et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>). When this protein was added to GUVs at 100 nM, it bound in a strikingly different way from wild-type Gag, often resulting in a diffuse Gag fluorescence covering the entire GUV membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f,g</xref>). For comparison, wild type Gag essentially only bound to GUVs in clusters even in the absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,g</xref>). Based on the structure of the immature CA lattice in intact HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schur et al., 2015</xref>), we further produced a triple mutant (&quot;Gag three-fold&quot;: P170E, A174E, E177R) designed to alter a three-helix interaction at the three fold interface in CA-NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,c</xref>). This protein bound GUVs similarly to wild-type Gag, albeit with a moderate increase in the diffuse binding first observed for Gag two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). A Gag protein mutated at the six fold interface in CA-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,d</xref>) with the single-residue replacement K290A (&quot;Gag six-fold&quot;) reported to affect virus assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), also showed an increase in diffuse Gag binding over wild-type Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

We first compared the membrane binding of Gag proteins in the presence of RNA to Gag proteins alone as characterized above. We observed that the presence of RNA increased the clustering of all Gag proteins, and increased the fraction of GUVs which had bound Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, the capacity of the Gag proteins to recruit fluorescent RNA in the absence of competitor was studied. Each Gag construct was premixed with 0.5 nM fluorescent 5’UTR and added to GUVs. Recruitment of fluorescent 5’UTR to the GUV membrane was observed for all Gag constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>), with a quantitation showing a slight decrease in recruitment for the Gag two-fold and Gag two-, three- , six-fold mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). However, when a ten fold excess of non-fluorescent competitor RNA (5 nM RNA378) was added, the Gag proteins behaved differently from each other. Wild type Gag retained as much 5’UTR fluorescence in the presence of competitor RNA as in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f,k</xref>) and the Gag three-fold mutant showed only a minor decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h,k</xref>). On the other hand, GUV-bound clusters of the Gag two-fold, Gag six-fold and Gag two-, three-, six-fold mutants lost most of their 5’UTR fluorescence in the presence of competitor RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,i–k</xref>). Thus, RNA selectivity in this assay closely correlates with clustered binding of Gag to GUVs in the absence of RNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4k</xref>). In summary, mutations which cause subtle changes in the ability of Gag to multimerize on a membrane drastically decrease the RNA selectivity of assembled Gag clusters, without greatly affecting their ability to bind RNA non-specifically.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RNA selectivity of CA domain mutants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Confocal micrograph of GUV, 10 min after adding 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 and 0.5 nM 5’UTR -Alexa488.

First, we examined the SHAPE profile of the 5’UTR RNA in solution by itself. The RNA-only SHAPE profile is highly consistent with the recently reported solution structure of the HIV-1 RNA packaging signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keane et al., 2015</xref>), with the tandem three-way junctions exhibiting modest SHAPE reactivities, reflecting the loosely base-paired nature of this region. On the other hand, well based-paired stem regions in the DIS, PBS, U5:AUG, and ψ/SL3 sequences exhibit low or no SHAPE reactivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The dimer-promoting DIS loop (G257-C262) had no SHAPE reactivity. This is not per se an unequivocal indication of the 5’ UTR being dimeric since DIS has been reported to partially base-pair with U5 in the monomeric conformation of the 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2011a</xref>). However, the SHAPE reactivity of the SD region G289-G292 (highlighted with a gray shaded box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) is consistent with the reported 3D structure of the dimeric conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keane et al., 2015</xref>), not with the completely unprotected loop proposed for the monomeric 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2011a</xref>). A longer 356 nt 5’UTR able to assume both monomer- and a dimer-favoring conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heng et al., 2012</xref>) had a similar SHAPE reactivity to the 345 nt 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>), indicating that it is present mainly as a dimer under the conditions of the study. We next compared the SHAPE profiles of isolated RNA, and RNA in complexes mimicking steps in the genome packaging. Isolated NC domain was selected to represent the initial interaction of a single Gag molecule with the 5’UTR, ΔMA(1–119)-Gag for a potential soluble Gag-RNA complex involving CA-mediated Gag-Gag interactions, and Gag clusters on GUVs as a model of viral budding sites on the plasma membrane. In all measurements, protein was kept in excess (solution protein:RNA ratio 8:1, GUV protein:RNA ratio 20:1). For a SHAPE analysis on GUV-bound RNA, reactions were set up as for confocal imaging, and GUVs were found to be intact during the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The amount of free RNA in the GUV supernatant was typically 10–20% of the total RNA, dependent on the presence of both GUVs and Gag. The SHAPE profiles for 5’UTR were very similar in the presence of NC, ΔMA-Gag, and when bound to Gag clusters on GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon Gag binding, major SHAPE changes were observed in the following clusters: U117-U122, G234-A242, A271-G273, and A302-G309 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Among them, the two clusters exhibiting decreased SHAPE reactivity (G234-C242 and A271-G273) surround the two guanine-rich bulges on the DIS stem. This Gag-mediated decrease of RNA flexibility is consistent with, but does not necessarily reflect, direct Gag-RNA contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenyon et al., 2015</xref>). These clusters show a more pronounced decrease in SHAPE reactivity than the ψ loop G317-G320. The other two clusters showing major SHAPE reactivity changes, U117-U122 and A302-G309, are located around the tandem three-way junctions. Both regions exhibit higher SHAPE reactivities upon Gag binding, indicating that protein interactions lead to rearrangement of the local structure that results in higher RNA flexibility. However, GUV recruitment of the complex did not trigger additional SHAPE changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the overall structure of the 5’UTR is not further altered between the states of initial Gag binding in solution and recruitment to assembled Gag on a membrane. Noteworthy, the SHAPE reactivity of the SD region G289-G292 is similar under all conditions studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the 5’UTR is maintained in the dimeric conformation over the assembly process. Taken together, we see no evidence for large changes in secondary structures in the 5’UTR when interacting with either Gag in solution or assembled Gag on a membrane, and it appears dimeric under the conditions studied.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Probing Gag-induced structural changes on the HIV 5’UTR using SHAPE.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Secondary structure of the HIV 5’UTR RNA with SHAPE reactivities labeled.

We wanted to investigate whether Gag-tRNA interactions also play a role in selective RNA packaging. Premixing 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 with 1 µM yeast tRNA before addition to GUVs led to a virtually complete block in Gag assembly on GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref>). Since the amount of Gag on individual GUVs is more variable than the relative RNA fluorescence at Gag clusters, a membrane flotation assay was devised to quantitate the amount of Gag assembled on membranes. 100 nM Gag-ATTO488 was mixed with 0–20 µM tRNA, and incubated for 10 min with 1.0 µm large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing 5 mol% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Vesicles were subjected to flotation on a density step gradient and Gag fluorescence in the top fraction was measured. For the tRNA titration, a 50% inhibition of Gag membrane association was evident at 200 nM tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). At 20 µM tRNA, the amount of Gag found in the vesicle fraction dropped to ~10% of the value seen in the absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Next, long viral or unspecific RNAs at 5 nM concentration were added to Gag with or without tRNA. In addition to the above studied 5’UTR, RRE, and RNA378, an RNA corresponding to the first 1947 nucleotides of the HIV-1 strain NL4-3 genomic RNA was studied (HIV1947), along with a single-stranded control RNA of similar length (RNA2266). In the absence of tRNA, all these RNAs slightly increased the amount of Gag associated with vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In the presence of 20 µM tRNA however, the 5’UTR and the longer HIV1947 RNA (which contains the 5’UTR sequence) enhanced membrane association by Gag more than the other RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). RNA378 had no effect on Gag membrane association in the presence of 20 µM tRNA, whereas the effect of RRE or the longer RNA2266 was slight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). In summary, tRNA at micromolar concentrations potently inhibits membrane association of Gag. Under such conditions, Gag that encounters viral RNA has a higher probability of overcoming that inhibition and associating with membrane.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of tRNA and viral RNA on Gag membrane association.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Confocal micrograph of GUVs, 10 min after adding 100 nM Gag-ATTO594.

We find a strong correlation between the ability of Gag to multimerize on a membrane and its selective packaging of viral RNA. Mutations in the lattice-forming CA domain that lessen Gag clustering on membranes (W316D,M317D and K290A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d,f,g</xref>) drastically lowered its RNA selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,i,k</xref>), without affecting the total capacity of Gag to recruit RNA to a membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,d,k</xref>).

Mutations at the three-fold symmetry contact in CA-NTD did not alter Gag clustering on membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>), concurring with observations that a ΔCA-NTD Gag still supports particle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borsetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accola et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy has delivered important constraints on the stoichiometry and the location of the RNA selection event. Genomic RNA is present at the onset of HIV-1 assembly at the plasma membrane, at which point the number of Gag molecules was reported to be below the detection limit of ~12 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jouvenet et al., 2009</xref>). Cytosolic Gag does not form large oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendrix et al., 2015</xref>) and mainly associates with cellular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>). A small fraction of cytosolic Gag is found to be slowly diffusing and consist of oligomers of up to ~5 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendrix et al., 2015</xref>). In a recent study, TIRF microscopy was used to study the monomer-dimer state of genomic HIV-1 RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). It was reported that the large majority of plasma membrane-proximal genomic HIV-1 RNAs are monomeric in the absence of HIV-1 Gag. In cells expressing Gag, monomeric genomic RNAs are seen to coalesce to dimers on the membrane, but were not observed to arrive to the membrane as dimers. That study and our results underscore the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging.</p><p>The SHAPE analysis focused on the secondary structure of the 5’UTR RNA in situations representing different stages of packaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). When comparing SHAPE reactivities of isolated 5’UTR, 5’UTR interacting with NC domain in solution, ΔMA-Gag in solution, or recruited to GUV membranes by clusters of full-length Gag, the changes in SHAPE reactivities were consistent with a conservation of secondary structure between all these states. Based on these results, there is no gross unfolding of the dimeric 5’UTR in the early steps of genomic RNA selection and packaging for HIV-1. This contrasts with reports that the packaging signal of the related retrovirus Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) is partially unfolded in released immature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grohman et al., 2014</xref>). The SHAPE reactivity pattern indicated that the 5’UTR was, as expected, dimeric in solution. This was observed both with the shorter 345 nt 5’UTR, which has been reported to be locked in a dimer-favoring conformation, and the longer 356 nt 5’UTR which is also capable of assuming a second conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heng et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the light of a recent report that most genomic HIV-1 RNAs in cells are monomeric until interacting with Gag on a membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), the isolated 5’UTR would thus be representative of the genome after engagement with Gag. It is possible that the RNA chaperone activity of Gag may be necessary to expose the 5’UTR and its DIS in the context of a full-length genome. The strongest decrease in SHAPE reactivity upon Gag interaction was found in the guanosine-rich bulges on the DIS stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), consistent with a recent study using full-length Gag in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</xref>). The increased SHAPE reactivity in central regions of the tandem three-way junction suggests that Gag engagement, while not leading to a drastic rearrangement of the 5’UTR secondary structure, may lead to alterations its 3D structure. Overall, our results show that RNA conformational changes upon binding to membrane-associated Gag are minor in magnitude and thus suggest that conformation rearrangements are likely to be a minor contributor to selective packaging.</p><p>Cytosolic RNA has been reported to regulate Gag membrane association, effectively increasing its selectivity for the plasma membrane lipid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alfadhli et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chukkapalli et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dick and Vogt, 2014</xref>). The RNA species that binds the Gag MA domain in cells was identified by deep sequencing as primarily consisting of tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>). Our reconstituted system allowed us to disentangle the effect that different RNAs have on Gag membrane association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We show that Gag-tRNA interactions may also serve to increase Gag fidelity for viral RNA. In the absence of tRNA, any long RNA caused a slight increase in Gag membrane association. But in the presence of 20 µM tRNA, 5’UTR and a longer 1947 nt fragment of the HIV-1 genome increased Gag membrane association more than other RNAs. We hypothesize that a viral RNA with several high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA.</p><p>In summary, our study leads to a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Lattice contacts conferring Gag ability to multimerize on a membrane are crucial for the selective packaging of viral RNA. The 5’UTR is recruited to membranes by multimerized Gag without any gross changes to its secondary structure. Moreover, the association of Gag with tRNA serves to inhibit genome-less virus assembly.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for selective HIV-1 genome packaging.</title><p>Cytosolic Gag (light gray triangles) is inhibited from membrane association by its association with tRNA (yellow).

Before SHAPE reactions, 9 μl of annealed 5’UTR RNA at 0.1 mg/ml was mixed with 1 μl of variants of Gag protein to achieve a final RNA:protein stoichiometry of ~1:8 (0.8 µM:7.2 µM).

For SHAPE analysis of GUV-bound RNA, reactions were set up in Lab-Tek II chambered coverglasses as for confocal imaging to ensure identical mixing kinetics and GUV settling as during imaging. Gag and 5’UTR were premixed with GUV dilution buffer to 150 µl total volume and after 5 min at room temperature were added to 150 µl GUVs in imaging chambers for final concentrations of 100 nM Gag and 5 nM 5’UTR. 10 min after mixing, 200 µl supernatant was gently aspirated. 15 µl 1M7 in DMSO was briefly premixed with 35 µl GUV dilution buffer to avoid exposing GUVs to undiluted DMSO, added to the remaining 100 µl GUV solution in the chamber, and mixed by gentle stirring.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Wes Sundquist, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The authors describe a reconstituted HIV RNA &quot;packaging&quot; system featuring specific interactions between the viral RNA and membrane-associated Gag polyprotein. Attractive features of the system include: 1) dependence upon the 5'UTR core packaging site, 2) a requirement for immature Gag assembly, and 3) tRNA inhibition of Gag-membrane interactions that is specifically overcome by RNAs that contain the HIV-1 5'UTR. In addition to describing the system, the authors point out that their study is the first to show that the structure of the dimeric RNA does not change significantly during the different steps of packaging, as evidenced by a relative lack of SHAPE reactivity changes. This report marks the next progression in the excellent studies from the Hurley lab in which they have reconstituted different stages of HIV-1 assembly in vitro.</p><p>In principle, these studies represent a significant advance, but several additional controls are necessary to ensure that the system is accurately mimicking viral RNA packaging as it occurs in the context of a cellular infection. Specifically, recent studies from other laboratories support a model in which HIV RNA packaging occurs through a stepwise pathway in which the viral RNA begins in a translatable conformation (Gag AUG codon exposed), converts into a dimerizing conformation (Gag AUG codon sequestered, DIS element exposed), interacts specifically with a small number of Gag molecules that bind guanosine clusters in the 5'UTR, and then interacts with a much larger number of Gag molecules along its entire length as the immature virion lattice assemblies at the membrane. Unspliced, dimeric RNA is selectively packaged against a background of cellular RNAs, spliced RNAs, and monomeric RNAs. Thus far, the in vitro system has been shown to recapitulate some, but not all of these features.</p><p>Substantive concerns to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors argue that their work &quot;will stand as the definitive in vitro study of HIV genome packaging&quot;. This is certainly a worthy goal, but to achieve it the authors need to do more to demonstrate that their system really does recapitulate all of the key aspects of specificity seen in the cellular context.</p><p>Specifically, the authors need to show:</p><p>A) Selective packaging of dimeric vs. mutant HIV RNAs (e.g., using DIS mutants that are shown experimentally not to dimerize and using other mutant(s) that have been shown to reduce packaging).</p><p>B) Selective packaging of unspliced RNAs (e.g., using mimics of spliced viral RNAs).</p><p>C) That NC mutants (or AT-2 treatment) reduce binding specificity.</p><p>D) That the membrane actually plays an important role in helping to generate RNA selectivity (this is shown indirectly by loss of specificity in the Gag assembly mutants, but it is not clear that the membrane is required for Gag assembly).</p><p>E) That Gag proteins actually bind along the length of the viral RNA when the RNA-Gag-membrane complex forms.</p><p>This is not just a list of &quot;extra&quot; experiments to do – we consider them essential for validating the in vitro packaging system.</p><p>2) The authors should show tests of statistical significance throughout. Some of the changes shown appear to be rather modest, and it is important to know that they are statistically significant (or discover that they are not).</p><p>3) Molecular interpretations of the fluorescence data are very difficult. Of what the &quot;Gag clusters&quot; really consist remains unknown, and the fluorescence visualization in some cases is marginal. The lipid dye sometimes shows what GUV experts would interpret to be &quot;junk&quot; and does not track uniformly around the periphery of the GUV (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, 1C</xref>). While the bar graph showing that Gag mutants (esp. the two-fold WM mutant) are defective in clustering seems quite convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), the actual GUV pictures used as examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> for wt, 2F for mutant) are not convincing at all. It is really hard to see much in these pictures and their quality should be improved.</p><p>Other points for the authors' consideration:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, why does addition of 10-fold excess of competitor RNA378 reduce Gag colocalization to 0% (I might have thought it would reduce it to 10%)?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it would be helpful to highlight the splice donor site, since the lack of SHAPE reactivity at that site is used as evidence that the RNA is in the packageable conformation. The authors might even consider showing the alternative conformation with a SD hairpin to emphasize that their SHAPE data fit with one conformation and not the other.</p><p>3) In the subsection “SHAPE-based mapping of interactions between the HIV-1 5’UTR and Gag in solution and on membranes”: It was not clear why different protein:RNA ratios were used in the solution vs. GUV reactions.</p><p>4) A related question is how the authors know that most of the RNA is bound by Gag proteins under these conditions.</p><p>5) In the subsection “RNA selectivity depends upon intact CA domain lattice contacts”, last paragraph: It appears that the authors meant to refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> (not 2F).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: One of the two RNAs seems to be missing its 3' tail (and the figure itself isn't labeled with a figure number).</p><p>7) The authors should probably discuss the point that the RNA structure from the Summers' laboratory that they use to interpret their SHAPE data is actually of the monomeric core packaging element. They argue, based upon the SHAPE data, that their RNA is dimeric even before it interacts with Gag, and this may well be true (though it should be shown more directly), but even if they're right it seems possible that the structures of the monomeric and dimeric core packaging RNA elements may differ in significant ways (beyond simply forming or not forming a DIS kissing loop).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14663.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Substantive concerns to be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors argue that their work &quot;will stand as the definitive in vitro study of HIV genome packaging&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We admit that the word “definitive” might have sounded too strong. This word was only used in the cover letter and is absent from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>This is certainly a worthy goal, but to achieve it the authors need to do more to demonstrate that their system really does recapitulate all of the key aspects of specificity seen in the cellular context.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specifically, the authors need to show:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Selective packaging of dimeric vs. mutant HIV RNAs (e.g., using DIS mutants that are shown experimentally not to dimerize and using other mutant(s) that have been shown to reduce packaging).</italic> </p><p><italic>B) Selective packaging of unspliced RNAs (e.g., using mimics of spliced viral RNAs).</italic> </p><p>These are excellent suggestions and very important points that concerned us as well. We address points A and B together in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We generated the following mutant 5'UTR RNAs: a DIS-mutant monomeric construct, a mutation of packaging-critical guanines around three-way-1 junction, the combination of the monomerization and 3way1 mutations, and the first 345 nt of the spliced RNA env-1. We let these RNAs compete with fluorescent wild type 5'UTR for recruitment to Gag clusters on GUVs, and could measure that all of the mutant RNAs are weaker competitors than the wild type 5'UTR. We believe these data forcefully make the case that the in vitro system recapitulates the main features of biological HIV-1 genome packaging.</p><p><italic>C) That NC mutants (or AT-2 treatment) reduce binding specificity.</italic> </p><p>The new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> show that either deletion of NC, or AT-2 treatment sharply reduce RNA recruitment, whereas a DMSO control still permits RNA recruitment to Gag clusters.</p><p><italic>D) That the membrane actually plays an important role in helping to generate RNA selectivity (this is shown indirectly by loss of specificity in the Gag assembly mutants, but it is not clear that the membrane is required for Gag assembly).</italic> </p><p>Our data, and specifically the findings that specificity is lost in 2-fold and 6-fold axis mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), strongly support our conclusion that Gag assembly is critical for specificity. The membrane is important in our model system as the platform on which all of the Gag assembly occurs, consistent with the accepted notion in the HIV field that the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice only assembles when Gag interacts with a membrane. The focus of HIV-1 budding research by our team is directed at reconstituting the most realistic possible in vitro model system for HIV-1 particle biogenesis and release, and this clearly requires the inclusion of membrane. It is possible to construct in vitro systems that assemble virus-like particles in the absence of membranes, notably the p6-deleted version of Gag studied by Rein and co-workers. It seems plausible to us that the system characterized by Rein might be able to selectively package RNA even in the absence of membranes, because that system is optimized for membrane-free assembly. Experimental tests of this seem to us to be far beyond the scope of this study and of our research program.</p><p><italic>E) That Gag proteins actually bind along the length of the viral RNA when the RNA-Gag-membrane complex forms.</italic></p><p>The best evidence we have to support binding along the length of the viral RNA is the gain in specificity relative to tRNA competition for the HIV1947 construct as compared to the 5’UTR construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). It would be difficult to explain this observation with other models, given the absence of additional known specific binding sites. We are not sure how this conclusion could be made stronger than it already is without bringing in some completely different technology (perhaps crosslinking coupled to deep sequencing, as already carried out by the Bieniasz group for Gag/RNA complexes isolated from cells) and making a major expansion of the scope of the study.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should show tests of statistical significance throughout. Some of the changes shown appear to be rather modest, and it is important to know that they are statistically significant (or discover that they are not).</italic></p><p>These have now been added throughout and support the significance of all the conclusions drawn previously.</p><p><italic>3) Molecular interpretations of the fluorescence data are very difficult. Of what the &quot;Gag clusters&quot; really consist remains unknown, and the fluorescence visualization in some cases is marginal. The lipid dye sometimes shows what GUV experts would interpret to be &quot;junk&quot; and does not track uniformly around the periphery of the GUV (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, 1C</xref>).</italic> </p><p>The components the in vitro system are fully defined: PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing GUVs, myristylated Gag, and in vitro transcribed RNA, so we do not feel it would be correct to state that the contents of the Gag clusters are “unknown”. With respect to the unevenly distributed membrane dye referred to as &quot;junk&quot;: Mg<sup>2+</sup> was added to the buffers in this study in order to ensure proper folding of the RNAs. We noticed that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> made the GUV morphology more variable, which is consistent with literature on the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on membranes containing anionic lipids. We now point this out in the text. The more variable GUV morphology does not influence the assignments of Gag and RNA clusters and causes no difficulty apart from a cosmetic one.</p><p><italic>While the bar graph showing that Gag mutants (esp. the two-fold WM mutant) are defective in clustering seems quite convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), the actual GUV pictures used as examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> for wt, 2F for mutant) are not convincing at all. It is really hard to see much in these pictures and their quality should be improved.</italic></p><p>We have now increased their brightness in all figures by a uniform and equal amount. In addition, we marked the GUVs having diffuse Gag binding in the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) with asterisks.</p><p><italic>Other points for the authors' consideration:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, why does addition of 10-fold excess of competitor RNA378 reduce Gag colocalization to 0% (I might have thought it would reduce it to 10%)?</italic></p><p>It is likely that the amount of fluorescent RNA at Gag clusters is reduced to 10%, not 0%. But our image analysis script makes a binary decision if a Gag cluster is positive for RNA based on an intensity threshold, and the reduction of the amount of fluorescent RNA by 90% apparently lowers the RNA fluorescence to below this threshold for all Gag clusters.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it would be helpful to highlight the splice donor site, since the lack of SHAPE reactivity at that site is used as evidence that the RNA is in the packageable conformation. The authors might even consider showing the alternative conformation with a SD hairpin to emphasize that their SHAPE data fit with one conformation and not the other.</italic> </p><p>We assume that the reviewers referred to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, which is 5A in the revised manuscript. The region is now marked with &quot;SD&quot; and highlighted with a gray-shaded box, as mentioned in the revised text.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection “SHAPE-based mapping of interactions between the HIV-1 5’UTR and Gag in solution and on membranes”: It was not clear why different protein:RNA ratios were used in the solution vs. GUV reactions.</italic> </p><p>The SHAPE experiments on GUVs were conducted at lower RNA and protein concentrations. To ensure that little unbound RNA was present during those experiments (see below), we chose to use a higher protein:RNA ratio.</p><p><italic>4) A related question is how the authors know that most of the RNA is bound by Gag proteins under these conditions.</italic> </p><p>In solution, the protein concentration of 7.2 µM is far in excess of the reported affinities between NC and 5'UTR (~17 nM according to Heng et al., 2012). For the studies on GUVs, we measured the RNA concentration in the GUV supernatant after a 5 min spin to pellet GUVs, and found that it was ~10-20% of added RNA, dependent on the presence of both Gag and GUVs. This is now stated in the Results section.</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection “RNA selectivity depends upon intact CA domain lattice contacts”, last paragraph: It appears that the authors meant to refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> (not 2F).</italic></p><p>Corrected.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: One of the two RNAs seems to be missing its 3' tail (and the figure itself isn't labeled with a figure number).</italic> </p><p>We have corrected these omissions.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should probably discuss the point that the RNA structure from the Summers' laboratory that they use to interpret their SHAPE data is actually of the monomeric core packaging element. They argue, based upon the SHAPE data, that their RNA is dimeric even before it interacts with Gag, and this may well be true (though it should be shown more directly), but even if they're right it seems possible that the structures of the monomeric and dimeric core packaging RNA elements may differ in significant ways (beyond simply forming or not forming a DIS kissing loop).</italic> </p><p>Heng et al. &amp; Summers (2012) showed that the construct used was dimeric in the absence of Gag, and this is now referenced. The point that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> show the monomeric structure is well-taken and that is now noted in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
