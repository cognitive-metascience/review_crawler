pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33505.001</object-id><p>The adipokine leptin acts on the brain to regulate energy balance but specific functions in many brain areas remain poorly understood. Among these, the preoptic area (POA) is well known to regulate core body temperature by controlling brown fat thermogenesis, and we have previously shown that glutamatergic, long-form leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing neurons in the POA are stimulated by warm ambient temperature and suppress energy expenditure and food intake. Here we further investigate the role of POA leptin signaling in body weight regulation and its relationship to body temperature regulation in mice. We show that POA Lepr signaling modulates energy expenditure in response to internal energy state, and thus contributes to body weight homeostasis. However, POA leptin signaling is not involved in ambient temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations. Our study reveals a novel cell population through which leptin regulates body weight.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>knockdown</kwd><kwd>body weight</kwd><kwd>energy

behavioral responses that are critical for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McKinley et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the POA controls sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and modulates energy expenditure to defend core body temperature in response to ambient temperature changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrison et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the POA was further implicated in food intake modulation under a changing thermal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brobeck, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson and Larsson, 1961</xref>). For example, rats with POA lesions had difficulty not only maintaining core temperature but also adjusting food intake upon ambient temperature changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamilton, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamilton and Brobeck, 1964</xref>). Despite its prominent role in regulating energy expenditure and implication in controlling food intake, the POA has not been investigated as an important brain area for body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that POA Lepr neurons (Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons) are stimulated by warm ambient temperature and mediate warm-adaptive responses, especially by decreasing both energy expenditure and food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, chronic chemogenetic stimulation of these neurons in mice resulted in body weight loss caused by reduced food intake that surpassed the decrease in energy expenditure. This result proposes that the manipulation of POA neural circuits can affect body weight. Another Lepr-expressing neuronal population in the dorsomedial hypothalamus/dorsal hypothalamic area (DMH/DHA) is stimulated by ambient cold and leptin, and ablating <italic>Lepr</italic> in this area caused obesity in mice due to reduced energy expenditure without affecting food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2014</xref>), revealing critical function of leptin signaling in the DMH/DHA on energy expenditure. Because both POA and DMH/DHA Lepr neurons control BAT thermogenesis to modulate energy expenditure, it is plausible that thermoregulation-related Lepr neurons integrate information on ambient temperature and internal energy state that is represented by leptin to fine tune the energy expenditure level. Taken together, we hypothesized that POA leptin signaling contributes to energy balance and body weight homeostasis by modulating energy expenditure and/or food intake in interaction with ambient temperature information. This possibility is further supported by studies showing that leptin is required for ambient temperature-dependent food intake adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaiyala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaiyala et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the role of POA leptin signaling by selective stimulation or knockdown of POA <italic>Lepr</italic> in mice. We demonstrate that POA leptin signaling contributes to body weight homeostasis by modulating energy expenditure level, specifically under a surplus energy state, in which circulating leptin level is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Münzberg et al., 2004</xref>). However, neither stimulation nor blockage of POA leptin signaling affected acute temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations. Finally, our study implicates Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons in the HFD-induced increase of metabolic rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons respond heterogeneously to leptin</title><p>First, we directly measured the effect of leptin on membrane potential of Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in <italic>Lepr<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> reporter mice.

Energy efficiency also showed a weak but significant negative correlation with POA pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice spent less energy per unit food consumed.</p><p>Because Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons control BAT SNA, we first tested whether BAT function declined in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice.

Consistent with this result, there was slightly increased but statistically non-significant increase in fat accumulation in BAT in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup> KD</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We next examined if the thyroid axis was affected in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice because systemic leptin increases <italic>thyrotropin releasing hormone</italic> (<italic>Trh</italic>) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nillni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2004</xref>) and the POA has been implicated in TRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martelli et al., 2014</xref>). TRH secretion ultimately leads to thyroid hormone secretion and metabolic rate increase through both central and peripheral mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mullur et al., 2014</xref>). We found that plasma levels of total triiodothyronine (T3) was only slightly and not significantly lower in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice but significantly correlated with the POA pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>), suggesting that POA Lepr stimulates the thyroid axis to modulate energy expenditure. To corroborate this result, we observed strong projection of Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in the field of TRH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Furthermore, when wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-GFP, an anterograde transsynaptic tracer, was expressed in Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons, we observed a rare case of its expression in a TRH neuron in the PVH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C–D</xref>). However, intra-POA leptin injection (0.5 pg) in fasted mice failed to significantly elevate the total T3 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>), unlike the effect of systemic exogenous leptin in fasted mice on the thyroid hormone level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima et al., 1999</xref>).

In contrast, a direct leptin injection into the POA transiently suppresses food intake without affecting energy expenditure. There are at least a couple of possible explanations for the seemingly contradictory phenotypes between the POA leptin injection and <italic>Lepr</italic> deletion. The first possibility is the well-known discrepancy of leptin function between below and above the normal physiological leptin level. The lack of leptin is generally considered a stronger signal than increasing leptin levels above normal circulating levels and biological responses do not show a linear relationship with the leptin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leibel, 2002</xref>). Another possibility is leptin’s action on different cell types. In other words, the effect on food intake may be mediated by presynaptic Lepr expressed in neurons innervating the POA, likely at axon terminals, while the effect on energy expenditure may be mediated cell autonomously in POA Lepr neurons. A similar dual mode of leptin action exists in the ARC between agouti related neuropeptide (AGRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, in which leptin suppresses the presynaptic inhibitory AGRP neuronal input onto POMC neurons and cell autonomously stimulates POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>). Our electrophysiological recordings also support this notion because leptin application in the presence of a cocktail of synaptic transmission blockers reduced the percentage of depolarized neurons compared to leptin application in the absence of blockers. The POA receives inputs from many Lepr-expressing neurons that could modulate food intake including AGRP and POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our POA <italic>Lepr</italic> KD study suggests that leptin acts on Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons to modulate energy expenditure. However, because the energy expenditure phenotype of POA <italic>Lepr</italic> KD was only evident under fasting or HFD feeding and the effect was small, an acute intra-POA leptin injection in <italic>ad lib</italic> chow-fed mice may have failed to affect energy expenditure or induced undetectable changes. A more chronic leptin administration into the POA in food-restricted mice or <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice may be required in order to detect this small and specific leptin effect on energy expenditure. Furthermore, the retrospective histological pSTAT3 analysis showed that only a portion of POA Lepr had been stimulated by intra-POA leptin injection.</p><p>Because Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons control ambient temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), we first speculated that POA leptin function may be involved in this aspect. This reasoning was further supported by the fact that leptin gene expression is inversely proportional to the SNA level to adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trayhurn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans et al., 1999</xref>), which is controlled by ambient temperature and the POA. However, neither stimulation nor ablation of POA <italic>Lepr</italic> affected temperature-dependent adaptive changes in energy expenditure and food intake. Instead, energy expenditure was specifically affected when the internal energy state, which is reflected by circulating leptin levels, was low or high in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice. Although it seems counterintuitive that <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice have higher energy expenditure during fasting than control mice, a similar discordance of leptin-linked physiology was reported for female reproduction. In female <italic>Lepr<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice injected with AAV-Cre in the POA, the baseline LH level was higher than that of control mice and leptin failed to further induce LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellefontaine et al., 2014</xref>), reminiscent of our energy expenditure phenotype in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice during fasting. Despite the increased LH level in POA <italic>Lepr</italic>-ablated mice, female reproduction did not seem to be affected based on our study.</p><p>The exact cellular mechanism of how leptin affects Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neuron functions is not clear due to small effect sizes and trending but statistically non-significant results for various measurements for energy expenditure. While Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons strongly modulate BAT thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), our results show no significant changes in BAT function in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice. However, data from BAT gene expression and histology all point toward small but blunted BAT function by <italic>Lepr</italic><sup>POA</sup> KD. The weak but significant positive correlation between POA STAT3 activation and plasma T3 is consistent with previous studies showing leptin’s involvement in expression and secretion of TRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nillni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martelli et al., 2014</xref>) and ability to prevent the fasting-induced drop in the thyroxine level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>). We have also observed strong projections of Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons to the PVH in the field of TRH neurons, even though we found little evidence for direct synaptic connection from Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons to TRH<sup>PVH</sup> neurons. Nonetheless, these collective data do not prove that POA Lepr signaling modulates the thyroid axis. It requires further investigation if neuronal (thermosensory) and humoral (leptin) inputs to Lepr<sup>POA</sup> neurons modulate energy expenditure through separate mechanisms.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to point out that our AAV-GFP:Cre injection into the POA achieved only about 50% <italic>Lepr</italic> KD on average in the HFD study. We believe this partial ablation of POA Lepr and inherent variability of viral injections contributed to relatively small effect sizes and big standard errors that rendered many measurement differences between groups statistically insignificant. Therefore, the contribution of POA leptin signaling to energy balance and body weight homeostasis may be underestimated in our study.</p><p>Our study is the first to link POA leptin signaling to body weight control. HFD promotes a higher metabolic rate and POA Lepr may be necessary for this HFD-induced increase in energy expenditure. Therefore, the loss of POA Lepr may have accelerated the body weight gain caused by HFD in <italic>Lepr<sup>POA</sup></italic> KD mice. Our study also proposes a potential integration of environmental temperature information and internal energy state in the POA through neural and humoral routes, respectively. Even though acute temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations did not interact with POA leptin signaling, the long-term interaction still remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>M.

Coronal sections containing the POA (250 µm) was cut with a Microm HM 650V vibratome (Thermo Scientific). Then the slices were recovered in the aCSF at 34°C for 1 hr. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed in the GFP-labelled mature POA neurons visually identified by an upright microscope (Eclipse FN-1, Nikon) equipped with IR-DIC optics (Nikon 40x NIR).

For the fasting experiment, food was removed from the cage at CT 3.5 hr and leptin (5 mg/kg, i.p.; n = 5) or saline (n = 5) were injected at the same time. Average energy expenditure between the injection time and the end of the light cycle was compared between conditions (<italic>ad lib</italic> fed vs fasting +saline vs fasting +leptin). Energy expenditure after 2 weeks of HFD feeding was measured with female C57Bl/6J mice (n = 5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry and histological analysis</title><p>Brains were sliced at 30 μm thickness into four series with a sliding microtome. pSTAT3 was visualized by diaminobenzene (DAB; 34065, ThermoFisher Scientific) following treatment with Vectastain ABC kit (PK-6100, Vector Laboratories) after incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody. BAT was formalin fixed, paraffin processed, and sectioned at 5 μm for staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) or with UCP1. UCP1 staining was visualized by DAB using Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (DS9800, Leica). Stained slides were scanned using a NanoZoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu) and lipid droplet area was computed on H and E images using a custom app within Visiopharm version 2017.7 (Visiopharm). Primary antibodies used in this study are rabbit anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr705, 9131, Cell Signaling; 1:500) and chicken anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam; 1:1000), rabbit anti-TRH (Dr. Eduardo A Nillni, Brown University; 1:1000), and rabbit anti-UCP1 (ab209483, Abcam, 1:4000). Secondary antibodies are donkey anti-rabbit IgG-biotin (711-065-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:1000) and donkey anti-chicken IgY-DyLight 488 (703-486-155, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:200), and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (A-21207, ThermoFisher Scientific; 1:200).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>BAT RNA from the POA <italic>Lepr</italic> ablation study with HFD was purified with TRIzol Reagent (15596, ThermoFisher Scientific) and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (11754050, ThermoFisher Scientific).

Blood was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 3000 rpm and then the upper plasma layer was collected and stored at −80°C.

For each mouse, we pre-selected brain sections that contain rostral, medial, or caudal parts of the median preoptic areas that together encompass bregma 0.62–0.26 mm based on the Paxinos mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paxinos and Franklin, 2004</xref>). For distribution of Lepr neurons in the POA, refer to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cells were counted by the count tool in Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems). Please note that pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cell numbers are only estimates because the POA areas used for cell counting are slightly different between mice in spite of our best effort to minimize the variability. The estimated pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cell numbers in the POA were correlated to various measurements (e.g. body weight).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are represented as mean ± SEM.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Yu and colleagues examined the effects of manipulating leptin signaling in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus on body temperature, energy expenditure and energy balance. They report that preoptic leptin signaling regulates energy expenditure and body weight homeostasis. In contrast, leptin action in the preoptic area did not affect ambient temperature-dependent responses.</p><p>Having previously shown a role for POA leptin receptor neurons in thermal sensing and activating these cells decreases food intake and energy expenditure, the authors have now examined the role for direct leptin action on these cells for energy balance. Leptin depolarizes most POA LepRb neurons in acute slice preparations. Direct leptin infusion into the POA briefly decreases food intake, but does not alter energy expenditure (at a variety of temperatures) or energy balance. They also use AAV-cre to delete POA leptin receptors. While this does not alter food intake or energy balance on chow diet, leptin did not increase the energy expenditure when these animals were fasted (this may also have prevented the fall in energy expenditure with fasting). The knockout mice also gained more weight on HFD than did controls. In contrast, no alteration in energy expenditure was detected by calorimetry, the feed efficiency of these mice was increased, suggesting a subtle decrease in energy expenditure on HFD. Collectively, the studies provide some novel observations that will be of interest. However, several issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The biggest issue is noted by the authors relating to the mechanism of the effects to regulate energy expenditure. The negative data in the BAT is confusing. They suggest it may be related to the thyroid axis, though this correlation is somewhat weak. If the effect is mediated by changes in thyroid activity, some additional experiments supporting this seem to be lacking.</p><p>The photomicrographs demonstrating the AAV injections and pSTAT3 are too small for my eyes to see what the authors are presenting. Also, did the authors make maps/drawings of the injection sites and pSTAT staining?</p><p>The results are consistent with an effect of POA leptin on energy expenditure, especially when leptin decreases (as with fasting) or increases (as with HFD). The effect size is rather small, however. While the importance of POA leptin action is of some interest, the small effect size and the opposing effects of POA leptin as revealed by injection versus knockout are a source of confusion and limit the impact of the manuscript.</p><p>Can the authors be sure that the injected leptin only activates POA LepRb neurons? Mapping pSTAT3 plumes could shed light on this issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33505.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The biggest issue is noted by the authors relating to the mechanism of the effects to regulate energy expenditure.

However, we would like to remind the reviewers that the body weight changes are mild and small changes in BAT and thyroid function may be below detection levels.</p><p>To address this issue, we have now performed additional analysis of BAT histology with H and E staining, lipid area analysis, and UCP1 protein staining. While all parameters trended towards changes that are consistent with decreased thermogenic function in LepRb<sup>POA</sup> knockdown (KD) mice, these changes did not reach statistical significance. This is consistent with our earlier data showing decreased expression of thermogenic BAT genes in LeprbPOA KD mice, which nevertheless did not reach statistical significance. Our new histological data are now included as Figure 5—figure supplement 3A.</p><p>We also performed additional studies to further investigate the link between POA leptin and total T3. Based on the work of Ahima RS et al.1996, we tested whether POA leptin would be sufficient to restore fasting-depressed circulating total T3 levels, using a new cohort of POA cannulated mice (n=10) for infusion of leptin into the POA. We found that POA leptin increased circulating free T3 levels in fasted mice, but these results did not reach statistical significance. We would like to point out that any intraparenchymal cannulation (here in the POA) will introduce more data variation due to cannula placements that explains the high standard error found in the leptin-treated group. These new data are now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 3B.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether LepRb<sup>POA</sup> neurons project to the PVH and are synaptically connected to TRH neurons in the PVH. When we virally expressed farnesylated EGFP in LepRb<sup>POA</sup> neurons, we observed strong fiber projection of LepRb<sup>POA</sup> neurons to the PVH in close proximity of TRH neurons (Figure 5—figure supplement 4A-B). We also virally expressed WGA<sup>GFP</sup>, a transsynaptic anterograde tracer, in LepRb<sup>POA</sup> neurons and found several WGA<sup>GFP</sup>-positive neurons in the PVH, confirming synaptic connectivity of LepRb<sup>POA</sup> &gt; PVN circuits. However, only a single case of WGA<sup>GFP</sup>-TRH co-expression was found (Figure 5—figure supplement 4C-D), indicating that TRH neurons are likely an indirect target of LepRb<sup>POA</sup> neurons.</p><p>In conclusion, we have now provided several additional and independent data that consistently point towards a blunted BAT thermogenesis and thyroid axis that explain the mild, but significant increase in body weight, but only the direct correlation of POA leptin responsiveness with T3 levels revealed significant changes. We have further highlighted in the Discussion that due to the small non-significant changes, we are unable to pinpoint the exact mechanism for the increased body weight, but that several experimental outcomes suggest a combination of a blunted BAT thermogenesis and thyroid axis (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The photomicrographs demonstrating the AAV injections and pSTAT3 are too small for my eyes to see what the authors are presenting. Also, did the authors make maps/drawings of the injection sites and pSTAT staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We moved previous Figure 4B to Figure 4—figure supplement 1A to enlarge the image. To help visualization of reduced pSTAT3 by AAV-GFP:Cre, we replaced the previous representative histological images for AAV-GFP:Cre to emphasize that the pSTAT3 level decreases only in areas of strong virus expression. We also included a diagram showing virus spreads of all 9 mice injected with AAV-GFP:Cre in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. We did not include a map of pSTAT3 staining because pSTAT3 shows a complementary/reciprocal pattern to virus spread, as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>We similarly enlarged images for AAV injections and pSTAT3 for the HFD study in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and included virus spread for all 16 mice injected with AAV-GFP:Cre in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. Previous Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-J are now separated as Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results are consistent with an effect of POA leptin on energy expenditure, especially when leptin decreases (as with fasting) or increases (as with HFD).

In other words, leptin-mediated biological responses do not necessarily show a linear correlation to leptin concentration as mentioned in the first paragraph of the Discussion. We did not experimentally address the contrasting phenotypes observed by leptin injection versus knockdown, as this is outside the scope of this manuscript. However, as suggested by the reviewers, we verified that POA leptin injections did not cause leptin leakage to other hypothalamic sites like the ARC. We included representative pSTAT3 images in the POA and the ARC from intra-POA PBS, intra-POA leptin, and IP leptin (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). We observed very few pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cells in the ARC of intra-POA leptin in all animals, thus ruling out leptin effects on the ARC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
