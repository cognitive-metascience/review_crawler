is a second major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific chaperone. We sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR can also influence MHC class I peptide selection by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst. We show that TAPBPR can catalyse the dissociation of peptides from peptide-MHC I complexes, enhance the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminate between peptides based on affinity in vitro. In cells, the depletion of TAPBPR increased the diversity of peptides presented on MHC I molecules, suggesting that TAPBPR is involved in restricting peptide presentation. Our results suggest TAPBPR binds to MHC I in a peptide-receptive state and, like tapasin, works to enhance peptide optimisation. It is now clear there are two MHC class I specific peptide editors, tapasin and TAPBPR, intimately involved in controlling peptide presentation to the immune system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09617.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09617.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our immune system protects us from infections and destroys cells that are turning cancerous. A group of proteins called MHC class I molecules are essential for this protection. These molecules let the immune system know what is going on inside our cells by displaying chopped up fragments of proteins (or peptides) on the surface of the cell. If these peptides are from infectious or disease-causing agents the immune system is triggered into action and can recognise and kill the cell.</p><p>There is still much to discover regarding how MHC molecules choose which peptides to display. A very complex pathway within our cells controls this displaying of peptides to the immune system. Recently, a protein called TAPBPR was identified as a new player in MHC class I biology, but its role was unclear.</p><p>Hermann, van Hateren et al. now reveal that TAPBPR plays a central role in restricting which peptides are loaded onto and presented by MHC class I molecules. The results suggest that TAPBPR acts as a quality control checkpoint, closely monitoring and ensuring that the loaded peptide is stable within the MHC class I molecule. The discovery of TAPBPR's role in peptide selection increases our understanding of how peptides are chosen and stabilized, and sets the stage for learning more about how cells decide which peptides to reveal to the immune system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09617.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09617.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>antigen processing and presentation</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd><kwd>peptide repertoire</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship. 104647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyle</surname><given-names>Louise H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Fellowship, UF100371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deane</surname><given-names>Janet E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Grant, C7056A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Hateren</surname><given-names>Andy</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Career Development Fellowship, 085058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyle</surname><given-names>Louise H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship, 089563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermann</surname><given-names>Clemens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 685</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trautwein</surname><given-names>Nico</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevanović</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Grant, 089821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trowsdale</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>We reveal TAPBPR is a peptide exchange catalyst which restricts the peptide repertoire presented by MHC I on cells, a finding which has important implications for all aspects of immune recognition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules convey a selection of the peptidome of a cell to the immune system. As well as being of crucial importance for the detection of intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses, it is now apparent that peptide presentation by MHC class I is extremely relevant in the recognition of tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rötzschke et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gubin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yadav et al., 2014</xref>). Despite this, the molecular mechanisms controlling peptide selection for immune recognition are still poorly understood. Currently, the loading of peptide onto MHC class I is known to be orchestrated by the co-factor tapasin and is thought to occur predominantly within the peptide loading complex (PLC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sadasivan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ortmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2002</xref>). Tapasin enhances the rate and the extent of MHC class I peptide loading and improves the discrimination that occurs between peptides to ensure MHC class I molecules are loaded with high-affinity peptides, thus prolonging cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howarth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Hateren et al., 2013</xref>). MHC class I allomorphs differ in their dependence on tapasin for efficient peptide loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenwood et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the ability to select and assemble with an optimal peptide cargo in the absence of tapasin is inversely correlated to the enhancement observed in the presence of tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Hateren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It has recently become apparent that, in addition to tapasin, there is a second MHC class I-specific chaperone, the tapasin-related protein TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to tapasin, TAPBPR is not an integral component of the peptide loading complex and cannot compensate for the loss of tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, the precise function of TAPBPR in the MHC class I pathway is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>). A functional role in MHC class I antigen presentation is supported by the finding that the presence of TAPBPR slows the anterograde trafficking of MHC class I and prolongs the association of MHC class I with the PLC. This raises the possibility that TAPBPR serves as an additional quality control checkpoint in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). Although tapasin and TAPBPR only share 22% identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Teng et al., 2002</xref>), both bind MHC class I, and their orientation on MHC class I is similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). This shared orientation raises the possibility that there is some common functionality between the two molecules, particularly in regard to the ability to influence the peptide repertoire presented on MHC class I. Here, we sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR has a peptide editing function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and purification of TAPBPR</title><p>In order to test whether TAPBPR has peptide editing functionality we chose an approach analogous to that previously established for tapasin, namely a cell free in vitro assay that allows monitoring of peptide binding to MHC class I in real time via fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>). Due to the intrinsically low affinity between tapasin and MHC class I molecules in vitro, soluble tapasin function on MHC class I is only measurable when the two molecules are brought into close proximity via a Jun/Fos leucine zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>) or when tapasin is conjugated to ERp57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>). Since TAPBPR is not integrated into the PLC and can be co-immunoprecipitated with MHC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that TAPBPR has a higher affinity for MHC class I than tapasin. We therefore tested whether TAPBPR functioned in vitro without the need for an artificial intermolecular tether.</p><p>To this end, the luminal domains of TAPBPR were cloned into the pHLsec expression vector and transiently transfected into HEK293F cells. This resulted in the efficient production of a secreted form of TAPBPR with a C-terminal His-tag, allowing for purification from the culture supernatant using Ni-affinity and size exclusion chromatography. TAPBPR protein eluted as a single major peak of high purity as verified by Coomassie staining following sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> in which the isoleucine at position 261 was mutated to lysine, which inhibits the interaction of TAPBPR with MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>), was produced in the same manner and was also efficiently expressed and produced a major single protein peak following size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed melting temperatures for TAPBPR and TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> to be between 51.5°C and 52.5°C indicating that the single point mutation did not adversely affect TAPBPR folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These mammalian-expressed, purified TAPBPR proteins were used in subsequent fluorescence anisotropy experiments to characterise the equilibrium and kinetic parameters between MHC class I and different peptide ligands.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of TAPBPR. </title> <p>Size exclusion chromatograms of (<bold>A</bold>) TAPBPR and (<bold>B</bold>) TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> purified from cell culture supernatants.

Using fluorescent polarisation we tested whether TAPBPR enhanced peptide dissociation from HLA-A2, an allomorph that co-immunoprecipitates readily with TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). HLA-A*02:01 molecules were loaded with the fluorescent peptide FLPSDC*FPSV (C* indicates the position of the fluorophore) before excess unlabelled FLPSDCFPSV peptide was added in the presence or absence of TAPBPR. Dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was only apparent in the first six hours in the presence of competitor peptide and TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was also observed when a vast excess of unlabelled NLVPMVATV was used in the presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To ensure the enhancement of peptide dissociation was a consequence of direct interaction between TAPBPR and HLA-A2, we repeated the peptide dissociation assays using TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> (I261K) which inhibits the ability of TAPBPR to bind to HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). No enhancement in the dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was observed in the presence of TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> (red line <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus the ability of TAPBPR to enhance peptide dissociation is a direct consequence of TAPBPR binding to HLA-A2.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TAPBPR functions as a peptide loading catalyst and peptide editor for HLA-A2.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Dissociation, (<bold>C</bold>) association and (<bold>D</bold>) peptide competition of fluorescent peptide FLPSDC*FPSV on HLA-A*02:01 in the absence or presence of TAPBPR or TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> as measured by fluorescence polarisation.

To test this, HLA-A*02:01 molecules refolded with a UV conditional ligand were made peptide-receptive by photolysis and the binding of the fluorescent peptide FLPSDC*FPSV was monitored by fluorescence polarisation in the absence or presence of TAPBPR. We found that TAPBPR catalysed binding of FLPSDC*FPSV to peptide-receptive HLA-A*02:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, no enhancement in the association of FLPSDC*FPSV with HLA-A2 was observed in the presence of TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), further demonstrating that a direct association between TAPBPR and HLA-A2 is required for TAPBPR to influence HLA-A2 peptide binding characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TAPBPR enhances the selection of high affinity peptide by HLA-A2 in vitro</title><p>To ascertain whether TAPBPR is able to discriminate between peptides, competition assays were performed in which peptide-receptive HLA-A*02:01 molecules were incubated with a mix of two peptides; 0.125 µM of the high affinity labelled peptide FLPSDC*FPSV, and a variable concentration of the peptide NLVPMVATV, which binds HLA-A*02:01 with lower affinity than FLPSDCFPSV. In the presence of TAPBPR, NLVPMVATV became a poorer competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> had no effect on peptide competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results suggest that, like tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>), TAPBPR can enhance the selection of high affinity peptides for binding to MHC I in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison of TAPBPR and tapasin-jun mediated peptide dissociation from HLA-A2 in vitro</title><p>Next we compared the ability of TAPBPR or tapasin-jun to enhance dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV and a panel of six additional peptides bound to HLA-A2. The dissociation rates of all peptides were enhanced in the presence of TAPBPR and in the presence of tapasin-jun as compared to competing peptide alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, peptide specific differences were apparent in the ability of tapasin-jun and TAPBPR to enhance dissociation. As different concentrations of active tapasin-jun and TAPBPR proteins were present in these assays, it was not possible to directly compare the dissociation half-lives of specific peptides in the presence of tapasin-jun with TAPBPR. Therefore we compared the hierarchies of dissociation relative to one peptide (KLWEAESK*L) over four independent experiments. This revealed reproducible differences in the hierarchies of peptide dissociation between tapasin-jun and TAPBPR on HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Interestingly the half-life hierarchy for tapasin was similar to the hierarchy observed in the absence of either cofactor (competitor only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), with the exception of the dissociation of GLDDIKDLK*V whose dissociation was relatively much slower in the presence of tapasin-jun compared to the other peptides than was observed in the presence of competitor only. This suggests that tapasin enhancement of peptide dissociation generally parallels peptide-MHC complex stability, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howarth et al., 2004</xref>). However, the half-life of peptides in the presence of TAPBPR does not follow this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Specifically we observed that in comparison to the other peptides, TAPBPR enhanced dissociation of KLVK*EVIAV to a much smaller extent than was apparent in the presence of tapasin-jun or absence of either cofactor (competitor only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). The same was also true of FLPSDC*FPSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Taken together our results suggest firstly that both tapasin and TAPBPR enhance peptide dissociation, and secondly that there are subtle differences in regard to their peptide specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TAPBPR interacts with HLA-B as well as HLA-A molecules</title><p>We previously reported that TAPBPR has preference for HLA-A68 over HLA-B15 expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). We wondered if TAPBPR generally exhibited preference for HLA-A allomorphs or whether TAPBPR might interact with HLA-B allomorphs. To explore this, we expressed a small panel of individual HLA allomorphs in the MHC class I negative cell line 721.221, and determined their interaction with endogenous TAPBPR, in a system in which competition between MHC class I allomorphs is absent. Immunoprecipitation of TAPBPR, followed by western blotting for MHC class I, confirmed the strong association between TAPBPR and the HLA-A allomorphs HLA-A2 and HLA-A68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, an association between TAPBPR and HLA-B allomorphs was also detected, although this was weaker (HLA-B8 and -B15), or below the limits of detection (HLA-B40), compared to that for HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, although there is clearly a strong association with those HLA-A allomorphs tested, TAPBPR interacts with a broader range of HLA molecules than originally appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>TAPBPR associates with HLA-A and HLA-B molecules.</title> <p>TAPBPR was isolated by immunoprecipitation (using R014) from the MHC class I negative cell line 721.221 and 721.221 stably transduced with HLA-A2, A68, B8, B15 or B40.

We first asked whether TAPBPR enhanced peptide dissociation from HLA-B*08:01fos molecules. We found that dissociation of EIYK*RWIIL was enhanced in the presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). No enhancement of the dissociation of EIYK*RWIIL was observed in the presence of TAPBPR using HLA-B8:01-T134K in which the T134 residue had been mutated to lysine, which abrogates binding of TAPBPR to MHC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), demonstrating that the enhanced peptide dissociation was dependent on a direct interaction between TAPBPR and HLA-B8. We also tested the ability of TAPBPR to enhance dissociation of two additional peptides, ELRSRK*WAI and FLRGRK*YGL from HLA-B*08:01. The dissociation of ELRSRK*WAI was not altered in the presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and only a very slight change in dissociation of FLRGRK*YGL was observed in the presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Tapasin has also been reported to exhibit peptide specificity in regard to peptide dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>). Like TAPBPR, tapasin-jun accelerated dissociation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled versions of both EIYK*RWIIL and FLRGRK*YGL from HLA-B*08:01fos, while the dissociation of ELRSRK*WAI was insensitive to tapasin-jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>TAPBPR can function as a peptide loading catalyst and peptide editor for HLA-B8.</title> <p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Dissociation, (<bold>E–G</bold>) association and (<bold>H</bold>) peptide competition of fluorescent peptides on HLA-B*08:01 in the absence or presence of TAPBPR. 2 μM HLA-B*08:01fos or HLA-B*08:01fos T134K molecules were mixed with 20 μM human β2m and made peptide receptive then loaded with 1 μM (<bold>A,B</bold>) EIYK*RWIIL (<bold>C</bold>) ELRSRK*WAI or (<bold>D</bold>) FLRGRK*YGL.

To do this, we created a HeLa cell line in which TAPBPR was knocked out using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system. We found that upon treatment with IFN-γ, TAPBPR expression was induced in HeLa, but not in the HeLa-TAPBPR KO line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Tapasin expression was not affected by the sgRNA targeted to TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the absence of TAPBPR, cell surface expression of MHC class I in IFN-γ treated HeLa did not significantly change as determined by W6/32 staining and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When the amino acid sequences of the peptides eluted from MHC class I molecules from IFN-γ treated HeLa and HeLa-TAPBPR KO cells were compared, the most noticeable difference was a change in the diversity of peptides isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Again the most obvious difference was a change in the diversity of peptides isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We found the total number of different peptides isolated from MHC class I was decreased in cells over-expressing TAPBPR, from 819 MHC class I restricted peptides from HeLa cells down to 296 MHC class I restricted peptides isolated from HeLa cells over-expressing TAPBPR. 210 peptides were shared between the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Again, when these peptides were further sub-divided into those predicted to bind to HLA-A*68:02 and -B*15:03 based on their motif, an increased repertoire was observed for both allomorphs in the absence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that TAPBPR restricts the peptide repertoire presented on MHC class I molecules. We compared the anchor residues found at the P2 and C-terminal (PΩ) position of the shared peptides, eluted from either TAPBPR negative or TAPBPR expressing cells, which will presumably be permitted release in TAPBPR expressing cells, with unique peptides exclusively eluted from TAPBPR negative cells (HeLa or HeLa-TAPBPR KO+IFN-γ), which are therefore usually removed or restricted by TAPBPR. We found there was an enhancement of canonical anchor residues in the peptides eluted from TAPBPR expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). For example, in IFN-γ treated HeLa cells 53% of the shared peptides predicted to be bound to HLA-A*A68:02 (which had presumably been subjected to TAPBPR function) had classic anchor residues (P2 = threonine or valine, PΩ = valine or leucine) compared to 43% of the peptides found exclusively in TAPBPR deficient cells which are the peptides that TAPBPR usually restricts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). More striking was the restriction of peptides predicted to be bound by HLA-B*15:03 in cells over-expressing TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) with only 5% of the peptides eluted exclusively from TAPBPR deficient cells (i.e. the TAPBPR restricted peptides) containing classical anchor motifs (P2 = glutamine or lysine, PΩ = tyrosine or phenylalanine) compared to 24% of the peptides eluted from TAPBPR over expressing cells (i.e. the TAPBPR permitted peptides). This suggests TAPBPR restriction in vivo helps to remove some peptides of lower affinity and therefore assists in improving peptide selection on MHC class I. We found TAPBPR expression did not have a dramatic effect on peptide length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Within a cellular environment tapasin and TAPBPR have distinct effects on peptide selection</title><p>We also compared the effect of TAPBPR depletion with tapasin deficiency on the MHC class I peptide repertoire from IFN-γ treated KBM-7 cells (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>] for knockdown efficiency). Surface expression of HLA-A2 was similar in IFN-γ treated wild-type (WT), TAPBPR depleted and tapasin deficient KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While TAPBPR depletion resulted in increased peptide diversity on HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), tapasin deficiency did not significantly change the total number of peptides presented on HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), although the peptide repertoire was significantly different between IFN-γ treated WT and tapasin deficient KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Surface expression of HLA-B40 was similar in IFN-γ treated WT and TAPBPR depleted cells, but was reduced in tapasin deficient KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). TAPBPR depletion and tapasin deficiency produced different effects on peptides presented by HLA-B40 and -C03 in IFN-γ treated KBM-7 cells, with TAPBPR depletion increasing peptide diversity and tapasin deficiency decreasing the number of peptides presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>).

TAPBPR was isolated in complex with MHC I from IFN-γ induced KBM-7 cells (which are HLA-A2+), then incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μM of the HLA-A2 binding peptide NLVPMVATV. Western blot analysis of the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with TAPBPR revealed a &gt;90% reduction in the amount of HLA-A2 bound to TAPBPR following the addition of the NLVPMVATV peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To ensure this was a consequence of direct peptide binding to HLA-A2, we tested NLVPMVATV peptide variants in which the anchor residues at position 2 and 9 were substituted, thus lowering the avidity of the peptide. Less dissociation of HLA-A2 from TAPBPR was observed using N<underline>A</underline>VPMVATV (Δ2) and NLVPMVAT<underline>M</underline> (Δ9) peptides, in which one anchor residue had been substituted, while the N<underline>A</underline>VPMVAT<underline>M</underline> (Δ2/9) peptide, in which both anchor residues were substituted was unable to induce any HLA-A2 dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Next we asked whether peptide loaded HLA-A2 molecules were released from TAPBPR following peptide addition by performing a second immunoprecipitation using BB7.2 from the peptide-treated eluates. Peptide loaded HLA-A2 was released from TAPBPR upon incubation with the NLVPMVATV peptide but not in the absence of the peptide (lanes 2 and 1 respectively <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Only trace amounts of peptide loaded HLA-A2:β2m molecules were released from TAPBPR using the Δ2 and Δ9 peptides (lane 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), while no peptide loaded HLA-A2 was released from TAPBPR using the Δ2/9 peptide (lane 5 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Previous studies have reported that, although the quantity of naturally processed peptides stably bound by HLA-A*02:01 is significantly reduced in the absence of tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2001</xref>), surface expression of HLA-A2 is relatively unaffected in the absence of tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenwood et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, HLA-B7 expression is reduced in the absence of tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>). As TAPBPR is also involved in peptide selection on MHC class I molecules, we sought to examine the effect of TAPBPR depletion on surface expression of both HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 in the presence and the absence of tapasin. To investigate this, 721.221 (tapasin positive, MHC class I negative) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shimizu et al., 1988</xref>) and 721.220 (tapasin negative, HLA-A, -B negative, but HLA-Cw1 positive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenwood et al., 1994</xref>) cells were transduced with HLA-A2 and -B7 and then depleted of TAPBPR using shRNA. This resulted in a significant, although not complete, reduction of TAPBPR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Tapasin expression in 721.221 cells was not altered in cells expressing shTAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings in tapasin deficient KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>), we found an increased interaction between HLA-A2 and TAPBPR in the absence of tapasin in the 721 cell line series (compare TAPBPR IP lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) which was apparent even though the expression of TAPBPR appeared to be slightly higher in .220 cells compared to .221 cells. This phenomenon does not appear to be restricted to HLA-A2, as we similarly observed an increased interaction between HLA-B7 and TAPBPR in the absence of tapasin (compare TAPBPR IP lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The increased association between TAPBPR and MHC class I occurs despite the fact that the steady state level of both HLA-B7 and HLA-A2 is severely reduced in the absence of tapasin (compare lysate lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We found that the steady state level of HLA-A2 at the cell surface was not affected by TAPBPR depletion in tapasin sufficient cells (left panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, the depletion of TAPBPR in tapasin negative cells resulted in a ∼75% decrease in cell surface expression of HLA-A2 (right panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, using an antibody to the Bw6 epitope we observed a significant decrease in the surface expression of HLA-B7 upon depletion of TAPBPR, even in the presence of tapasin (left panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This is despite the poor ability of HLA-B7 to co-immunoprecipitate with TAPBPR, as compared with HLA-A2 with TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Only residual expression of HLA-B7 was observed upon the depletion of TAPBPR in the tapasin negative cell 721.220 (right panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

To test directly whether HLA molecules are indeed loaded with low affinity peptides in the absence of TAPBPR, we compared the stability of MHC class I molecules in the presence and absence of TAPBPR. First, the thermal stability of HLA-A2 molecules expressed in TAPBPR-competent and TAPBPR-depleted cells in the presence or absence of tapasin was investigated by heating lysates of radiolabelled cells for a short time, followed by immunoprecipitation with BB7.2 (specific for peptide loaded HLA-A2). We found that the thermal stability of HLA-A2 was reduced in TAPBPR depleted cells (compare grey bar with the red bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). As the thermal stability of MHC class I correlates with the affinity of its peptide cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>), these results support the hypothesis that TAPBPR assists in the selection of stable peptides on MHC class I molecules. However, the effect of TAPBPR depletion on HLA-A2 thermal stability was not as severe as that observed in the absence of tapasin (compared red and blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The thermal stability of peptide loaded HLA-A2 was further decreased when TAPBPR was depleted in tapasin negative cells (green bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These results are consistent with the decreased steady state levels of HLA-A2 observed in TAPBPR depleted and tapasin deficient cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.</p><p>Next, to examine whether MHC class I complexes with lower stability are released onto the cell surface in the absence of TAPBPR, we examined the decay rates of MHC class I molecules expressed at the cell surface in TAPBPR-competent and TAPBPR-depleted cells. Both HLA-A2 and –B7 exhibited faster decay rates from the cell surface in TAPBPR-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E‚F</xref>), suggesting that in the absence of TAPBPR MHC class I molecules containing lower affinity peptides can escape to the cell surface. For HLA-A2, tapasin deficiency had a more severe effect than TAPBPR depletion on the rate of decay (compare the blue line with the red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) while for HLA-B7, tapasin deficiency and TAPBPR depletion had a similar effect on the decay rate (see the overlap of the blue and red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). For both HLA-A2 and –B7 the loss of both tapasin and TAPBPR had an accumulative effect on MHC class I stability (see green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). Together, these results clearly demonstrate a role for TAPBPR in the selection of stable peptides for MHC class I molecules in vivo and support the hypothesis that TAPBPR can enhance peptide optimisation in the absence of tapasin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PLC is considered to be the major site where MHC class I molecules are loaded with high affinity peptides, with the tapasin-ERp57 conjugate described as the functional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Momburg and Tan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howarth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>). Our experiments indicate that TAPBPR is also involved in peptide selection for MHC class I molecules. Like tapasin, TAPBPR can catalyse the dissociation of peptides from peptide-MHC I complexes, enhance the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminate between peptides based on affinity in vitro. Therefore, it is now apparent that there are two MHC class I specific peptide exchange catalysts in the antigen presentation pathway intimately involved in selecting peptide for presentation to the immune system.</p><p>We found that the luminal domains of TAPBPR were able to efficiently function in MHC class I peptide selection in vitro. This suggests that the luminal region of TAPBPR alone has sufficient affinity for MHC class I to promote peptide loading and to catalyse peptide exchange and does not require other co-factors or to be artificially tethered to MHC class I to perform this function. This is in contrast to soluble tapasin, which others have found does not associate productively with MHC class I in vitro alone, and instead requires either conjugation to ERp57 or to be artificially tethered to MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>). We speculate the difference in affinity of tapasin and TAPBPR for MHC class I may have evolved as a consequence of the distinct cellular environment the two peptide exchange catalysts function: tapasin functioning in the context of the PLC, where other proteins collectively form a mutually supportive interaction scaffold, and TAPBPR functioning outside the confines of the PLC. Although both tapasin and TAPBPR clearly function as peptide exchange catalysts in vitro, the activities of the two proteins are not identical. Firstly, we observed differences in the ability of tapasin-jun and TAPBPR to promote dissociation of peptides from HLA-A*02:01. Secondly, we found TAPBPR was unable to promote the binding of ELRSRK*WAI or FLRGRK*YGL to peptide receptive HLA-B*08:01fos molecules, whereas Chen &amp; Bouvier found that tapasin-jun enhanced the binding of FITC labelled variants of both these peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>). This indicates there are some qualitative differences between the activity of TAPBPR and tapasin.</p><p>Clearly, a new picture concerning how peptides are selected for presentation by MHC class I molecules is emerging. Our findings are consistent with tapasin and TAPBPR working together in a sequential manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The initial peptide loading of MHC I molecules is likely to occur within the PLC and to be assisted by tapasin. Within this relatively peptide-rich environment, peptide loading and exchange mediated by tapasin increases the affinity of peptide bound to MHC class I. We propose that outside of the PLC, the stability of peptide:MHC I complexes is monitored by TAPBPR. Those molecules loaded with high affinity peptides will either circumvent TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing completely or pass through this quality control checkpoint. For MHC class I molecules loaded with peptides of intermediate or low affinity, TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing proceeds. The unique environments in which tapasin and TAPBPR have evolved to operate in are likely to shape the peptide repertoire in different ways. The relatively peptide-rich environment of the PLC may allow tapasin to promote peptide binding and produce a relatively broad peptide repertoire. However, presumably as an MHC I molecule moves away from the PLC, the gradient of optimal peptides is likely to decrease and therefore TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing events within such an environment may favour peptide dissociation rather than association. Thus we speculate that, in a peptide rich environment, acceleration of both association and dissociation (by tapasin) contributes to editing; while in a peptide dilute environment, acceleration of dissociation only (by TAPBPR) may dominate editing, consistent with the increased peptide repertoire observed in TAPBPR deficient cells. Thus, TAPBPR may restrict peptide presentation by enhancing the selection of high affinity peptide on MHC class I.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.015</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the relationship between tapasin and TAPBPR in shaping the peptide repertoire expressed on MHC class I.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upstream of the PLC, in an environment in which peptides suitable for MHC class I binding are likely to be at a low concentration, TAPBPR might help stabilise a peptide-receptive conformation of MHC class I, but would not directly assist in peptide loading, peptide exchange or directly increase the abundance of peptide:MHC complexes due to a shortage of peptide. (<bold>B</bold>) The optimal peptide loading environment for MHC class I is presumably within the PLC where the concentration of peptides suitable for MHC class I is the highest and where MHC I are held in a peptide-receptive conformation by tapasin. (<bold>C</bold>) Once peptide:MHC I complexes are released from the PLC, TAPBPR-mediated dissociation would attempt to remove peptide from MHC class I. If a high affinity peptide was bound to the MHC I molecules, TAPBPR would not be able to remove it. If TAPBPR can cause the dissociation of peptide, peptide exchange could ensue if suitable replacement peptides were available. However, the further away from the PLC and/or the further down the MHC class I peptide gradient TAPBPR works there may be a shortage of suitable replacement peptides. In this situation TAPBPR is unlikely to load the peptide-receptive MHC class I and may assist in the recycling of MHC I molecules. By functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst in a relatively peptide deficient environment, TAPBPR could increase the affinity of the peptide:MHC I complexes or restrict the diversity of peptide:MHC I complexes which are presented to the cell surface.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09617.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09617.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09617-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Further in-depth analysis is required to dissect the intricate relationship between tapasin and TAPBPR in determining the final peptide repertoire presented on the cell surface. In particular it will be important to understand how different MHC class I allomorphs depend on these two specific chaperones. Intriguingly, we have observed differences in the functional effects of TAPBPR on peptide selection by HLA-A2 and –B7. For HLA-A2, TAPBPR catalyses both the peptide dissociation and association in vitro, in a similar manner described for the function of tapasin, albeit with different peptide preference. Therefore, there may be shared, but not identical, functionality between tapasin and TAPBPR regarding peptide selection onto HLA-A2, i.e. in a peptide abundant environment both chaperones could potentially load and edit peptides bound to HLA-A2. This may explain, at least in part, why surface expression of HLA-A2 is relatively tapasin-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis et al., 1998</xref>). Surface expression of HLA-A2 is also TAPBPR-independent in the presence of tapasin, and it is not until tapasin and TAPBPR are absent or depleted that a severe effect is observed on HLA-A2 surface expression. In the absence of both tapasin and TAPBPR, surface expression of HLA-A2 resembles that of the HLA-A2 T134K mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lewis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peace-Brewer et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore the discovery of a peptide editing function for TAPBPR helps explain the previous discrepancies regarding the phenotype of the T134K mutant (in which the HLA-A2 mutant is unable to interact with either tapasin or TAPBPR and exhibits low cell surface expression) and tapasin-deficient cells (in which the HLA-A2 binds TAPBPR and exhibits high cell surface expression).</p><p>Our results clearly demonstrate that TAPBPR also plays a significant role in peptide selection by HLA-B molecules. This importance of TAPBPR in HLA-B biology was underappreciated previously when investigating the interaction between TAPBPR and HLA-B in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). Although all the HLA-B molecules investigated here (HLA-B7, -B8, -B15 and -B40) exhibit weak or transient association with TAPBPR as compared to HLA-A2 in wild-type cells, the interaction between HLA-B7 and TAPBPR was significantly increased in the absence of tapasin as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. TAPBPR clearly influenced peptide selection on all of these HLA-B molecules: fluorescent polarisation experiments demonstrate that TAPBPR functions as a peptide loading and exchange catalyst for EIYK*RWIIL on HLA-B8; TAPBPR deficiency in IFN-γ induced HeLa and KBM-7 cells alters the peptide repertoire expressed by HLA-B15 and HLA-B40 respectively; and depletion of TAPBPR in 721.221 results in a significant decrease in the surface expression of HLA-B7, even in the presence of tapasin. Taken together, these results suggest that TAPBPR is responsible for restricting peptides on HLA-B allomorphs. Clearly, peptide selection by MHC class I molecules is far more complex than previously anticipated.

To determine classic peptide anchor conservation, TAPBPR permitted peptides (shared peptides) and TAPBPR restricted peptides (peptides unique to HeLa-TAPBPR KO cells or peptides unique to HeLa cells) were compared and the frequency of classic anchors at P2 or PΩ calculated for both HLA-A*68:02 or HLA-B*15:03.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>CH, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>AvanH, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>NT, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>AN, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>PJD, Assistance in protein expression and purification, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>SS, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>JT, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>JED, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>TE, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>LHB, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="s6-1" sec-type="datasets"><title>Major datasets</title><p>The following datasets were generated:</p> <p><related-object content-type="generated-dataset" id="dataro1" source-id="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.487j9" source-id-type="uri"><collab>Hermann C</collab>, <collab>van Hateren A</collab>, <collab>Trautwein N</collab>, <collab>Neerincx A</collab>, <collab>Duriez PJ</collab>, <collab>Stevanović S</collab>, <collab>Trowsdale J</collab>, <collab>Deane JE</collab>, <collab>Elliott T</collab>, <collab>Boyle LH</collab><x>,</x> <year>2015</year><x>,</x><source>Data from: TAPBPR alters MHC class I peptide presentation by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst</source><x>,</x> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.487j9">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.487j9</ext-link><x>,</x> <comment>Available at Dryad Digital Repository under a CC0 Public Domain Dedication</comment></related-object></p></sec></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apps</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernando</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardner</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahad</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Moffett</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2009">2009</year><article-title>Human leucocyte antigen (hLA) expression of primary trophoblast cells and placental cell lines, determined using single antigen beads to characterize allotype specificities of anti-HLA antibodies</article-title><source>Immunology</source><volume>127</volume><fpage>26</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03019.x</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aricescu</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>EY</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2006">2006</year><article-title>A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells</article-title><source>Acta Crystallographica.

One of the three reviewers, Nilabh Shastri, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Clemens and colleagues report new details of what is emerging as a key step in the antigen-processing pathway for generating peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules. They show that TAPBPR, a tapasin-like protein which was discovered earlier by some members of this group, is a peptide editor for selective loading of MHC I molecules. Unlike tapasin, which functions in the peptide-loading complex (PLC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), TAPBPR apparently carries out its peptide editing functions outside the PLC and this editing function does not overlap with that of tapasin. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the peptide-selection mechanisms in the MHC class I antigen processing pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors are to be congratulated on a very high-quality and interesting manuscript. Only the relatively minor revisions listed below have been requested:</p><p>1) The actual peptide sequences should be made available to the reader.</p><p>2) In the absence of TAPBPR, the number of different peptides is enhanced, suggesting that these peptides were edited out in the presence of TAPBPR. Although not explicitly stated, such peptides are likely of low affinity. This could be directly tested with some of the synthetic peptides from the list in their fluorescence peptide binding/competition assays.</p><p>3) If the peptide-HLA is indeed loaded with low affinity peptides in absence of TAPBPR, then such complexes should be less stable on the cell surface. This could be easily tested by measuring the decay of peptide-loaded HLAs from the cell surface in brefeldin A treated cells which would not export newly assembled HLA molecules. Faster decay of HLA from the cell surface would strengthen the conclusion that the new peptides that arise in TAPBPR-deficient cells are low affinity. This evidence should further support the lower thermal stability data for MHC that actually makes it to the cell surface.</p><p>4) Reproducibility: the authors need to clearly indicate how reproducible the presented data is. How many times the experiments were performed and what the error bars shown represent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09617.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors are to be congratulated on a very high-quality and interesting manuscript.

While it is possible to do these experiments, we feel the results would be entirely dependent on the particular peptide we happen to pick from the peptide pool. As our peptide lists have thousands of different peptides and we can only analyse perhaps ten of these peptides in the assay (which would only represent 1% of the total peptide pool) we feel this approach might not be reflective of TAPBPR function on the whole population of peptide and we might inadvertently skew the data depending on the particular 1% of peptides we selected to test in our assay.</p><p>Therefore, as an alternative approach to examine whether TAPBPR is involved in editing out peptides of low affinity, we have compared the anchor residues of peptides shared in TAPBPR-competent and TAPBPR-depleted cells, which are therefore indicative of peptides permitted release through the TAPBPR filter/restriction step, with the anchor residues of unique peptides found in TAPBPR negative cells, which are indicative of peptides which are removed or restricted by TAPBPR expression. This new data can be found <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (sections E-H). Using this approach, we observed a larger percentage of peptides which are permitted release by TAPBPR have classic anchor residues compared to the peptides restricted by TAPBPR. These results suggest there is some enhancement of peptide anchors on MHC I by TAPBPR and hence TAPBPR has the potential to remove some peptides with lower affinity. We hope this new data analysis fully answers the reviewers point regarding TAPBPR editing out some peptides of lower affinity within a cellular environment.</p><p><italic>3) If the peptide-HLA is indeed loaded with low affinity peptides in absence of TAPBPR, then such complexes should be less stable on the cell surface.

We have now performed these experiments comparing the stability of two MHC class I molecules, HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, in TAPBPR-competent and TAPBPR-depleted cells (and in the presence and absence of tapasin as a control) and do indeed find an increase in the rate of decay of MHC class I in the absence of TAPBPR. This new data can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (section E and F). As we observe a faster rate of decay of HLA from the cell surface in TAPBPR depleted cells, this new data strengthens the conclusion that at least some of the new peptides that arise in TAPBPR-deficient cells are low affinity.</p><p><italic>4) Reproducibility: the authors need to clearly indicate how reproducible the presented data is.
