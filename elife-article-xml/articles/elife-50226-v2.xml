As effectors of cytoskeletal dynamics, Rho GTPases and their regulators are likely involved, but their daunting complexity has hindered progress in dissecting their functions. We overcome this hurdle by employing high throughput in utero RNAi-mediated screening to identify key Rho regulators of skin morphogenesis. Our screen unveiled hitherto unrecognized roles for Rho-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling events that impact hair follicle specification, differentiation, downgrowth and planar cell polarity. Coupling our top hit with gain/loss-of-function genetics, interactome proteomics and tissue imaging, we show that RHOU, an atypical Rho, governs the cytoskeletal-junction dynamics that establish columnar shape and planar cell polarity in epidermal progenitors. Conversely, RHOU downregulation is required to remodel to a conical cellular shape that enables hair bud invagination and downgrowth. Our findings underscore the power of coupling screens with proteomics to unravel the physiological significance of complex gene families.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>Rho GTPases</kwd><kwd>RNAi screen</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell shape dynamics</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laurin</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Enrichment Program Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomez</surname><given-names>Nicholas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ruth L Kirschstein National Research Service Award (F32CA221353)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomez</surname><given-names>Nicholas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sendoel</surname><given-names>Ataman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sendoel</surname><given-names>Ataman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009326</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship forthe Next Generation of Scientists</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laurin</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR27883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unprecedented large-scale screen in mice for morphogenetic regulators of tissue development provides major new insights into the roles of Rho GTPases in diverse array of skin developmental processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During embryonic development, fundamental cell fate decisions are driven by a succession of reciprocal and antagonistic interactions between developmental signaling pathways that elicit changes in gene expression. Accompanied by these events are dramatic and diverse cellular rearrangements typify tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Van Aelst and Symons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gilmour et al., 2017</xref>). Due to their ability to regulate cytoskeletal and cellular junction remodeling, Rho GTPases and their regulators are emerging as key effectors of these fascinating morphogenetic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Van Aelst and Symons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duquette and Lamarche-Vane, 2014</xref>). Yet, a complete picture of the physiological roles played by these networks in mammals is lacking.</p><p>Most Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that remain inactive when bound to GDP, but become active when bound to GTP, where they can associate with their downstream effectors and elicit changes in cellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>). Rho GTPases are regulated by Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) that promote the exchange of GDP for GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Laurin and Cote, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cook et al., 2014</xref>), GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) that catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tcherkezian and Lamarche-Vane, 2007</xref>) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDI) that prevent reactivation from the GDP to GTP bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Mata et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, fine-tuning of Rho GTPase-mediated cellular events is achieved through the proteinâs GTP status, localization, effector-binding, as well as gene expression and protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hodge and Ridley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olson, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, there are 20 Rho GTPases and nearly 150 regulators. Cell culture screening approaches have uncovered roles played by Rho GTPases and their regulators in cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duquette and Lamarche-Vane, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amado-Azevedo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tajadura-Ortega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pascual-Vargas et al., 2017</xref>). Thus far however, in vivo analyses of Rho GTPase functions in morphogenetic processes have been largely restricted to signaling by the three prototypical members RAC, RHO and CDC42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hodge and Ridley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Van Aelst and Symons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duquette and Lamarche-Vane, 2014</xref>). Given the associated risks of functional redundancies, few researchers have ventured into the realm of employing conventional genetic methods to tackle the physiological roles of other family members. This has left an incomplete picture of the biological significance of the multiplicity of Rho GTPases, and the ways in which their associated actomyosin dynamics govern the complex morphogenetic events that are needed for tissues development and function.</p><p>The skin epithelium is an exceptional example of the dramatic and diverse changes in cytoskeletal-adhesion dynamics that occur during tissue development. The surface ectoderm emerges at embryonic day E9.5, shortly after gastrulation. As yet unspecified, these progenitors soon transition from a single layer of progenitors to a stratified epidermis replete with hair follicles (HFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gonzales and Fuchs, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jamora et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Perez-Moreno and Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Devenport et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Luxenburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>). By E12.5, epidermal progenitors begin to stratify. This process requires actomyosin dynamics and epithelial polarization, driven basally by integrin-mediated assembly and adhesion to an underlying basement membrane of extracellular matrix proteins, and laterally by formation of cadherin-mediated intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Niessen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Raghavan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vaezi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Perez-Moreno and Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Luxenburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>). Fate specification begins around E13.5 and continues until birth in four sequential waves, as some epidermal progenitors accumulate sufficient instructive WNT-cues to coalesce and form a hair placode and an associated underlying dermal condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saxena et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>).

While PCP manifests in the HF, its cues are established at intercellular junctions within the E13.5 epidermal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahtiainen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cetera et al., 2018</xref>). There, actin and myosin cytoskeletal dynamics orchestrate the cortical tension, cell shape remodeling and cellular rearrangements necessary to generate the epidermal PCP patterns that instruct HFs to align along the anterior-posterior axis across the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cetera et al., 2018</xref>). While the signaling events are still unfolding, cytoskeletal networks also become asymmetrically polarized within the placode and are required for the angling of the downgrowing HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Whether and how Rho GTPases and their effectors function in these complex actin cytoskeletal and cell junctional processes remain largely unexplored. Conventional genetic analyses have provided valuable insights into RAC1, RHOA and CDC42 Rho GTPases in skin. Postnatal roles for these Rho GTPases include stem cell maintenance, tumorigenesis, migration, wound-repair and immune-epithelial crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benitah et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tscharntke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Winge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">GarcÃ­a-Mariscal et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, postnatal HF defects leading to alopecia have been reported for both RAC1 and CDC42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castilho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chrostek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wu et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrendt et al., 2012</xref>), and for CDC42, defects in basement membrane assembly, hair differentiation and WNT signaling have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wu et al., 2006a</xref>). In contrast, neither CDC42 nor RHOA mutant pups show altered skin at birth, and for RHOA, mice remain aphenotypic into adulthood, suggestive of redundancy or compensation with other Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>). The precise mechanisms by which these Rho GTPases exert the actin dynamics necessary to generate these phenotypes await further investigation. In addition, there are many other Rho GTPases and their regulators that show some expression during embryonic skin morphogenesis and yet whose physiological relevance and functions have been untapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rezza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To tackle the daunting complexity of the possible Rho GTPases and their regulators that are likely to orchestrate these highly coordinated actomyosin dynamics in epidermal and HF development, we exploited the power of our ultrasound-guided microinjection system to expose E9.5 mouse embryos in utero to lentivirus and selectively transduce the single layer of skin progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous screens involving pooled shRNA lentiviral libraries focused on the epidermis and scored for enrichment of library components as a consequence of altered clonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asare et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beronja et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schramek et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we repurposed this strategy to develop a first morphogenesis screen performed in mammals aimed at identifying Rho GTPases and their regulators that have different roles in the HF versus the epidermis. We unearthed a number of diverse functions for superfamily members in skin development. Selecting one interesting hit, the atypical Rho GTPase <italic>Rhou</italic>, for in depth exploration, we show how our screen can be coupled to unbiased proteomic approaches to uncover new insights into how ill-defined members of the Rho GTPases superfamily coordinate distinct types of cytoskeletal behaviors to achieve complex tissue architectures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A screen strategy to identify Rho GTPase regulators of skin morphogenesis</title><p>Our screen was based on the principle that cells carrying short hairpins RNA (shRNAs) that target positive regulators of HF versus epidermal development should be depleted in the growing HF, while cells carrying shRNAs against regulators whose down-regulation favors skin appendage formation should be enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our strategy further capitalized on the ease of enzymatically separating E18.5 epidermis from the dermal fraction containing HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rhee, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Since lentivirus only infects and transduces the single layer of surface epithelial progenitors, only the epithelial (i.e. HF) cells within the dermis will contain integrated lentiviral inserts, thus alleviating the need for further cell purifications before performing high throughput targeted sequencing of integrated lentiviral inserts to identify enriched and depleted shRNAs in the HFs.</p><p>The success of our previous screens focused solely on the epidermal fraction was predicated on the relatively low variation in clonal growth rates across embryonic progenitors, enabling identification of shRNAs that differentially affected growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>). To screen successfully for morphogenetic regulators of HF development, it was equally important to test and document that HF progenitors similarly undergo relatively comparable expansion during embryogenesis. We did so by performing cell competition assays followed by flow cytometry quantifications and verified that the ratio between sizes of individual cell clones expressing a shRNA against a scrambled sequence (<italic>shScr</italic>) and either H2B-GFP or H2B-RFP remain the same at E18.5 when compared to their starting representation (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, RatioÂ =Â 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, RatioÂ =Â 1).</p><p>In addition to cellular growth, HF morphogenesis also entails cell specification, junctional remodeling and down-growth. Importantly, our competition assays were also able to identify shRNAs that perturb these features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Thus in pilot tests, we observed marked depletion relative to <italic>shScr</italic> (RatiosÂ &lt;1) when we used either <italic>shCtnnb1</italic> targeting Î²-catenin, required for WNT signaling in HF specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>), or <italic>shMyh9</italic> targeting Myosin IIa, which is known to be essential for HF downgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le et al., 2016</xref>). These shRNAs also gave the expected outcomes in the epidermal fraction: proliferation in embryonic epidermis is known to be slowed when Î²-catenin is defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2013</xref>), while Myosin IIBâs redundancy with Myosin IIA as been suggested to masks in the embryo the epidermal hyperproliferation observed in its absence in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crish et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schramek et al., 2014</xref>). These results documented the efficacy of our screen strategy to capture regulators spanning multiple aspects of skin development.</p><p>With these controls in place, we then turned to our goal of unearthing new biological functions for the understudied superfamily of Rho GTPases and their regulators. We began by building a pooled lentiviral shRNA library targeting 166 Rho GTPases and their regulators, including 20 Rho GTPases, 77 RhoGEFs, 66 RhoGAPs and 3 RhoGDIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Our library containedÂ â¥5 distinct shRNAs per gene, and also 20 Scr shRNAs with minimal mouse genome homology and no effect on skin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schramek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In total, the library contained 999 independent shRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>For the purposes of the current study, we did not include other RAS superfamily of GTPase members to keep requisite embryo numbers for our triplicate screens manageable (&lt;200 total). Indeed, to minimize multiplicity of infections (MOI) and ensure that epidermal progenitors receive a single shRNA, we could only infectÂ ~15% of E9.5 surface progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beronja et al., 2013</xref>), and as our pilot testing revealed, onlyÂ ~10% of transduced E9.5 epidermal progenitors contribute to HFs at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâI</xref>). Since each E9.5 embryo harborsÂ ~Â 120,000 epidermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beronja et al., 2013</xref>), these new data implied that onlyÂ ~12,000 future HF progenitors would be present at the time of injection. Thus to ensure robustness for a morphogenetic screen involving both HF and epidermal progenitors,~10X more embryos were needed over epidermal screens to have each shRNA transduced by at least 100 HF progenitors (i.e.Â â¥100 fold coverage) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref> for further details). For our 1000 shRNA library, this meant 60 embryos per replicate.</p><p>To profile the initial composition of our lentiviral pooled library and control for variations in the representation of individual shRNAs, we infected cultured primary epidermal cells and isolated genomic DNAs 24 hr later (t0 in vitro) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In parallel, we injected our library in triplicate in utero into the amniotic sacs of the requisite numbers of E9.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). At E18.5, HF (tE18.5 HF) and epidermal (tE18.5 Epi) fractions were prepared from backskins, and genomic DNAs were isolated, amplified and sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2CâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50226.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RNAi screen hits reveal Rho GTPase regulators of hair follicle morphogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of our in vivo screen for Rho GTPases and their regulators.

Comparative analyses revealed shRNAs that were enriched or depleted in both HF and epidermal fractions relative to a) their initial representation in the library (tE18.5 HF fraction vs t0 in vitro and tE18.5 Epi fraction vs t0 in vitro) and b) the behavior of Scr controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Candidates were chosen for further study ifÂ â¥2 independent shRNAs each showed aÂ â¥Â 2 fold enrichment or depletion in the HF and/or epidermal fraction. Additionally, to meet our criteria, the fold change needed to be statistically significant [<italic>P</italic> valueÂ &lt;Â 0.05 by multiple two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test and false discovery rate (FDR) method of Benjamini and Hochberch, with a FDR set at 10% between biological replicates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asare et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>)] and none of the geneâs other targeting shRNAs could have the opposite effect. This optimized our chances of selecting positive hits with strong biological effects. While this also likely increased the numbers of âfalse negativesâ, the potential for functional redundancy had already led us to focus our attention on positive hits and not negative ones. Even so, this gave us a total of 68 candidates to pursue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>Â andÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>Seven of these genes were uniquely enriched in the epidermal fraction, making them candidates for late-stages of epidermal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

For the purposes of the current study, we narrowed our attention to 26 candidates whose shRNA-transduced cells were not dramatically selected for or against in the epidermal fraction but which were enriched or depleted specifically in the HF as these are strong candidates for regulating actin-mediated differences between epidermal and HF morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Four of these 26 candidates were Rho GTPases, 14 were RhoGEFs and eight were RhoGAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

FGD2 is an understudied member of the FGD1 family of CDC42 GEFs, and mutations in this family have been associated with faciogenital dysplasia, a disease thought to originate from cellular migration defects during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakanishi and Takai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pasteris and Gorski, 1999</xref>).

TRIO was recently found to play a role in lens placode invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Plageman et al., 2011</xref>), a biological process that is tantalizingly similar to HF downgrowth. RHOU has a higher intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate than CDC42 in vitro and has been regarded as an atypical, constitutively active Rho GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shutes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hodge and Ridley, 2017</xref>).

At the core of PCP is CELSR1, an atypical cadherin that localizes specifically along the anterior and posterior cell membranes of basal epidermal cells during skin development and orchestrates the distributions of other PCP components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Perturbations in CELSR1 localization have been shown to perturb HF orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>).

In marked contrast, <italic>shRhou</italic> embryos showed clear perturbations in CELSR1 polarization. These defects were not attributable to differences in the expression of core PCP genes, whose levels were comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Rather, without RHOU, CELSR1 pattern and consequently PCP, was not properly established in the developing epidermis and this in turn prevented HFs from properly aligning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Beyond HF angling: Alterations in basal epidermal cell shape and actin-junctional dynamics when <italic>Rhou</italic> is suppressed</title><p>Defects in HF angling alone did not explain why shRNAs targeting <italic>Rhou</italic> surfaced in our screen.

Although our screen only focused on the overall growth of the epidermis and the emergence and downgrowth of the HF, and hence did not detect alterations in the stratification/terminal differentiation program of the epidermis, these alterations modestly affected the overlying layers. This resulted in a thinner epidermis with reduced suprabasal keratin 10 (K10) and LORICRIN, and induction of keratin 6 (K6), a marker of aberrant epidermal behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Shape analysis of these cells within the E14.5 and E15.5 basal epidermal sheet revealed that indeed, the average area along the basement membrane of <italic>shRhou</italic> cells was larger than <italic>shScr</italic> counterparts, and this was accompanied by a marked decrease in their basal cell height, a feature still present at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Overall, our findings pointed to a functional requirement for RHOU in promoting (actin-dependent) adherens junction formation, diminishing the integrin-rich basal surface and generating the cortical actin network that is necessary for columnar cell shape, CELSR1 orientation and PCP establishment in the epidermal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the loss of RHOU was accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of myosin II light chain, expected from a more robust actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Proximity-dependent RHOU interactome unveils a bias for proteins known to shuttle between adherens junctions and focal adhesions</title><p>To probe more deeply into the molecular basis of RHOUâs effects on cell-cell junction and shape dynamics, we turned to an in vitro system of cultured primary neonatal skin epidermal keratinocytes. We first tested whether in these cells, RHOU regulates adherens junction formation and actin dynamics as it did in vivo. Indeed, upon shifting from low to high calcium medium to activate cell-cell junction assembly, RHOU-deficient epidermal cells exhibited clear delays in adherens junction formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). After 24 hr, however, intercellular junctions were indistinguishable from WT (not shown), indicating that RHOU-deficiency did not block intercellular junction formation per se. Rather, RHOU appeared to function in supporting nascent adherens junctions at early stages of epithelial sheet formation, where adherens junction-linked actin dynamics are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Upon examining individual cells, it became clear that loss of RHOU resulted in an increase in F-ACTIN stress fibers and integrin-mediated focal adhesion size and length, features of reduced focal adhesion turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2BâD</xref>). This was intriguing, as it began to illuminate further why basal epidermal progenitors lacking RHOU in vivo were on the one hand, flatter with enhanced basal surface along the ECM-rich basement membrane and on the other, less columnar with reduced apico-lateral surfaces along sites of intercellular contact.</p><p>Given the similarities in RHOUâs in vitro and in vivo effects, we turned to proximity-dependent biotin identification (âBioIDâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) to position RHOU at the core of signaling pathways and gain further molecular insights into its function. The BioID method relies on fusion of a promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA*) to a protein of interest, such that upon expression in keratinocytes, endogenous proteins in proximity will be biotinylated on available lysine residues and recovered through streptavidin pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This method detects transient protein interactions and can accommodate harsh lysis conditions that often prevent protein partner identification, but which are necessary for epidermal keratinocytes.

The frequency of each proteinâs detection in the interactome was illustrated by the size of each word in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.

Gene ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) revealed a RHOU interactome enriched for proteins involved in 'adherens junctions', including p120-catenin (Ctnnd1), a known RHOA-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Perez-Moreno et al., 2006</xref>) and 'focal adhesions', including paxillin, integrin Î²1 and tensin-4, as well as NCK1, an adaptor protein required for Rho GTPase activation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Saras et al., 2004</xref>), which was previously reported as an interactor of RHOU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Risse et al., 2013</xref>). An outlier was PAR6, which did not surface in our interactome, despite its expression in primary keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) and previous reports of its binding to RHOU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brady et al., 2009</xref>). Its absence is likely rooted in our conditions used for analysis, where keratinocytes did not display tight junctions, the site of this described interaction. Overall, the RHOU interacting proteins we unearthed were in good agreement with prior in vitro studies that have implicated RHOU in focal adhesion turnover and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dart et al., 2015</xref>). These findings were also consistent with our in vitro and in vivo data on epidermal progenitors.</p><p>Given RHOUâs dual and opposing effects on the epidermisâ intercellular and cell-substratum borders, we were especially intrigued by the prominence in RHOUâs interactome of the p21-activated serine-threonine kinases, PAK1 and PAK2, and the guanine nucleotide exchange protein ARHGEF7 (Î²-PIX). These proteins are known to shuttle as a complex between adherens junctions, where tyrosine kinase receptor activity is silent and focal adhesions, where it is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Livshits et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Plutoni et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, EGFR was also present in our interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

In primary keratinocytes and during epidermal development, PAK2 is the most highly expressed PAK1/2/3 protein and gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left and right respectively) that likely accounts for why PAK2 was more abundant than PAK1 in our proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, overexpression of RHOU resulted in PAK1/2 activation in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) while depletion of RHOU resulted in its reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Moreover, we found that activation of PAK1/2 inversely correlated with phospho-myosin light chain 2, consistent with the view that RHOU functions by enhancing actin dynamics and focal adhesion turnover.</p><p>Among the uncharacterized proximity partners, we used immunoprecipitation and confirmed ARHGEF7âs interaction with RHOU as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Finally, these data imply that by accentuating the conical cell shape required for HF invagination, <italic>shRhou</italic> cells acquire a competitive advantage for invasion and HF downgrowth over wild-type cells in a mosaic tissue and are more likely to contribute to the HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>An unprecedented morphogenetic screen in mice</title><p>Many of the pioneering genetic screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have focused on the epidermis and its appendages, where phenotypic abnormalities can be readily spotted and analyzed. By screening for enrichment or depletion of shRNAs in the epidermis and HFs, weâve illustrated the power of our strategy in identifying novel regulators of mammalian skin morphogenesis. The methodology weâve developed is broadly applicable, as the single E9.5 progenitor layer also gives rise to mammary glands, sweat glands and oral epithelia. Moreover, since adjusting infection times can achieve transduction of different tissues, including neuroectoderm and internal tissues, morphogenetic screens using lentiviral transductions should be applicable to interrogate many processes across mammalian development.</p><p>Screening for Rho GTPases and their regulators in morphogenesis offered an interesting challenge because of their complexity and broad expression patterns. To date, only the original three Rho GTPase family members and a handful of their regulators have been studied in depth in vivo. The epidermis and HFs proved to be the perfect morphogenetic system to probe this complexity, given their diverse developmental repertoire of cytoskeletal-based changes in cell shapes, cell fate specifications, cell movements and intercellular and cell-basement membrane interactions needed to achieve these proper and remarkably distinct tissue architectures.</p><p>Taking an unbiased screening approach was the only way to illuminate non-redundant distinctions among different members of this superfamily. That said, we were surprised to find that 42% of the genes targeted by our library showed an enrichment or depletion of their targeting shRNA in either the epidermal or HF fractions, revealing considerably less redundancy than previously assumed for Rho family members and their regulators. When taken together with the fascinating diversity in phenotypes that we observed upon analyses of only a few of these hits, our screen exposes a treasure-trove of morphogenetic processes that are coupled to these critical regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>In reflecting on the many hits we encountered, <italic>Rhob</italic> and <italic>Rac3</italic> were surprising. Both <italic>Rhob</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>Rac3</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corbetta et al., 2005</xref>) are viable and fertile and donât show obvious defects during skin development. As we only scored embryonic phenotypes here, postnatal gene compensation by other Rho GTPases might explain these discrepancies. An alternative explanation comes from recent studies by Didier Stainierâs lab, which have show that some mechanisms of gene compensation that result from gene knockouts are not triggered upon RNAi-mediated knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, RNAis may fail to reveal gene function due to incomplete protein depletion. Ultimately, the combination of RNAi and gene knockout strategies may be necessary to illuminate the physiological relevance and full scope of a geneâs function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RHOU, intercellular adhesion and planar cell polarity</title><p>Our screen identified not only prototypical Rho GTPases, but also atypical members like RHOU, as critical regulators in skin morphogenesis, and by coupling our screen results with developmental studies and proximity ligation proteomics, we gained further insights. Our realization that RHOU functions at adherens junctions was piqued by our prior knowledge that in developing mouse epidermis, both adherens junctions and cortical actin are required to polarize the CELSR1 cadherin and establish PCP guidance cues along anterior-posterior interfaces of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Devenport et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aw et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Two new findings emerged from our subsequent functional analyses. First, we discovered that RHOU loss markedly perturbed the actin-driven formation of nascent adherens junctions, which arise during the narrow developmental window when planar polarization of CELSR1 takes place. Secondly, RHOU loss did not prevent the passive formation of adherens junctions that occurs in densely packed epithelial sheets. This explains why RHOU loss has not revealed intercellular adhesion defects in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Loebel et al., 2011</xref>), while in others, mislocalization of intercellular junction molecules has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dickover et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery that RHOU acts upstream of PCP establishment also came with new insights. Initial links between PCP and Rho GTPases came from <italic>Drosophila,</italic> where parallels were found between PCP patterning phenotypes and hypomorphic RHOA mutations involving internal excisions in the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Strutt et al., 1997</xref>). Similar mutants also disrupt the planar polarized ciliary beating that occurs in the mucociliary epidermal cells of Xenopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Although such dominant negative Rho mutations clearly disrupt PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eaton et al., 1996</xref>), only triple/quadruple genetic mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rho GTPases have unveiled PCP phenotypes, and even those were mild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">MuÃ±oz-Descalzo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Similar redundancy of Rho GTPases has been observed in other animals where PCP comes into play. Thus for instance, the worm RHOU orthologue, CHW-1, has also been implicated as an upstream GTPase involved in vulval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kidd et al., 2015</xref>). That said, drawing a link to PCP was only achieved with compound mutations involving other non-Rho pathway members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kidd et al., 2015</xref>), as were vertebrate studies on other Rho GTPases associated with regions of convergence-extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">SimÃµes et al., 2014</xref>).

As our studies further reveal, RHOU's function in governing PCP patterning in the skin is through the actin-mediated dynamics that drive adherens junction formation and dictate cell shape. These features constitute the overarching foundation of PCP establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RHOU as an integrator of the inverse relation between cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion</title><p>In a number of different cell lines in vitro, RHOU has been implicated as a regulator of focal adhesion dynamics, with elevated RHOU leading to focal adhesion dissolution and reduced RHOU favoring more stable focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ory et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ruusala and AspenstrÃ¶m, 2008</xref>). In this regard, our proteomics were particularly intriguing as they illuminated RHOU at the heart of the protein complex that can shuttle between and govern an inverse relation between focal adhesions and adherens junctions. In vivo depletion of members of this complex showed similarities to RHOU loss of function, with an increase in the basal (focal adhesion) surface of epidermal progenitors and a decrease in apico-lateral (adherens junction) surfaces. Conversely, our gain of RHOU studies were consistent with an increase in apico-lateral domains at the expense of basal domains. It will be interesting in the future to see the extent to which RHOU functions in other contexts, including malignancy and wound healing, where reductions in the actin dynamics associated with adherens junction formation are often counterbalanced by more motile protrusion dynamics associated with focal adhesions turnover.</p><p>Pursuing the role for RHOU in cell-cell junction dynamics, it was also notable that the top hit after the junction-shuttling proteins was p120-CATENIN (<italic>Ctnnd1).</italic> While previously not identified as a RHOU-interacting partner, p120-CATENIN is an established E-CADHERIN-binding protein which in polarized epithelia, exists in a complex with RhoGEFs/GAPs to alter associated Rho GTPases and affect apico-lateral junction stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klompstra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Noren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wildenberg et al., 2006</xref>). By differentially expressing RHOU, known to have a higher intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate than CDC42, we posit that these junctional zones may lessen their reliance on other GTPase regulators, thereby acquiring the means to prolong stability of adherens junctions and columnar cell shape. Further support this tantalizing notion comes from studies on the foregut endoderm, where RHOU is expressed in columnar and absent in more squamous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Loebel et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Rhou</italic> mRNA has recently been shown to be more highly expressed in the differentiated progeny versus the stem cells of the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Slaymi et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly to what we observed in the epidermis, inactivation of <italic>Rhou</italic> in gut increases significantly the level of pMLC2 and alters cell contractility.

As such, downregulation of RHOU generates the conical shape (enhanced basal surface and decreased apico-lateral surfaces) required for HF invagination and downgrowth.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50226-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our findings now place RHOU at the crux of these actomyosin and cell shape dynamics that typify HF morphogenesis. As our gain of function studies revealed, RHOU maintains epidermal architecture, but this antagonizes HF invagination and downgrowth. Thus for HF morphogenesis to occur and for hair buds to invaginate, RHOU expression must be downregulated. Since <italic>Rhou</italic> shRNAs were selected for in the HF fraction of our screen, our findings further illustrate that by accelerating the switch to a conical shape, downregulating RHOU stimulates the invagination process relative to RHOU-expressing cells. Our findings are interesting in light of prior studies showing that in early embryos derived from <italic>shRhou-</italic>transduced embryonic stem cells, the developing ventral foregut endoderm also fails to maintain its apical position within the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Loebel et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, we speculate that RHOU suppression may be a general feature of morphogenetic processes that require invagination from a RHOU+ epithelium.</p><p>In summary, our morphogenesis screen and the plethora of new potential RHOU interactions highlight a role for RHOU in choreographing the architecture of the epidermis as well as the HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

An angularity of 0Â° represent a perfect alignment of the HF along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. To assess the establishment of PCP in the epidermis, whole-mount samples from head skin of E14.5, E15.5 and E16.5 embryos were stained with CELSR1 and E-CADHERIN and imaged as described above. Data collection was conducted using confocal image at a horizontal plane from the middle of the basal cell layer. A PCP polarized basal cells was defined as a cell in which two opposing domains of CELSR1 can be observed. The angle of polarity was determined using the Fiji straight-line tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantitative analysis of P-CADHERIN and F-ACTIN pixel intensity</title><p>P-CADHERIN and F-ACTIN pixel intensity was measured using Fiji (ImageJ) straight line tool and by using the function Plot Profile. Data collection was conducted using confocal images at a horizontal plane from the middle of the basal cell layer from E14.5 and E15.5 embryos stained with P-CADHERIN and F-ACTIN. A straight line across individual cell was drawn and the pixel intensity profile plotted. Pixel intensity across individual cell was normalized to account for differences in cell size by dividing each cell in 20 equal bins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantitative analysis of basal and placode cell shape dynamics, cell density and number of cell in placode</title><p>Measurements of basal cell area, placode cell area, cell eccentricity and cell density were performed using Cell Profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lamprecht et al., 2007</xref>) and their own tissue neighbors pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cellprofiler.org">www.cellprofiler.org</ext-link>). Briefly confocal images of basal cell in the epidermis were segmented on the basis of E-CADHERIN to measure basal cell area. Z-stack confocal images from placodes were acquired and orthogonal views were used to identify the apex, middle and bottom planes that were than segmented on the basis of P-CADHERIN to measure placode cells area. The number of placode cells in the middle plane was recorded. Basal cell height was measured using the Fiji straight-line tool on confocal images from E15.5 and E16.5 embryos stained with Keratin 5. Placode area was determined using confocal images and the Fiji area tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification of cell proliferation</title><p>For cell proliferation assay, pregnant female mice were injected with 5-ethynyl-2âdeoxyuridine (EDU) intraperitoneally allowing E18.5 embryos transduced with <italic>Scr or Rhou-505</italic> shRNAs to be pulsed for 3 hr. Embryos were dissected, frozen in OCT, sectioned (12 Î¼m) and processed according to the manufacturerâs instruction (Click-iT EDU Alexa Fulor 647 Imaging kit, Life Technologies, C10340). The ratio of RFP<sup>+</sup> cells (transduced cells) that are EDU<sup>+</sup> was calculated for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Barrier assay</title><p>Dye penetration assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asare et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, E17.5 and E18.5 embryos were isolated form the pregnant mother. Euthanized embryos were immersed in ice cold PBS for 30 min. Embryos were immersed in cold methanol gradient in water, taking 2 min per step (1â25%, 2â50%, 3â75%, 4â100% methanol) and rehydrated in methanol gradient in water, taking 2 min per step (1â75% methanol, 2â50% methanol, 3â25% methanol, 4â100%). Embryos were immersed in 0.1% toluidine blue solution in water on ice. Embryos were destained in PBS to reveal dye pattern and barrier properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA-Seq alignment and differential expression analysis</title><p>Embryos from the same litters were pooled and used as individual biological replicates. Total RNA was isolated from FACS purified basal epidermal cells, (see above for a description of the purification strategy) using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) per manufacturers instruction. RNA quality was determined using Agilent 21100 Bioanalyzer and all samples had a RINÂ &gt;0.8. Poly-A enrichment and library preparation using Illumina TruSeq mRNA sample preparation kit was performed by Weill Cornell Medical College Genomic Core Facility. Samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq4000 and 50 bp Single-end reads obtained. Transcripts were quantified to generate TPM and counts using Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) with Gencode M18 (mm10) used as the reference. Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with lfcThresholdÂ =Â 0 and alphaÂ =Â 0.01 contrasting <italic>shRhou</italic> and <italic>shScr.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistic and blinding</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8 (Graphpad) software and representative data are shown. All experiments were repeated at least three times. For each measurement, at least three biological replicates were used and littermates used as controls. No statistical method was used to predetermined sample size, randomization and experiment blinding was not used. Quantitative data were represented as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). Normal distribution of the data was determined using the Shapiro Wilk test. Quantitative data that followed a normal distribution were compared using either a paired or unpaired parametric two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Quantitative data that didnât meet the criteria for a normal distribution were compared using a non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Significance of <italic>P</italic> value was set atÂ &lt;0.05. Individual <italic>P</italic> values are provided in the figures. Correlation between samples was determined using Spearman correlation. Changes in distribution frequency were determined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical details for each experiment, including the statistical test used, the sample size for each experiment, the <italic>P</italic> and R<sup>2</sup> value can be found in the corresponding figure legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Rockefeller Universityâs Comparative Biology Research Center, an AAALAC-accredited animal facility, for their assistance in animal husbandry and housing for all of our mouse studies.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An RNAi Screen Unravels The Complexities of Rho GTPase Networks in Skin Morphogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study employs an in vivo shRNA pool screen on embryonic epidermis and hair follicles to identify Rho GTPase effectors that regulate skin development. After validating the approach, a customized pool of selected shRNAs targeting Rho GTPases and their regulators were selected based on the enrichment or depletion of a given shRNA over time in the developing skin indicating positive or negative selection. 3 of these hits were followed up, with <italic>RhoU</italic> being analysed in some detail. The authors show that depletion of <italic>RhoU</italic> leads to a planar cell polarity defect as well as alterations in cell shape both in the epidermis and hair follicle. The cellular mechanism appears to in part involve increased cell matrix adhesion and actin anchored at these sites, concomitant with delayed formation of cell-cell contacts and organization of cortical actin. The findings are interesting and provide new insight into actin regulation and skin biology. A number of points were identified that require addressing:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state that they used the 'most potent' shRNA of those present in the screen â but all three <italic>RhoU</italic> shRNAs tested were equally potent at reducing <italic>Rhou</italic> mRNA levels, thus the text needs altering here. Other <italic>RhoU</italic>, Trio and Fgd2 shRNAs replicate the initial hair follicle findings. This was done for two read-outs in Figure 4 only for <italic>RhoU</italic>, but not for other critical experiments that the authors spend most of the rest of the manuscript investigating i.e. effects on epidermal/keratinocyte cell shape, actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions. These results need to be repeated with another <italic>RhoU</italic> shRNA to prove that they are not off-target effects.</p><p>2) Figure 5B: what is the variability between experimental results between mice? Is each cell an individual variable in the statistical analysis? The authors should rather consider each experiment (mouse) as an independent entity for comparison, because inevitably the knockdown will vary per mouse.</p><p>3) Figure 6: Presumably PAK2 rather than PAK1 was the strongest hit in the <italic>RhoU</italic> interactome because it is more highly expressed than PAK1 (or PAK3) in the epidermal cells used for the screen. This needs to be verified. To further support the possible involvement of PAK, activation of PAK1 and PAK2 should be tested in <italic>RhoU</italic> depleted keratinocytes by western blotting for phosphorylated forms of the kinases.</p><p>4) The cell shape changes as well as the changes in focal adhesions could all be explained by altered contractility, which has also been shown to be downstream of PAK. The authors could consider staining or western blotting for phosphorylated myosin light chain to strengthen the mechanistic aspect of the manuscript.</p><p>5) The screen identified <italic>Rac1</italic> as a regulator of hair follicle morphogenesis, which is supported by hair formation defects in knockout mice. However, it also identified <italic>RhoB</italic> and <italic>Rac3</italic>, where corresponding knockout mice do not show obvious hair follicle defects. <italic>Cdc42</italic> was surprisingly not detected as an important regulator of hair follicle formation, although it is known that <italic>Cdc42</italic> knockout in keratinocytes has a significant effect on hair follicle maintenance. These discrepancies must be discussed in the context of the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50226.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state that they used the 'most potent' shRNA of those present in the screen â but all three RhoU shRNAs tested were equally potent at reducing Rhou mRNA levels, thus the text needs altering here.

We also agree that it is useful to confirm our findings with 2 independent <italic>Rhou</italic> shRNAs to verify that the observed defects are not off-target effects. In our initial manuscript, we showed that <italic>shRhou-504</italic> and <italic>shRhou-505</italic>-depleted skins have misoriented hair follicles (Figure 4A, B). Additionally, we showed that both <italic>shRhou-504</italic> and <italic>shRhou-505</italic>-transduced animals present an initial delay in epidermal barrier formation and a thinner epidermis at E18.5 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B, D). Finally, we had shown (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A) that primary keratinocytes transfected with <italic>shRhou-504</italic> behave like those transfected with <italic>shRhou-505</italic> in exhibiting clear delays in adherens junction formation. Upon examining individual cells, we observed that transfection of both <italic>shRhou-504</italic> and <italic>shRhou-505</italic> resulted in an increase in F-ACTIN stress fibers and focal adhesion size (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B-D).</p><p>However, in response to the reviewersâ suggestion, we now also add a new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 to show that in vivo, actin dynamics, adherens junctions, levels of phosphorylated myosin II light chain and importantly cell shape are also perturbed with <italic>shRhou-504,</italic> analogous to what we show in Figure 5 for <italic>shRhou-505.</italic> Additionally, we now show in a new Figure 7âfigure supplement 1Cthat similarly to the <italic>shRhou505</italic> hair pegs, the <italic>shRhou-504</italic> hair pegs are of comparable length to control hair pegs and we show in a new Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D that <italic>shRhou-504</italic> placodes have a larger area than control placodes. Altogether, these new additions round off the essential need to document clearly that the defects we see in cell shape in vivo, as well as the defects in actin dynamics, adhesion and PCP,are not the results of off target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5B: what is the variability between experimental results between mice?

The authors should rather consider each experiment (mouse) as an independent entity for comparison, because inevitably the knockdown will vary per mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this concern, although we did consider each cell to be an individual variable, it is important to point out that each transduced cell has a different integration site for the lentiviral DNA. Hence, the concern is not as great as for instance transgenic mice, and this is why we had analyzed the data on a cell by cell basis. Notably, we also always analyze embryos with comparable transduction efficiencies (â¥ 80%) in order to limit variability between mice with regards to phenotypic analyses. We now have stated this information in the revised Materials and methods of our manuscript.</p><p>That said, following the reviewersâ suggestion, we now have gone back and modified our analysis and where needed for statistical significance, added another 1-2 embryos, so that we now consider each mouse as an independent entity. The new data are now presented in Figure 5B and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B where we use each mouse as an independent entity for comparison. Gratifyingly, both the results and the conclusions are similar to those obtained when we considered each cell as an independent entity. We agree that for the reader, this strategy will simplify the issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6: Presumably PAK2 rather than PAK1 was the strongest hit in the RhoU interactome because it is more highly expressed than PAK1 (or PAK3) in the epidermal cells used for the screen. This needs to be verified. To further support the possible involvement of PAK, activation of PAK1 and PAK2 should be tested in RhoU depleted keratinocytes by western blotting for phosphorylated forms of the kinases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. Indeed PAK2 is the more robustly expressed in the epidermal progenitors! As suggested, weâve now analyzed the expression level of PAK proteins in primary epidermal keratinocyte lysates. To do so, we used a pan-PAK antibody that recognizes PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3. We now present a western blot with these data in a new Figure 6E and make this point in the text. Additionally, transcriptome profiling from primary keratinocytes (Fuchs lab RNA-seq data, unpublished data) revealed that expression of <italic>Pak2</italic> mRNA is more abundant than <italic>Pak1</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic>. We also observed using transcriptome profiling from transduced E14.5 epidermal cells that <italic>Pak2</italic> mRNA is the most highly expressed <italic>Pak</italic> gene during epidermal development. We now present these data in Figure 6E.Together our mRNA and protein expression analyses are nicely complementary.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers requested that we examine the RHOU dependency of PAK1/PAK2 phosphorylation/activation in primary keratinocytes. Weâve now added western blotting for phosphorylated forms of the PAK kinases in a gain Figure 6F and loss of RHOU function Figure 6G setting to illuminate the importance of RHOUâs interactions with PAK kinases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The cell shape changes as well as the changes in focal adhesions could all be explained by altered contractility, which has also been shown to be downstream of PAK. The authors could consider staining or western blotting for phosphorylated myosin light chain to strengthen the mechanistic aspect of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this hypothesis and agree that this could help strengthen the mechanistic aspect of our manuscript. Following this suggestion, we have now stained <italic>shScr, shRhou-504</italic> and <italic>shRhou-505</italic> -transduced embryos with antibodies against the phosphorylated myosin II light chain (pMLC2) and we show that similarly to what is observed in the gut epithelium of <italic>Rhou</italic> knockout animal, depletion of RHOU increases the level of pMLC2 We now present this data in Figure 5C and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C. We now also shown that when we overexpress RHOU in vitro in primary keratinocytes, PAK1/2 become activated and this correlated with a decrease in pMLC2, conversely when we knock down RHOU, PAK1/2 show decreased activity and this correlates with increase in focal adhesions and actomyosin (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B-D). We now present this data in Figure 6F-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The screen identified Rac1 as a regulator of hair follicle morphogenesis, which is supported by hair formation defects in knockout mice. However, it also identified RhoB and Rac3, where corresponding knockout mice do not show obvious hair follicle defects. Cdc42 was surprisingly not detected as an important regulator of hair follicle formation, although it is known that Cdc42 knockout in keratinocytes has a significant effect on hair follicle maintenance. These discrepancies must be discussed in the context of the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for raising this important point. As pointed out by the reviewers, we identified <italic>Rhob</italic> and <italic>Rac3</italic> as potent regulators of hair follicle morphogenesis, and yet both <italic>Rhob</italic> and <italic>Rac3</italic> knockout mice are viable and fertile without obvious defects during skin development (Liu et al., 2001 and Corbetta et al., 2005). We now explain in our Discussion that gene compensation mechanisms might be responsible for this discrepancy.</p><p>Intriguingly, new studies by Didier Stanierâs lab have unearthed some of the gene compensation machinery responsible for the mysterious differences in phenotypes previously observed between gene knockout and knockdown (El-Brolosy et al., 2019). Interestingly, theyâve demonstrated that these gene compensation mechanisms are triggered only in certain knockouts and not upon RNAi-mediated knockdown. This tantalizing recent discovery explains why shRNA knockdowns often reveal gene functions that were previously hidden through mechanisms of gene compensation in knockout animals. Although such probing is beyond the scope of our study here, weâve now raised this issue in our Discussion. Indeed the particular case in point seems relevant, as it was previously observed that depletion of RHOA in the skin triggers an important upregulation of RHOB (Jackson et al., 2011). Importantly, potential gene compensation by other Rho GTPases was not addressed in <italic>Rhob</italic> knockout animals and this analysis was limited in the <italic>Rac3</italic> knockout, which could explain the lack of observed phenotypes in the knockouts but not the shRNA knockdowns.</p><p>Regarding the flip side of the coin, although the reviewers are correct in that <italic>Cdc42</italic> conditional knockout in the skin leads to defects in hair follicle maintenance, these defects are only manifested after birth. This suggests that the initial stages of hair follicle morphogenesis are not affected, most likely accounting for why <italic>Cdc42</italic> did not surface in our screen. We have now modified our Introduction to indicate that pups rather than embryos are affected by <italic>Cdc42</italic> loss and more clearly state the defects that those authors observed in their conditional knockout.</p></body></sub-article></article>
