reside in all tissues of the body and play key roles in homeostasis, immunity, and disease. As immune cells, macrophages serve as sentinels of infection and injury and are active participants in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Detection of pathogens and tissue damage is mediated by a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors for pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), exemplified by the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Ligation of TLRs initiates profound changes in gene expression that include induction of chemokines, cytokines, anti-microbial peptides, and other factors that contribute to the innate immune response and influence adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ostuni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence and Natoli, 2011</xref>). This response has been extensively characterized in vitro by treating cultured macrophages with specific TLR ligands such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Escoubet-Lozach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raetz et al., 2006</xref>). TLR4 ligation regulates gene expression through signal transduction pathways culminating in the activation of latent signal-dependent transcription factors, which include members of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), interferon regulatory factor (IRF), and activator protein 1 (AP-1) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Medzhitov and Horng, 2009</xref>). In macrophages, these factors are primarily directed to macrophage-specific enhancers that are selected by macrophage lineage determining transcription factors, PU.1 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). The macrophage activation phenotype resulting from selective treatment with LPS, or in some cases a combination of LPS and interferon γ (IFNγ), is referred to as M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFNγ) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref>), and is considered vital for the host response to bacterial or viral infection.</p><p>Macrophages also play important roles in regulating the resolution phase of inflammation as well as the repair of tissue damage. These functions are controlled by complex microenvironmental pathways that include reductionist signals such as transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and interleukin 4 (IL4). TGFβ is generally considered to be an inducer of a 'de-activated' macrophage or M(TGFβ) phenotype, although it also acts as a potent chemo-attractant for monocytes and can potentiate their transition into activated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Macrophages respond to TGFβ in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. For example, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells results in increased macrophage-mediated secretion of TGFβ and subsequent inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to dampening inflammatory responses, secreted TGFβ plays key roles in accelerating wound healing and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuppan and Kim, 2013</xref>). At the transcriptional level, TGFβ signal transduction pathways function primarily in a Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD)-dependent manner through Smad2-, Smad3-, and Smad4-mediated activation, as well as Smad7-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massagué, 2012</xref>). Like other signal-dependent transcription factors, ligation of TGFβ receptors causes the localization of Smad3 to genomic loci containing lineage-determining transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of macrophage gene expression by IL4 plays roles in containment of parasitic infections and in homeostatic functions of adipose tissue. IL4 acts through the IL4 receptor to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefterova et al., 2010</xref>), which positively regulates gene expression upon binding to recognition elements in promoters and enhancers of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>). IL4 signaling regulates genes that control tissue remodeling, phagocytosis, scavenging, and the arginase pathway. The macrophage activation phenotype resulting from selective treatment with IL4 is referred to as M(IL4) and is considered vital for the role of macrophages in wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Dyken and Locksley, 2013</xref>).</p><p>While M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFNγ), M(TGFβ), and M(IL4) macrophage phenotypes are clearly distinct in vitro, they result from selective activation of specific signaling pathways by strongly polarizing ligands. In vivo, macrophages encounter diverse combinations of signals that can change over time in response to physiological or pathological processes such as tissue injury. Recent studies show that these combinations of signals can influence the transcriptional landscape of macrophages in an input-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginhoux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gosselin et al., 2014</xref>). However, how complex signals are integrated at the level of transcription and how reductionist stimuli (LPS, TGFβ, and IL4) can be used as a framework to predict how combinations of transcriptional regulators coordinate immune and tissue repair activities in complex tissue microenvironments remain largely unknown.</p><p>The Rev-erb nuclear receptor family consists of two members, Rev-erbα (also known as nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1, NR1D1) and Rev-erbβ (also known as nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 2, NR1D2) (Rev-erbs), that regulate the expression of genes involved in the control of circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preitner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2012</xref>), metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raspé et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Martelot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solt et al., 2012</xref>), and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbs et al., 2012</xref>). Rev-erbs mediate transcriptional repression through recruitment of the nuclear co-repressor (NCoR) and histone de-acetylase 3 (HDAC3) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yin and Lazar, 2005</xref>). Rev-erbs lack the carboxy-terminal (AF2) transactivation domain, which is required for recruitment of co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Durand et al., 1994</xref>). Genome-wide location analysis of Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ in macrophages revealed thousands of binding sites, the vast majority of which resided at macrophage-specific enhancer-like regions of the genome established by PU.1 and other macrophage lineage determining factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lam et al., 2013</xref>). Gain and loss of function experiments indicated that Rev-erbs function to suppress the activities of these enhancers by repressing enhancer-directed transcription. While these studies provided insights into the functional significance of enhancer transcription, the biological consequences of the actions of Rev-erbs at these distal regulatory elements were not explored.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that Rev-erbs repress the transcription and function of signal-dependent enhancers that are targets of TLR, IL4, TGFβ, and DAMP signaling. Rather than exerting a pattern of repression that reinforces a particular polarization phenotype, Rev-erbs regulate subsets of signal responsive genes that span those associated with M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFNγ), M(TGFβ), and M(IL4) phenotypes, enriching for functions associated with wound repair. Consistent with these in vitro observations, deletion of Rev-erbs from the hematopoietic lineage in vivo results in accelerated wound repair. Unexpectedly, we found that a complex tissue injury signal directs genomic binding patterns for NF-κB p65 (p65), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Fos – a member of the activator protein 1, or AP-1, family), and Smad3 that differ substantially from those observed following selective treatments with a TLR4 agonist or TGFβ. In addition, by analyzing changes in enhancer signatures, we identified Nrf2 as an additional mediator of the transcriptional response to the tissue injury signal. While these transcription factors exhibit relatively little co-localization in response to single polarizing ligands, we observe substantial co-localization and enhancer activation in response to the complex tissue injury signal, resulting in transcriptional outcomes that are qualitatively different than the sum of single polarizing signals. These observations provide insights into how combinations of signals are integrated at a transcriptional level to result in context-specific patterns of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rev-erb transcriptional activity varies according to polarizing signal</title><p>Our previous findings that Rev-erbs regulate transcription from signal-dependent enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lam et al., 2013</xref>) led us to investigate possible biological roles of Rev-erbs in influencing macrophage phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To study the phenotypic contribution of Rev-erbs to signal-dependent gene expression in macrophages, we performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of poly(A) mRNA isolated from wild-type macrophages and those deficient for both Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Rev-erb double knockout (DKO) macrophages were generated from bone marrow differentiation of Tie2-Cre Rev-erbα<sup>flox/flox</sup> Rev-erbβ<sup>flox/flox</sup> (Rev-erb DKO) mice and compared to control macrophages derived from Cre-negative littermates (WT). Deletion of Rev-erbβ exons to generate a non-functional Rev-erbβ mRNA results in marked de-repression of Rev-erbα expression and increased expression of a DNA binding domain deleted form of Rev-erbα mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sud et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Similar effects can be seen following deletion of Rev-erbα exons (corresponding to the DNA-binding domain) with respect to Rev-erbβ de-repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Reduction of targeted Rev-erb exonic mRNA averaged 90% for Rev-erbα and 80% for Rev-erbβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13024.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall impact of Rev-erb DKO on signal-dependent gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustrating the experimental approach used in defining the global transcriptional program in WT and Rev-erb DKO bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs).

Genes associated with distinct polarization states resulting from activation with single ligands but exhibiting co-expression following treatment with tissue homogenate could reflect co-expression at the single cell level or mutually exclusive expression in subpopulations. To address this question, we performed RT-Q-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from single cells maintained under control conditions or treated with tissue homogenate for 6 hr. We evaluated panels of mRNAs in triplicates corresponding to genes selectively activated by LPS or LPS+IFNγ, IL4, TGFβ, or tissue homogenate signals, as well as informative transcription factors and reference genes.

Despite exhaustive efforts, we were not successful in determining high-confidence cistromes for endogenous Rev-erbs in BMDMs. We therefore considered the genomic locations of 7889 high-confidence binding sites occupied by both Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ defined by ChIP-Seq of biotin-tagged proteins in RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lam et al., 2013</xref>). For the de-repressed genes in the Rev-erb DKO, such as <italic>Cx3cr1, Mmp9,</italic> Arg1, and <italic>Socs3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), strong Rev-erb peaks coincide with at least one nearby enhancer-like region occupied by PU.1 and/or Fos, as well as p65 and/or Smad3 (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of Rev-erb binding sites identified in RAW264.7 macrophages co-localize with binding sites for their obligate co-repressor NCoR in BMDMs, strongly suggesting that Rev-erbs occupy a similar cistrome in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).</p><p>Two observations were unexpected and noteworthy. First, a subset of enhancer-like regions occupied by Smad3 in cells treated with TGFβ were occupied by p65 in cells treated with KLA. Under conditions of stimulation with either KLA or TGFβ alone, the expectation is that these regions would be occupied by one factor, but not the other. However, in the context of tissue homogenate treatment, both factors are simultaneously bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, yellow boxes). Second, and consistent with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, tissue homogenate treatment leads to binding sites for p65 and Smad3 that are not observed following treatment with KLA or TGFβ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, blue boxes). Furthermore, many of the new binding sites for p65 co-localize with Smad3 and vice versa. Consistent with these findings at individual genomic locations, motif analysis of tissue homogenate-specific SMAD binding sites (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) using TGFβ-specific SMAD sites as the background returned an NF-κB recognition motif as the second most highly enriched motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13024.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Signal-dependent transcription factors collaborate in response to complex stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Motifs enriched in the vicinity (200 bp) of Smad3 binding sites that are specific to tissue homogenate (induced four-fold), as compared to Smad3 binding sites that are specific to TGFβ (induced four-fold) using <italic>de novo</italic> motif enrichment analysis.

We observed ~7400 p65 peaks, 5465 of which overlapped with the 39,825 peaks for Smad3 observed in TGFβ-treated cells, representing an overlap with 6% of the Smad3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In contrast, we observed 20,858 p65 peaks and 13,975 Smad3 peaks in homogenate-treated cells, with p65 co-localizing with 11,379 (82%) of the Smad3 binding sites. Therefore, the complex tissue homogenate signal drives substantial co-localization of p65 with Smad3 that is not observed following selective treatment with TGFβ. These relationships are further illustrated for two representative genes, Arg1 and <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, in which yellow shading indicates regions where tissue homogenate induced p65 binding to regions occupied by Smad3 under either TGFβ or tissue homogenate treatment, whereas blue shading indicates regions in which both p65 and Smad3 binding are selectively observed following treatment with tissue homogenate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nrf2 target genes and Nrf2 genomic binding are induced by tissue damage signals</title><p>Unexpectedly, the top enriched motif in tissue homogenate-specific SMAD sites is a binding site for NFE2L2, also known as Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). This was also the top motif recovered from motif analysis of genomic regions exhibiting a gain in H3K27ac 3 hr following stimulation with tissue homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Nrf2 is a latent basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that is activated in response to cell injury and inflammation, and regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Evaluation of RNA-seq data from both the in vivo wound model and tissue homogenate-treated macrophages revealed upregulation of numerous Nrf2 target genes, including <italic>Txn1, Sod2, Hmox1, Prdx6,</italic> and <italic>Nqo1</italic>, suggesting that Nrf2 is activated in macrophages as part of the wound response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). We therefore performed ChIP-Seq analysis for Nrf2 in macrophages before and after tissue homogenate treatment. These experiments demonstrated that tissue homogenate increased the genome-wide binding of Nrf2 at thousands of genomic locations, a substantial fraction of which were observed to overlap with the tissue homogenate-induced binding sites for p65, Fos, and Smad3 (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Tissue damage signals drive co-localization of PU.1, p65, Fos, Smad3, and Nrf2</title><p>To further explore the signal-dependent binding patterns of p65, Fos, Smad3, and Nrf2, we performed unbiased hierarchical clustering using peaks gained after stimulation with tissue homogenate or single stimuli. This analysis revealed that genomic occupancy of PU.1, Smad3, Nrf2, Fos, and p65 was most similar upon treatment of macrophages with the tissue homogenate signal, whereas patterns of transcription factor binding were more varied upon treatment of macrophages with individual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). This co-binding of transcription factors is further emphasized when comparing the overlap of the investigated transcription factors upon treatment of cells with tissue homogenate or the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f and g</xref>). This approach demonstrated co-localization of only 1.4% (893) of peaks in the vehicle state, which increased to 12.05% (7758) overlap when cells were treated with tissue homogenate. This eight-fold increase in co-localization suggests that the combination of signals present in tissue homogenate induce co-binding of multiple transcription factors to enhancers that mediate the tissue injury response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>NF-κB, Smad, Nrf2, and Rev-erb signaling pathways contribute to the integrated tissue damage response</title><p>Tissue homogenate contains a combination of DAMPs, MAMPs and other factors that have the potential to activate numerous signaling pathways. While ChIP-Seq experiments documented that tissue homogenate induces genomic binding of p65, Smad3, and Nrf2, these studies do not establish functional roles of these factors in the integrated transcriptional response. To address this question, we evaluated effects of chemical inhibitors of NF-κB, Smad3, and Nrf2 on gene expression in tissue homogenate-treated macrophages, using the IKK inhibitor VII to inhibit NF-κB activity, SB-43154 to inhibit TGFβ signaling, and glutathione to block the activation of Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a–c</xref>). These studies support the idea that each factor contributes to the integrated response to tissue homogenate. For example, activation of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> by tissue homogenate was decreased upon targeting the NF-κB, TGFβ receptor, and Nrf2 pathways, supporting the involvement of all of these pathways in the regulation of this gene. Conversely, tissue homogenate activation of other genes was more dependent on specific signal-dependent pathways. For instance, <italic>Dusp5</italic> activation was sensitive to NF-κB inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>) while <italic>Nptx1</italic> activation was unaffected by NF-κB inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>Socs3</italic> activation was sensitive to both inhibition of NF-κB and TGFβ receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a and b</xref>) and <italic>Ctla2b</italic> was selectively sensitive to inhibition of TGFβ receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Established Nrf2 target genes <italic>Txn1</italic> and <italic>Hmox1,</italic> which were also induced by tissue homogenate, were repressed by glutathione co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Finally, we investigated the ability of the Rev-erb agonist SR-9009 to influence the responses to tissue homogenate. This agonist repressed a subset of genes in tissue homogenate-treated macrophages, exemplified by <italic>Cx3cr1, Gpr84</italic>, and <italic>Pgd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>).

However, the great majority of Rev-erb binding sites in macrophages are located at cell-specific enhancers, which are selected by macrophage lineage-determining factors such as PU.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lam et al., 2013</xref>). These observations predicted that in addition to cell autonomous regulation of the circadian rhythm, Rev-erbs would also regulate a macrophage-specific program of gene expression. Here, using loss of function, transcriptomic, and epigenetic analyses, we demonstrate that Rev-erbs function to repress a network of genes associated with the response to wounding. Consistent with altered transcriptional responses observed in vitro, loss of Rev-erb expression in cells derived from the bone marrow compartment resulted in accelerated wound healing in the skin. As the Rev-erbs are deleted from all hematopoietic lineages in these experiments, further studies will be required to establish the relative contributions of macrophages and other bone marrow-derived cells to this phenotype. How this function of Rev-erbs might contribute to normal tissue homeostasis is as yet unclear. In vivo, Rev-erb expression is circadian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2012</xref>), implying that the effects on macrophage gene expression observed in the present studies are likely to vary over the course of the day. Rev-erbs may thus act in a circadian manner to regulate aspects of tissue macrophage gene expression required for the normal turnover of extracellular matrix, tissue remodeling, and wound healing.</p><p>By evaluating the consequences of Rev-erb deficiency on macrophage gene expression in response to distinct polarizing signals in vitro, we found that the consequences of loss of function of Rev-erbs were dependent on the specific polarizing signal. Consistent with this, Rev-erbs co-localize with NF-κB p65 and AP-1 family member Fos at enhancers activated by TLR ligands, and with Smad3 at enhancers activated by TGFβ. Although of interest from a mechanistic standpoint, these findings are of uncertain relevance to functions of macrophages within tissue environments, which contain a multitude of signaling molecules that are sensed simultaneously. To model the complex environment associated with acute tissue damage, we treated macrophages with a supernatant of a skin homogenate. While the specific identities and concentrations of the DAMPs, MAMPs, and other bioactive molecules in this homogenate are unknown, we provide evidence that the transcriptomic response of the macrophage to this mixture overlaps significantly with the transcriptional response observed in a skin wound, thereby validating its use. Through ChIP-Seq experiments, we demonstrate that this complex signal coordinately induces binding of NF-κB, AP-1, and Smad transcription factors. Furthermore, <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis of activated enhancers led to the unexpected discovery that the tissue damage signal also acutely activates Nrf2. This finding illustrates the utility of enhancer analysis to identify transcriptional mediators of unknown environmental factors, providing a basis for subsequent directed analysis of corresponding upstream signaling pathways. Accordingly, the use of glutathione to neutralize reactive oxygen species, thus blocking the downstream disruption of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-Cuilin 3 (Cul3) complex required for activation of Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorrini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shibata et al., 2013</xref>) provides evidence for its functional importance in the transcriptional response to the tissue damage signal. Similarly, the use of inhibitors of NF-κB and TGFβ provided corresponding support for functionally important roles of these transcription factors. Of course, there are likely to be many other signaling pathways and downstream transcription factors involved in the tissue damage response. Furthermore, Rev-erb deficiency likely modifies both basal and signal dependent transcriptional programs. To distinguish between 'prior' versus 'post-activation' roles of Rev-erbs in macrophages during wound healing may require the use of inducible Cre-expression strategies, as well as measurements of target gene expression in situ in macrophage infiltrated wounds.</p><p>Three additional observations are of particular interest. The first is that the complex signal provided by tissue homogenate induced co-expression of genes characteristic of distinct macrophage polarization states within individual cells. Second, we found that the tissue homogenate signal induced different genomic locations of p65, Fos, and Smad3 than were observed following KLA or TGFβ, respectively, resulting in co-binding at a large number of enhancer-like regions in the vicinity of tissue homogenate-induced genes. An important implication of these findings is that transcription factors binding maps are context-dependent and must be interpreted accordingly. We speculate that the observed co-localization of factors in response to the complex signal enables the appropriate integration of multiple relevant signaling components necessary for the initial acquisition of a wound repair phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Third, the present findings may have practical applications based on the development of small molecules that enhance or inhibit Rev-erb repressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solt et al., 2012</xref>). Delayed wound healing is observed in a number of pathological contexts, including in diabetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falanga, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sen et al., 2009</xref>) and in immunocompromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). In these settings, it is possible that Rev-erb antagonists could be evaluated as a means of enhancing wound repair. Alternatively, a large number of devastating and largely untreatable diseases are characterized by exaggerated tissue fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial renal fibrosis, and liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuppan and Kim, 2013</xref>). We demonstrate that a Rev-erb agonist can suppress a subset of genes that are de-repressed in the Rev-erb DKO and are regulated by the complex wound signal. Overall, our findings suggest that Rev-erbs act to repress a specific combination of genes downstream of multiple signaling pathways that collectively function in an integrated manner to promote the response to wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). It will therefore be of interest to evaluate whether defects in Rev-erb signaling are associated with these diseases and whether pharmacological modulation of Rev-erb might be of therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse bone marrow derived macrophages were obtained and cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).

Antibodies against Fos (sc-7202), Nrf2 (sc-13032x), p65 (sc-372), and PU.1 (sc-352x) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX), against Smad3 (ab28379) from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and against H3K27ac (39135) from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, for Fos, Nrf2, p65, and Smad3 ChIPs, macrophages were first cross-linked in 2 mM dissuccinimidyl glutarate (Pierce 20593, Thermo Fischer) in PBS for 30 min, followed by subsequent 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) cross-linking in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. For H3K27ac and PU.1 ChIPs, cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After cross-linking, glycine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.2625 M to quench the reaction.

Histone regions were centered on nucleosome free regions using the '–nfr' parameter. For comparisons, called peaks from different data sets were merged using the mergePeaks command. Merging of transcription factor peaks or histone regions was done using the parameter '–size given'.

Unstained and single stains were used for setting up compensations and gating. Events were first gated on forward and side scatter to determine single events, before evaluation of other fluorescent markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Monocyte enumeration from peripheral blood</title><p>Blood was collected from 16 chimeric mice per genotype into 0.5 ml K3 EDTA coated tubes. The volume of the blood was determined by pipetting and transferred to 5 ml round bottom tubes with 50 µl of Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) CountBright Absolute Counting Beads. Erythrocytes were lysed by addition of 4 ml eBioscience RBC lysis buffer with incubation at 4C for 5 mins. Cells were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was carefully removed. Cells were washed once more and resuspended in buffer containing anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 93, BioLegend) and Zombie Aqua fixable viability dye (BioLegend). After 10 min, cells were stained with the following 2X antibody cocktail: anti-mouse CD11b BD Horizon BUV395 (clone M1/70, BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD19 BD Horizon BUV737 (clone1D3, BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD115 Brilliant Violet 421 (clone AFS98, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD90.2 Brilliant Violet 785 (clone 30-H12, BioLegend), anti-mouse Ly6G FITC (clone 1A8, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD45.2 PE (clone 104, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD45.1 Alexa Fluor 647 (clone A20, BioLegend), and anti-mouse Ly6C APC/Cy7 (clone HK1.4, BioLegend). After 20 min, cells were washed, and counted on a Beckman Colter MoFlo Astrios EQ equipped with 355 nm, 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm lasers. Cells per µl were determined by following the manufacturer protocol for CountBright Absolute Counting Beads. Cells of interest were identified by excluding Zombie Aqua that fell within consecutive singlet gates using SSC and FSC. Donor derived monocytes were identified as CD45.2+, CD19-, CD90.2-, CD115+, Ly6G-, and CD11b+. Monocytes were further segregated based on expression of Ly6C. To test the dependence on hematopoietic derived expression of Rev-erb α/β on peripheral blood cell populations, we used a Welch two sample t-test using R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Wound healing studies</title><p>Wound healing studies were conducted 6–10 weeks post-transplantation. Briefly, 15.5 mL tert-amyl alcohol was added to 25 grams of 2,2,2 tribromoethanol (Sigma Aldrich Chemical) and dissolved overnight in a dark bottle to generate a stock solution. The subsequent solution was diluted with PBS, dissolved overnight, and filtered through a 0.2 µm filter to generate a working solution (20 mg/ml). To achieve anesthesia, 0.4–0.75 mg/g was administered intra-peritoneally. A 3 mm punch biopsy (Miltex, York, PA) was used to generate four wounds on the dorsal skin of each animal. Wounds were systematically photographed from a fixed distance daily. For macroscopic analysis, genotypes were blinded and the size of the wound was analyzed by Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA), and normalized to its size on Day 0. Mice were housed singularly throughout the duration of the study.</p><p>To assess the contribution of Rev-erb to wound healing, data from three independent experiments were combined and analyzed using a linear mixed effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Gil et al., 2012</xref>) using the R package 'nlme' (R script: wound model &lt;- lme('wound size' ~ 'genotype' * 'time point', random=~1 | 'independent experiment' /'independent mouse' /'nested observation', data=data.file, na.action='na.exclude'). Genotype, time point, and their interaction, were modeled as fixed effects, whereas the observations at wound sites were treated as a random effect nested within the independent mouse, which in turn was treated as a random effect nested within the independent experiment, to account for the hierarchical nature of the study design. The numbers of biologically independent mice per time point are summarized in the below table.</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Day</th><th valign="top">WT chimera</th><th valign="top">Rev-erb DKO chimera</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">29</td><td valign="top">28</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">28</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">26</td><td valign="top">25</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">21</td><td valign="top">20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">22</td><td valign="top">20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">22</td><td valign="top">20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">12</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top">20</td><td valign="top">16</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">12</td><td valign="top">9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">12</td><td valign="top">9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">12</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Histological analyses</title><p>At the indicated time points, mice were euthanized and wounds were harvested using a 6 mm punch biopsy (Miltex). Harvested wounds were cut along the mid-sagittal plane and paraffin-embedded. Genotypes were blinded for subsequent histological analyses. The first section along the mid-sagittal plane was utilized for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Subsequent sections were utilized for immunohistochemical analysis using the following primary antibodies: biotinylated anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec (now Bio-Rad), MCA4978, 1:50 dilution), IgG (Dako, Glostrup Municipality, Denmark), rat anti-Ly6B.2 (AbD Serotec (now Bio-Rad), MCA771GA, 1:200), and the following secondary antibodies: biotinylated anti-rat (1:500, BD ), as well as HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Jackson Laboratory), Briefly, slides were de-paraffinized and washed three times in 0.1% Tween-20 PBS. Blocking was performed sequentially using 3% hydrogen peroxide (10 min), 1% BSA in 0.1% Tween-20 PBS (10 min), 0.1% avidin (10 min), and 0.01% biotin (10 min). Three washes were performed between each blocking step using 0.1% Tween-20 PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed using proteinase K (Dako, S3020), followed by three washes and subsequent overnight incubation with the indicated primary antibodies. After three washes, slides were incubated with the indicated secondary antibodies for 30 min and developed using AEC Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, SK-4200) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Counterstaining was performed using Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Sigma, MHS16), after which samples were mounted in an aqueous gel mount (Vectamount, Vector Labs, H-5501).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In vitro matrigel migration assays</title><p>In vitro matrigel migration assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, macrophages were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone) for 24 hr and resuspended at a density of 1 million cells per milliliter. 100 µL of macrophages was added to the top chamber of a transwell (Corning, Corning, NY) while 650 µL of media was added to the bottom chamber. Macrophages were allowed to migrate through basement membrane extract (Corning, 3458) for 24 hr. Afterwards, the wells were briefly washed with PBS, and migrated macrophages were dissociated from the membrane and incubated with Calcein AM. Relative fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the SoftMax Pro software (485 nm excitation, 520 nm emission). A standard curve was used to convert relative fluorescence to cell numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Sequencing data</title><p>All sequencing data used in this manuscript has been submitted to GEO under the accession GSE72964.

Your article has been reviewed by two reviewers including Joachim Schultze, and the evaluation was overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Reviewing Editor and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work is an outstanding example of understanding macrophage biology in context of complex environmental signals such as those present during wound healing. The authors show that macrophages integrate their signals in a context-specific fashion and that this is mainly driven by combinatorial action of several transcription factors, something that was also recently suggested for human monocyte-derived macrophages assessing reductionist in vitro models (Schmidt et al., Cell Research, 2016). This work is a logical and important next step towards understanding of the complex regulation and integration of environmental signals following reductionist models studied so far, and demonstrating that it is absolutely essential to overcome the previous simple model of polarized macrophage activation.</p><p>There are some concerns about both the data and their physiological significance and presentation as identified below, and enthusiasm for the manuscript will be increased if they are addressed. While all new physiological experiments mentioned below are not essential, it would be appropriate for the authors to provide some data in these areas and to acknowledge these issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Instead of starting with the by now already outdated M1/M2 model, it is suggested that the authors start with the more recent model of macrophage activation, the multi-dimensional model of macrophage activation (Ginhoux et el, Nature Immunology, 2016). It would be best not to use the terms M1/M2 at all; according to a new nomenclature suggested by Murray and colleagues (Immunity, 2014), terminology would be best changed throughout the manuscript (M1 = M(IFNγ), M2 = M(IL4)). This does not take away the major message of the story but would better reflect the current thought process in explaining how signals from the tissue and complex patterns of stress signals (as modeled here by tissue homogenates) are integrated by macrophages. In this context, the manuscript could introduce the reductionist stimuli (KLA, IL4, TGFβ) as a framework and could predict that combinatorial signals such as those from tissue homogenates would lead to the identification of so far unknown combinations of transcriptional regulators, mainly transcription factors associated with particular functions of macrophages, here response to wounding. This would provide a nice illustration of how one can use reductionist models and combine them into models with high relevance in vivo.</p><p>2) Several of the RNA-seq experiments were only done at n&lt;3 replicates (as indicated in figure legends). It would be important to improve the dataset to at least n=3 for all conditions.</p><p>3) The mechanistic connections between the chromatin and transcription modification by and the functional outcome/s of Rev-erb deletion are somewhat thin. The bone marrow transfer-and-wound healing studies as they stand, while nice, do not show that it is indeed a macrophage-specific Rev-erb-deficiency that provides the accelerated wound healing phenotype since Tie2-Cre will likely mark all hematopoietic cell lineages in addition to endothelial lineage cells, nor do they rigorously establish the 'cell-autonomous' nature of the functional consequences of Rev-erb-deficiency for wound healing. Addressing these concerns definitively may require, for example, doing wound healing experiments in mixed bone marrow chimeras made with WT versus 'DKO' bone marrow mixed with macrophage-deficient strain bone marrow, and tracking relative recruitment of WT and 'DKO' macrophages (and neutrophils) post-wounding in mixed bone marrow chimeras made with WT plus 'DKO' bone marrow cells.</p><p>4) Secondly, the monocytic lineage landscape of the Rev-erb deficient mice is not characterized. This is relevant both in the context of specific macrophage 'subsets' that may contribute more or less to wound healing, and in the context of the specificity of the wound-healing functional phenotype vis-à-vis other macrophage functions. Thus, are 'patrolling' monocytes, a subset commonly claimed to contribute to wound healing, over-represented in 'DKO' cells? While the single-cell data suggest that this may not be the major explanation for the phenotype, a Rev-erb-deficiency-based modification of the differentiation-diversification of monocytic lineages would inevitably complicate the situation. Addressing this concern may require a detailed enumeration of the macrophage sub-lineages/subsets that the field currently recognizes. As for the specificity of the functional phenotype, some sense of whether (and the extent to which) other macrophage functions such as bacterial killing and cytokine/chemokine generation would help greatly.</p><p>5) Finally, since Rev-erb deficiency likely modifies the basal programs of deficient macrophages as the authors already note for some modules, distinguishing between 'prior' versus 'post-activation' roles of Rev-erb in macrophages is an essential discussion, and its elucidation may eventually well require use of inducible Cre-expression strategies (such as ERT2-Cre), and measurements of expression levels of specific target genes in WT versus 'DKO' macrophages in situ in infiltrated wounds.</p><p>6) The manuscript would further benefit from some more precision within the Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13024.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>There are some concerns about both the data and their physiological significance and presentation as identified below, and enthusiasm for the manuscript will be increased if they are addressed.

All of the heatmaps and corresponding analyses have been revised to incorporate these new experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The mechanistic connections between the chromatin and transcription modification by and the functional outcome/s of Rev-erb deletion are somewhat thin.

We gave serious consideration to the suggestion to perform mixed chimera experiments, and as described below, performed new bone marrow transplantation experiments to address other concerns. However, we were not able to devise an experimental plan using existing strains of mice that would provide a clear-cut answer to this question. The most straightforward approach would be to use alternative deleter strains to generate mice in which the Rev-erbs are selectively and/or inducibly deleted in macrophages as suggested in Point 5, below. However, even these approaches are not definitive, e.g., the conventional LysM-Cre strain also deletes genes in granulocytes, which could contribute to the wound healing phenotype, and does not delete efficiently in some of the resident macrophage populations of the skin. Our main purpose in presenting the wound phenotype was to provide a biological context for the subsequent molecular analyses of the effects of complex signals on transcription factor interactions. While we think that the wound repair findings are significant in themselves and will be of general interest, restricting or expanding the cell types involved would not alter the main conclusions of the manuscript. We therefore hope that a definitive answer to this question will not be required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. To address the Reviewer’s concerns on this point, we more clearly state in the Results and Discussion that the accelerated wound repair phenotype results from a loss of Rev-erb expression in cells derived from the bone marrow compartment and that further studies will be required to establish the relative contributions of macrophages and other bone marrow-derived cells.</p><p><italic>4) Secondly, the monocytic lineage landscape of the Rev-erb deficient mice is not characterized. This is relevant both in the context of specific macrophage 'subsets' that may contribute more or less to wound healing, and in the context of the specificity of the wound-healing functional phenotype vis-à-vis other macrophage functions. Thus, are 'patrolling' monocytes, a subset commonly claimed to contribute to wound healing, over-represented in 'DKO' cells?

As for the specificity of the functional phenotype, some sense of whether (and the extent to which) other macrophage functions such as bacterial killing and cytokine/chemokine generation would help greatly.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the important suggestion to exclude possible changes in monocyte subsets. To address this concern, we performed a new round of bone marrow transplantation using WT or DKO bone marrow to enable an extensive flow cytometry analysis of each genotype in the same background. Based on these analyses, there was no difference in the ratio of specific macrophage subsets (Ly6c<sup>high</sup> or Ly6c<sup>low</sup>) or neutrophils (neutrophils data not shown, p-value=0.5287 Welch two sample t-test) in peripheral blood WT and Rev-erb DKO bone marrow transplanted animals (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). With regards to cell autonomous functional phenotypes, we demonstrate that Rev-erb DKO macrophages exhibit enhanced migration through matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which was predicted from the upregulation of Mmp9.</p><p><italic>5) Finally, since Rev-erb deficiency likely modifies the basal programs of deficient macrophages as the authors already note for some modules, distinguishing between 'prior' versus 'post-activation' roles of Rev-erb in macrophages is an essential discussion, and its elucidation may eventually well require use of inducible Cre-expression strategies (such as ERT2-Cre), and measurements of expression levels of specific target genes in WT versus 'DKO' macrophages in situ in infiltrated wounds.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that Rev-erb deficiency likely modifies both basal and signal dependent transcriptional programs, and that to distinguish between “prior” versus “post-activation” roles of Rev-erbs in macrophages may require the use of inducible Cre-expression strategies, as well as measurements of target gene expression in situ in macrophage infiltrated wounds. This essential discussion point has now been incorporated in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
