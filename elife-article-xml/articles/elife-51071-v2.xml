extensively in the brain. However, several studies have established that mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic> confer susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, suggesting LRRK2 also controls immunity. We demonstrate that loss of LRRK2 in macrophages induces elevated basal levels of type I interferon (IFN) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and causes blunted interferon responses to mycobacterial pathogens and cytosolic nucleic acid agonists. Altered innate immune gene expression in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> knockout (KO) macrophages is driven by a combination of mitochondrial stresses, including oxidative stress from low levels of purine metabolites and DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation. Together, these defects promote mtDNA leakage into the cytosol and chronic cGAS engagement. While <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice can control <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) replication, they have exacerbated inflammation and lower ISG expression in the lungs. These results demonstrate previously unappreciated consequences of LRRK2-dependent mitochondrial defects in controlling innate immune outcomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that causes tremors, slow movements, and stiff and inflexible muscles. The symptoms are caused by the loss of cells known as neurons in a specific part of the brain that helps to regulate how the body moves.</p><p>Researchers have identified mutations in several genes that are associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s. The most common of these mutations occur in a gene called <italic>LRRK2</italic>. This gene produces a protein that has been shown to be important for maintaining cellular compartments known as mitochondria, which play a crucial role in generating energy. It remains unclear how these mutations lead to the death of neurons.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic> have also been shown to make individuals more susceptible to bacterial infections, suggesting that the protein that <italic>LRRK2</italic> codes for may help our immune system. Weindel, Bell et al. set out to understand how this protein works in immune cells called macrophages, which ‘eat’ invading bacteria and produce type I interferons, molecules that promote immune responses. Mouse cells were used to measure the ability of normal macrophages and macrophages that lack the mouse equivalent to <italic>LRRK2</italic> (referred to as <italic>Lrrk2</italic> knockout macrophages) to make type I interferons.</p><p>The experiments showed that the <italic>Lrrk2</italic> knockout macrophages made type I interferons even when they were not infected with bacteria, suggesting they are subject to stress that triggers immune responses. It was possible to correct the behavior of the <italic>Lrrk2</italic> knockout macrophages by repairing their mitochondria. When mice missing the gene equivalent to <italic>LRRK2</italic> were infected with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, they experienced more severe disease.</p><p>The protein encoded by the <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene is considered a potential target for therapies to treat Parkinson’s disease, and several drugs that inhibit this protein are being tested in clinical trials. The findings of Weindel, Bell et al. suggest that these drugs may have unintended negative effects on a patient’s ability to fight infection. This work also indicates that <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations may disrupt immune responses in the brain, where macrophage-like cells called microglia play a crucial role in maintaining healthy neurons. Future studies that examine how mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic> affect microglia may help us understand how Parkinson’s disease develops.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>cGAS</kwd><kwd>DRP1</kwd><kwd>purine biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

Indeed, other PD-associated genes, such as <italic>PARK2</italic> (Parkin), <italic>PINK1</italic>, and <italic>DJ1</italic>, all play crucial roles in mitochondrial quality control via mitophagy. LRRK2 has been implicated in mitophagy directly through interactions with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MIRO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>), and several lines of evidence support roles for LRRK2 in controlling mitochondrial network dynamics through interactions with the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, a number of different cell types, including fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients harboring mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic> exhibit defects in mitochondrial network integrity as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). In spite of these well-appreciated links, LRRK2’s contribution to mitochondrial health in cells outside of the brain remains vastly understudied.</p><p>There is mounting evidence that mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic>, as well as in other genes related to PD including <italic>PARK2</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic>, contribute to immune outcomes both in the brain and in the periphery. For example, mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic> impair NF-κB signaling pathways in iPSC-derived neurons and render rats prone to progressive neuroinflammation in response to peripheral innate immune triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López de Maturana et al., 2016</xref>), and chemical inhibition of LRRK2 attenuates inflammatory responses in microglia ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moehle et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to these strong connections between <italic>LRRK2</italic> and inflammatory responses in the brain, numerous genome-wide association studies suggest that LRRK2 is an equally important player in peripheral immune responses. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <italic>LRRK2</italic> are associated with susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, inflammatory colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Umeno et al., 2011</xref>), and Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Limbergen et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with a role for LRRK2 in pathogen defense and autoimmunity, it is abundant in many immune cells (e.g. B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages), and expression of <italic>LRRK2</italic> is induced in human macrophages treated with IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardet et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of LRRK2 reduces IL-1β secretion in response to <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> infection in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and enhances expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection at early time points of mouse infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Härtlova et al., 2018</xref>). However, the precise mechanistic contributions of LRRK2 to controlling immune responses in the periphery remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that LRRK2’s ability to influence inflammatory gene expression in macrophages is directly linked to its role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Specifically, we demonstrate that mitochondrial stress and hyper-activation of DRP1 in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages leads to the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), chronic engagement of the cGAS-dependent DNA sensing pathway, and abnormally elevated basal levels of type I IFN and ISGs. These high basal levels of type I IFN appear to completely reprogram <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages, rendering them refractory to a number of distinct innate immune stimuli, including infection with Mtb. While Mtb-infected <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice did not exhibit significant differences in bacterial burdens compared to controls, we did observe exacerbated pathology and lower expression of ISGs in the lungs at early infection timepoints. Collectively, these results demonstrate that LRRK2’s role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis is critical for proper induction of type I IFN gene expression in macrophages and for downstream inflammatory responses during in vivo infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA-seq analysis reveals that LRRK2-deficiency in macrophages results in dysregulation of the type I IFN response during Mtb infection</title><p>To begin to implicate LRRK2 in the peripheral immune response, we took an unbiased approach and asked how loss of LRRK2 impacts innate immune gene expression during Mtb infection of macrophages ex vivo. Briefly, primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) derived from littermate heterozygous (HET) and knockout (KO) <italic>Lrrk2</italic> mice were infected with Mtb at MOI of 10. RNA-seq analysis was performed on total RNA collected from uninfected and infected cells 4 hr post-infection (<italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO n = 4, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> HET n = 3). Previous studies have identified 4 hr as a key innate immune time point during Mtb infection, corresponding to the peak of transcriptional activation downstream of several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manzanillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Following analysis with CLC Genomics Workbench, we first asked whether we could detect gene expression differences in uninfected <italic>Lrrk2</italic> HET and KO macrophages. Surprisingly, we identified hundreds of genes whose expression was significantly higher in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages (blue genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Taking a closer look at the most affected genes (zoom-in, right), we noted that a number of well-characterized ISGs (e.g. <italic>Mx1</italic>, <italic>Ifit1</italic>, <italic>Irf7</italic>, <italic>Rsad2</italic>, etc.) were expressed several times higher in macrophages lackingLRRK2 (p&lt;0.05).

Mtb is a potent activator of type I IFN expression, thought to occur mostly through perturbation of the Mtb-containing phagosome and release of bacterial dsDNA into the cytosol, where it is detected by DNA sensors like cGAS, activating the STING/TBK1/IRF3 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wassermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wiens and Ernst, 2016</xref>).

Again, canonical pathway analysis identified an enrichment for immune genes whose expression was impacted by loss of LRRK2 in response to Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). RT-qPCR analysis confirmed higher baseline expression and lower induction during Mtb infection of several ISGs: <italic>Rsad2</italic>, <italic>Gbp2</italic>, <italic>Cmpk2, Stat2</italic>, and <italic>Ifit1</italic> in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; see ‘Statistical analysis’ section in Materials and methods for details regarding the statistical analysis of baseline and induced gene expression). We also measured high basal levels of <italic>Ifnb</italic> and <italic>Isg15</italic>, although the differences in induction of these genes between <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO and HET macrophages were more modest in this particular experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Increased basal expression and decreased induction of IFN and ISGs was also detected during Mtb infection in the human monocyte cell line U937 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages when <italic>Lrrk2</italic> expression was knocked down by shRNA (<italic>Lrrk2</italic> KD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Importantly, blunted expression was not observed for all immune genes; for example, loss of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> had no effect on the NFκB gene <italic>Tnfa</italic> despite the transcript being dramatically induced upon Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, expression of several non-ISG, non-immune genes was reduced in uninfected <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO BMDMs, including <italic>ApoE</italic>, which has been repeatedly linked to inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, and <italic>Ldhb</italic>, a critical metabolic gene involved in post-glycolytic energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Collectively, these transcriptome-focused analyses revealed that <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages have a high baseline IFN signature but generally fail to induce the type I IFN response to the same level as control cells when infected with Mtb. This phenotype is unusual and suggests that <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages are somehow fundamentally reprogrammed. Typically, high resting IFN levels potentiate type I IFN responses, leading to a hyperinduction of ISGs following innate immune stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">West et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages exhibit blunted type I IFN induction in response to cytosolic nucleic acid agonists</title><p>We next wanted to define the nature of the innate immune stimuli that would elicit a blunted type I IFN response in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages.

We also measured serum cytokines and found no major differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We next examined if local inflammation in the lungs was impacted by loss of LRRK2.

These results began to suggest that during Mtb infection, most of the effects of LRRK2 ablation occur at the local site of infection.</p><p>To better understand the nature of this local inflammatory phenotype, we inspected lung tissues via hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We observed significantly more inflammatory granulomatous nodules in the lungs, specifically in the perivascular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>), indicating that more macrophages had infiltrated infected lungs of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice at Day 21 post-infection. Consistent with increased inflammation, we observed more total neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs) as well as more PMNs undergoing cell death (degenerate PMNs) in the lungs of Mtb-infected <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>). These results are consistent with a recently published study that reported enhanced inflammatory innate immune responses to Mtb infection in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Härtlova et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite being repeatedly associated with susceptibility to mycobacterial infection and inflammatory disorders in genome-wide association studies, very little is known about how LRRK2 functions outside of the central nervous system. Here, we provide evidence that loss of LRRK2 in macrophages alters type I IFN and ISG expression due to elevated levels of cytosolic mtDNA and chronic cGAS signaling. During Mtb infection, loss of LRRK2 dysregulates type I IFN production and enhances local neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and cell death in the lung. These data help explain why <italic>LRRK2</italic> missense mutations are associated with exacerbated inflammation and poor disease outcomes in leprosy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fava et al., 2016</xref>). They also hint at a previously unappreciated but potentially crucial role for LRRK2 in regulating the central nervous system immune milieu in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patrick et al., 2019</xref>) via alteration of mitochondrial homeostasis in brain-resident glial cells. Our observations connect LRRK2’s role in innate immune dysregulation with its requirement for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and are consistent with numerous recent studies linking mitochondrial metabolism and energy production to immune outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angajala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bird, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are several unique aspects of the <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophage phenotype that reveal new insights into how mitochondrial stress impacts type I IFN expression and innate immune cell priming. <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages fail to activate normal levels of phospho-STAT1 following innate immune stimuli, resulting in blunted ISG induction, but this defect can be rescued by depleting mtDNA, reducing mitochondrial ROS, and deleting <italic>cGas.</italic> In this way, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages are phenotypically distinct from other cells in which mitochondrial stress and increased cytosolic mtDNA have been shown to dramatically increase phospho-STAT1, further amplifying the IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">West et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that cytosolic DNA and increased ROS— which perhaps together generate oxidized cytosolic DNA that is resistant to the exonuclease TREX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gehrke et al., 2013</xref>)—drive this unique refractory phenotype in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages. Alternatively or additionally, this phenomenon could be driven via by upregulation of one or more unidentified negative regulators of these key signaling pathways. Interestingly, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages also challenge the general paradigms of type I IFN priming. Typically, tonic or basal IFN levels are thought to ‘rev the engine’ so that cells can rapidly induce type I IFN expression after receiving a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001</xref>). Using this metaphor, although the engine is revved in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages, these cells still lose the race. Additional studies will be needed to define the molecular mechanisms driving this puzzling phenotype.</p><p>The metabolic phenotypes of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages are also unique. It is curious that they suffer from defects in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, since generally, these two energy-producing pathways compensate for each other. Defects in both pathways is indicative of a more quiescent cellular metabolic state consistent with a reduced capacity for IFNAR signaling. Importantly, treatment of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages with IFN-β neutralizing antibody was sufficient to rescue glycolysis (as measured by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)) but not OXPHOS (as measured by oxygen consumption rate (OCR)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which suggests chronic IFNAR signaling alters the glycolytic rate in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages. Rescue of the OXPHOS defect required treatment with both IFN-β neutralizing antibody and mitoTEMPO, indicating that a more complex defect drives changes to mitochondrial respiration, perhaps linked to the depolarization defect. It will be important moving forward to understand the precise molecular contributions of LRRK2 to specific aspects of mitochondrial health (e.g. energy production, morphology, fission/fusion, etc.) and to link these defects with outcomes in diverse cell types (e.g. neurons and macrophages).</p><p>We propose that dysregulation of type I IFN expression in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages is the result of two distinct cellular defects conferred by loss of LRRK2. First, in the absence of LRRK2, decreased levels of purine metabolites and urate contribute to oxidative stress, leading to damage of the mitochondrial network. This idea is supported by our experiments showing that urate and mitoTEMPO treatments could rescue defects in mitochondrial polarization and return elevated basal type I IFNs to normal in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7E–G</xref>). A recent human kinome screen identified LRRK2 as a kinase involved in dynamics of the purinosome, a cellular body composed of purine biosynthetic enzymes that assembles at or on the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, shRNA knockdown of <italic>LRRK2</italic> in HeLa cells inhibited purinosome assembly and disassembly. As purinosomes are posited to form in order to protect unstable intermediates and increase metabolic flux through the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schendel et al., 1988</xref>), we propose that the lower levels of IMP and hypoxanthine we measure in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages results from LRRK2-dependent defects in purinosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Lower levels of purine nucleotide intermediates are especially notable in the context of PD; the plasma of PD patients (both <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutant-associated and idiopathic) has been shown to contain significantly less hypoxanthine and uric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansen et al., 2009</xref>), and patients with higher plasma urate levels, despite carrying <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations, are less likely to develop PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakshi et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, urate is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic of PD, highlighting the importance of purine biosynthesis in this disease.</p><p>Second, we propose that loss of LRRK2 contributes to type I IFN dysregulation through defects associated with the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1. Previous reports have shown that LRRK2 can physically interact with DRP1 and that LRRK2 mediates mitochondrial fragmentation through DRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Overexpression of both wild type LRRK2 and the PD-associated G2019S allele of LRRK2 have been shown to cause mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Curiously, we observe a similar phenotype in macrophages lacking LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Previous studies have linked LRRK2 and LRRK2 kinase activity to DRP1 activation via phosphorylation at several sites including T595 in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su and Qi, 2013</xref>) and S616 in a neuron-like carcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esteves et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation that <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages accumulate phospho-S616 DRP1 and exhibit increased fragmentation of the mitochondrial network indicates that LRRK2 is not required for DRP1 phosphorylation or activation of mitochondrial fission in macrophages. Indeed, other kinases have been shown to phosphorylate DRP1 at S616 in other cell types, including ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kashatus et al., 2015</xref>) and CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taguchi et al., 2007</xref>). We propose that loss of LRRK2 could alter DRP1 phosphorylation indirectly through changing serine accessibility or protein-protein interactions, or by modifying other pathways that control mitochondrial turnover or lysosome homeostasis. It will be important for future studies to compare the molecular mechanisms driving the DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission defects in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO cells and in cells harboring the PD-associated ‘gain of function’ G2019S allele.</p><p>Mtb is a potent activator of cytosolic DNA sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manzanillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watson et al., 2012</xref>), and type I IFNs are important biomarkers of Mtb infection associated with poor outcomes in humans and in mouse models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2010</xref>). New insights into the requirement of IFNAR signaling for nitric oxide production in macrophages ex vivo suggest critical roles for type I IFN induction in cell-intrinsic control of Mtb replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banks et al., 2019</xref>). However, the degree to which these macrophage phenotypes translate to mouse models of infection remains poorly understood. Although we observed a striking type I IFN defect (both higher basal levels and blunted induction) in a number of macrophage primary cells and cell lines, we did not find major differences in infection outcomes in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> HET vs. KO mice. Our previous experiments demonstrated that while loss of cGAS almost completely abrogates type I IFN expression in macrophages, it has only minor effects in vivo (serum IFN-β levels and lung type I IFN/ISG expression levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watson et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that Mtb infection can elicit type I IFN expression in important cGAS-independent ways in vivo that we do not yet fully understand. Another recent publication that investigated the role of LRRK2 in controlling Mtb infection does report a significant decrease in CFUs in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice at very early infection time points (Day 7 and 14), which correlates with increased inflammation in the lungs (as we also report) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Härtlova et al., 2018</xref>). It is likely that minor discrepancies between our data and that reported by Härtlova et al. are the consequence of differences in mouse and Mtb strains and the fact that we compared <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO and HET littermate controls as opposed to WT controls. It will be crucial moving forward to more directly interrogate the molecular drivers of inflammation and Mtb pathogenesis in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice as well as in mouse genotypes associated with human disease susceptibility, for example <italic>LRRK2﻿ </italic>G2019S. Because LRRK2 inhibitors are a major area of drug development for the treatment of PD, it is crucial to understand how both loss of and mutations in this protein might impact the ability of patients receiving such therapies to respond to and clear infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Lrrk2</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Lrrk2</italic>; LRRK2</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">MGI:1913975</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mtb; Erdman</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watson et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mlep</td><td valign="top">National Hansen's Disease Program</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO; C57BL/6-<italic>Lrrk2</italic>tm1.1Mjff/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top">16121 Lrrk2 KO</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Ifnar</italic> KO; B6(Cg)-<italic>Ifnar</italic>1tm1.2Ees/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top">28288 Ifnar1 KO</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Tfam</italic> HET</td><td valign="top">obtained from A.

The Mtb inoculum was prepared as described above. Age- and sex-matched mice were infected via inhalation exposure using a Madison chamber (Glas-Col) calibrated to introduce 100–200 CFUs per mouse. For each infection, approximately five mice were euthanized immediately, and their lungs were homogenized and plated to verify an accurate inoculum. Infected mice were housed under BSL3 containment and monitored daily by lab members and veterinary staff. At the indicated time points, mice were euthanized, and tissue samples were collected. Blood was collected in serum collection tubes, allowed to clot for 1–2 hr at room temperature, and spun to separate serum. Serum cytokine analysis was performed by Eve Technologies. Organs were divided to maximize infection readouts (CFUs: left lobe lung and ½ spleen; histology: two right lung lobes and ¼ spleen; RNA: one right lung lobe and ¼ spleen). For histological analysis organs were fixed for 24 hr in either neutral buffered formalin and moved to ethanol (lung, spleen). Organs were further processed as described below. For cytokine transcript analysis, organs were homogenized in Trizol Reagent, and RNA was isolated as described below. For CFU enumeration, organs were homogenized in 5 ml PBS + 0.1% Tween-80, and serial dilutions were plated on 7H11 plates.

In the majority of experiments involving induction or infection, the independent variables were heavily skewed (i.e. the variable of Mtb infection vs. variable of genotype). Therefore to avoid a type II error, a log transformation was performed on the data prior to analysis. Data were then analyzed by two-way, or three-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test to determine significance. Experiments involving one independent variable were analyzed without a log transformation. Here significance was determined using a Student’s two-tailed T test or a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For LCM/MS MS significance was determined with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey HSD post-hoc test. A Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used for the false discovery rate. Graphs were generated using Prism (GraphPad). In order to depict baseline and induced gene expression on the same graph, we have broken the y-axis into segments where needed. Error bars represent SEM.</p><p>For mouse experiments, we estimated that detecting a significant effect requires two samples to differ in CFUs by 0.7e^10. Using a standard deviation of 0.35e^10 for each population, we calculated that a minimum size of 5 age- and sex-matched mice per group per time point is necessary to detect a statistically significant difference by a t-test with alpha (2-sided) set at 0.05 and a power of 80%. Therefore, we used a minimum of 5 mice per genotype per time point to assess infection-related readouts. For statistical comparison, each experimental group was tested for normal distribution. Data were tested using a Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We’d like to thank Cory Klemashevich at the TAMU Integrated Metabolomics Analysis Core for his help with the metabolomics analysis.

The high basal levels of type I IFNs are due to alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis and cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA, which engages the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing immune pathway. The mitochondrial and immune dysfunction in LRRK2 deficient animals may be important to consider to explain the role of LRRK2 in Parkinson's and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LRRK2 regulates innate immune responses and neuroinflammation during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Russell E Vance as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Overall we are enthusiastic about the potential importance of the work. However, some significant revisions are required. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this consolidated decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the immunological phenotype of mice lacking LRRK2, a poorly understood kinase with proposed roles in resistance to infection and in Parkinson's Disease. The authors provide evidence that loss of LRRK2 results in mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic activation of the cytosolic innate immune cGAS-STING pathway. These results have important implications in understanding the complex pathology seen in LRRK2 deficiency.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall: Significant questions were raised about the analysis and statistics in the first five figures. Nevertheless we consider the core observations in these figures to be potentially important. The last two figures of the paper attempts to connect LRRK2 deficiency and neuroinflammation during infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. For reasons outlined below, we found this part of the paper considerably less convincing. We feel the authors are overstraining to push an interpretation that is not well justified--a strategy that may be necessary for other journals, but not <italic>eLife</italic>. Overall, we feel that a reworking of the manuscript as suggested below would potentially allow for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> without a need for much substantial additional experimentation.</p><p>1) The reviewers suggest refocusing the manuscript, including the title and Abstract, on the important observation that loss of LRRK2 leads to chronic cGAS-STING activation and decreased responsiveness to IFN inducing stimuli (Figures 1-5). We suggest removing the data that attempt to establish a role for LRRK2 in Mtb infection and neuroinflammation (Figures 6,7). Our rationale is that the in vivo infection/neuroinflammation phenotypes are either absent or mild and equivocal (e.g., no role for LRRK2 in microglia reactivity, astrocyte reactivity up at one timepoint, down at another). In addition, there were concerns that the in vivo data were quantified/normalized appropriately. The in vitro microglia data (e.g., Figure 7F,H) appear to show the complete opposite of the macrophage data presented earlier in the manuscript (i.e., down instead of up in unstimulated, enhanced instead of dampened responses to stimulation). This is confusing and undermines the rest of the paper. Overall, the attempt to push the 2-hit model of neurodegeneration strikes as us forced overinterpretation. Indeed, no data on neuronal loss is shown. Moreover, the evidence that loss of LRRK2 contributes to PD risk is equivocal. Many assays, including direct assays of LRRK2 function, suggest that mutant alleles retain function. There is some direct human genetic evidence recently that loss of function alleles are present in humans but not pathogenic. If the authors wish to determine if pathogenic mutations associated with PD alter Mtb infection, they would have to use G2019S or R1441C knockin mice. Lastly, the phenotype of LRRK2 KO mice infected with Mtb has been previously reported (Hartlova et al) and the mild inflammatory phenotype seen by the present authors broadly resembles this previous report, though it is appreciated that there are some differences (e.g., no CFU or cytokine differences, unlike Hartlova). If the authors wish to 'correct the record', it might be appropriate to include the Mtb cfu/cytokine/neutrophil data (Figure S6A-C, 6A-B) as supplemental, along with a discussion of why you may have obtained different results (e.g., is this related to the use of +/- hets instead of +/+ WT mice?). However, we suggest 'saving' the neuroinflammation data for a subsequent paper when further work will allow some of the complex phenotypes to be better understood.</p><p>2) The reviewers have significant concerns about how the data were analyzed. We feel it is inappropriate, e.g., in Figure 1 but also elsewhere, to present the response of control and KO genotypes to infection (normalized to unstimulated) separately from the baseline responses of genotypes at baseline. Typically, one would compare treatment and genotype in one experiment and use a two-factor analysis. Unless there is a strong rationale for performing the experiments separately and in fact that is what was done, this figure needs reworking and p values for genotype, treatment and interaction terms generated. We feel it is not appropriate to express results as fold induction when the baseline measurements are not equivalent across conditions. This concern also affects Figures 2, 3, 4E, 5G. The authors may have chosen their convoluted presentation because the basal levels of gene expression are very low compared to the induced levels and plotting all four conditions on the same axis would minimize the differences in basal expression. This might be solvable by plotting the data on a log scale; or if that is unsatisfactory, by plotting all the data in a single graph but with an additional inset to highlight the basal differences. In general, the statistical reporting should be improved by stating which test was used in which figure, what n precisely means in each figure and please also give the value of the test statistic, particularly for parent ANOVAs where these were used. Related to the above, in panels 3B, 3I, 3J, 4E, 5G and possibly elsewhere, please indicate if the 2nd and 4th conditions are statistically different from each other (i.e., does mitoT or ddC or cGAS KO, or urate, etc., significantly enhance the ability of LRRK2 KO cells to respond to stimuli?). For the RNAseq data in Figure 1: it was very hard to understand what the n of samples is. It appears from 1A and 1C that this an n=1 experiment, based on the lack of p values in A and the single lane in the heatmaps. If so, this is simply not an appropriate experiment to report. If not, then the presentation needs to show individual values for replicates.</p><p>3) For Figure 4 and later in Figure 5, many studies have raised concerns about JC-1 because the red/green shift is dependent not just on membrane potential but also local concentration. Here, if the mitochondria show different volumes based on prior figures then this may contribute to some of the apparent effects. It is advised that JC-1 dye assays are run with CCCP controls to ensure the signal is sensitive to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Can the authors show this control data to ensure the signal changes are due to altered membrane potential. In addition, it is strongly recommended that these figures are confirmed with TMRM or TMRE, which are less prone to these artifacts.</p><p>4) Can the authors demonstrate alterations in DRP1 phosphorylation by loss-of-Lrrk2 by western blot? The authors have shown images of DRP1 puncta, however there is no quantification to ensure no changes in overall DRP1 expression. Again, this should be done via western blot. Furthermore the authors claim that DRP1 distribution is not different between genotypes but no quantification has been shown; by eye, it does indeed seem that there is decreased DRP1/TOM20 colocalisation in the Lrrk2-KO cells. As well, authors show histograms from flow data regarding DRP1-S616 levels, but this is not quantified anywhere. Furthermore, the authors report an increase in DRP1 phosphorylation via flow in Lrrk2-KO BMDCs. This is in contrast to other reports that show increased LRRK2 kinase activity increases DRP1 (doi: 10.5607/en.2018.27.3.171). Can the authors speculate how both increased kinase LRRK2 activity and loss of LRRK2 can induce the same phenotype?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51071.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall: Significant questions were raised about the analysis and statistics in the first five figures.

All our data is presented as baseline (HET/WT vs. KO) separate from treatment (HET/WT vs. KO). No data in the revised manuscript is displayed as fold-change. In the majority of experiments involving induction or infection, the 2 (or 3) independent variables were heavily skewed (i.e. the variable of Mtb infection vs. variable of genotype) Therefore in order to avoid a type II error where genotype significance was 100% dependent on the strength of the stimulation, we performed a log transformation on the data prior to analysis. Data were then analyzed by two-way, or three-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test (see Materials and methods). We have also included the p-values for all parent and post-hoc tests in an additional Supplementary file. In order to depict baseline and induced gene expression on the same graph we have used either a log10 scale or broke the y-axis into segments where warranted. We are confident that the improved analysis will fully address the reviewers’ valid concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the RNAseq data in Figure 1: it was very hard to understand what the n of samples is.

We worked extensively with Thermo Fisher to decide on the proper dye for these types of experiments and they ultimately recommended JC-1 because it has a much larger dynamic range so it is generally more appropriate to assess phenotypes that may be more subtle. In any event, we did several major experiments with TMRE and observed the same trends in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO cells that we observed with JC-1 (Figure 4, 5, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).We also added FCCP controls for JC-1 in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors demonstrate alterations in DRP1 phosphorylation by loss-of-Lrrk2 by western blot?

We performed the IF to ask whether Drp1 distribution was grossly disrupted in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages. We can qualitatively observe that Drp1 localizes to the ends of mitochondrial tubules in both genotypes. Because the mitochondrial network is so fragmented in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO macrophages, there are perhaps more Drp1 dots because there are more pieces of network for it to be tethered to and yes, maybe less DRP1/TOM20 colocalization because the TOM20-positive pieces of the mitochondria are themselves smaller. Ultimately, we decided that there were too many differences in the mitochondrial networks themselves to allow quantification of DRP1 from these images. The image in question remains in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and we do not make any claims about any quantifiable phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As well, authors show histograms from flow data regarding DRP1-S616 levels, but this is not quantified anywhere.</p></disp-quote><p>All flow data in the main figures, including DRP1-S616, is now displayed as a histogram (Figure 4A, 4C, 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, Figure 7I-J)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors report an increase in DRP1 phosphorylation via flow in Lrrk2-KO BMDCs. This is in contrast to other reports that show increased LRRK2 kinase activity increases DRP1 (doi: 10.5607/en.2018.27.3.171). Can the authors speculate how both increased kinase LRRK2 activity and loss of LRRK2 can induce the same phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We have the same questions! We speculate that while the end result of increased DRP1 phosphorylation at S616 and mitochondrial fragmentation are shared between <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> G2019S cells, the molecular mechanisms driving these phenotypes are distinct. Our lab works closely with a colleague at TAMU, Dr. Phillip West, an expert in mitochondrial biology and together we have come up with several potential explanations. There are multiple important phosphorylated residues on DRP1 (T595, S616, S656, S637) and several kinases in addition to LRRK2 have been implicated in DRP1 phosphorylation (ERK2, PKA). It is possible that loss of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of DRP1 could allow these other kinases to activate it. Likewise, loss of LRRK2 could alter DRP1-containing protein complexes, which could result in altered DRP1 activity/phosphorylation that phenotypically mirrors overactivity of the LRRK2 kinase domain. We also like the idea that in one of the genotypes, (KO or G2019S) mitophagy and/or lysosomal dynamics are altered, and the accumulation of phosphoS616-DRP1 could be due to lack of mitochondrial turnover as opposed to the direct kinase activity of LRRK2. We are exploring these possibilities in ongoing experiments and have included some of this speculation in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
