Besides sugars, the transfer of sterols is essential for corals and other sterol-auxotrophic cnidarians. Sterols are important cell components, and variants of the conserved Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) sterol transporter are vastly up-regulated in symbiotic cnidarians. Types and proportions of transferred sterols and the mechanism of their transfer, however, remain unknown. Using different pairings of symbiont strains with lines of <italic>Aiptasia</italic> anemones or <italic>Acropora</italic> corals, we observe both symbiont- and host-driven patterns of sterol transfer, revealing plasticity of sterol use and functional substitution. We propose that sterol transfer is mediated by the symbiosis-specific, non-canonical NPC2 proteins, which gradually accumulate in the symbiosome. Our data suggest that non-canonical NPCs are adapted to the symbiosome environment, including low pH, and play an important role in allowing corals to dominate nutrient-poor shallow tropical seas worldwide.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43923.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Coral reefs are the most biodiverse marine ecosystems on our planet. Their immense productivity is driven by friendly relationships, or symbioses, between microbes called algae and the corals. Related organisms, such as anemones, also rely on these close associations. The algae use energy from sunlight to make sugars, cholesterol and other molecules that they supply to their host. In exchange, the host’s cells provide homes for the algae inside specialist, acidic structures called symbiosomes.</p><p>Corals and anemones particularly need cholesterol and other ‘sterol’ molecules from the algae, because they are unable to create these building blocks themselves. In mammals, a protein known as Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) transports cholesterol out of storage structures into the main body of the cell. Corals and anemones have many different, ‘atypical’ NPC2 proteins: some are produced more during symbiosis, and these are mainly found in symbiosomes. However, it was not known what role these NPC2 proteins play during symbioses.</p><p>Here, Hambleton et al. studied the symbioses that the anemone <italic>Aiptasia</italic> and the coral <italic>Acropora</italic> create with different strains of <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic> algae. The experiments found that the strain of algae dictated the mixture of sterols inside their hosts. The hosts could flexibly use different mixes of sterols and even replace cholesterol with other types of sterols produced by the algae. Atypical NPC2 proteins accumulated over time within the symbiosome and directly bound to cholesterol and various sterols the way other NPC2 proteins normally do. Further experiments suggest that, compared to other NPC2s, atypical NPC2 proteins may be better adapted to the acidic conditions in the symbiosome. Taken together, Hambleton et al. propose that atypical NPC2 proteins may play an important role in allowing corals to thrive in environments poor in nutrients.</p><p>The first coral reefs emerged over 200 million years ago, when the Earth still only had one continent. Having built-in algae that provide the organisms with nutrients is thought to be the main driver for the formation of coral reefs and the explosion of diversity in coral species. Yet these ancient relationships are now under threat all around the world: environmental stress is causing the algae to be expelled from the corals, leading to the reefs ‘bleaching’ and starving. The more is known about the details of the symbiosis, the more we can understand how corals have evolved, and how we could help them survive the crisis that they are currently facing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aiptasia</kwd><kwd>corals</kwd><kwd>lipids</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>sea anemone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GU 1128/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guse</surname><given-names>Annika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2013-CIG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guse</surname><given-names>Annika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>724715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guse</surname><given-names>Annika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008454</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exploration Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guse</surname><given-names>Annika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LTF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Victor Arnold Shivas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001661</institution-id><institution>Universität Heidelberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guse</surname><given-names>Annika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR83</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvaskoff</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Sachsenheimer</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvaskoff</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Sachsenheimer</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diversification of a conserved cholesterol binder drives functional replacement of cholesterol with symbiont-produced sterols in corals living in nutrient-poor environments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many plants and animals cultivate symbioses with microorganisms for nutrient exchange. Cnidarians, such as reef-building corals and anemones, establish an ecologically critical endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas, 2010</xref>) (family <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaJeunesse et al., 2018</xref>). Their symbionts reside within endo/lysosomal-like organelles, termed symbiosomes, and transfer photosynthetic products to their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muscatine, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yellowlees et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to sugars that mostly provide energy, recent studies hint at the importance of the transfer of various lipids including sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crossland et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battey and Patton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Revel et al., 2016</xref>). Sterols are essential building blocks for the cell membrane and endomembrane systems, in the form of cholesterol and other sterol variants. Cnidarians are sterol auxotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gold et al., 2016</xref>) that must acquire these essential compounds from diet and/or symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goad, 1981</xref>). In line with this, non-canonical variants of the conserved cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) are among the most up-regulated genes in symbiotic <italic>Exaiptasia pallida</italic> (commonly <italic>Aiptasia</italic>) and <italic>Anemonia viridis</italic> anemones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehnert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolfowicz et al., 2016</xref>). Dinoflagellates synthesize various sterols, many of which are found in symbiotic cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Withers et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciereszko, 1989</xref>); however, the specific combinations of transferred sterols, as well as the mechanism of this transfer remain unknown. To what extent is the specific mix of transferred sterols controlled by the host, symbiont, or both – reflecting physiological relevance – and how is such selective transport achieved?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of distinct strains of <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic> symbionts with different and complex sterol compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Withers et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciereszko, 1989</xref>), and of various hosts. Besides the coral <italic>Acropora digitifera</italic>, we investigated different host lines of the symbiotic anemone <italic>Aiptasia</italic>, an emerging model system for coral-algal symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tolleter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neubauer et al., 2017</xref>). We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to semi-quantitatively profile relative sterol abundances in three compatible symbiont strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hambleton et al., 2014</xref>), and related this to sterol abundances in the coral and in three <italic>Aiptasia</italic> laboratory lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grawunder et al., 2015</xref>), with or without symbionts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). First, to validate our assay and to show that algal sterols are indeed transferred to host tissue, we determined the host sterol composition without symbionts (aposymbiotic), in symbiosis with recent dietary input (two weeks since last feeding, ‘intermediate’), and in symbiosis with essentially no dietary input (five weeks since last feeding, ‘symbiotic’). For the <italic>Aiptasia</italic> F003 host line, this revealed a gradual transition from an initial aposymbiotic, food-derived cholesterol profile to a cholesterol-reduced, algal sterol-enriched symbiotic profile that was also found in the symbiont-free eggs (and is thus present in host tissue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also compared the sterol composition of coral symbiotic polyps collected from the wild to that of their symbiont-free eggs, which again proved nearly identical sterol compositions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and unambiguously revealed symbiont-to-host tissue transfer. Taken together, this suggests that symbiont-derived sterols can functionally replace dietary cholesterol without any further chemical conversion by the host. Moreover, the sterol content of the hosts is highly plastic, and sterols are used flexibly as they become available from food and/or symbionts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43923.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transfer of symbiont-produced sterols reflects control by both host and symbiont.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-generated sterol profiles of the given organisms, with relative composition (%) of each sterol in key.

To this end, we investigated the same <italic>Aiptasia</italic> line CC7 hosting distinct symbionts (SSA01 or SSB01, see Materials and methods) with different symbiont profiles; and the same symbiont (SSB01) in two distinct host lines (CC7 and H2), as well the symbiont CCMP2466 similar to that in <italic>Acropora</italic>. We found that <italic>Aiptasia</italic> CC7 hosting <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic> strain SSA01 contained a large proportion of stigmasterol-like sterol (dark blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) when compared to campesterol (light blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the same <italic>Aiptasia</italic> line hosting strain SSB01 contained minimal stigmasterol-like derivatives compared to campesterol, as well as the unique sterol gorgosterol (light blue and pink, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), characterized by an unusual cyclopropyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciereszko, 1989</xref>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A very similar sterol profile was observed when the same symbiont (SSB01) infected the H2 host line, indicating that the host sterol profile was largely symbiont-driven. Likewise, in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> line F003 hosting both SSA01 and SSB01, the sterol proportions reflect both symbionts: a dominance of stigmasterol-like sterol (reflecting SSA01) together with gorgosterol (reflecting SSB01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also compared the sterol profile of <italic>Acropora</italic> colonies collected from the wild to that of a closely related symbiont CCMP2466 in laboratory culture and found a strong enrichment for gorgosterol and campesterol at the expense of stigmasterol-like sterols – highly reminiscent of the trend previously observed in the SSB01/CC7 and SSB01/H2 pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We thus observed two major patterns of sterol transfer in our symbiont-host combinations – one enriching for stigmasterol-like sterols (combinations SSA01/CC7 and SSA01 +SSB01/F003), and another one enriching for gorgosterol and campesterol (combinations SSB01/CC7; SSB01/H2; and CCMP2466/<italic>Acropora).</italic> This suggests that selective sterol transfer and/or accumulation by the host may occur.</p><p>Moreover, symbionts may change their sterol synthesis profile as symbiotic <italic>vs</italic>. free-living cells. To address this, we separated anemone homogenates by centrifugation into symbiont-enriched (pellet, although substantial host tissue remained, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and symbiont-depleted (supernatant) fractions, for which the sterol profiles could be directly compared to free-living symbionts cultured under similar conditions. This revealed that certain sterols were absent in symbiont-enriched pellets yet present in symbiont cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For example, stigmasterol/gorgosterol-like (dark purple) and ergost-tetrol-like sterol (light purple) are proportionally highly abundant in cultured symbionts, yet are basically absent in all pellet samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that synthesis of at least some sterols changes in residence <italic>vs</italic>. in culture, providing further support that the symbiont has a major influence on which specific composition and proportion of the sterols are transferred during symbiosis. Further, cultured symbionts exhibited some degree of plasticity of sterol profiles under various culturing conditions (e.g. SSA01 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> <italic>vs</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate possible molecular mechanisms how symbiont-hosting cells may influence sterol transfer from the symbiont, we focused on non-canonical members of the highly conserved NPC2 protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehnert et al., 2014</xref>). The current hypothesis in the field is that non-canonical NPC2s may specifically facilitate transfer of symbiont-produced sterols in cnidarian-algal symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Revel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolfowicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2017</xref>). However, NPC2s may serve other purposes, for example signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2017</xref>), and mechanistic analyses of NPC2 function are lacking. To characterize them further, we first compared the genomic complement of NPC2 homologues in symbiotic cnidarians to that of non-symbiotic metazoans, uncovering several previously unidentified homologues in the reef-building corals and other taxa (asterisks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A Bayesian tree reconstruction placed all canonical NPC2 family members (identified by three shared introns) on a large multifurcation, and all previously and newly identified non-canonical NPC2 (identified by the absence of introns due to retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2014</xref>]) to a basal position, most likely attracted by the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> outgroup NPC2s. This indicated higher sequence divergence of non-canonical NPC2s; and in line with this, they contain only around half as many residues under negative (purifying) selection (35 to 61) as canonical NPC2s and twice as many residues under positive (diversifying) selection (12 to 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our analysis also revealed that non-canonical NPC2 homologues are confined to cnidarians within the anthozoan class, as they did not appear in the earlier-branching sponge <italic>Amphimedon</italic> nor in the hydrozoans <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic> and <italic>Hydractinia echinata</italic>. Notably, the occurrence of non-canonical NPC2s appeared to correlate with symbiotic state: the symbiotic anthozoans (<italic>Aiptasia</italic>, <italic>Acropora, Montastrea</italic>) have several non-canonical NPC2 homologues (3, 3, and 2, respectively). In contrast, the non-symbiotic anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic> displays evolutionary traces of a single non-canonical NPC2, which either failed to expand or underwent higher loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43923.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Symbiotic anthozoans have expanded NPC2s with characteristics of differential adaptive evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Consensus Bayesian phylogeny of NPC2 homologues in metazoan genomes with anthozoan non-canonical (blue shading) and canonical (red shading) homologues.

As determined by qPCR and Western blotting using custom-made antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), two of the three non-canonical NPC2 homologues displayed substantially higher expression at the transcript and protein levels in symbiotic but not aposymbiotic animals (closed blue symbols; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A+B</xref>). The third non-canonical NPC2 homologue was highly expressed in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals, yet more so in symbiotic animals. Conversely, canonical NPC2s were highly expressed in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals (closed red symbols). Likewise, the non-symbiotic anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic> exhibited ubiquitously high expression of canonical NPC2 genes (open red symbols), whereas the non-canonical NPC2 gene was highly expressed only upon feeding (open blue symbols). Aposymbiotic embryos of the symbiotic coral <italic>Acropora</italic>, as well as <italic>Nematostella</italic> embryos, contained maternally provided canonical NPC2 transcripts, suggesting that these are required for development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, several canonical NPC2s in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> (XM_021046710, XM_021041174) and <italic>Nematostella</italic> (XM_001635452) may be ‘in transition’ to becoming non-canonical: they were expressed at intermediate abundances between the two groups, and they responded to symbiosis (<italic>Aiptasia</italic>) or feeding (<italic>Nematostella</italic>) (red square and triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A + 3B</xref>). Some of their intron/exon structures reflected those of the non-canonical group (red triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the non-canonical NPC2s decorated intracellular symbionts in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C + D</xref>), consistent with previous data in <italic>Anemonia viridis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2017</xref>). The NPC2 signal appears to be restricted to the symbiosome and absent from the cytoplasm of the symbiont-containing cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We noted that non-canonical NPC2s decorate some but not all symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that at any given time, symbiosomes are a dynamic group of specialized organelles. To gain further insight into the NPC2-decorated symbiosome dynamics, we measured the spatio-temporal regulation of non-canonical NPC2s in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> larvae establishing symbiosis (‘infection’) with <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic> strain SSB01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hambleton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucher et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, non-canonical NPC2 slowly decorated intracellular symbionts over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This localization ranged from weak ‘grainy’ patterns to stronger ‘halos’ around symbionts (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We quantified infection rates, symbiont load of individual larvae, and non-canonical NPC2 signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found that infection rates remained steady after removal of symbionts from the environment, whereas the proportion of larvae showing non-canonical NPC2 signal continued to increase to eventually include the majority of infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Concordantly, the proportion of symbionts within each larva surrounded by NPC2 signal also increased over time, as did the signal strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Finally, infected larvae displaying any NPC2 signal generally contained a higher symbiont load than their infected, unlabelled counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, non-canonical NPC2 is increasingly expressed and recruited to symbionts over time, suggesting that non-canonical NPC2 function becomes important primarily once symbiosomes become ‘mature’.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43923.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Non-canonical NPC2s respond to symbiosis and are spatiotemporally regulated to mature symbiosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene expression by RT-qPCR of canonical (red symbols) and non-canonical (blue symbols) NPC2s and 40S ribosomal subunit (RPS7, gray symbols).

Because of the profound effect of this drug on all cells and thus anemone physiology, severe effects are to be expected. Accordingly, we found that both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones appear to lose tissue and shorten their tentacles in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. However, symbiotic anemones showed such effects on host physiology faster than their aposymbiotic counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Moreover, symbiont density decreased in response to U18666A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

This suggests that inhibition of sterol transport affects symbiosis stability and may lead to loss of symbionts (‘bleaching’). Further, the disruption of global sterol transport compromises host tissues in all cases, emphasizing the importance of sterols in tissue homeostasis.</p><p>To test sterol-binding properties of <italic>Aiptasia</italic> NPC2, we compared the most conserved canonical NPC2 to the non-canonical NPC2 most up-regulated upon symbiosis (XM_021041171 to XM_021052404, respectively). We used lipidomics to quantify lipids bound by immunoprecipitated native or recombinant NPC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Recombinant proteins were expressed in HEK 293T cells, after which cell lysates were mixed with <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic> SSB01 homogenates at either neutral conditions (pH 7) or acidic conditions reflecting the lysosome/symbiosome (pH 5). Under both conditions, canonical and non-canonical NPC2:mCherry fusion proteins bound symbiont-produced sterols significantly above the background levels of the control, mCherry alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The relative proportions of bound sterols generally exhibited equilibrium levels with the corresponding symbiont homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To validate sterol binding by non-canonical NPC2 in vivo, we also immunoprecipitated the native non-canonical NPC2 and bound sterols directly from homogenates of symbiotic <italic>Aiptasia</italic>. Again, we detected symbiont-produced sterols above background levels, validating our heterologous system and indicating that these proteins bind sterols in vivo during symbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data indicate that, despite their evolutionary divergence, both types of <italic>Aiptasia</italic> NPC2s have the conserved function of binding sterols in lysosomal-like environments.

Whereas lumenal pH of classic lysosomes can range from 4.7 to 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), recent work indicates that mature symbiosomes in steady-state symbiosis are even more acidic (pH ~4) to promote efficient photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barott et al., 2015</xref>).

Interestingly, the patterns of extracted soluble proteins vary among NPC2s: canonical NPC2 appears in one predominant form at both pH’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, red arrowhead), whereas one of the symbiosis-responsive non-canonical NPC2s (XM_021052412; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A + B</xref>) always appears in two forms in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrowheads and asterisks). Strikingly, the pattern for the other symbiosis-specific non-canonical NPC2 (XM_021052404; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–C</xref>) is distinct between pH 7 and pH 5, with a consistently occurring additional band at higher pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, blue arrow). Although we cannot rule out that the additional bands reflect degradation products, we favor the interpretation that they most likely represent distinct glycoforms, which also occur in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). When quantifying the protein variant common to all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrowheads), we found that at pH 5, the non-canonical NPC2s were consistently more abundant in the soluble fraction than the canonical counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). For all proteins tested, the ratio of the predominant soluble protein variant at pH 7 to that at pH 5 was always &gt;1, indicating more solubility at pH 7. However, the ratio was higher for <italic>Aiptasia</italic> canonical NPC2 than for the non-canonical NPC2s, indicating that the former is relatively less soluble at pH 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, symbiosis-responsive non-canonical NPC2 appears to be more soluble/stable than canonical NPC2 at a lower pH, likely characteristic of the symbiosome. In line with this, all <italic>Aiptasia</italic> non-canonical NPC2 proteins harbored glycosylation sites and a glycine followed by a histidine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which may contribute to protein stability in acidic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rudd et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Culyba et al., 2011</xref>). However, pH-dependent protein stability is difficult to predict and functional experiments are required to determine whether such motifs (or others) play a role for the adaptation to the symbiosome or not.</p><p>In summary, our data reveal that the transfer of complex mixtures of symbiont-derived sterols is a key feature of anthozoan photosymbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), whereby the specific composition and proportion of transferred sterols appears to be under the control of both symbiont and host. While the non-canonical NPC2 sterol-binding proteins are part of the machinery transferring sterols from symbiont to host, they do not contribute to host sterol selection by differential expression or differential binding. Instead, our assays reveal the possibility of an increased tolerance to acidic conditions of non-canonical NPC2s and their late accumulation in the symbiosome, consistent with gradual enrichment upon increasing symbiosome acidification. We propose that whereas ubiquitously expressed canonical NPC2 homologues are ‘workhorses’ in sterol trafficking throughout the host, non-canonical NPC2s are spatiotemporally regulated to accumulate as the symbiosome matures, developing into a unique compartment optimized to promote the interaction and communication of the symbiotic partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This allows symbiotic cnidarians to flexibly use symbiont-produced sterols, with reef-building corals nearly fully substituting these for prey-derived cholesterol, supporting survival in nutrient-poor environments. More broadly, our findings indicate that carbon acquisition by lipid transfer, similar to other symbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keymer et al., 2017</xref>), is a major driver of coral-algal symbiotic relationships as a means to adapt to various ecological niches by efficient exploitation of limited resources.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Samples were then incubated with Hoechst 33258 at 10 µg/ml in PBT for 1 hr at RT, washed 3x with PBT for 5 min each, and then washed into PBS at 4°C overnight. PBS was replaced with 95% glycerol with 2.5 mg/ml DABCO, and the larvae were mounted for microscopy. In peptide-blocked controls, the corresponding immunogenic peptides dissolved in PBS or DMSO at 0.5 mg/ml – 1 mg/ml were added to diluted primary antibodies (XM_021052412 at 1:200 [1.5 µg/ml], XM_021052404 at 1:750 [0.6 µg/ml], and XM_021052381 at 1:200 [2 µg/ml]) and rotated at 1 hr at RT before being added to samples, which were then processed as described.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>U18666A exposure in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> and <italic>A. digitifera</italic></title><p>Symbiotic and aposymbiotic <italic>Aiptasia</italic> polyps were allowed to attach for 2 d in 6-well culture plates before exposure to U18666A (U3633, Sigma Aldrich) in DMSO at the indicated concentrations in FASW; final percentage of DMSO was &lt;0.05%. Polyps were cultured at 26°C at 12:12 L:D and photographed daily, followed by wash and drug re-addition. Symbiont density per anemone was quantified by homogenization in 200 µl ultrapure water with 0.01% SDS using a 23G needle and 1 ml syringe, after which samples were quantified for cells by visual particle counter (TC20, BioRad) and for total protein by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). <italic>Acropora</italic> polyps hosting <italic>Symbiodiniaceae</italic> SSB01 were exposed to U18666A as described, except that they were cultured in FNSW.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Confocal microscopy of NPC2 immunofluorescence was performed using a Leica SP8 system with an HC PL Apo CS2 63x/1.30 GLYC objective. Hoechst was excited at 405 nm and detected at 410–501 nm, and algal autofluorescence was excited at 633 nm and detected at 645–741 nm. In a second sequential scan, Alexa-488 (secondary antibody) was excited at 496 nm and detected at 501–541 nm. Z-stacks were collected with a step size of 0.5 µm and 3x line averaging. A zoom factor of 5 or, for whole larvae, 1.33, was used, and a pinhole of 1 Airy unit. Quantification and imaging NPC2 IF over a time-course was carried out using a Nikon Eclipse Ti epifluorescence compound microscope with a Plan Apo λ 40x objective, Sola light source, and GFP filter set. Images were captured with a Nikon DS-Qi2 with an exposure time of 1 s. Fluorescence microscopy of <italic>Aiptasia</italic> adults was carried out using a Nikon SMZ18 fluorescence stereoscope with a 0.5X objective; endogenous autofluorescence of symbiont photosynthetic antennae was visualized with a Texas Red filter set, and images were captured at magnification 15X with an Orca-Flash4.0 camera (C11440, Hamamatsu) at 300 ms exposure using Nikon Elements software and processed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Acropora</italic> polyps were photographed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolfowicz et al., 2016</xref>), and fluorescence was quantified in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) as total fluorescence in the polyp area minus adjacent background.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Statistical information</title><p>In GC/MS-based sterol profiling, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> are representatives of n = 3 (<italic>Aiptasia,</italic> SSB01) or n = 2 (<italic>Acropora</italic>, SSA01, CCMP2556) samples each, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> are representatives of n = 3 samples each, and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> are averages (<bold><italic>A</italic></bold>) and representatives (<bold><italic>B</italic></bold>) of n = 2 samples each.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers have similar concerns on some of the experimental results, especially with respect to U18666A and its specificity. One reviewer specifically asked for a control experiment with aposymbiotic anemones to verify the effects of the drug. Normally, if reviewers request further experiments, it is grounds for rejecting a paper, however, based on their positive comments in general, we are asking that you perform these experiments and submit a revised manuscript that addresses these and the other concerns raised. Both reviewers felt that these additional experiments could be accomplished in less than two months. In some cases, the comments can be addressed by adjusting the writing of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study is extremely interesting, novel, and well conducted. It investigated the role of NPC2 proteins in transporting sterols in cnidarian-algal symbioses. As cnidarians are sterol-auxotrophs, they can only get sterols from their diet or symbiotic partners. The level of detail and variety of techniques that were used is remarkable, and even more so for a study on cnidarians with relevance for coral reefs.</p><p>I have identified a few issues (and also many interesting questions that are not problematic), and I hope the authors can address at least for some of them with additional experiments.</p><p>1) The experiments with the drug U18666A are problematic. This drug induced loss of symbionts from the host anemones, tissue loss, and shortening of tentacles, which the authors interpreted as direct evidence for disruption of NPC1/2-mediated sterol transport from symbionts to host, and especially from non-canonical NPC2s (which are more highly expressed during symbiosis). However, the effects seen suggest toxicity, possibly due to unspecific effects of the high doses used together with general inhibition of sterol export throughout cnidarian tissues (and <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>, if they have NPCs).</p><p>Although NPC2s are certainly present in symbiosome-containing cells, the drug inhibits NPC1 which surely is present throughout the anemone tissues.</p><p>These issues must be addressed by looking at the effects of U18666A on aposymbiotic anemones, and ideally also by measuring sterol composition in symbiotic anemones treated with U18666A (which should display reduce abundance of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>-derived lipids).</p><p>2) It seems that the antibodies generated in this study specifically recognize three non-canonical NPC2s. Then, what antibodies were used to detect the canonical NPC2 (XM_021041171) by Western blot in Figure 4E? (if they were the same antibodies, it would question the specificity of the antibodies and interpretation of results).</p><p>General question about antibody validation: Were peptide-preabsorption controls performed for Westerns and microsopy? (If not, they must be done).</p><p>Do these antibodies recognize NPCs from <italic>Acropora</italic>?</p><p>3) The sterol composition of cnidarian tissues (which contain symbionts) was compared to that from cultured Symbiodinium. The authors have cleverly addressed potential contamination of cnidarian tissues with symbiont sterols by examining symbiont-free eggs, which receive sterols from their parent. However, while symbiotic anemones contain some sterols that are present in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> and absent in aposymbiotic anemones, they also lack many of the most abundant sterols present in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> (e.g. stigmasterol/gorgosterol-like, and ergost-tetrol-like). The authors explain these results by differential sterol transport and accumulation; however, is it also possible that <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> produces different sterols while in symbiosis, and in fact it is well established that many physiological aspects of free-living (or cultured) <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> is different from symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>. This could be easily examined by separating symbionts from whole cnidarian tissues by a slow-speed centrifugation step and comparing the lipid composition of the pelleted symbionts to the host tissue that remains in the supernatant. This technique should also be used for the experiment suggested in point (1) above. (Note: this is not an essential experiment for this paper, but it could provide very interesting information).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Guse and colleagues presents several interesting new findings related to sterol biology in cnidarian corals and anemones, without or with their endosymbionts. In agreement with prior literature they demonstrate that sterols transfer from the symbiont to the host, and further show the time course of the changing sterol composition, which varies with the degree of symbiosis. Also in agreement with a previous report, they show NPC2 localization to the symbiont membrane. In addition they compare so-called canonical NPC2 proteins with non-canonical NPC2 proteins, demonstrating several differences including a greater degree of upregulation of the non-canonical NPC2's during symbiosis (i.e. between fasted and fed cnidarians), a primary sequence difference which indicates greater acid stability for the non-canonical NPC2's, and possibly somewhat greater acid tolerance compared with the canonical NPC2's. They further use the U18666A compound, known to directly bind and inhibit the function of mammalian NPC1, and show that it causes severe morphological derangement in host animals.</p><p>While the work appears quite well done and the results are interesting, the conclusions seem to outpace the actual data.</p><p>1) There is little selectivity observed in the transfer of different sterol species between symbiont and host, yet the summarizing phrases used are that a 'unique sterol mix' is transferred to the host. I suppose you can say that the sterol composition of a dinoflagellate is different and therefore unique compared to a fasted anemone, but the summation implies selectivity and this is clearly not the case. (In fact this is in contrast to mammalian sterol transfer; for example in humans only cholesterol is transferred from the gut into the intestinal cell, while minimally different plant sterols are excluded).</p><p>2) The case for greater acid stability of the non-canonical compared to canonical NPC2's is based on the presence of one GH signature sequence in non-canonical but not NPC2's, and the purported smaller decrease in NPC2 protein content under pH5 vs. pH7 for non-canonical NPC2's than canonical NPC2's. But examination of Figures 4E and 4F shows only one non-canonical protein and two canonical NPC2's, one of which did not differ in apparent acid stability compared to the non-canonical NPC2. A direct test of several purified proteins from each class would be needed to support this conclusion. (In this regard, the mammalian NPC2 protein was shown to have higher sterol transfer activity at acidic pH than at neutral pH (Cheruku et al., 2006 J Biol Chem); functional analysis, either of sterol binding or perhaps transfer, as a function of pH would strengthen this aspect of the invesitgators' story).</p><p>3) The U18666A experiments show marked derangement of the cnidarian host by the compound (Figure 3G and 3H). The &quot;U-compound&quot; has been demonstrated to target NPC1 (again, in mammalian cells), as shown in Vance, 2010. This experiment, therefore, does not shed light on the NPC2 proteins, but rather leads to the general statement that sterols are important in tissue homeostasis (main text, sixth paragraph)., which is not surprising. It would be useful to have more information on NPC1 proteins in these organisms, e.g. is a similar upregulation seen upon initiation of symbiosis? As it stands, the U compound experiment does not provide much information.</p><p>4) The conclusion that the sterol harvesting machinery (NPC2 and NPC1, presumably) are &quot;key to symbiosis&quot; (Abstract) is not well supported, as no experiment directly addressed this point, rather the results are generally correlative.</p><p>Overall this is a well done study with several interesting confirmatory and novel findings, but the major conclusions drawn do not seem sufficiently well supported by the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43923.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have identified a few issues (and also many interesting questions that are not problematic), and I hope the authors can address at least for some of them with additional experiments.</p><p>1) The experiments with the drug U18666A are problematic.

Because of this profound effect on animal physiology, again as the reviewer rightfully points out, some toxicity effects are to be expected. However, the question remains of whether symbiotic animals (which presumably have, due to the symbionts, higher levels of active sterol transfer when compared to non-symbiotic anemones) respond more drastically to this drug and whether this effect can be distinguished from the drug´s overall effects.</p><p>To specifically address this, we have now repeated and extended the experiment according to the reviewer’s suggestion by including more time-points, as well as comparable aposymbiotic anemones as controls (for more details, see the updated Materials and methods, subsections “U18666A exposure in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> and <italic>A. digitifera</italic>” and “Statistical information”). Please also note that for the new experiments, we used two U18666A concentrations (0.2 and 0.4 µM), which differ from the previously used ones (0.2, 1 and 2 µM). The reason for reducing the concentration is that this time we used smaller animals and in a preceding pilot experiment, we found 0.2 and 0.4 µM to be suitable to maintain anemones this size for 10-14 days in a state not too physically detrimental.</p><p>We find that indeed at both concentrations tested, symbiotic anemones show more rapidly tentacle retraction and shrinkage than their aposymbiotic counterparts (new Figure 3G and new Figure 3—figure supplement 6). Accordingly, quantification of symbiont density as number of symbionts per µg host tissue suggests that over a time-period of 10 days, symbionts get lost in a dose-dependent manner (new Figure 3H). (please note that quantification of symbiont density is somewhat difficult because of the natural variability in symbiont densities in anemones). Together, this suggests that inhibition of sterol egress from lysosomes impairs symbiosis stability and thus may lead to symbiont loss. Understanding the mechanistic details of this phenomenon will be an important endeavor for the future. We hope that we have addressed the reviewer´s concern with this additional experiment.</p><p>We have further clarified the manuscript text to reflect this assessment (please see Results and Discussion, sixth paragraph). In addition to the updated Figure 3 and new Figure 3—figure supplement 6, we have moved the accompanying coral experiments to Figure 3—figure supplement 7 and updated the corresponding figure legends.</p><p>Finally, we would also like to mention that while we thought the suggestion raised is an interesting idea, we did not attempt to measure whether the sterol composition in the host tissue of symbiotic anemones changes upon drug addition, mostly because we feel that measurable changes in sterol proportions may be technically difficult to determine. Our GC-MS analysis here is not per se quantitative and is not sensitive enough to pick up small quantitative changes in sterol abundance, hence our use for comparative abundances. To address this interesting point, we would need to precisely develop new and more sensitive and highly quantitative assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It seems that the antibodies generated in this study specifically recognize three non-canonical NPC2s. Then, what antibodies were used to detect the canonical NPC2 (XM_021041171) by Western blot in Figure 4E? (if they were the same antibodies, it would question the specificity of the antibodies and interpretation of results).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed we generated antibodies that specifically recognize the three endogenous, non-canonical NPC2s via Western blot using <italic>Aiptasia</italic> extracts (Figure 3B and new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). However, for Figure 4E, we express <italic>Aiptasia</italic> NPC2s recombinantly in mammalian cell culture, and the detection of all NPC2 proteins in Figure 4E uses an anti-mCherry antibody that recognizes the same C-terminal mCherry-tag on every expressed NPC2 (Materials and methods, subsection “Immunoprecipitation-lipidomics of NPC2-sterol binding”). To clarify, we have now added this information in the legend for Figure 4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General question about antibody validation: Were peptide-preabsorption controls performed for Westerns and microsopy? (If not, they must be done).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now included a new supplementary figure entirely dedicated to validating our distinct NPC2 antibodies (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The protein sequences of the non-canonical NPC2s are relatively conserved, and we therefore chose peptide antigens based on the C-terminal regions, which substantially differ. We included an alignment of the NPC2 proteins and indicated the regions that were chosen as antigens aiming for maximal sequence diversity (A). Next, we used dot blot analysis to show that the antibodies do not show any cross-reactivity for the distinct peptides, supporting their specificity for individual NPC2 proteins (B). We further validated this using whole anemone extract and Western blotting as well as using IF: we find that peptide pre-absorption blocks NPC2 detection effectively for all three antibodies in both methods (C+D).</p><p>We have added a reference to this new figure supplement in the manuscript (Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph) along with the new corresponding figure legend, and we have added the corresponding information to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do these antibodies recognize NPCs from Acropora?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tried this experimentally but we do not expect that our antibodies would recognize <italic>Acropora</italic> NPC2 because of their sequence diversity. Specifically, none of the antibody epitopes have more than 3 of 15 residues in common with any <italic>Acropora</italic> NPC2s, making interspecies cross-reactivity unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The sterol composition of cnidarian tissues (which contain symbionts) was compared to that from cultured Symbiodinium. The authors have cleverly addressed potential contamination of cnidarian tissues with symbiont sterols by examining symbiont-free eggs, which receive sterols from their parent. However, while symbiotic anemones contain some sterols that are present in Symbiodinum and absent in aposymbiotic anemones, they also lack many of the most abundant sterols present in Symbiodinium (e.g. stigmasterol/gorgosterol-like, and ergost-tetrol-like). The authors explain these results by differential sterol transport and accumulation; however, is it also possible that Symbiodinium produces different sterols while in symbiosis, and in fact it is well established that many physiological aspects of free-living (or cultured) Symbiodinium is different from symbiotic Symbiodinium. This could be easily examined by separating symbionts from whole cnidarian tissues by a slow-speed centrifugation step and comparing the lipid composition of the pelleted symbionts to the host tissue that remains in the supernatant. This technique should also be used for the experiment suggested in point (1) above. (Note: this is not an essential experiment for this paper, but it could provide very interesting information).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer: it is entirely possible that <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> produces distinct mixes of sterol depending on its life style: free-living or as a symbiont inside the host. To specifically test this possibility, we have performed the experiment as suggested by the reviewer, wherein symbiotic anemone homogenates were separated by centrifugation and the symbiont-containing pellets were compared to symbionts in culture via our GC/MS sterol profiling analysis (for the updated Materials and methods). Please note that we attempted pilot experiments to test the best method for such centrifugal separation, with the best parameters then used for the new experiment now in the manuscript. However, the symbiont-containing pellets still did contain a substantial amount of anemone host tissue, which we did our best to quantify in both number and% contribution to each sample (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>Notably, we found evidence in these experiments to indicate that indeed, the symbionts may be changing the abundance/synthesis of their sterols while in residence in anemones. As the reviewer points out, the ergost-tetrol-like sterol (light purple) is abundant in free-living symbionts in culture but not found (no peak in the GC/MS data, sterol contribution 0%) in the symbiont-containing pellets (new Figure 1C and new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). We reasoned that if the symbionts were not changing their sterol profiles from free-living to symbiotic, this sterol would almost certainly be detected in the symbiont-containing pellets especially considering its relative abundance to stigmasterol/gorgosterol-like (dark purple), which is present in the symbiont-containing pellets (albeit also in a very small proportion that could suggest that it too may change upon symbiosis). Overall, the technical limitations of such a separation approach prevent us from drawing too many specific conclusions as to exactly which sterols and precisely to what extent are differentially present/synthesized in symbionts in culture vs. in residence. However, we conclude that these experiments demonstrate that this occurs to at least some extent.</p><p>Because of these interesting additions to the GC/MS data, we have amended the manuscript text to include this new experiment (Results and Discussion, third paragraph) in addition to the above-mentioned addition to the Materials and methods section, the accompanying new Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and the new corresponding figure legends. Of course, we welcome any additional comments or discussion from the reviewers and editors and, seeing as how this new experiment accompanies new text, we are open to further edits on these new portions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Guse and colleagues presents several interesting new findings related to sterol biology in cnidarian corals and anemones, without or with their endosymbionts. In agreement with prior literature they demonstrate that sterols transfer from the symbiont to the host, and further show the time course of the changing sterol composition, which varies with the degree of symbiosis. Also in agreement with a previous report, they show NPC2 localization to the symbiont membrane. In addition they compare so-called canonical NPC2 proteins with non-canonical NPC2 proteins, demonstrating several differences including a greater degree of upregulation of the non-canonical NPC2's during symbiosis (i.e. between fasted and fed cnidarians), a primary sequence difference which indicates greater acid stability for the non-canonical NPC2's, and possibly somewhat greater acid tolerance compared with the canonical NPC2's. They further use the U18666A compound, known to directly bind and inhibit the function of mammalian NPC1, and show that it causes severe morphological derangement in host animals.</p><p>While the work appears quite well done and the results are interesting, the conclusions seem to outpace the actual data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the assessment and very helpful comments. We now aimed to better match our conclusions with the actual data to address the reviewer´s overall concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is little selectivity observed in the transfer of different sterol species between symbiont and host, yet the summarizing phrases used are that a 'unique sterol mix' is transferred to the host. I suppose you can say that the sterol composition of a dinoflagellate is different and therefore unique compared to a fasted anemone, but the summation implies selectivity and this is clearly not the case. (In fact this is in contrast to mammalian sterol transfer; for example in humans only cholesterol is transferred from the gut into the intestinal cell, while minimally different plant sterols are excluded).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer´s assessment that the phrase ‘a unique sterol mix is transferred’ may be misleading when compared to the situation described above for intestinal cells in mammals. However, as the reviewer points out, the sterol composition in free-living symbionts differs from the sterol mix recovered from anemones and their eggs. This difference may have various reasons: the symbiont only transfers a subset, the host specifically accumulates certain sterols, the symbiont changes the composition of its produced and thus transferred sterols upon entering symbiosis. Alternatively, the host may convert transferred sterols into the most suitable for the host. However, the latter seem unlikely to be the dominant mode because our mix and match experiments demonstrate that the host composition is a direct response of the housed symbiont and thus differs for distinct symbionts.</p><p>We conclude that the host has the ability to flexibly use distinct sterol mixes, thereby adapting to their symbionts. Further, our results show that corals appear to be capable of living basically without cholesterol, further supporting the flexibility and adaptability of symbiotic cnidarians, especially in comparison with e.g. mammals that selectively take up cholesterol and reject minimally different plant sterols, as the reviewer mentions above.</p><p>To date we can only speculate about the underlying mechanism, and we agree with the reviewer that we should avoid phrases such as “a unique sterol mix is transferred” because this implies an active, selective mechanism for which we currently don’t have sufficient data. We have therefore now changed the manuscript and used more open and thus hopefully appropriate phrases without diminishing our findings (please see Abstract and Results and Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The case for greater acid stability of the non-canonical compared to canonical NPC2's is based on the presence of one GH signature sequence in non-canonical but not NPC2's, and the purported smaller decrease in NPC2 protein content under pH5 vs. pH7 for non-canonical NPC2's than canonical NPC2's. But examination of Figures 4E and 4F shows only one non-canonical protein and two canonical NPC2's, one of which did not differ in apparent acid stability compared to the non-canonical NPC2. A direct test of several purified proteins from each class would be needed to support this conclusion. (In this regard, the mammalian NPC2 protein was shown to have higher sterol transfer activity at acidic pH than at neutral pH (Cheruku et al., 2006 J Biol Chem); functional analysis, either of sterol binding or perhaps transfer, as a function of pH would strengthen this aspect of the invesitgators' story).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer´s critical assessment. A more comprehensive analysis is required to determine the specific biological function(s) of the non-canonical NPC2 in symbiosis when compared to canonical NPC2 and among each other. Nevertheless, we find that <italic>two</italic> non-canonical NPC2s show a higher acid-tolerance when compared to <italic>one</italic> canonical NPC2. The result is only significant for one of the proteins tested, but the trend holds for both (Figure 4F). The tested canonical NPC2 is by far the most abundant among its canonical counterparts in the organism (Figure 3A), and the two tested non-canonical NPC2s are the highest up-regulated of their counterparts in symbiosis (Figure 3A) suggesting that these proteins play important roles. However, we agree that purified proteins would indeed be ideal to fully test all canonical and non-canonical NPC2s directly. We are indeed working towards that goal; however, it has proven difficult so far to express the proteins of interest in bacteria and/or insect cells after multiple attempts in both systems, and the yield from expression in mammalian cells was too low to establish fully-controlled in vitro biochemical assays testing for protein stability, sterol binding and transfer activity.</p><p>To our knowledge and after consultation with colleagues in molecular dynamics and modeling, pH stability of proteins is difficult to predict based on pure sequence analysis and always has to be combined with experimental data. The presence of additional Histidines may be an indication for higher stability at low pH but is for sure not a proof.</p><p>It was neither our goal to imply that enhanced stability under low pH is the <italic>only</italic> potential function for the non-canonical NPC2s nor that the identified GH-motif is the one and only reason for our experimental findings. Therefore, and in agreement with the reviewer´s criticism, we have now changed the text in the manuscript to avoid over-simplification and generalization on this topic (please see Abstract, Results and Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The U18666A experiments show marked derangement of the cnidarian host by the compound (Figure 3G and 3H). The &quot;U-compound&quot; has been demonstrated to target NPC1 (again, in mammalian cells), as shown in Vance, 2010. This experiment, therefore, does not shed light on the NPC2 proteins, but rather leads to the general statement that sterols are important in tissue homeostasis (main text, sixth paragraph)., which is not surprising. It would be useful to have more information on NPC1 proteins in these organisms, e.g. is a similar upregulation seen upon initiation of symbiosis? As it stands, the U compound experiment does not provide much information.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the U18666A experiment does not shed any light on the function of NPC2 proteins specifically, but rather confirms an indeed not-too-surprising effect on general tissue homeostasis due to impaired sterol transfer in all cells throughout the organism. Indeed we found a single NPC1 gene in Aiptasia that is overall highly expressed but <underline>not</underline> upregulated in symbiosis. However, it may be speculated that symbiosomes are hotspots of sterol transfer where sterols are transported from the symbiont via the symbiosome lumen and NPC1 into the cytosol are more drastically affected by the addition of U18666A than lysosomes in cells that do not contain symbionts. For example, blocked egress of symbiont-derived sterols from the symbiosome lumen may lead to an accumulation of sterols within the symbiosome. This accumulation may be unhealthy for the cell which may in turn lead to symbiont loss (similar to a lysosomal storage disease phenotype in mammals).</p><p>To address these concerns by both reviewers, we repeated the U18666A experiment using both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones in order to determine whether any differences in response could relate to symbiosis. In line with this hypothesis, we now find that symbiotic anemones are indeed more severely affected by U18666A than their aposymbiotic counterparts (new Figure 3G and H and Figure 3—figure supplement 6) suggesting that inhibiting sterol egress via NPC1 affects symbiosis stability.</p><p>This being said, we fully agree with the reviewer´s opinion, and we have changed the manuscript text to avoid implying insights into the function of non-canonical NPC2 proteins but rather clearly state the potential caveats of using this drug. Please see the explanation we provide above in our response to point #1 from reviewer #2. Our changes to the main text are found in the sixth paragraph of the Results and Discussion. In addition to the updated Figure 3 and new Figure 3—figure supplement 6, we have moved the accompanying coral experiments to Figure 3—figure supplement 7 and updated figure legends and Materials and methods sections (subsections “U18666A exposure in <italic>Aiptasia</italic> and <italic>A. digitifera</italic>” and “Statistical information”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion that the sterol harvesting machinery (NPC2 and NPC1, presumably) are &quot;key to symbiosis&quot; (Abstract) is not well supported, as no experiment directly addressed this point, rather the results are generally correlative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and changed the specific phrase, as well as a few other phrases that may be misleading, in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall this is a well done study with several interesting confirmatory and novel findings, but the major conclusions drawn do not seem sufficiently well supported by the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we thank the reviewer for the overall positive assessment and hope that we have addressed the reviewer´s concerns by changing the manuscript in a satisfying way.</p></body></sub-article></article>
