Currently-available therapies are ineffective in curing chronic HBV infection. HBV and its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) infect hepatocytes via binding of the preS1 domain of its large envelope protein to sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). Here, we developed novel human monoclonal antibodies that block the engagement of preS1 with NTCP and neutralize HBV and HDV with high potency. One antibody, 2H5-A14, functions at picomolar level and exhibited neutralization-activity-mediated prophylactic effects. It also acts therapeutically by eliciting antibody-Fc-dependent immunological effector functions that impose durable suppression of viral infection in HBV-infected mice, resulting in reductions in the levels of the small envelope antigen and viral DNA, with no emergence of escape mutants. Our results illustrate a novel antibody-Fc-dependent approach for HBV treatment and suggest 2H5-A14 as a novel clinical candidate for HBV prevention and treatment of chronic HBV infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HBV</kwd><kwd>NTCP</kwd><kwd>preS1</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>Fc receptor</kwd><kwd>effector function</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB837600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sui</surname><given-names>Jianhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005081</institution-id><institution>Beijing Council of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wenhui</given-names></name><name><surname>Sui</surname><given-names>Jianhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSFC81525018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wenhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB849600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wenhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Major National Science and Technology Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013ZX09509102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wenhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel and potent receptor-binding-blockage human neutralizing antibody prevents HBV infection, and suppresses HBV infection therapeutically in HBV-infected mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects more people than does Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). Despite the fact that there is an effective prophylactic HBV vaccine, 240 million people are chronically infected. HBV carriers are at high risk of developing severe liver diseases ranging from chronic hepatic insufficiency to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schweitzer et al., 2015</xref>). Current therapies are inadequate for treating chronic HBV infection. For example, the immune-modulatory interferon alpha therapies have a curative effect in a small portion of patients; nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) therapies can suppress viral replication but hardly achieve sustained virological control after treatment withdrawal and are non-curative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lok et al., 2016</xref>). An additional problem involves co-infection with Hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is a satellite virus that propagates only in the presence of HBV. Approximately 15 million of HBV carriers are co-infected with HDV, which accelerates disease progression and exacerbates disease severity. No effective therapies are currently available for HBV patients co-infected with HDV, and there are no anti-viral therapies that specifically target HDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rizzetto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>HBV is a small enveloped DNA virus with a relaxed circular genome. Upon entering hepatocytes, HBV covalent closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is generated in the nucleus of infected cells, and this cccDNA serves as both the intermediate for viral replication and as a viral persistence reservoir. It is believed that curing chronic hepatitis B (CHB) would require either elimination or permanently silencing of the cccDNA from hepatocytes and/or elimination of the infected hepatocytes carrying cccDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seeger and Mason, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Block et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gane, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Immunotherapies based on human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have achieved remarkable clinical success in treating multiple cancers and various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. More recent efforts have shown that chronic viral infectious diseases can be treated via mAb-based immunotherapy; studies have reported promising clinical outcomes using a mAb with broad and potent activity in neutralizing HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schoofs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), in addition to their capacity to specifically block viral entry via Fab (fragment of antigen binding) recognition of virus, have been found to exert a variety of immunological âeffectorâ functions, including clearance of circulatory viruses as well as by mediating cytotoxic killing or phagocytosis of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiLillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bournazos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hessell et al., 2007</xref>), or even possibly triggering sustained host immune responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schoofs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pelegrin et al., 2015</xref>). For example, just as with cancer cells, virus-infected cells can be eliminated by antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) through interaction of the Fc (fragment crystallizable domain) of an antibody with its cognate FcÎ³ receptors (FcÎ³Rs) expressed on immune cells. Therefore, although the results from other immune-based therapies in treating HBV have so far been disappointing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), novel nAb-based immunotherapy may represent a new modality for curing chronic HBV infection.</p><p>Infection of HBV is mediated by HBV envelop proteins, which are the main target of neutralizing antibodies. No structural data are available for these multi-transmembrane proteins. The large (L) envelope protein of HBV has a preS1 domain at the N-terminal end of S domain and plays a pivotal role in HBV and HDV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Seyec et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanchet and Sureau, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We discovered that the preS1 domain of the L protein specifically binds to the liver bile acid transporter sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) in hepatocytes and thusly mediates viral entry of HBV and HDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li, 2015</xref>). Given this key functional role, the preS1 domain containing the NTCP-binding site is an attractive target for developing nAbs against HBV and HDV infection.</p><p>In the present study, we took advantage of a large non-immune phage display human antibody library and our human NTCP-enabled HBV cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2016</xref>) to identify a panel of nAbs that specifically target the preS1 domain. One of the lead nAbs, 2H5, showed strong neutralizing ability against both HDV and HBV. We used crystallographic studies to identify the 2H5 epitope, and sequence analysis predicted that this epitope is highly conserved in eight of the ten HBV genotypes. Neutralization-oriented optimization of the lead nAb by antibody engineering resulted in a more potent anti-preS1 nAb, 2H5-A14, with picomolar neutralizing activity against the major epidemic genotypes of HBV (B, C, and D). Importantly, 2H5-A14 demonstrated ADCC activity through natural killer (NK) cells and through macrophages, and ADCP activity through macrophages in vitro. In animal studies, the prophylactic use of 2H5-A14 resulted in full protection of humanized mice from HDV and HBV infection. Moreover, 2H5-A14 greatly reduced HBV infection in a treatment mouse model. Studies with 2H5-A14 Fc mutant in the animals revealed that Fc-mediated immune effector functions are largely responsible for the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a human nAb against the preS1 domain of the HBV L protein and structural analysis of the antigen-antibody complex</title><p>To identify nAbs that block viral infection, we used preS1 peptides derived from the preS1 domain of the HBV L protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) as targets to select against a large non-immune phage display antibody library. By employing HepG2-hNTCP cell-based in vitro HBV infection systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), we identified six nAbs that were effective in neutralizaling HBV, but each differed in its potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Epitope mapping by direct binding and competition ELISA assays showed that these nAbs recognized four unique epitopes, represented by #71, 2H5, m1Q and #15, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2AâC</xref>). The neutralization potency of these nAbs correlated with the location of their epitopes in relation to the receptor binding site (RBS) in preS1. The epitopes of 2H5 and m1Q are more closer to the C-terminus of RBS, and showed more potent neutralization activity compared to the other two nAbs, including #71, with its epitope close to the N-terminus of RBS that only recognizes non-myristoylated preS1 peptides, and #15, with its epitope distant from the C-terminus of RBS, although all four of these nAbs had similar preS1 binding activity. 2H5 and m1Q were also able to neutralize HDV infection in HepG2-hNTCP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As 2H5 was slightly more potent in neutralizing HBV and HDV than m1Q, we selected 2H5 for further characterization and optimization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26738.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification, in vivo activity verification, and structural characterization of 2H5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neutralization of HBV (genotype D) infection in the HepG2-hNTCP stable cell line by anti-preS1 Abs.

A wild-type synthesized 16-mer preS1 peptide could efficiently compete with the full-length preS1 peptide for binding to 2H5. However, three 16-mer variants of the preS1 peptide that had a key residue (Asp<sup>20</sup>, Pro<sup>21</sup>, or Phe<sup>23</sup>) mutated to alanine failed to compete the full-length preS1 peptide for binding to 2H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Further, alanine substitution of preS1 Leu<sup>19</sup>, which is immediately adjacent to the 8-residue region of the 59C peptide, also reduced binding competition activity, indicating that this residue is involved in preS1-2H5 binding. Of note, sequence alignment showed that 2H5 epitope is highly conserved among HBV genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that 2H5 can potentially provide broad protection against the vast majority of HBV genotypes. Although residue 24 in the 2H5 epitope is variable among different HBV genotypes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Gly<sup>24</sup> in genotypes A and C; Lys<sup>24</sup> or Arg<sup>24</sup> in all other genotypes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), G24R mutation of the preS1 peptide had no effect on binding to 2H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>), consistent with our observation from the complex structure that Gly<sup>24</sup> does not make direct contact with 2H5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of a more potent nAb, 2H5-A14</title><p>To evaluate the neutralization activity of 2H5 in vivo, we employed a de novo HDV infection mouse model that we recently established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2015</xref>) in which the transgenic expression of human NTCP (<italic>hNTCP</italic>-Tg) in C57BL/6 mouse liver supports acute HDV infection mediated by HBV envelope proteins. Using this model, prophylactic administration of 2H5 IgG1 (1 hr before HDV viral challenge) resulted in a more than one log reduction of the viral titer in mouse livers as compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Nevertheless, 2H5 treatment was not able to completely block HDV infection in mouse livers, even at a 20 mg/kg dose. Thus, increasing the neutralization activity of 2H5 while preserving its conserved epitope were needed to yield a potent and broadly-neutralizing antibody with improved in vivo efficacy.</p><p>To this end, we employed various antibody engineering approaches including chain shuffling, structure-guided design, and CDR-focused mutagenesis. The VH chain shuffling approach was most fruitful in identifying improved anti-preS1 nAbs. VH chain shuffling by fixing the variable light (VL) chain of 2H5 and pairing it with a repertoire of naturally-occurring variable heavy (VH) genes (~1Ã10<sup>10</sup>) led to the identification of 16 Abs with higher binding affinity. HBV and HDV neutralizing assays were then performed to rank the neutralizing ability of these 16 Abs relative to that of 2H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The viral neutralization activities of the 11 out of the 16 Abs were then further confirmed in their human IgG1 form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). ELISA assays revealed that the four top (2H5-31, 2H5-32, 2H5-A14, and 2H5-A21) nAbs had about 100-fold improvement in binding activity relative to 2H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Further neutralization assays revealed that, relative to 2H5, these four nAbs all had about 20-fold increases in neutralizing activity against HBV and about 100-fold increases against HDV, and their HBV neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> values were all lower than 50 pM under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2BâC</xref>). Subsequent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments with the four nAbs revealed good thermostability of 2H5-A14. It is noteworthy that the major amino acid sequence differences of the four nAbs and 2H5 are in their HCDR3 loops, particularly 2H5-A14 only differs from 2H5-31 and 2H5-A21 in its HCDR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2H5-A14 is a potent and broadly-neutralizing nAb against HBV infection that acts by blocking the binding of preS1 with the HBV receptor NTCP</title><p>Competition ELISA assays showed that 2H5-A14 had almost the same peptide competition pattern as did 2H5, and mutation of G24R of preS1 did not affect 2H5-A14 binding activity, indicating that 2H5-A14 targets the same epitope as does 2H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). This epitope is in close proximity to, but does not overlap, the receptor NTCP-binding site of preS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether the neutralization activity of 2H5-A14 can be attributed to competition with preS1 for binding with NTCP, we used a stable HepG2-hNTCP cell clone that expresses a high level of hNTCP and supports the binding of a fluorescent-labeled preS1 peptide. An immunofluorescence staining assay showed that 2H5-A14 inhibited the binding of FITC-labeled preS1 to HepG2-hNTCP cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an isotype-matched control Ab did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This result indicates that the neutralization mechanism of 2H5-A14 likely involves blocking of viral entry by interfering with the binding of NTCP and preS1, probably owing to steric hindrance at or near the preS1 receptor binding site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26738.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Blocking activity of 2H5-A14 for preS1 binding to hNTCP and the broad and potent neutralization activity of 2H5-A14 against HBV and HDV.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2H5-A14 competed for the binding of preS1 to HepG2-hNTCP cells. 2H5-A14 or an isotype-matched control Ab at the indicated concentrations and 100 nM of FITC-labeled preS1 lipopeptide were mixed, and added to HepG2-hNTCP cells and were incubated for 15 mins, followed by extensive washing and staining of nuclei by DAPI.

Even so, our sequence analysis showed that the epitope 2H5-A14 is highly conserved and our neutralization assay results clearly showed that 2H5-A14 neutralizes the three major epidemic genotypes of HBV with remarkable potency.

As expected, the 2H5-A14-DANA variant could still bind to CHO-59C cells and preS1 peptides, and neutralize HBV infection to the same extent as 2H5-A14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>), but could not bind to Fc receptors as revealed by FACS binding assays using NK92-MI<sup>hCD16</sup> cells and SPR analysis (Biacore) using soluble human and mouse FcÎ³Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Using the same ADCC assay, we also demonstrated that 2H5-A14, but not the 2H5-A14-DANA variant, caused ADCC against HBV-infected cells. The HepG2-hNTCP cells infected by HBV were specifically killed by NK cells, whereas the HepG2-hNTCP cells uninfected by HBV were spared from NK cell killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>We next examined if 2H5-A14 can mediate ADCC and ADCP via macrophages. When fully differentiated human macrophages were mixed with target cells (293F-59C, see materials and methods) expressing the 2H5-A14 epitope on their surface, both ADCP and ADCC were observed following treatment with wild type 2H5-A14 but not with the 2H5-A14-DANA variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).

When the target cells were expressing a mutant epitope (293F-59C-mut), no specific ADCC and ADCP were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) as effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Taken together, the results of these in vitro assays suggest that 2H5-A14 can kill target cells via Fc-FÎ³R interaction-dependent effector functions such as ADCC and ADCP.</p><p>We further analyzed if 2H5-A14 can activate complement and induce CDC. In the presence ofÂ complement sera (from rabbit or human), 2H5-A14 did not cause cell lysis of CHO-59C cells. Under the same testing conditions, anti-CD20 (Rituximab) and an anti-GPC3 chimeric antibody (GC33) that are known to cause CDC all induced target-specific CDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4A</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Meerten et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, 2H5-A14 is not competent to induce CDC against target cells. Consistently, 2H5-A14 has very weak binding activity to both human- and mouse C1q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection is dependent on Fc-mediated effector functions</title><p>To assess whether the effector functions of 2H5-A14 contribute to its in vivo efficacy, we compared the anti-viral activities of 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA in the aforementioned HDV and HBV infection mouse models. The Fc of 2H5-A14 is from the human IgG1 isotype, which is able to engage mouse FcÎ³Rs on mouse effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Overdijk et al., 2012</xref>). In the <italic>Ntcp</italic> gene-edited homozygous FVB mice, 2H5-A14-DANA and 2H5-A14 showed similar prophylactic efficacy: both offered complete protection from HDV infection at a 5 mg/kg dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This result suggests that Fab-mediated neutralization, rather than the Fc-mediated effector function, is primarily responsible for preventing viral infection. This mouse model only supports transiently-acute HDV infection and is thus only suitable to assess prophylactic efficacy. We therefore used the hFRG mouse model, which supports sustained HBV infection, to determine if the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14 requires Fc-FÎ³R interaction-dependent effector functions. hFRG mice with a medium level of humanization (an average human serum albumin level of about 3 mg/mL) were challenged with HBV on day 0. At 33 dpi, nine mice with similar level of stably-established HBV infection were divided into three groups and treated with 2H5-A14 (5 mg/kg), 2H5-A14-DANA (5 mg/kg), or PBS (vehicle control). Treatment was administered twice weekly for a total of 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Blood was collected periodically for monitoring virological markers, including DNA titer and the HBsAg level until the end of the experiment (89 dpi). The HBV DNA titer and the HBsAg level increased over time in the control group, with an average DNA titer ofÂ ~2.0Ã10<sup>9</sup>/mL and an average HBsAg level ofÂ ~3Ã10<sup>6</sup> IU/mL at 89 dpi. In the 2H5-A14-DANA group, the average HBV DNA titer and the HBsAg levels wereÂ ~3.8Ã10<sup>8</sup>/mL andÂ ~4.0Ã10<sup>4</sup> IU/mL, respectively, at 89 dpi. In contrast, compared to the control group, the 2H5-A14 treatment group had an about 200-fold reduction in DNA titer (~1.0Ã10<sup>7</sup>/mL) and aÂ ~Â 40000 fold reduction in the HBsAg level (~70 IU/mL) at 89 dpi. Importantly, in contrast to control PBS or 2H5-A14-DANA, treatment with 2H5-A14 resulted in reductions in both HBV DNA titer and HBsAg levels over time, starting from the beginning of the treatment and continuing through the treatment window and 3 weeks after treatment withdrawal, with only a slight rebound at the end of the experiment (4 weeks after treatment withdrawal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results showed that 2H5-A14 treatment not only efficiently suppressed the spread of HBV in mice, but could also gradually reduce the extent of an established HBV infection over time. In contrast, 2H5-A14-DANA was able to suppress the spread of HBV as compared to the control group, but it did not reduce the extent of an established HBV infection: the levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg at all tested time points after the treatment were all higher than those at the starting point of treatment. Note that both 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA treated mice had comparable serum antibody concentrations at all time points tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and had comparable human albumin levels both before viral challenge and at 80 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26738.026</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Contributions of Fc-mediated effector functions to the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14 against HDV and HBV infection in mouse models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fc-mediated effector functions are not required for 2H5-A14 to protect mice from HDV infection.

No significant histopathological changes related to the treatment were observed.

Quantification of the cccDNA level in the liver tissues by qPCR further independently confirmed that 2H5-A14-treated mice indeed had much lower cccDNA copy numbers than the other two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results demonstrate the potent in vivo anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14. Moreover, the comparison of the effects of 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA treatments side by side clearly proves that the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 results only in part from Fab-mediated neutralization, while the Fc-dependent effector functions of 2H5-A14 are particularly critical in conferring its overall therapeutic effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Prospects for immune escape</title><p>To examine if HBV escape mutants will arise under selection pressure from 2H5-A14 treatment, we sequenced the HBV <italic>L</italic> gene amplified from the mouse liver tissues collected at the end of the two aforementioned studies in hFRG mice.

Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that 2H5-A14 treatment may induce escape mutants, these results indicate that the epitope of 2H5-A14, a receptor-binding proximal and highly conservative region centered by Phe<sup>23</sup>, is likely unsusceptible to escape mutation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Highly potent direct anti-viral agents for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) can now cure most HCV-infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreiber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feld et al., 2015</xref>). Curing HBV has thus become the next major goal in fighting viral hepatitis. Monoclonal antibodies have rapidly become an important drug class, especially for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases. However the potential of using mAbs to treat chronic viral infections is only beginning to be explored.</p><p>In HBV, nAbs against the HBV small (S) envelop protein (HBsAg) constitute the major protective components of both the widely-used recombinant HBV vaccine and of the post-exposure prophylactic blood-derived HBIG. However, neither the vaccine nor HBIG are effective in treating persistent HBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsuge et al., 2016</xref>). A previous study reported that a combination of two monoclonal nAbs against HBsAg (HepeX-B) only exhibited short-term anti-viral effects in animal models and an early phase I human study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neumann et al., 2010</xref>). A humanized anti-HBsAg nAb was recently shown to have longer anti-viral effects in mouse models mainly through clearance of the Ab-HBsAg immune complexes by phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). High levels of circulating HBsAg-containing non-infectious subviral particles are commonly present in the blood of chronically-infected HBV patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seeger et al., 2007</xref>). It has been assumed that HBsAg can act as a decoy that prevents anti-HBsAg nAbs from effective targeting of infectious virions and infected cells, the formation of circulating immune complexes that may lead to immune complex disease also remains a potential risk. Compared to the HBsAg, the L protein is much less abundant in circulation and preferentially present on infectious HBV particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seeger et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover it is now known that the preS1 domain of the L protein is responsible for receptor NTCP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To date, two anti-preS1 nAbs, the murine BX-182 nAb and humanized KR127 nAb, have been shown to be able to prevent HBV infection when injected in chimpanzees prior to HBV challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). However, neither these nor any other anti-preS1 nAbs have been tested as a treatment against established HBV infection and no mechanistic studies have been conducted with these nAbs. BX-182 is an HBV subtype-specific nAb owing to sequence variations in its epitope (residues 6â10 of preS1, SVPNP). KR127 recognizes residues 37â45 (NSNNPDWDF) of preS1 and has broader neutralizing activity than BX-182, but its potency is limited, diminishing its promise for therapy.</p><p>2H5-A14 has potent viral neutralization activity with low picomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values in cell cultures. Consistent with this in vitro potency, it is extremely effective in protecting mice from de novo HDV and HBV infection. Remarkably, 2H5-A14 demonstrated impressive therapeutic efficacy against HBV infection in two independent mouse studies using liver-humanized hFRG mice. At present, there is no immune-competent small animal model that supports natural and long-lasting HBV infection. Although the hFRG mice are immunodeficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azuma et al., 2007</xref>), this model recapitulates the complete life cycle of HBV and is a valuable model for evaluating the efficacy of an antibody against HBV infection in vivo. Our initial animal study in hFRG mice with high-level of humanized chimeric liver was ended at 37 days due to the rampant viral propagation in the untreated control group, which had an adverse effect on the general health of these mice. The second study had slower viral propagation rates (likely due to the medium-level of liver humanization and/or the relatively lower propagation rate of the challenging virus) and lasted for 89 days, allowing us to assess the antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 over a longer period. Monitoring infection during this longer experimental period revealed a marked reduction of the extent of an established HBV infection in 2H5-A14-treated mice.</p><p>Mechanistically, we found that viral neutralization by 2H5-A14 is the dominant mechanism contributing to the protection of mice from HDV infection. In contrast, in addition to protecting hepatocytes from viral entry, Fc-mediated effector functions contribute substantially to the overall antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection in hFRG mice. Our experiments in the hFRG model revealed that wildtype 2H5-A14, but not the Fc-DANA mutant of 2H5-A14 (a variant incapable of mediating antibody-dependent effector functions), elicited remarkable anti-viral effects against an established HBV infection. hFRG mice lack T and B lymphocytes, and NK cells. NK cells are generally considered to be the main effector cells in mediating ADCC to induce apoptosis in target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The observed effector functions in hFRG model thus cannot be attributed to NK cells but to the remaining immune effector cells in these mice; forÂ example FcÎ³R-expressing macrophages or other meloid cells (e.g. neutraphils) that are capable of killing infected hepatocytes by ADCC and/or ADCP or antibody-dependent scretion of antiviral cytokines or by direct clearance of the antibody-opsonized viruses via phagocytosis. Considering that primary hepatocytes and HBV-infected hepatocytes may be resistant to CDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halme et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and 2H5-A14 lacked complement C1q binding activity and CDC activity in vitro, CDC is unlikely involved in the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 in the HBV-infected hFRG mice. Macrophages have previosuly been shown to be the major effector cells invovled in anti-tumor activity of several mAbs in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clynes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamaguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Minard-Colin et al., 2008</xref>). Macrophages exert their cytotoxic functions via diverse mechanisms such as ADCC, ADCP, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braster et al., 2014</xref>). Neutrophils have also been reported to be involved in the anti-tumor efficacy of two mAbs in tumor models in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golay et al., 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to identify which immune effector cells are involved in mediating the in vivo antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 in future studies. The cells involved could be identified via the selective depletion of macropahges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010</xref>) or neutraphils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daley et al., 2008</xref>) using specific reagents targeting each of them in hFRG mice.</p><p>In humans, the mechanisms underlying HBV control is only partially understood, and harnessing immune control to combat chronic HBV infection is promising but remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Block et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guidotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isorce et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lucifora et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertoletti and Rivino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertoletti and Ferrari, 2012</xref>). During chronic HBV infection, it appears that NK cells have impaired secretion of antiviral cytokines (e.g. IFN-Î³) yet are able to maintain their cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maini and Peppa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shabani et al., 2014</xref>). The proportion of FcÎ³R-expressing NK cells in liver (27â75% of total NK cells in liver) is lower than that in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burt et al., 2009</xref>). Nontheless, given that they retain their cytotoxicity, these FcÎ³R-expressing NK cells can be assumed to have ADCC activity. Hepatic macropahges include both infiltrating macrophages and liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, accounting for 80â90% of all tissue macrophages in entire body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jenne and Kubes, 2013</xref>]). The roles of these cells in HBV infection appear to be complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ju and Tacke, 2016</xref>). Similar to human tumor-associated macrophages, hepatic macropahges likely retain antibody-dependent effector fuctions via their expressed FcÎ³Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grugan et al., 2012</xref>). Future human clinical trials will allow us to determine if, as we found in hFRG mice, 2H5-A14 elicits its Fc-dependent effect functions via activating immune cells in liver to exert its anti-viral effect.</p><p>Two aspects of the anti-HBV effect of 2H5-A14 are worth noting. First, 2H5-A14 treatment resulted in substantial decreases in HBsAg levels in the blood of HBV-infected hFRG mice over time. Serological HBsAg reduction, and eventually HBsAg loss, is considered as a critical step toward a âfunctional cureâ. Current NUCs therapy rarely reduces HBsAg level in CHB patients. 2H5-A14 specifically targets preS1 but not the vast majority of HBsAg particles, therefore, in contrast to nAbs targeting HBsAg, the decline of HBsAg by 2H5-A14 cannot be attributed to the Ab-mediated clearance of HBsAg from the blood, but to a gradual reduction of established HBV infection. Second, 2H5-A14 treatment at least effectively suppressed cccDNA accumation and more likely reduced cccDNA in liver tissues. Due to techniqucal difficulties, we cannot quantify the intrahepatic cccDNA when treatment began, however the continuing reduction of the levels of DNA titers and HBsAg levels after treatment clearly demonstrates that 2H5-A14 does reduce the extent of an established HBV infection. Our data showed that 2H5-A14 can mediate immune effector cells to kill HBV-infected cells in vitro via ADCC and ADCP, although more evdience is needed, it is conceivable to speculate that the clearance of cccDNA-carrying infected cells or decrease their in vivo half-lives by Fc-dependent effector functions via FcÎ³R engagement, including cytotolytic and/or noncytolytic mechanisms, may have contributed to the anti-HBV effect of 2H5-A14 in a manner beyond Fab-mediated blockage of new infections. It will be interesting to further determine the detailed mechanism of the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14, in particular the relative contribution of cytolytic versus noncytolytic effects in this process.</p><p>In summary, we identified six anti-preS1 human nAbs from a phage library and then improved the lead hit into 2H5-A14, a high-affinity and broad-spectrum nAb that is extremely potent in vitro and in vivo against both HDV and HBV. 2H5-A14 inhibits NTCP binding by recognizing a structurally-defined and highly-conserved epitope located in close proximity to the RBS of preS1. 2H5-A14 is also capable of triggering epitope-specific and Fc-dependent effector functions. Importantly, the effector functions contribute substantially to the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection in vivo. These results for the first time demonstrate a nAb targeting the RBS adjacent region on preS1 can exert anti-HBV effect through Fc-dependent effector functions by engaging FcÎ³Rs, pointing toward a novel antibody-Fc-dependent strategy for HBV treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cell lines 293T (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link>) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0027">CVCL_0027</ext-link>) were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,Â Manassas, VA); human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0336">CVCL_0336</ext-link>), Raji (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0511">CVCL_0511</ext-link>) and Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0213">CVCL_0213</ext-link>) were from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A human non-immune scFv (single-chain fragment of variable domain: VH-linker-VL) antibody library (1.1 Ã 10<sup>10</sup>) constructed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 93 healthy donors was used for selection against the synthesized NC36b or m47b preS1 peptides. Briefly, the peptides were captured on streptavidin-conjugated magnetic M-280 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) and then incubated with 5 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> phage-scFv particles prepared from the library. For each peptide, two rounds of selection were performed. To recover high-affinity binders from the magnetic beads and to increase the diversity of the recovered phage-scFvs, two elution methods were used: peptide competition elution and conventional basic triethanolamine solution elution. Subsequently, a total of about 2000 single clones were randomly picked and rescued to produce phage-scFvs in the bacterial culture supernatant. These clones were screened for specific binding to NC36b and/or m47b by ELISA. More than 90% of the clones screened were positive for one or both peptides. Clones that bound to NC36b and/or m47b with an optical density at 450 nmÂ &gt;1.0 were selected for further antibody gene sequencing. The genes of the variable heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) of the selected clones were sequenced. A total of 109 clones with unique sequences were identified. These clones were either produced as purified phage-scFv particles or converted to full-length human IgG1s and then analyzed for binding to the preS1 peptides by ELISA again, and evaluated in HBV and/or HDV neutralization assays.

Construction of CHO-59C cell line: An expression plasmid was first constructed by inserting the preS1-59C coding DNA into the C-terminal (CT) extracellular domain of the VAMP2 gene that encodes a single-pass type IV transmembrane protein. The NT of VAMP2 is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Its CT extracellular domain only contains two amino acids.

DNA was precipitated with equal volume of isopropanol and finally dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0). For Southern blotting, the DNA samples were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; GE-RPN2250B) using a standard neutral transfer procedure. 3.2 kb, 2.0 kb, and 1.3 kb HBV fragment DNA was also run on the same agarose gel to serve as the molecular marker. The membrane was probed with the DIG-labeled HBV DNA probe. Hybridization was carried out in 10 ml of hybridization buffer with a 1 hr prehybridization at 60Â°C and overnight hybridization at 60Â°C, followed by 2Â ÃÂ 5 min wash with 2Â ÃÂ SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 2Â ÃÂ 5 min wash with 0.2Â ÃÂ SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60Â°C. The membrane was incubated with blocking buffer for 30 min, followed by 30 min incubation with antibody solution. After equilibration with detection buffer for 5 min, the membrane was rinsed with CDP-star and then exposed to X-ray film at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Quantification of HBV cccDNA in mouse liver tissues by qPCR</title><p>HBV cccDNA was quantified by qPCR using a protocol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qi et al., 2016</xref>), with modifications. Briefly, the frozen liver tissues were homogenized and then lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.4 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, pHÂ =Â 8.0) in the presence of proteinase K (QIAGEN). The total DNA was extracted according to a standard phenol-chloroform extraction protocol. 5U (0.5 ÂµL) plasmid-safe adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent deoxyribonuclease DNase (PSAD) (Epicentre Technologies,Â Madison, WI) was used to digest 500 ng of total DNA in 20 ÂµL reaction volume, and incubated at 37Â°C for 8 hr to remove the linear genomic and HBV replication intermediate DNAs. The reaction was then incubated at 70Â°C for 30 mins to inactivate the DNase. Then, 2 Î¼L of the digested DNA for each sample was used as a qPCR template for quantification of intrahepatic HBV cccDNA copies. HBV cccDNA specific qPCR primers are: 5'-TGCACTTCGCTTCACCT-3â (forward) and 5'-AGGGGCATTTGGTGGTC-3â (reverse). The hNTCP gene copy numbers, which represent the amount of human hepatocytes in the liver tissues of chimeric mice, were used to normalize the relative cccDNA amount in the infected cells for each sample. For quantification of human NTCP gene copies, 50 ng of the undigested DNA samples were used. Human NTCP specific primers (annealing to the second intron of hNTCP gene) are: 5â-TCCAGGAGCCACTTTCACCATAA-3â (forward) and 5â-AGCAGGGACAAGTGTCAGAACAGA-3â (reverse). The amount of HBV cccDNA or hNTCP gene copies were calculated using the standard curves generated from the standard plasmids with known copy numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Northern blot analysis of HBV RNA</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver tissues using TRIZOl reagent. About 2 Î¼g of total RNA per sample was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto positively charged nylon membrane. DIG-labeled probes were prepared with a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche,Â <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche.com/careers/country/switzerland.htm">Switzerland</ext-link>).

L gene was amplified from the extracted DNA by PCR using a set of specific primers. Two PCRs were performed for each sample. The PCR products were then cloned by TA cloning. For each TA cloning, clones were randomly picked for sequencing the L gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Accession number</title><p>The coordinates and structural factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank with accession code 5YAX.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank W Chen, Z Cao, Y Li and X Tian and all other members in the Sui and Li labs for their technical assistance and discussions.

In regard to liver toxicity, at least human albumin and ALT levels should be examined longitudinally in addition to histopathlogy-ideally viral load.</italic></p><p>We agree that starting Ab treatment following full establishment of chronic infection would further strengthen the impact of nAb as therapeutics. We have conducted two mouse studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-G</xref>, respectively. In the first mouse study, Ab treatment was initiated on day 5, post infection, while in the second study, the treatment was started 33 days after the HBV infection. As we discussed in the manuscript (Discussion section), the virus used in the first mouse study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref>) had rampant viral propagation, which had adverse effect on the general health of these immune deficient hFRG mice, thus the study was ended at thirty seven days post infection. In the second animal study shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 B-G</xref>, viral propagation rate was slower than the first study, allowing us to assess the antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 over a longer period. The Ab treatment was started at 33 days after infection, when the infection was clearly established although it still kept going up. Under this condition, Ab treatment markedly reduced the level of infection, demonstrating that 2H5-A14 can reduce the extent of an established HBV infection.</p><p>To access liver toxicity, we measured the levels of human albumin and ALT in longitudinal serum samples of which sufficient amounts were available for the assays. For both albumin and ALT levels, there were no significant differences between 2H5-A14 treated group and other groups including vehicle control, 2H5-A14 prophylaxis group and HBIG control group. The result is presented as a new supplemental figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
