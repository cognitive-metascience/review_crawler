Therefore, methods to rapidly and effectively improve enzyme stability are highly appealing. In this study we applied a computational method (FRESCO) to guide the engineering of an alcohol dehydrogenase. Of the 177 selected mutations, 25 mutations brought about a significant increase in apparent melting temperature (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> ≥ +3 °C). By combining mutations, a 10-fold mutant was generated with a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 94 °C (+51 °C relative to wild type), almost reaching water’s boiling point, and the highest increase with FRESCO to date. The 10-fold mutant’s structure was elucidated, which enabled the identification of an activity-impairing mutation. After reverting this mutation, the enzyme showed no loss in activity compared to wild type, while displaying a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 88 °C (+45 °C relative to wild type).

There is a vast diversity of ADHs that can transform a large range of substrates, often with high regio- and enantioselectivity. Most ADHs employ nicotinamide cofactors for catalysis. In particular, ketone reductions catalysed by ADHs are used in industry to synthesize chiral alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nealon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Although ADHs have been mainly applied for ketone reductions, recent studies show promising results as biocatalysts for selective oxidations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Solé et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>NAD(P)-dependent ADHs catalyse the transfer of a hydride from the reduced nicotinamide coenzyme to reduce ketones to alcohols, or the transfer of a hydride from alcohols to reduce NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>. A large subset of alcohol dehydrogenases belongs to the family of short-chain reductases/dehydrogenases (SDRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kavanagh et al., 2008</xref>). Enzymes from this family encompass around 250 amino acid-long sequences, typically form tetramers, use NAD(H) or NADP(H) as cofactor, and mainly act on secondary alcohols and ketones. The characteristic catalytic triad in SDRs is a combination of Ser-Tyr-Lys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatia et al., 2015</xref>). These residues are located close to the C4 of the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, at which the hydride is located or is transferred to. The catalytic triad, along with several residues in its vicinity, form a proton-relay system that either assists in the deprotonation of an alcohol to initiate alcohol oxidation, or facilitates the protonation of a ketone substrate with concurrent hydride transfer, resulting in ketone reduction.</p><p>Most enzymes in nature have evolved to catalyse reactions within cells, in crowded, mild and aqueous conditions, and only for limited periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldenzweig and Fleishman, 2018</xref>). Moreover, enzymes that can be easily degraded after some time enable greater metabolic adaptability for the organism, for instance when a local resource depletes, or a signaling event occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parsell and Sauer, 1989</xref>). Therefore, many enzymes are only moderately stable. When considering enzymes for applications, this can lead to various difficulties in heterologous expression, degradation upon isolation, and poor biocatalyst performance. Enzymes that have the potential to be applied as biocatalyst are often insufficiently stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bommarius and Paye, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Woodley, 2019</xref>). One such enzyme is ADHA, an alcohol dehydrogenase from <italic>Candida magnoliae</italic> DSMZ 70638. This enzyme was isolated for its ability to reduce several ketones with excellent enantioselectivities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These catalytic features make ADHA attractive for industrial applications. Although heterologous expression of ADHA is good, the melting temperature of ADHA is moderate, with an apparent <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 43 °C. If stability of ADHA could be improved, it would become a very attractive biocatalyst for selective oxidations or reductions.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Initial measurements of ADHA WT activity and selectivity with several ketones.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Substrate (concentration)</th><th valign="top"><italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub><sup>*</sup> (U/mg)</th><th valign="top">Enantiomeric excess product (<italic>ee</italic>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Ethyl acetoacetate (100 mM)</td><td valign="top">4.1</td><td valign="top">n.d.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cyclohexanone (50 mM)</td><td valign="top">3.2</td><td valign="top">n.a.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBA) (50 mM)</td><td valign="top">0.3</td><td valign="top">&gt; 99% (<italic>R</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4-Chloroacetophenone (4-CAP) (50 mM)</td><td valign="top">2.4</td><td valign="top">97.2% (<italic>S</italic>)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup><italic>k<sub>obs</sub></italic> values are averages based on 2–3 replicates and for each average the error was smaller than 5%.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Several studies over the past two decades have developed strategies to stabilize proteins and enzymes. A subset of these strategies specifically targeted the charge of the protein or enzyme surface or interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjørk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gribenko et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, the field has mostly aimed at the development of computational methods to predict mutations that improve the stability of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malakauskas and Mayo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murphy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shah et al., 2007</xref>) and/or enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bednar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borgo and Havranek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korkegian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moore et al., 2017</xref>). Considering the large improvements in stability that were found using these methods with minimal screening work in the lab, such computational approaches are highly appealing.</p><p>Our goal was to improve the stability of ADHA through enzyme engineering, guided by a computational method. The requirement for this endeavour was to obtain a crystal structure of the enzyme. The structure is needed as input for our in-house developed method: ‘framework for rapid enzyme stabilization by computational libraries’ (FRESCO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wijma et al., 2018</xref>). This computational protocol incorporates two algorithms to calculate folding free energy (Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>Fold</sup>, expressed in kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>), and compares these calculations (ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sup>Fold</sup>) between the wild-type structure and variants with a single mutation. The calculations are performed for all possible single mutations. The variants with the best scores are simulated with molecular dynamics, to inspect the flexibility and conformational stability. In the last round of enzyme engineering, mutations that improve the stability are combined to obtain a final robust variant. The main motivation to apply FRESCO is that it is relatively fast, because it greatly reduces the required screening effort compared to other enzyme engineering approaches.</p><p>Here, we present the results of the application of FRESCO on ADHA. This has led to a variant which has been mutated at 10 positions and displays a drastically increased thermostability (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 94.5 °C, Δ <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = +51 °C). However, it was found that this engineered ADHA displayed very little activity. Elucidation of its crystal structure disclosed the structural basis for the inactivation: one particular mutation, in combination with other introduced mutations, resulted in a reorientation of a loop region through which binding of the nicotinamide cofactor is hampered. By reverting this mutation, a highly stable (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 88 °C) and active ADHA variant was obtained, demonstrating the power of using computationally predicted mutations in combination with structural analysis to engineer robust enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of ADHA</title><p>Characterization of ADHA immediately indicated a high reductive activity towards a broad panel of ketones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) with high enantioselectivity (&gt; 97% <italic>ee</italic>). This result illustrated that the enzyme could be applied for the synthesis of various chiral alcohols. Therefore, we concluded that ADHA has great potential for the application as a biocatalyst. However, we soon realized that most of the enzyme activity is lost in reactions of 8 h or longer, even at moderate temperatures such as 25 °C or 30 °C (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to employ FRESCO to generate a more robust variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Crystal structure of wild-type ADHA</title><p>A prerequisite for FRESCO is the availability of a crystal structure of the target protein. Therefore, already in the early stages of the project, the untagged ADHA was tested for crystallization trials. The purified enzyme crystallized in many conditions and the enzyme three-dimensional structure was solved in the apo and NADP<sup>+</sup>-bound state at 2.0 Å and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). ADHA is a homotetramer as typically observed in most SDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kavanagh et al., 2008</xref>). A search for homologous structures in the Protein Data Bank showed that the closest structural homologue is another alcohol dehydrogenase from <italic>Candida magnoliae</italic> (PDB entry 5MLN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tavanti et al., 2017</xref>]; root-mean-square deviation of 1.0 Å for 238 Cα atoms with 64% sequence identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The structure of ADHA bound to NADP<sup>+</sup> unveils, apart from a disordered nicotinamide moiety, a well-defined catalytic pocket with a size suited for small cyclic compounds such as cyclohexanol, a good substrate of the enzyme.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The crystal structure of ADHA.</title><p>The figure highlights the final weighted 2Fo-Fc map for NADP<sup>+</sup> bound to a subunit of the wild-type ADHA (subunit A, contour level 1.2 σ).

A detailed description of the procedure is available as a step-by-step protocol suitable for biochemists with minimal computational experience and all the scripts are deposited online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wijma et al., 2018</xref>). Licenses for the Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>Fold</sup>-determining software components (Rosetta and FoldX) are free for academic purposes, whereas our preferred software for modelling and MD simulations, YASARA, needs to be purchased. Depending on the size of the protein, a computer cluster may be necessary for the calculation-intensive parts of the predictions. After FRESCO’s in silico screening, a final selection of mutants is expressed, purified and tested for stability in vitro. The experimental part has also been described in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>) and requires readily purchasable consumables and equipment commonly available in most labs.</p><p>Because the energy prediction algorithms Rosetta and FoldX do not accept non-proteinogenic residues and because the ligand-free enzyme represents the physiologically more relevant form, we used the crystal structure of ADHA without NADP<sup>+</sup> for the stabilizing mutation predictions. While FRESCO usually excludes residues of ligand-binding sites, we decided to include such residues for predicting stabilizing mutations. Because the enzyme is relatively small, we could still easily discard activity-impairing mutations in the experimental phase. We did not include the residues that form the canonical catalytic triad (T148, Y161, and K165), which are highly conserved residues and essential for enzyme activity. Curiously, unlike ADHA, the majority of SDRs have a serine at the position of T148. In fact, the catalytic triad of SDRs is usually designated as SYK (serine, tyrosine, lysine). Clearly, a catalytic threonine can also support redox catalysis in an SDR-type alcohol dehydrogenase, and such an alternative catalytic triad has also been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King et al., 2007</xref>). The calculations for the 4503 possible mutations were ranked and mutations with a ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sup>Fold</sup> ≤ −5 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> were briefly simulated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the flexibility of the variant. The resulting 478 computer-generated mutant structures were visually inspected to remove chemically undesirable mutations (clashes, exposed hydrophobic residues, loss of hydrogen bonds), and highly flexible mutants (based on the short MDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wijma et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, several positions (&gt; 20) had more than four suggested beneficial mutations. In those cases, we chose two or three distinct suggested mutations. Finally, we selected 177 single mutations for experimental screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>In vitro analysis of mutant library</title><p>The mutant library was prepared using the QuikChange method following the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>).

The purified samples were desalted and the apparent <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> was measured in an RT-PCR machine in duplicate. 26 mutants repeatedly did not give a clear signal, which may have been caused by insufficient expression.

The additive effect is not perfect, as the theoretical maximal additive effect would be 56.5 °C, while M9 displays an improvement of 51.5 °C. This may indicate that some of the mutations are part of the same structural “soft spot” that triggers early unfolding events in the wild type. Still, an increase of &gt; 50 °C by introducing 10 mutations was highly gratifying. Adding more hits (S25A, G41N, G75L) from the library beyond the 10<sup>th</sup> mutation did not increase the apparent melting temperature any further. This prompted us to investigate the M9 mutant in more detail. We found that the M9 enzyme retained catalytic activities, though with a 100-fold higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for NADP<sup>+</sup> (1.0 mM, compared to 9.5 µM) and a 4-fold decreased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (0.25 s<sup>−1</sup>, compared to 1.1 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We suspected that this would be the result of a shift in optimal temperature for activity, due to the presumed higher rigidity of this highly stabilized mutant. But even at higher temperatures (≥ 40 °C), the activity of the M9 mutant did not drastically change. Clearly, the multiple mutations did result in a highly stable but catalytically impaired enzyme and it was essential to elucidate the specific structural cause of this.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Michaelis-Menten plots for kinetics with NADP<sup>+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ADHA wild type (<bold>B</bold>) M9 mutant.

As with the wild-type ADHA, several conditions gave crystals of the M9 enzyme, enabling determination of its structure at 2.6 Å resolution. Although the crystallization conditions contained 1.0 mM NADP<sup>+</sup>, there was no electron density for any ligand in the M9 structure. This was not surprising, considering the high <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (1.0 mM) for NADPH of this mutant. When inspecting the M9 structure, it is worth noting that all the introduced mutations are in the same area of the enzyme three-dimensional structure. Specifically, the mutations are located centrally on each of the two flat faces of the homo-tetramer, where two opposing subunits come together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Most mutations are located close to the tetramer centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and many are surface-exposed, or surface-near. Superposition of the wild-type ADHA and M9 tetramers revealed a very close structural similarity with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.58 Å for 956 Cα atoms. The only considerable backbone shift (up to 3.1 Å) concerns loop 196–214 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Residues 196–198 in this loop are involved in binding the NADP<sup>+</sup> pyrophosphate group as shown by the crystal structure of the wild-type ADHA bound to NADP<sup>+</sup>. The observed structural alteration in this particular loop immediately provides an explanation for the increase of <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for this cofactor in M9: the introduced E197 seems to occupy the NADP<sup>+</sup> pyrophosphate binding site. Along with the shift of the loop, the carboxylate moiety of the S197E mutation induces an interaction with the guanidinium of R18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) – a residue that crucially binds the 2’ phosphate of NADP<sup>+</sup> in the wild-type structure. While the favourable electrostatics of this new interaction is a likely explanation for the mutation’s stability effect, it also explains the lower affinity for NADP<sup>+</sup> (and the absence of the cofactor in the mutant’s crystals), as the salt bridge neutralizes R18 and occupies the NADP<sup>+</sup> binding pocket.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structure of the M9 mutant of ADHA with mutated resides highlighted.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) quaternary structure of M9.

As a result, the cofactor (green carbons) is only bound in the wild type, while absent from the mutant structure.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54639-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Closely located to the S197E mutation are several other introduced mutations: G149A, L150F, V193L, T194V, and V217P. These mutations cause rather small alterations by exchanging a hydroxyl for a methyl group or slightly increasing the bulkiness of aliphatic side chains. These residues are part of a cluster of hydrophobic residues adjacent to the loop 196–214 and involve several aliphatic (I20, P191, M198, I215, I220) and aromatic (F207, W214, Y244) side chains. G149A, L150F (the most stabilizing mutation of all), V193L, T194V, and V217P all contributed substantially to thermostability, with up to 14 °C increase in the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values at the single mutant level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The structural analysis clearly shows that improved side-chain packing and hydrophobic interactions are the likely source of their stabilizing effect. Another mutation causing improved hydrophobic packing is G159A (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> increase of 5.5 °C) that locates close to I102, F171, and L175. V238L (+7 °C) is a unique case, promoting more extended interaction of the subunits within the tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Curiously, the mutation does so by allowing a hydrophobic interaction with itself at the dimer interface. V217P is a seemingly conservative mutation at the beginning of an α-helix and yet caused a significant effect (+3 °C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Prolines often occur at ‘helical capping’ positions by restraining the backbone conformation and positioning a substituted backbone amino group that is unable to form H-bonding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Richardson and Richardson, 1988</xref>). The V217P mutation follows this trend. Among the identified mutations, M157K is the only one that replaces a hydrophobic residue with a hydrophilic and charged side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It has a large (+8 °C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) effect on protein stability, which very likely arises from the removal of a solvent-exposed hydrophobic group and its replacement with the charged and hydrophilic amine of a lysine residue. Lastly, N212R is possibly the most puzzling mutation. It positions an arginine side chain in a fully solvent-exposed location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and its conspicuous (+5 °C) stability can be tentatively attributed to the more pronounced polarity of an arginine side chain as compared to an asparagine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Szilágyi and Závodszky, 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dimer interface with the V238L mutation (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 7 ˚C).</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) indicate the different monomers in the ADHA tetramer.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54639-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, the detailed structural analysis of the mutation sites reveals a consistent pattern concerning the stabilizing effects: all stabilizing mutations of M9 promote hydrophobic packing of side chains or install highly polar and charged groups on fully solvent-exposed positions on the protein surface.

This method can be effective to stabilize enzymes for industrial applications, in particular if the enzyme has a higher order quaternary structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NEB 10-beta chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic></td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neb.com/">https://www.neb.com/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">C3019I</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence based reagent</td><td valign="top">pBAD Golden gate vector (N-terminal 6xHis, araC, bla)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Molecular Enzymology Group, University of Groningen</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Polymerase</td><td valign="top">PfuUltra II Hotstart PCR Master Mix</td><td valign="top">Agilent Technologies <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agilent.com/">https://www.agilent.com/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">600852</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Ni chromatography resin</td><td>GE Healthcare Life Sciences <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gelifesciences.com/">https://www.gelifesciences.com/</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Rosetta</td><td>Rosetta Commons <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rosettacommons.org/">https://www.rosettacommons.org/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015701">SCR_015701</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FoldX</td><td>FoldX<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/">http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008522">SCR_008522</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>YASARA</td><td>YASARA Biosciences GmbH<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yasara.org/">http://www.yasara.org/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017591">SCR_017591</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FRESCO scripts</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://groups.google.com/forum/">https://groups.google.com/forum/</ext-link>#!forum/fresco-stabilization-of-proteins</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>GraphPad Prism <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com">https://graphpad.com</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td>Version 6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials, strains and chemicals</title><p>Oligonucleotide primers for cloning and mutagenesis were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich.

A gene fragment of a new ketoreductase was identified. By using a refined PCR-primer the full open reading frame of the previously unknown ketoreductase ADHA was identified. The gene encoding for ADHA was cloned into c-LEcta’s proprietary expression vector pLE1A17 (a derivative of pRSF-1b, Novagen). After transformation of electrocompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells with the pLE1A17-ADHA vector, the cells were cultivated in ZYM505 medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Studier, 2005</xref>), supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/L) at 37 °C. Expression was induced at logarithmic phase by IPTG (0.1 mM) and carried out at 30 °C for 16–18 hr. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3220 x g, 20 min, 4 °C) and disrupted with cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0; 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1x CelLytic B (Sigma-Aldrich); DNA nuclease 0.02 U, lysozyme 0.5 mg/mL). The crude extracts were separated from cell debris by centrifugation (3220 x g 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was sterile-filtrated over a 0.2 µm-membrane filter and subsequently freeze dried.

A preculture inoculated with a single colony of <italic>E. coli</italic> NEB 10-beta harbouring the pBAD vector was grown overnight in LB (5 mL) with ampicillin (50 mg/L) at 37 °C. This preculture was used to inoculate TB (5 v/v %) and was simultaneously induced with 0.02% L-arabinose. The cells were grown at 24 °C for another 38 hr. Then the cells were spun down (3000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5), and sonicated (5 s on/off, 70% amplitude) on ice for cell lysis. Debris was spun down (21000 x g, 45 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to an IMAC column (GE Healthcare). After washing with buffer, and buffer with 5 mM imidazole, the His-tagged protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in buffer. The sample was subsequently subjected to a gravity-flow desalting column (PD-10, GE healthcare), to remove the imidazole. In case of SUMO-tagged protein, the protein was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with SUMO protease. The next day, the cleaved protein was separated from the SUMO-protease by IMAC and further purified by gel-permeation chromatography (Superdex 200, GE healthcare) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5.

To probe crystallization conditions, several screens were preformed using an Oryx eight robot (Douglas Instruments, UK) starting from PEG Suite, Ammonium Sulphate Suite and Classic Suite (Nextal). Preliminary crystallization experiments were performed in sitting drop using MRC SWISS CI plates, with a 1:1 protein:reservoir ratio and 0.4–1 mL crystallization droplets. Crystallization experiments were performed also with proteins incubated with 1 mM NADP<sup>+</sup>. The best crystals grew in 20% w/v PEG 3350, 0.2 M sodium citrate. These conditions were then used for all (wild type and mutant) crystallization experiments. Crystals were harvested from crystallization droplets using nylon cryo-loops (Hampton Research/Molecular Dimensions), shortly soaked in a cryo-protectant solution containing 20% w/v PEG 3350, 0.2 M sodium citrate and 20–25% v/v PEG 400, and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at ESRF ID23 beam line (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) for the wild-type crystals, and at the Swiss Light Synchrotron (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, SUI) for the M9 mutant. Wild-type crystals diffracted at 1.6–2.0 Å, while the resolution of diffraction by the mutant crystals was 2.6 Å. Data processing, structure determination by molecular replacement, and structure refinement were performed with XDS and programs of the CCP4 suited using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabsch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winn et al., 2011</xref>).

Although we also obtained a crystal structure of ADHA in complex with NADP<sup>+</sup>, we chose the wild-type structure without the ligand for our calculations, because of two reasons: firstly, the FoldX and Rosetta software only accept protein residues and the cofactor would have to be omitted for these parts in any case. Secondly, NADP<sup>+</sup> is assumed to interact only transiently to the enzyme and does not bind permanently as a prosthetic group. Thus, to realistically model the enzyme in its most relevant physiological condition, we did not consider the ligand-bound structure for the MD simulations either. In brief, we then prepared the structure using YASARA by adding hydrogens, predicted their optimal H-bonding network, and removed buffer and water molecules from the structure. The Rosettaddg and FoldX algorithms were then applied as described, and the resulting list of energies was used to identify 478 mutations with a ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sup>Fold</sup> improvement of &lt; −5 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>. We re-added the water molecules and furthermore solvated the protein in a charge-neutralized simulation cell stretching 7.5 Å around all atoms. MD simulations were carried out with YASARA using the Yamber3 force field. In five independently seeded simulations, the system was first energy minimized, heated to 298 K in 30 ps, equilibrated for 20 ps, and finally simulated in the production run for 50 ps. The MD trajectories’ average structures were superimposed and compared with those of the wild type in a visual inspection step of all MD-simulated mutants. Taking into account both the predicted static, as well as the MD simulated structures, mutants were not considered for experimental verification if we observed an increased backbone or side-chain flexibility, hydrogen bond impairment, or hydrophobic exposure. The Peregrine high-performance computing cluster (University of Groningen, Groningen) was used to perform all calculations for Rosettaddg, FoldX, and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations were carried out using the software Yasara Structure (YASARA Biosciences GmbH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mutagenesis and small-scale growth and expression</title><p>Following the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>), mutant oligonucleotides were designed and ordered, and the mutant library was prepared via QuikChange. QuikChange was also used to prepare mutants in which several mutations were combined. The construct used for small-scale expression of the mutants was an L-arabinose-inducible pBAD vector, where the ADHA gene is fused to an N-terminal His-tag. The plasmid was used to transform chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic> NEB 10 beta cells. Cell cultures were grown in four 96-deepwell plates, containing 1 mL per well. When the 1 mL TB medium was inoculated with an overnight preculture (5% v/v), arabinose was also added, and the 96-deepwell plates were incubated for 38 h at 24 °C. Then, the cells were centrifuged to create a single pellet for each mutant from 4 mL of culture broth. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5.

potential importance in the biotransformation of industrially relevant compounds. The use of X-ray crystal structural analysis of the optimized enzyme helps explain its exceptional properties. This study serves as an excellent model for what is possible in the thermal engineering of proteins using computational design.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Approaching boiling point stability of an alcohol dehydrogenase through computationally-guided enzyme engineering&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing/Senior Editor Philip Cole. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting paper that describes the successful application of FRESCO, a computational method for protein stabilization previously reported by the authors, for the stabilization of an alcohol dehydrogenase. Upon screening &gt; 150 computationally selected mutations and combining the most stabilizing ones, the authors were able to obtain a 51 °C stabilization compared to the parent enzyme, which is an impressive achievement. By removing a stabilizing but deleterious mutation, the authors were able to achieve a significant level of stabilization without losing catalytic activity. This work encompasses a significant amount of work and the results are relevant and important. The structural analyses on the evolved variant nicely complement the characterization studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors should clarify how accessible FRESCO is to the scientific community in terms of cost and technical aspects</p><p>– Have the authors determined the <italic>ee</italic> values for a range of substrates for their most thermostable enzyme? One worries that in the process of incorporating these mutations, stereochemical selectivities associated with the wt enzyme may be reduced or otherwise altered.</p><p>– All tables and graphs except Figure 5 are missing error bars. These should be included.</p><p>– &quot;Since we suspected the S197E mutation to be problematic concerning coenzyme binding, based on the structural observations (Figure 3C),...&quot;. This is an important point that could be explained more clearly. It is not obvious from the Figure 3C why the S197E mutation should be deleterious for cofactor binding. Due to effect of mutation on the flexibility of the loop? What insights do the MD simulations provide into that? The E197 neg charge could cause electrostatic repulsion with phosphate of NADPH, but what is distance from E197 and the cofactor? And isn't E197 neg charge neutralized by interaction with Arg R18, as discussed in the manuscript? The electrostatic repulsion effect could be probed by comparing/contrasting activity of WT and mutant using NADH.</p><p>– &quot;The initial FRESCO calculations and predictions for ADHA had a good hit rate: of the tested 177 mutations, 57 had a stabilizing effect of &gt; 1 °C.&quot; This number should be adjusted considering error in Tm measurement (+/- 1C). Because of the error, it seems more appropriate to indicate # of mutants with DeltaTm&gt; 2degC as significant.</p><p>– There is barely any reference to literature related to the use of computational design for enzyme stabilization.

This seems to be contradicted by the note in Figure 1 that the nicotinamide moiety is disordered.</p><p>– There is an unclear methodology aspect of the (probably too brief) introduction to FRESCO. At the outset it was not clear to what extent the coenzyme was included in the folding free energy or MD calculations. Near the end of the paper the authors say, &quot;the employed computational algorithms (Rosettaddg and FoldX) cannot take into account the flavin-protein interactions (Wijma et al., 2018).&quot; Completely omitting the coenzyme during ddG and MD calculations is a surprising enough action that the authors should be very explicit in the methods description.</p><p>– Another methodology clarification request. It is not clear whether visual inspection occurred for the 478 design models, the 478 MD simulations, or the 478 MD simulation final snapshots. The length of the MD simulations is either not mentioned or not sufficiently prominent.</p><p>– It is unclear if there was a quantitative threshold used to filter undesirable mutations? Similarly, when choosing 2 or 3 out of 4 beneficial mutations, how was the choice made? algorithm or biophysical intuition? Similarly, was the final roster of 177 mutations based on an unbiased, quantitative cutoff?</p><p>– Currently the comparison between panels A and B for &quot;Figure 3. Michaelis-Menten&quot; is awkward, since not only are there scale changes in both axes but also a unit change that might be overlooked.</p><p>– Re: &quot;The interaction it would have with R18, when in the context of the other introduced mutations, was impossible predict&quot;. You mean to say, &quot;impossible to predict&quot;, but might not more sampling reveal the new favored conformation? This seems like an excellent test case for developing improved FRESCO methods.</p><p>– The 6TQ8 difference between R-work and R-free is 10%, which seems rather large. We worry that there might be a significant level of bias in that model. The wwPDB validation report seemingly backs this up as a concern.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54639.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors should clarify how accessible FRESCO is to the scientific community in terms of cost and technical aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentences in the section of the Results on mutant prediction:</p><p>“A detailed description of the procedure is available as a step-by-step protocol suitable for biochemists with minimal computational experience and all the scripts are deposited online (Wijma et al., 2018).

The MD simulations were conducted without NADP, and the mutant structure also doesn’t contain the cofactor.

As described in more detail in Wijma et al., 2018 (which we refer to various times in the manuscript), the inspection step is performed by the researcher and thus arguably subjective, although of course based on biophysical considerations.</p><p>When choosing representatives from multiple mutation suggestions for the same residue, we chose to test only one from the commonly considered subgroups of amino acids (hydrophobic, negatively/positively charged, etc.).

You mean to say, &quot;impossible to predict&quot;, but might not more sampling reveal the new favored conformation? This seems like an excellent test case for developing improved FRESCO methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you pointing out the typo, which has been corrected. Indeed, it would hypothetically be possible to predict such a newly adopted conformation if either the prediction algorithms would be more accurate and allow backbone shifts, or if the MD simulation could sample a longer timeframe. With the current method of very short MD simulations (the price we pay for being able to simulate a large number of mutants), such large shifts are in fact, however, quite impossible to predict. As computational power increases, future applications of FRESCO may consider increased sampling time, yet, we are sceptical that such particular predictions are feasible (at least for academic research) within such a multi-mutant simulation framework in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The 6TQ8 difference between R-work and R-free is 10%, which seems rather large. We worry that there might be a significant level of bias in that model. The wwPDB validation report seemingly backs this up as a concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The crystals of the thermostable mutant (6TQ8) contain four enzyme chains in the asymmetric unit. Therefore, we could apply density averaging and NCS restrains during structure determination and refinement. We feel that the structure is well refined and model bias is not an issue, particularly in light of the four-fold averaging. The somewhat high free Rfactor most likely reflects some disorder, especially in subunit B. We are submitting the PDB and structure factor files for inspection by the reviewer if she/he would like to directly look at the data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
