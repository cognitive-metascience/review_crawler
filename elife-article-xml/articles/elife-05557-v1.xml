To understand the importance of these timing advances for a stable life history strategy, we constructed a full life cycle model of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Modelling and field data reveal that a cryptic function of flowering time control is to limit seed set of winter annuals to an ambient temperature window which coincides with a temperature-sensitive switch in seed dormancy state. This coincidence is predicted to be conserved independent of climate at the expense of flowering date, suggesting that temperature control of flowering time has evolved to constrain seed set environment and therefore frequency of dormant and non-dormant seed states. We show that late flowering can disrupt this bet-hedging germination strategy. Our analysis shows that life history modelling can reveal hidden fitness constraints and identify non-obvious selection pressures as emergent features.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05557.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05557.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05557.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants adjust when they grow, develop flowers and produce, or ‘set’, seeds in response to changes in temperature and day length. It is therefore unsurprising that climate change alters the timing of these important events in plants' lives; for example, many plants are adapting to rising temperatures by flowering earlier and growing for longer.</p><p>The environmental signals that control when a plant flowers, and the genes that underlie this process, have been well studied in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This plant's ability to quickly colonize and thrive in disturbed habitats—including agricultural land, construction sites, and waste ground—is partly because some of its seeds lie dormant in the soil, for up to several years, before they start to grow. Whether or not a seed undergoes a period of dormancy is controlled by the temperature that the seeds experienced when they were developing; this in turn is influenced by earlier events, such as when the flowers first developed, and when the plant first started to grow from its seed (a process called germination).</p><p>To try to understand these complex interactions, Springthorpe and Penfield developed a computational model of the major events in the life of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant. Data collected from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants that normally germinate in winter and spring were then used to check whether the model could accurately represent what happens in nature.</p><p>The analysis confirmed that the timing of seed setting depends mostly on the environmental temperature. Springthorpe and Penfield then showed that plants both flowered and set seed earlier in response to increases in temperature, so that the seeds were shed precisely when the temperature was between 14°C and 15°C.</p><p>Springthorpe and Penfield discovered that rise in the average temperature when a plant set seed from 14°C to 15°C had a dramatic effect on the seeds. Almost all of the seeds that developed below 14°C became dormant, while very few of the seeds that developed above 15°C became dormant.</p><p>From their findings, Springthorpe and Penfield predict that the temperature control of flowering time has evolved to constrain when seeds are set and ensure that plants produce a mixture of seeds: some that will become dormant, and some that will not. Their findings also show that modelling the whole life history of an organism has the potential to reveal strategies that are not obvious when studying single events in isolation. If the model was extended to include genetic variation across populations of plants, this approach could give new insights into how individual genes help plants adapt to weather and climate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05557.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05557.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>temperature</kwd><kwd>phenology</kwd><kwd>seed dormancy</kwd><kwd>germination</kwd><kwd>flowering time</kwd><kwd>life history</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Springthorpe</surname><given-names>Vicki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penfield</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Models of plant behaviour show that flowering early in a warming world is an adaptive strategy to insulate progeny seed behaviour from the affects of climate change.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Study of climate effects on phenology have quantified shifts in the timing of developmental transitions such as flowering, bud burst, and migration. These show that warmer temperatures are advancing plant phenology, with bud burst and flowering occurring earlier and the growing season becoming longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menzel and Fabian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cleland et al., 2007</xref>). This is an adaptive plant response to shifting temperatures, because for many species the flowering date is unaffected by climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>), and plants that couple their phenology to temperature are more likely to have populations resilient to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Willis et al., 2008</xref>). Why many plants have evolved to behave in this manner is currently unclear.</p><p>The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is widely distributed in the Northern hemisphere and can be used to analyze phenology, including control by individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>). In northern Europe, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> exhibits a primarily winter annual life history, but in central and southern Europe, summer rapid cycling and summer annuals appear alongside winter annuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thompson, 1994</xref>). Importantly, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is a ruderal species, primarily colonizing frequently disturbed habitats: the long-term persistence of such populations (and therefore fitness) is strongly dependent on seed behaviour and seed bank formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grime et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>During the vegetative phase, plants have signalling pathways that couple progression to flowering to temperature and photoperiodic cues, and these pathways have been elucidated genetically under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrés and Coupland, 2012</xref>). These same pathways are subject to positive selection in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Toomajian et al., 2006</xref>). However, when late flowering <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants are analysed under field conditions they delay reproduction by only a few days, leaving the significance or their role unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Temperature during seed set also strongly influences life history by modulating seed dormancy after shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmuths et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall et al., 2011</xref>), but in contrast to the control of flowering time comparatively little attention has been paid to the role of this process in life history generation and adaptation. Given that the environment during seed set is determined by flowering time, we hypothesized that understanding the role of either flowering time or dormancy control in population life history required a detailed integrated study of both traits. To address this problem, we therefore constructed and parameterized a field-validated model of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> life history for the Columbia-0 (Col-0) accession.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previously, photothermal models have been used to predict <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowering time under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>). In order to predict seed set conditions in the wild, we sought to extend this treatment to include the reproductive phase in order to determine the timing of seed set on plants germinated and grown at different times of the year. To parameterize this model, we first grew plants from bolting to first set seed under a range of temperatures under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found a simple linear relationship between temperature and the number of days from bolting to first seed set, showing that seed set timing depended on ambient temperature. Our data suggested that seed set was much less dependent on photoperiod, with only photoperiods of 8 hr significantly delaying seed set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). With these data, we constructed and optimized a thermal time model from first flowering to first seed set, and compared the predicted timing of seed set to that of plants setting seed under field conditions in York, UK in 2012 and 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The model was a good predictor of seed set timing in the field (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43) for seed set in York in 2012 and 2013, and outperformed models that also included photoperiod components. By combining this with a previously published bolting time model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>), we could predict Col-0 first seed set date for any germination date.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05557.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowering time and seed set control constrain mean temperature at seed shedding for winter and spring annuals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Laboratory experiments from bolting to first seed set at various constant temperatures used to constrain the seed set thermal time model.

Simulated at the most likely collection site, Gorsow, Poland, a key feature of the model is that germination times from September to April (winter and spring annuals) lead to a very similar seed set time in late May (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a behaviour caused in part by growth rate and flowering time control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>) but further enhanced by the seed set responses to temperature. Seed germinating from May to July set seed later in the same summer (rapid cycle), whereas August germinators have a wide range of possible flowering times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>). To understand how this would vary in response to shifting climate norms, we simulated the flowering and seed set models using climate data across a transect covering 25° of latitude from Arkangel'sk, Russia, to Valencia, Spain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Warmer climates advanced the seed set date, with 1°C rises in annual temperature giving about a 7-day advance in seed set time for winter annual cohorts from late June in Arkhangel'sk to early April in Valencia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This behaviour has been widely observed in phenological studies, but our analysis also revealed a striking effect on temperature at first seed set: although mean annual temperature at the sites varied between 0.5°C and 17.5°C, winter annual seed set temperature was maintained at 14–15°C independent of latitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, a key emergent feature of the model is that the acceleration of flowering and seed set timing by warmer temperatures serves to stabilize the temperature range during which seed set begins.</p><p>Lower temperatures during seed production enhance seed dormancy in most angiosperm species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenner, 1991</xref>), but rarely has this response been characterized in detail. Laboratory experiments revealed that Col-0 dormancy appeared related to the mean daily temperature and was not clearly influenced by daily temperature cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To understand precisely how Col-0 seed dormancy responds to temperature during seed set, we matured seeds between 10°C and 20°C in the laboratory and germinated them following incubation treatments at temperatures between 4°C and 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our results revealed a clear bi-phasic behaviour: At or below 14°C, seeds produced are very dormant and do not germinate at high levels even after prolonged incubations under any temperatures. This is not due to low viability because seeds set at 10°C are viable at harvest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, above 14°C, high levels of germination were possible especially where seeds were incubated at similar or lower temperatures than experienced during seed set. At these temperatures, seeds incubated in the dark experienced a transient period of primary dormancy loss during which time germination could occur if the seeds were given light, followed by secondary dormancy induction. This high sensitivity of dormancy to a 1°C increase in seed maturation temperature supports our previous observation of a general increase in the temperature-sensitivity of gene expression in developing seeds relative to vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05557.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The germination physiology of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 in response to temperature during seed set and imbibition.</title><p>Germination of seed matured between 12°C and 18°C incubated in the dark between 4°C and 20°C (see legend) and placed to germinate in the light at 22°C after the indicated time periods.

Primary dormancy loss and secondary dormancy induction were represented as cumulative logistic functions (see ‘Materials and methods’). We noted that secondary dormancy appeared to be induced faster at warmer imbibition temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and fixing this relationship in the model revealed that close matches to experimental data could be produced if initial primary dormancy was modelled as a function of the temperature during seed maturation (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s3 fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 2–4</xref>). In fact, a model with four parameters in which primary dormancy loss was dependent linearly on maturation temperature and secondary dormancy induction was dependent exponentially on imbibition temperature could be parameterised to provide a good fit to experimental data generated between 12 and 20°C (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and could match germination data in an experimental series set at 16°C and not used to train the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In order to determine whether our model could predict the germination of seed set under field conditions, we collected five seed batches during 2012 in a field site in York, UK and germinated them under multiple temperature regimes in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Behaviour of these lots was qualitatively similar to that observed in the laboratory. We then fitted the parameterised model to each field germination data set, generating a prediction for the seed maturation temperature for each seed lot. This was then compared to the temperature history of each batch in the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In each case the model-predicted temperature was close to the daily mean temperature in the last days before harvest for each seed batch, as has been shown previously in barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gualano and Benech-Arnold, 2009</xref>). Therefore, our model captures field-relevant relationships between maturation temperature and germination behaviour.</p><p>To understand the germination potential of seeds set at different times of the year, we ran the model for the locations in our transect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The germination model predicts behaviour with two principle states obvious from the data: Firstly, mean temperatures below 14°C during seed set strongly inhibit germination. Secondly, above 15°C the interaction between maturation temperature and imbibition temperature generally permits high germination rates. This is because faster gain of secondary dormancy after imbibition at warmer temperatures is offset by the lower level of primary dormancy induced during seed maturation. Warmer climates have a longer summer window of high germination until at very warm locations the model predicts germination inhibition at the height of summer, due to fast secondary dormancy induction. Our models show that the predicted transition from dormancy to germination takes place as the seed set temperature rises above 14°C, coinciding with the time of first seed set for winter annual cohorts, regardless of location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, simulated Col-0 phenology generates a coincidence of seed set timing with germination physiology which is independent of climate over 25° of latitude, demonstrating that this aspect of Col-0 phenology is strongly buffered against variation in temperature. Our model predicts that the low dormant progeny will enter a rapid cycle if the climate permits, flowering and setting seed later the same summer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This switch therefore has the potential to control the proportion of seeds entering the seed bank and those that emerge immediately for a rapid cycle generation for production of further seeds.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05557.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Simulation of the interaction of Col-0 life history stages at sub-arctic to sub-tropical sites.</title><p>Germination dates are given on the x-axis.

Thus, these are representative of any natural variants with mild and more severe delays in flowering affecting temperature or photoperiod sensitivity. This is more informative than considering strong <italic>FRI</italic> alleles because these do not substantially delay flowering of winter annuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>). Both <italic>gi</italic> and <italic>vin3</italic> mutants were predicted to set seed later in the year than wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>), producing a greater proportion of seeds above the 14.5°C threshold and theoretically giving rise to more seeds capable of immediate germination. Given the time of year, these germinating seeds would be committed to a rapid cycling life history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

However, until now the significance of the response of primary dormancy to the temperature during seed maturation has not been understood. A central feature of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phenology is the ability to generate genetically identical cohorts of seeds with contrasting life histories, such as winter annuals and rapid cyclers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montesinos-Navarro et al., 2012</xref>). Our data and models show that in a striking coincidence winter annual seeds are set when the mean temperature is approximately 14–15°C, the temperature at which a major switch from the production of dormant to non-dormant seeds occurs. This inevitably divides progeny into at least two distinct cohorts: obligate germinators which become summer rapid cyclers, and seeds which enter the soil seed bank even if initially exposed to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, a similar transition has been observed in <italic>Capsella bursa-pastoris</italic> seeds: in this case there is a transition in seed coat colour during seed set that alters dormancy and correlates with flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Toorop et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seed coat, pigmentation is affected by the temperature during seed set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MacGregor et al., 2015</xref>), again demonstrating control by the mother plant. Similar bet-hedging germination strategies have been described frequently across flowering plants suggesting wide general relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Childs et al., 2010</xref>), but further studies are required to understand whether this is a common strategy for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in locations where temperatures are warm enough to permit life history variation. In addition, our study only considers annual temperature and photoperiod variation and other factors, notably water availability, are also known to strongly affect germination and growth rates.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05557.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Scheme to show the role of winter annual flowering time control in soil seed bank formation.</title><p>Seed bank persistence requires that seed entry rate (production of dormant seeds) exceeds exit rate, the sum of germination, death or deep burial.

This suggests that Col-0 can operate equally well as a summer or winter annual. This prediction is supported by field emergence data, which shows that seed set in the laboratory at 15°C or seed set in the field conditions germinate in the soil in both autumn and spring emergence windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This bet-hedging strategy can therefore be relevant to both summer and winter annual accessions. Previously it has been shown that seeds of the Cape Verde Island accession germinate only in an autumn emergence window in central England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Footitt et al., 2011</xref>), whereas accession Bur-0 shows only a spring emergence window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Footitt et al., 2013</xref>). However, our work shows that winter and spring annual behaviour does not necessarily require different genotypes and are not mutually exclusive strategies. Both spring and autumn germination windows have also been described in coastal but not montane Spanish populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montesinos et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the strategy employed by Col-0 is of wide relevance in some ecological contexts.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05557.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Field emergence time in 2013/14 of Col-0 seed set in the laboratory at 15°C or set in the field in York in spring 2013.</title><p>Data represent the total percentage emergence at 2 weekly intervals of 500 seeds sown for each experiment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05557.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05557.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05557-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In the case of Col-0, winter annual behaviour appears to require (1) a strong slowing of growth rates under low temperatures, showing that growth rate can be as important as leaf number in determining timing of the floral transition in natural populations, and (2) strong tendency towards fast secondary dormancy induction combined with an autumn germination window. In contrast, strong <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> alleles and other late flowering alleles also confer flowering delays primarily on summer germinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>). This achieves winter annual behaviour with a second mechanism that permits early seed germination. The increased prevalence of strong <italic>FLC</italic> alleles at northern latitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shindo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2014</xref>) is good evidence that an advantage of this latter strategy is maximisation of energy capture in short growing seasons through early seedling establishment, rather than generation of winter annual behaviour itself. At mid-latutides stronger <italic>FRI</italic>/<italic>FLC</italic> alleles have the potential to push back seed set of summer germinants into autumn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilczek and et al., 2009</xref>), and during autumn the temperature again passes back through the critical 14–15°C range. This may then stratify the behaviour of progeny seeds of these cohorts.</p><p>In addition to flowering time, latitudinal clines in seed dormancy have also been described, whereby accessions form more northerly latitudes exhibit lower primary dormancy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>). Given that decreasing temperature during seed maturation strongly increases primary dormancy, our analysis suggests that these opposing genetic and environmental trends could offset each other in field conditions allowing maintenance of progeny behavioural strategies. Variation at the <italic>DELAY OF GERMINATION1</italic> (<italic>DOG1</italic>) locus is a major determinant of natural variation in primary seed dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentsink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>) and temperature-regulation of <italic>DOG1</italic> transcript levels during seed maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>) may therefore play an important role in adaptation of seed dormancy to changing temperatures.</p><p>Recent articles also show that it is possible to model <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> populations over several generations using thermal time models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donohue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burghardt et al., 2015</xref>). The process reveals theoretical interactions between primary dormancy and flowering time that can recreate aspects of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phenology observed previously under field conditions at different latitudes, including the ability of Col-0 to adopt winter annual, summer annual, and rapid cycling life histories described here. Our analysis also shows that germination behaviour not included in these models such as temperature regulation of primary dormancy depth and secondary dormancy kinetics are necessary to understand life history control. Combining these two complimentary approaches has the potential to enable a new level of understanding of the diversity of life history strategy in annual plants and their genetic basis.</p><p>A further feature of Col-0 phenology is that the bet-hedging strategy is stable over latitude throughout Europe, except in the far north where temperature is too cool to generate germinating cohorts. It is also stable in respect to simulated warming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), except in respect to time of year of seed set. This surprising lack of local adaptation could facilitate population stability in changing environments or enable rapid colonization of new territories, if timing of seed set was under no further constraints. Understanding the generality of this strategy is therefore of clear importance. Our work suggests that integration of life history modelling with behaviour of genetic variants has the potential to reveal fitness tradeoffs across the whole life history and identify non-obvious selection pressures as emergent features.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth chamber experiments</title><p>For seed production, Col-0 plant were grown in sanyo MLR 350 growth cabinets at 80–100 µmol m² s<sup>−1</sup> white light at 22°C in 16 hr light 8 hr dark cycles until bolting.

The reason we chose them was that <italic>gi</italic> confers are very moderate (7–10 days) delay in field conditions (and not in winter), and <italic>vin3</italic> confers a more substantial delay (20–50 days) all year round. This allows us to analyse the effect of delaying flowering time in general (by any allele, known or unknown, natural or man-made) as well as the effect of both loss-of-functions, which we agree are unlikely to proliferate in nature. Available parameter sets from natural alleles such as <italic>FRI/FLC</italic> do not affect flowering of spring flowering winter annuals (because <italic>FLC</italic> is vernalised away) so it was not informative to consider them in this analysis because they do not cause a delay (at least in the Wilczek 2009 paper parameter sets and field data). Known natural variants of FT and CO may be worth considering but parameter sets for introgressed Col–0 NILs would be required for this analysis. For summer behaviour see response to comment below.</p><p><italic>Indeed, it is understandable that the experimental work is done only for the lab strain Col and not for multiple genotypes that differ also in dormancy levels.

We have added our field-emergence time data for Col–0, which was obtained using methods similar to those used by Footitt and Finch-Savage (see Methods for details). This confirms your view that Col–0 has both a spring and a summer germination window. This has also been observed in coastal Spanish populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montesinos et al., 2009</xref>, now cited and discussed), but in that case it was not clear if the seeds germinating in the two windows were genetically identical (they were just dug from soil seed banks). We agree that it is useful to discuss the cited work and have included all this in a substantial new Discussion section (paragraphs 3 and 4), and the field emergence data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The Discussion has been improved in your revision.

Basically the difference is that these model populations of 1000 plants use only a highly stylised description of seed germination behaviour, with only genetically determined primary dormancy and no secondary dormancy. Our analysis and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17 bib18">Footitt et al., 2011 and 2013</xref> show that environmental control of dormancy depth and secondary dormancy are in fact key responses that determine field germination behaviour, and the behaviour we discuss is only revealed if these are correctly treated. However, combining the two approaches has clear merit, a point which we have emphasised. The two papers do reach one common conclusion that Col–0 is theoretically capable of all known <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> life histories, and this point I have emphasized in the text. In our case this conclusion is confirmed by field data.</p><p>In addition, we have expended to include a discussion of genetic variation in dormancy depth. This is interesting and I think we now understand one aspect of this, that lower dormancy observed in accessions from Northern latitudes in the lab likely functions to offset the effects of colder environments increasing primary dormancy levels. We have discussed the likely roles of natural variation at the DOG1 locus in this apparent adaptive response.</p></body></sub-article></article>
