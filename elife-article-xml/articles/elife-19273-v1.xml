Here we observe that hIAPP fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured pancreatic Î²-cells, leading us to determine the structure and cytotoxicity of protein segments composing the amyloid spine of hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method MicroED, we discover that one segment, 19â29 S20G, forms pairs of Î²-sheets mated by a dry interface that share structural features with and are similarly cytotoxic to full-length hIAPP fibrils. In contrast, a second segment, 15â25 WT, forms non-toxic labile Î²-sheets. These segments possess different structures and cytotoxic effects, however, both can seed full-length hIAPP, and cause hIAPP to take on the cytotoxic and structural features of that segment. These results suggest that protein segment structures represent polymorphs of their parent protein and that segment 19â29 S20G may serve as a model for the toxic spine of hIAPP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19273.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19273.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19273.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In Type-II Diabetes, an individualâs cells fail to respond correctly to the hormone insulin, leaving them unable to counteract high levels of sugar in the blood. Another hormone, human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), works with insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. hIAPP is an amyloid protein, which means that it can lose its normal structure and form fibrils. Fibrils are difficult for cells to break down and are often associated with disease. Indeed, fibrils of hIAPP often form in the pancreas as part of Type-II Diabetes.</p><p>Some studies have shown that hIAPP fibrils are toxic to pancreatic cells and worsen the symptoms of Type-II Diabetes. Others suggest that it is the process of fibril formation that is toxic, not the fibrils themselves. Although the structures of the fibrils have been described, whether these structures cause cell toxicity has not been investigated.</p><p>Krotee et al. have now explored the structures of two overlapping segments of hIAPP using a new cryo electron microscopy method called MicroED that is ideal for studying such segments. One segment, called 19-29 S20G, forms a standard amyloid fibril structure that is similar to the structure of full-length hIAPP fibrils. Adding these segments to human cells causes similar levels of toxicity as the full-length hIAPP fibrils. The second segment, called 15-25 WT, forms a non-toxic structure that is less stable than standard amyloid fibrils.</p><p>The results presented by Krotee et al. support the view that standard amyloid fibril structures are toxic to cells and suggest that 19-29 S20G may be a good model to use when studying how full-length hIAPP fibrils behave. The structure of 19-29 S20G may also be useful as a template for designing molecules that block amyloid fibril growth. If amyloid fibrils cause cell toxicity in the pancreas, then these molecules could be used to treat Type-II Diabetes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19273.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19273.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>islet amyloid polypeptide</kwd><kwd>amyloid fibril</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>MicroED</kwd><kwd>Type-II Diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG029430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krotee</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawaya</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><name><surname>Cascio</surname><given-names>Duilio</given-names></name><name><surname>Griner</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krotee</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawaya</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><name><surname>Cascio</surname><given-names>Duilio</given-names></name><name><surname>Reyes</surname><given-names>Francis E</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Hattne</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name><name><surname>Nannenga</surname><given-names>Brent L</given-names></name><name><surname>Griner</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonen</surname><given-names>Tamir</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>VetenskapsrÃ¥det</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR 2015-02297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oskarsson</surname><given-names>Marie E</given-names></name><name><surname>Westermark</surname><given-names>Gunilla T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Diabetes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oskarsson</surname><given-names>Marie E</given-names></name><name><surname>Westermark</surname><given-names>Gunilla T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007625</institution-id><institution>Cure Alzheimer's Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philipp</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name><name><surname>Glabe</surname><given-names>Charles G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atomic structures of hIAPP fibrillar segments, determined using the cryo electron microscopy method MicroED, reveal that strong, stable intermolecular interactions are important features of cytotoxic amyloid proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid fibrils are associated with more than 25 diseases, including Alzheimerâs disease, Parkinsonâs disease, and Type-II Diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012</xref>). The fibrils observed in each disease are composed of a particular protein; in T2D, amyloid fibrils are composed of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Westermark et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper et al., 1988</xref>). hIAPP is a 37 residue polypeptide hormone that is co-secreted with insulin to modulate glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roberts et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Westermark et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Researchers have accumulated substantial evidence for a correlation between hIAPP aggregation and pancreatic Î²-cell death in the course of the disease, T2D. Approximately 90% of pancreatic tissue samples taken post-mortem from T2D patients contain islet amyloid primarily composed of hIAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">HÃ¶ppener et al., 2000</xref>). The extent of islet amyloid positively correlates with pancreatic Î²-cell loss and insulin dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maloy et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esapa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jurgens et al., 2011</xref>). Additional support for a link comes from comparison of human and mouse IAPP: mouse IAPP differs from human IAPP by only six residues, 3 of which are Î²-strand breaking prolines. Consequently, mouse IAPP does not aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nishi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Westermark et al., 1990</xref>). Moreover, mice can be induced to develop islet amyloid and T2D when they are engineered to express human IAPP and fed a high fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Verchere et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Westermark et al., 2000</xref>). Perhaps the strongest support for a link is the mutation in hIAPP, hIAPP-S20G; segments that contain this mutation aggregate more quickly, contribute to increased pancreatic Î²-cell apoptosis, and are associated with early onset T2D in families who carry this lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sakagashira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sakagashira et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morita et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although a link between hIAPP aggregation and pancreatic Î²-cell death is well established, precisely which type of hIAPP aggregate contributes to pancreatic Î²-cell death and insulin dependence remains undetermined. Using mostly in vitro studies, researchers have presented evidence for toxicity of multiple types of hIAPP aggregates. Early studies suggest that amyloid fibrils are the primary cytotoxic species because preparations that contain fibrillar hIAPP were more cytotoxic than soluble preparations of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenzo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lorenzo and Yankner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schubert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapurniotu, 2001</xref>). Using cells and transgenic rodents as disease models, other studies found hIAPP fibrils to be associated with apoptosis, Î²-cell loss, and T2D severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">O'Brien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiddinga and Eberhardt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hull et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pilkington et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, some studies show that the process of hIAPP fibril formation, not the amyloid fibrils themselves, is the source of toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schlamadinger and Miranker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oskarsson et al., 2015</xref>). However, most current research studies suggest soluble pre-fibrillar oligomers are the primary type of toxic aggregate. Support for oligomers as the primary cytotoxic species comes from the observation of oligomers associated with caspase activity and ER stress, which precede the formation of extracellular amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ritzel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mukherjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haataja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedini et al., 2016</xref>). Several recent studies show that hIAPP fibrils are relatively inert and do not exert obvious toxicity. Despite these extensive in vitro studies, it is not clear that the toxic aggregates they describe also elicit toxicity in vivo.</p><p>In closer agreement with earlier studies, we find that hIAPP preparations that contain fibrils are cytotoxic to a rat pancreatic Î²-cell line, thus motivating us to determine the structure of the spine of hIAPP fibrils. If fibrils are a bona fide type of toxic aggregate in vivo, then determining the atomic structure of the spine of hIAPP fibrils is a logical approach for advancing our understanding of disease-relevant targetsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiltzius et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soriaga et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we can utilize atomic structures as templates for structure-based design of novel therapeutics that may protect against pancreatic Î²-cell death. Although full-length amyloid proteins have so far been resistant to crystallization, select protein segments that form the spines of amyloid fibrils do form crystals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sawaya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the atomic structures of nearly 90 amyloid spines have been revealed in this manner. Other studies have taken an alternative approach: they employed solid-state NMR to gain detailed structural insights into hIAPP fibril structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weirich et al., 2016</xref>); some of these structures have spurred successful inhibitor designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mirecka et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we use the cryoEM method MicroED to determine the atomic structure of two 11-residue segments, termed spine segments, that span the amyloid spine of hIAPP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>hIAPP preparations that contain fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured rat pancreatic Î²-cells</title><p>To compare the cytotoxic effects of oligomeric and fibrillar hIAPP, we generated hIAPP preparations that contained either amyloid oligomers or fibrils.

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiltzius et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soriaga et al., 2015</xref>). To assess Î²-sheet curvature, we compared the root mean square deviations (RMSDâs) of sheets from planarity across all hIAPP protein segment atomic structures determined to date (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The 19â29 S20G structure ranks in the upper half of the list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), containing both sheet curvature and a sharp kink. Most of the shorter peptides are nearly flat, but some have sharp kinks. The significance of deviation from planarity is not yet clear.</p><p>The similarity between the fiber diffraction pattern calculated from this steric-zipper and the fiber diffraction pattern collected from full-length hIAPP fibrils tends to validate the 19â29 S20G atomicÂ structure as a model for the amyloid spine of full-length hIAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The diffraction patterns share several key features, including reflections at 4.7 Ã and 2.4 Ã along the meridian, a reflection at 3.7 Ã along the off-meridian (left panel), and reflections at 10.0 Ã and 5.0 Ã along the equator (right panel).</p><p>Structural studies performed here and elsewhere by others suggest that 19â29 WT can form a similar dry interface to the one observed in the 19â29 S20G atomic structure. Radial profiles calculated from X-ray fiber diffraction of 19â29 WT and 19â29 S20G fibrils show strong reflections in common at 4.6 Ã, 8.4 Ã and 8.7 Ã, and 34.7 Ã, indicative of interstrand, intersheet, and proto-filament spacing, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). A previous study of 20â29 WT fiber diffraction revealed comparable reflections, which the authors used to formulate a fibril model of 20â29 WT that roughly agrees with our 19â29 S20G atomic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madine et al., 2008</xref>). Our atomic structure and their model differ by a small shift in registration between sheets, allowing for tighter packing in the atomic structure. These results are consistent with earlier findings by Cao and co-workers, who observed that hIAPP-WT fibrils seed hIAPP-S20G fibril formation, thus suggesting a shared fibrillar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the WT and mutant segments likely form similar structures, the structure of the mutant segment may be more stable. The stability of the mutant segment may stem from the early onset Gly20 mutation, which adopts an unusual geometry (ÏÂ =Â â101.7Â° and ÏÂ =Â 107.5Â°) that creates a kink in the peptide backbone. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated a model of 19â29 WT consisting of a mated pair of ten-stranded sheets. The model was identical to the 19â29 S20G atomic structure with the exception that we adjusted the backbone torsion angles of Ser20 to comply with the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for a non-glycine residue. We compared the energies of the WT and S20G structures after minimization with FoldIt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2010</xref>). The dry interfaces are nearly identical between the two segments, except near Asn21, where the altered backbone torsion angles break the canonical Asn ladder hydrogen bonding interactions with neighboring Asn21 residues within the sheet and instead, form hydrogen bonds with Ser29 from the opposing sheet. The alteration separates the pair of sheets by approximately 1.5 Ã in this region, and therefore the 19â29 S20G structure has a slightly lower energy than 19â29 WT (â590 REU vs. â535 REU).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Segment 15â25 WT forms an arrangement of labile unmated Î²-sheets</title><p>The atomic structure of segment 15â25 WT, also determined using MicroED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), shows an arrangement of unmated Î²-sheets composed of anti-parallel out-of-register Î²-strands that is uncharacteristic of pathogenic amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).Â Most pathogenic amyloid fibrils are composed of Î²-strands that stack perpendicular to the sheet-long axis, but the Î²-strands in out-of-register structures stack at an angle. Deviation of strands from the fibril perpendicular is a natural consequence of the registration shift implied by out-of-register structures. The out-of-register Î²-strands are stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding. Within each sheet, the Î²-strands form two distinct, unequal interfaces: a stronger interface with twelve hydrogen bonds, and a weaker interface with eight hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This inequality between interfaces has been observed in previous examples of out-of-register sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soriaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laganowsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). A view down the âproto-fibril axisâ of the crystal shows that the faces of adjacent sheets are wet and overlap only partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); the asymmetric unit contains density for seven ordered water molecules and one thiocyanate molecule. The area buried between adjacent sheets is small (10.7 Ã<sup>2</sup> per residue) compared to the average steric-zipper (20.1 Ã<sup>2</sup> per residue). Hence, there is no dry interface between adjacent sheets in the crystal, and the structure seems labile compared to that of 19â29 S20G.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19273.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Segment 15â25 WT forms an arrangement of unmated Î²-sheets that is uncharacteristic of pathogenic amyloid fibrils.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron micrograph of 3D crystals used for data collection.

We tested the cytotoxicity of the total, insoluble and soluble fractions of the 19â29 S20G sample to HEK293 cells using MTT dye reduction. We observe that the insoluble fraction, which contains amyloid fibrils, is similarly cytotoxic to the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), just as we observed with full-length hIAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggest that 19â29 S20G may form the toxic spine of full-length hIAPP.</p><p>Further evidence that 19â29 S20G may form the toxic spine of full-length hIAPP comes from our observation that (â)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a flavanol known to mitigate full-length hIAPP cytotoxicity by preventing hIAPP from forming fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meng et al., 2010</xref>), also mitigates 19â29 S20G cytotoxicity by preventing it from forming fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>). We hypothesize that EGCG may mitigate fibril formation of full-length hIAPP and 19â29 S20G by binding to a common site, such as the dry interface of the amyloid spine. A previous study suggested EGCG may mitigate hIAPP fibril formation by binding hIAPP via hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Young et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, EGCG does not prevent fibril formation of 15â25 WT, which does not possess a dry hydrophobic interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). In addition, these results further support our conclusion that preparations of segment 19â29 S20G that contain fibrils are cytotoxic.</p><p>Next we tested whether the spine segments activate pro-apoptotic machinery using a FRET-based biosensor assay for monitoring caspase-3 activity in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Paulsson et al., 2008</xref>). In this assay, CHO cells are stably transfected with a construct containing enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fused by a DEVD linker. FRET signal is observed by exciting ECFP at 440 nm. In cells undergoing apoptosis, active caspase-3-like proteases target and cleave the DEVD linker, resulting in loss of FRET signal. Cell viability is measured by monitoring the ratio of 540 nm/480 nm, which reports loss of FRET signal and increased caspase-3 activity.</p><p>Using this system, we observe that segment 19â29 S20G elicits the most caspase-dependent cytotoxicity of the spine segments and segments 15â25 are not cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Segment 19â29 S20G is not as cytotoxic as full-length hIAPP in this assay, possibly because hIAPP interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) is important for apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oskarsson et al., 2015</xref>), and residues 1â8, which are missing in all of the spine segments, are required for hIAPP binding to HSPGâs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Fibril seeds of 15â25 WT reduce the cytotoxicity of full-length hIAPP</title><p>Given that the spine segments seed full-length hIAPP fibril formation and that 19â29 S20G and 15â25 WT fibrils elicit different cytotoxic effects, we investigated whether seeding with either of the spine segments alters hIAPP cytotoxicity.

Over a century later, multiple studies have shown an unequivocal link between hIAPP aggregation and T2D, but uncertainty remains about which type of hIAPP aggregate contributes to pancreatic Î²-cell death. Although most recent in vitro studies suggest soluble oligomers are the primary type of toxic aggregate, here, we find hIAPP samples that contain fibrils alter pancreatic Î²-cell metabolism and activate pro-apoptotic caspases.</p><p>These findings motivated us to determine the structure of the spine of hIAPP fibrils and elucidate structural features important for hIAPP cytotoxicity. To improve our likelihood of crystallization and structure determination, we selected four protein segments that span the spine. We discovered that segment 19â29 S20G forms a pair of Î²-sheets mated at a dry interface, a structure that shares key features with full-length hIAPP fibrils as described in the following paragraph. Whatâs more, the fibrillar form of 19â29 S20G is cytotoxic. In contrast, segment 15â25 WT forms an unusual arrangement of single, out-of-register Î²-sheets that are not cytotoxic. The divergence in structure and cytotoxicity of segments 19â29 S20G and 15â25 WT suggests that strong, stable intermolecular interactions are important features of cytotoxic amyloid proteins.</p><p>The experiments of this study show that the 19â29 S20G atomic structure recapitulates many of the structural features and cytotoxic properties of hIAPP. First, preparations of 19â29 S20G that contain fibrils are cytotoxic, as is the case for full-length hIAPP. Second, X-ray fiber diffraction calculated from the dry interface of the 19â29 S20G atomic structure shares key features with fiber diffraction collected from full-length hIAPP fibrils. Third, segment 19â29 S20G elicits cytotoxicity by altering cell metabolism and activating pro-apoptotic machinery, mechanisms by which full-length hIAPP fibrils are thought to contribute to pancreatic Î²-cell death during T2D. Fourth, the early onset S20G mutation confers greater cytotoxicity within segment 19â29 and within full-length hIAPP. Last, EGCG, a flavanol that mitigates full-length hIAPP fibril formation and cytotoxicity, likewise mitigates 19â29 S20G fibril formation and cytotoxicity. These results, taken together with the canonical pathogenic amyloid fibril architecture of segment 19â29 S20G, suggest it represents the toxic amyloid spine of hIAPP.</p><p>Our studies begin to provide a framework for understanding which hIAPP fibril polymorphs may contribute to pancreatic Î²-cell death during T2D. Previous structural studies of hIAPP protein segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiltzius et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soriaga et al., 2015</xref>) and full-length hIAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weirich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldsbury et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kajava et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedrood et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wineman-Fisher et al., 2015</xref>) identified an array of structures with diverse side-chain and sheet arrangements; the 15 hIAPP protein segment structures that overlap the hIAPP amyloid spine belong to six different steric-zipper classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These multiple diverse structures suggest there is significant polymorphism within the hIAPP amyloid spine, but exactly which of these polymorphs elicit cytotoxicity was not known. By studying the structures and cytotoxic effects of protein segments in parallel, we identify a cytotoxic hIAPP fibril structure that may contribute to pancreatic Î²-cell death during T2D.

In the dry interface of the 19â29 S20G atomic structure, the curved Î²-sheets accommodate the tightly packed hydrophobic core, which includes a bulky phenylalanine, while maintaining high shape complementarity and large buried surface area. Paradoxically, in the 15â25 WT atomic structure, the curved Î²-sheets appear to have an opposite effect: the curved Î²-sheets appear to prevent adjacent sheets from associating to form a canonical pathogenic amyloid fibril architecture. In both atomic structures, the effect of the curved Î²-sheets is dictated by the registry of adjacent Î²-sheets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The 15â25 WT atomic structure joins the recently discovered class of out-of-register protein segment structures, which exert disparate cytotoxic effects. Here, we show that 15â25 WT is not cytotoxic but in contrast, the out-of-register protein segment KDWSFY from Î²2-microglobulin elicits mild cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). One notable difference between the two structures is that the 15â25 WT structure is formed of single sheets, while the KDWSFY structure is formed of sheets mated by a dry interface. The dry interface of the KDWSFY atomic structure results in a higher solvation energy per strand compared to the 15â25 WT atomic structure (122 cal/mol/strand vs. 19 cal/mol/strand). Given that cytotoxic structures like 19â29 S20G have relatively high solvation energies per strand (279 cal/mol/strand; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), this difference may explain the disparate cytotoxic effects of the two out-of-register structures. However, we need more studies of out-of-register protein structures and their cognate cytotoxic effects to definitively make this conclusion. The disparate cytotoxic effects within this structure class lead us to believe that the nature of cytotoxicity is not simply conferred by in-register or out-of-register structures. As many studies have suggested, there may be more than one mechanism of amyloid-related toxicity and the different mechanisms may be catalyzed by different architectures. Alternatively, maybe if additional residues were included, the anti-parallel out-of-register fiber could be stabilized, thereby increasing its toxicity.</p><p>Although the 19â29 WT fibrils prepared in this study appear morphologically similar to 19â29 S20G fibrils, the 19â29 WT fibrils are likely polymorphic and may contain some fraction of fibrils that are structurally similar to non-toxic 15â25 WT fibrils. Previous structural studies of segment 20â29 WT fibrils show that it forms an array of polymorphs, some of which are similar to the 15â25 WT atomic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Griffiths et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburn et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nielsen et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Nir Ben-Tal, and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript addresses the important and controversial topic of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) toxicity via a mostly structural study. The work is technically excellent, the use of Cryo electron microscopy-based MicroED is highly suitable for the scientific quest and the addition of the biological data is very important. The main conclusion is that the fibrillar form of hIAPP segment 19-29S20G is toxic, but its oligomeric form is not. In addition, in- or out-of registration/hydrophobicity of the four IAPP segments of interest in fibrillation is insufficient to account for the observed differential toxicity. This study concludes that 19-29S20G could be used as a model system for examining hIAPP aggregation and toxicity. The work is elegant and it provides important insights on the cytotoxicity of the polypeptide that is associated with Type II diabetes. The conclusions are consistent with the experimental results and the Discussion is very good. On the other hand, it is somewhat surprising that this manuscript heavily emphasizes on cytotoxicity â a not so very original point of this study, while the more novel structural observations are only mentioned in passing. If revised, it could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors make it appear as if fibrils (and not oligomers or other intermediates) are generally considered as the major cytotoxic species of IAPP.

The current description might be motivated by bad experiences with journal editors or referees who frequently dismiss all work on fibrils as being irrelevant and notoriously believe the pathology of any protein misfolding disease to solely depend on oligomers. This concept, while being too simple minded, is wide spread and causes numerous problems when attempting to publish solid scientific work.

Since toxicity is the biological endpoint of a chemical (e.g., ROS), physical (amyloids, oligomers and their associated hydrophobicity/membrane partitioning, assembly kinetics, assembly with intra- and extracellular proteins) or biological (the triangle between insulin, amylin and glucose etc.) trigger, it seems to make more sense that it is the combined contributions of these aspects, different for hIAPP fibrils and oligomers in each aspect, induce the toxicity of hIAPP.</p><p>2) If indeed the fibrillar form of the polypeptide is the toxic element, could antibodies raised against this form be a treatment for Type II diabetes?

The above statements should be amended.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for noting the important difference between in vitro and in vivo studies, which we now mention in the third paragraph of the Introduction. We do not, however, get into the mechanism of hIAPP action on cells; we restrict ourselves to reporting our observations of toxicity without proposing a mechanism. Our private hypothesis is that the mechanism may involve both mature fibrils and smaller species, perhaps short fibrils. That is, amyloid fibril deposition leads to distortion of the histological structure of the affected organ. Islet hormone release is dependent on the islet architecture and regulated insulin release requires cell-cell interaction via connexin-36. When hIAPP amyloid deposits extracellularly it results in separation of the Î² cells and loss of synchronized hormone release. Islet amyloid occurs perivascular and sometimes prominent deposits occur, possibly influencing diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. Whereas mature amyloid fibrils may exert no direct Î² cell cytotoxicity, amyloid fibrils somehow affect islet function, and the results of our paper may contribute to the ultimate understanding of the mechanism.</p><p>Although we do not propose a mechanism, we report one experiment that may bear on it. With our FRET-based amyloid toxicity assay, we showed that the amyloid fibril formation-process induced toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). An earlier study using the same assay revealed that the fibril formation-process is cytotoxic when it took place in contact with the cell surface, and the toxicity ceased when fibril formation was halted (Oskarsson, 2015, JBC). Thus, our data support that hIAPP-amyloid fibril formation induces cell toxicity, but amyloid fibrils neutralize the toxicity.</p><p><italic>The following statement was used to support that residues 15-29 are important for toxicity: &quot;previous work by our laboratory has shown that Phe15 is required for stabilizing an on-pathway Î±-helical dimer and that mutating this residue can delay aggregation&quot;. However, it solely describes aggregation and not toxicity. Please amend.</italic> </p><p>We amended the wording to make our intended statement clearer. It now reads: âThird, previous work by our laboratory has shown that Phe15 may be part of the amyloid spine because it is required for stabilizing an on-pathway Î±-helical dimer and mutating this residue can delay fibril formation (Wiltzius et al., 2009).â</p><p><italic>&quot;The cytotoxicity of hIAPP resides mainly in its fibrillar form&quot; and &quot;here, we offer support for mature amyloid fibrils as a major type of aggregate responsible for islet cell death by showing that fibrillar hIAPP is significantly more cytotoxic to cultured pancreatic Î²-cells than pre-fibrillar forms&quot;. These statements are questionable as the presently reported cytotoxicity measurements did not explicitly test oligomer samples.</italic> </p><p>In order to address this revision and essential revisions #5 and #6, we repeated the cytotoxicity studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> with some modifications. The most important modification was that we used half the concentration of IAPP that we used in our original studies. This modification allowed us to test the cytotoxicity of oligomer and fibril preparations.</p><p>Using the LOC antibody, we detect fibrillar oligomers in the âhIAPP 0 hâ preparation. Although the LOC antibody was raised against hIAPP fibrils, previous studies show that it binds to fibrillar oligomers of amyloid-Î² (Wu, 2010, JBC). Fibrillar oligomers are structurally distinct from pre-fibrillar oligomers, which are recognized by the A11 antibody.</p><p>Using two metrics of cytotoxicity, we find that hIAPP preparations that contain these fibrillar oligomers are significantly less cytotoxic than hIAPP preparations that contain fibrils and no detectable oligomers. The full description of these results starts in the subsection âhIAPP preparations that contain fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured rat pancreatic Î²-cellsâ.</p><p>The above statements were amended to reflect our updated cytotoxicity studies. They now read: âWe observe that hIAPP preparations that contain fibrils are significantly more cytotoxic to rat pancreatic Î²-cells than hIAPP preparations that contain oligomers but no detectable fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>)â; and âIn closer agreement with earlier studies, we find that hIAPP preparations that contain fibrils are cytotoxic to rat pancreatic Î²-cells, thus motivating us to determine the structure of the spine of hIAPP fibrils.â</p><p><italic>The origin of divergence in the literature regarding the identity of the toxic entity perhaps has to do with the rapid fibrillation rate of hIAPP compared with, say, amyloid-Î², where isolation of hIAPP monomers, oligomers, protofibrils and mature fibrils is nontrivial, as the authors also acknowledged.

But we do not have evidence for mechanism, so we prefer not to discuss this thoroughly. However, we acknowledge the potential disconnect between toxic aggregates identified in vitro and toxic aggregates present in vivo in the third paragraph of the Introduction and we briefly mention the possibility of multi-variable toxicity in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) If indeed the fibrillar form of the polypeptide is the toxic element, could antibodies raised against this form be a treatment for Type II diabetes? Unlike the case of amyloid-Î² vaccination, the risk of meningoencephalitis is not a concern.</italic> </p><p>Presumably, yes.

Does it suggest that the structural properties of protein monomers/amyloids may not be the only source to explain toxicity?</italic> </p><p>One potential cause for the different cytotoxic effects of the 2 out-of-register protein segments is whether or not the out-of-register sheets are mated. Mildly cytotoxic protein segment KDWSFY from Î²-2 microglobulin has sheets mated by a dry interface, but non-toxic hIAPP 15-25 WT is composed of single sheets. The dry interface of the KDWSFY crystal structure results in higher solvation energy per strand compared to the 15-25 WT crystal structure (122 cal/mol/strand vs. 19 cal/mol/strand). Given that cytotoxic structures like 19-29 S20G have high solvation energies per strand (279 cal/mol/strand; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), this difference may explain the disparate cytotoxic effects of the two out-of-register structures. However, we need more studies of out-of-register protein structures and their cognate cytotoxicity effects to definitively make this conclusion.</p><p>We added this observation to the Discussion of this revised submission (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) It might be beneficial to compare the overall hydrophobicity and charge of the four segments to decipher their differential toxicity as reported in this paper.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for making this suggestion. To investigate this and to compare the structures of shorter hIAPP protein segments previously determined, we added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, which lists many structural and biophysical features of the 15 protein segment crystal structures from hIAPP, including the structures described in this study.</p><p>Spine segments 19-29 S20G and 15-25 WT possess similar charges (0 and 0.1 at pH 7, respectively) and only slightly different hydrophobicity values (0.25 and 0.29, respectively) compared to other hIAPP protein segments for which we have crystal structures. Furthermore, the overall charge and hydrophobicity values for cytotoxic full-length hIAPP, (2.1 at pH 7 and â 0.097) are not particularly similar to any of the charges or hydrophobicity values for the protein segments described here. It is difficult to associate 1 biophysical characteristic with cytotoxicity as we only have cytotoxicity data for the 4 protein segments described in this study. Nonetheless, since we observe that the hydrophobicity values for the protein segments described here are close to the average hydrophobicity value for all hIAPP protein segments ever characterized (average = 0.11), we presume overall hydrophobicity and charge of the segments do not fully explain their differential toxicity. It seems more likely that their differential cytotoxicity is better explained by their divergent structures.</p><p><italic>5) All &quot;cytotoxicity&quot; data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> are solely based on the MTT assay, which is known to sometimes produce false positive results. See, for example J Biol Chem. 2014 289: 35781-94. These measurements need to be confirmed with another assay.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge the potential issues of the MTT assay. Of note, in the JBC paper cited by the reviewers, the researchers discovered that only fragmented fibrils, not unfragmented fibrils like those used in our studies, produced false positive results in the MTT assay. Additionally, as the reviewers point out in essential revision #1, our studies described in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> did not explicitly test oligomer samples. Thus, we repeated the cytotoxicity studies with some modifications in order to address these 2 essential revisions and essential revision #6.</p><p>By halving the concentration of IAPP that we used in our original studies, we were able to generate oligomer and fibril preparations of hIAPP. In the âhIAPP 0 hâ preparation, we detect only fibrillar oligomers and in the âhIAPP 24 hâ preparation, we detect only amyloid fibrils.</p><p>We tested the cytotoxicity of the samples using the MTT assay and a luminescence-based caspase-3/7 detection assay in parallel. Active caspase-3 and caspase-7 proteases are markers of apoptosis (Budihardjo, 1999, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol). Both assays show that âhIAPP 24 h,â which contains fibrils and no detectable oligomers, is significantly more cytotoxic than âhIAPP 0 h,â which contains only oligomers. Furthermore, we find that the insoluble fraction of the cytotoxic âhIAPP 24 hâ sample is more cytotoxic than the soluble fraction of the sample, providing more evidence for cytotoxicity of fibrils in our studies. We added the results of these studies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript. A full description of this study is in the subsection âhIAPP preparations that contain fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured rat pancreatic Î²-cellsâ.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: the &quot;dot blot&quot; with hIAPP is not of suitable quality for evaluation, as it only shows a black image. No conclusion is possible based on these data.</italic> </p><p>As stated in our response to essential revisions #1 and #5, we repeated the cytotoxicity studies described in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> using a modified setup in order to address the reviewersâ comments on the MTT assay and the absence of oligomers.</p><p>Additionally, we performed dot blot assays of the samples used in the cytotoxicity studies with 25 different conformational antibodies known to recognize soluble oligomers. Only one of these antibodies, LOC, gave a robust and consistent result across biological triplicates. We replaced the original dot blot results with the LOC dot blot results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Professor Charles Glabe and Dr. Stephan Philipp from UC Irvine tested our samples with the 25 different conformational antibodies and thus are now co-authors of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is not able to show a templating of toxicity by a fragment onto full-length IAPP. The 10% 19-29 S20G fibril seeds produced the same toxicity as full-length hIAPP without seeds, while 15-25 WT seeds reduced toxicity. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is probably that 19-29 S20G fibril seeds did not affect the formation of toxic species from hIAPP, while 15-25 WT seeds interact with hIAPP to reduce its toxicity. We do not see how this experiment justifies the conclusion that there is seeding of toxic activity.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewersâ interpretation of the result with hIAPP seeded with toxic 19-29 S20G fibrils. This result does not appear to show a templating of toxicity by a fragment onto full- length hIAPP. However, the result with hIAPP seeded with non-toxic 15-25 WT fibrils may be explained by (1) our interpretation of templating growth of fibrils of relatively low toxicity or (2) by the reviewersâ interpretation of seed interacting with hIAPP to reduce its toxicity. Both interpretations seem reasonable considering that 15-25 WT fibrils template full-length hIAPP fibril formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> in the revised manuscript). We include both interpretations in the revised manuscript. See subsection âFibril seeds of 15-25 WT reduce the cytotoxicity of full-length hIAPPâ, third paragraph.</p><p><italic>8) What could/should be emphasized much more clearly (specifically in the Discussion) are the following issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The current cross-Î² sheets are concave or convex when you look down the spine axis. This curvature is a major difference to Madine et al., 2008, and probably also most previous steric zippers consisting of short chains. What does this curvature mean or what enforces it?</italic> </p><p>This subject is addressed more fully in the amended manuscript. The Î²-sheets in the crystal structures presented here are curved compared to shorter hIAPP protein segments previously determined. To quantify Î²-sheet deviation from planarity across all protein segment crystal structures, we calculated their standard deviation of atoms from a best-fit plane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Many of the previous steric-zippers are very flat, but some including the 15-25 WT and 19-29 S20G crystal structures are in the top half of deviation magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Some of the sheets have sharp kinks rather than gradual curves. 19-29 S20G has both. The meaning of the deviations from planarity is not yet clear. These values are included in the newly added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and discussed in the Results section.</p><p>Our private hypothesis is that kinking and curvature are two mechanisms by which Î²-sheets may increase the interactions with neighboring sheets. In other words, kinks and curvature impart plasticity to the otherwise strictly planar Î²-sheet so it may conform to the shape of an adjacent surface to produce tighter dry interfaces (as in the case of 19-29 S20G) or optimize crystal contacts (as in the case of 15-25 WT). Indeed, our modeling studies showed without the kink introduced by the S20G mutation, the 19-29 segment cannot form as tight of a dry interface (see last paragraph in the subsection âSegment 19-29 S20G forms pairs of Î²-sheets tightly mated by a dry interfaceâ).</p><p>We speculate that kinking and curvature are likely to be observed more frequently with increasingly longer segments, since longer segments are likely to have greater variation in side chain lengths and kinks and curves provide additional degrees of freedom for sheets of varying thickness to mate more tightly.</p><p>Moreover, we think that kinked sheets are likely to be more common for in-register sheets than out-of-register sheets. We speculate that if the 15-25 WT segment could kink in addition to curving, the new shape would afford another chance that it may conform tightly with neighboring sheets. However, there is likely to be a high energy barrier to introducing a kink in the sheet formed by the 15-25 WT segment because the sheet lacks alignment of glycine residues, which assists with kink formation. Recall that kink formation requires a crease to propagate through the entire length of the sheet. Because the 15-25 WT structure is out of register, Gly24 residues do not align in a continuous line.</p><p><italic>B) Associated with this observation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows different backbone distances at the outer ends of the zipper and in the center. This variation of the packing distance could be an important new observation.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To investigate this question, we measured the standard deviation in sheet-to-sheet distance for all hIAPP protein segment structures determined to date. The variation of packing distance appears to accommodate the variation in side-chain sizes protruding from the sheet. This observation is noted in the revised text and it is also included in the newly added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>C) Most steric zippers have the strands oriented perpendicular to the sheet long axis. This is not the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Why?</italic> </p><p>Indeed, most steric-zippers are formed of Î²-strands stacked perpendicular to the sheet long axis. We describe such zippers as âin-register.â A few years ago, our group discovered steric-zipper structures that are formed of Î²-strands that stack at an angle to the sheet long axis. We describe these zippers as âout-of-register.â Deviation of strands from the fibril perpendicular is a natural consequence of the registration shift implied by out-of-register structures. The 15-25 WT crystal structure presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is an example of the out-of-register-steric-zippers.</p><p>To date, only 4 out-of-register steric-zippers have been identified and the significance of the out- of-register stacking of Î²-strands is not yet well established. It is possible that the out-of-register stacking could infer tendencies for the sheet to roll into a cylinder, like cylindrin does (Laganowsky, 2012, Science). The 4 out-of-register steric-zippers are formed of protein segments derived from Î²-2 microglobulin (Liu, 2012, PNAS), prion protein (Yu, 2015, Biochemistry), and IAPP (Soriaga, 2015, J Phys Chem Bio) suggesting out-of-register stacking is a shared feature of amyloid proteins.</p><p>We expanded our description of out-of-register protein structures in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p><italic>D) How does the current packing of the zippers relate to the ones seen in earlier zipper described for IAPP (Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology 16, 973 â 978, 2009)? Do the small zippers show the same interactions as the large ones? If not, what does it mean for the specificity of the side-chain interactions in the fibril?</italic> </p><p>Crystal structures of shorter hIAPP protein segments exhibit an array of sheet and side-chain interactions, which we term polymorphism. Even shorter protein segments that fully overlap with the 11-residue spine segments described in this work exhibit significant polymorphism. We list the steric-zipper classes and other structural features of each protein segment in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and we examine the polymorphism across the structures starting in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Furthermore, full-length hIAPP fibril models derived from solid-state NMR studies (Luca, 2007, Biochemistry) also suggest variable side-chain interactions in fibrils. Taken together with the 15 crystal structures of hIAPP protein segments, we surmise that there is some flexibility of side- chain interactions in the fibril.</p><p>Nonetheless, the extensive size of the 19-29 S20G dry interface implies it is particularly stable. In comparison, the zippers in our earlier publications have fewer residues and hence, smaller interfaces.</p></body></sub-article></article>
