transcriptional activators. Adipogenic signals activate early adipogenic activators and facilitate the transient formation of early enhanceosomes at target genes. These enhancer regions are subsequently inherited by late enhanceosomes. PPARγ is one of the late adipogenic activators and is known as a master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the factors that regulate PPARγ expression remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 23 (TRIM23), stabilizes PPARγ protein and mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation. TRIM23 knockdown caused a marked decrease in PPARγ protein abundance during preadipocyte differentiation, resulting in a severe defect in late adipogenic differentiation, whereas it did not affect the formation of early enhanceosomes. Our results suggest that TRIM23 plays a critical role in the switching from early to late adipogenic enhanceosomes by stabilizing PPARγ protein possibly via atypical polyubiquitin conjugation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05615.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05615.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05615.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The world is facing a global epidemic of obesity, which also increases the risk for diabetes and heart disease. Obesity is caused when excess fat is stored in fat cells, and overweight individuals have larger fat cells compared to healthy weight people. Therefore understanding how fat cells are created in the body can provide new ways to combat obesity.</p><p>Fat cells, also known as adipocytes, arise from precursor cells via a process called adipogenesis. This requires the activity of proteins called transcription factors that bind to DNA and switch on the expression of genes. PPARγ is an important transcription factor that drives the expression of the genes that are needed to convert a precursor cell to a mature adipocyte.</p><p>For adipogenesis to proceed, cells have to maintain the appropriate levels of PPARγ. If the amount of PPARγ bound to DNA is too low, then it is unable to activate gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which cells maintain the correct levels of PPARγ activity remain poorly understood. Watanabe et al. analyzed this process in mouse cells and identified a protein called TRIM23 that is produced in precursor cells. Cells in which the levels of TRIM23 were artificially lowered failed to mature into fat cells; this suggests that this protein is necessary for adipogenesis. Furthermore, in the absence of TRIM23, the amount of PPARγ that occupied regions of DNA was also markedly reduced. A direct consequence of this was a decline in the expression of several genes that are required for the later steps in the adipogenesis process.</p><p>Watanabe et al. next analyzed the mechanism through which TRIM23 had an effect on the levels of PPARγ. It is known from previous work that TRIM23 belongs to a family of enzymes that attach a small molecular tag called ubiquitin onto other proteins. This ubiquitin tag typically marks these proteins for rapid destruction by a large molecular machine called the proteasome. Watanabe et al. found that TRIM23 also modified PPARγ with ubiquitin, but that it did so in an unusual manner that instead prevented the proteasome from recognizing PPARγ and destroying it. As such, TRIM23 stabilizes the levels of PPARγ in cells.</p><p>By providing new insights into how adipogenesis is regulated, these findings suggest that TRIM23 may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of diabetes and disorders related to obesity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05615.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05615.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>TRIM23</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>PPARγ</kwd><kwd>adipocyte</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI, 24112006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatakeyama</surname><given-names>Shigetsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI, 24390065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatakeyama</surname><given-names>Shigetsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI, 10632424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI, 25118501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Hidehisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007434</institution-id><institution>Suzuken Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatakeyama</surname><given-names>Shigetsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatakeyama</surname><given-names>Shigetsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatakeyama</surname><given-names>Shigetsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRIM23 plays a critical role in the switching from early to late adipogenic enhanceosomes by stabilizing the PPARγ protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissue is a major storehouse for excess energy and has recently been shown to be an endocrine tissue critical for the generation of hormones and cytokines involved in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galic et al., 2010</xref>). Abnormalities in adipocyte differentiation or functions may result in the development of metabolic syndrome by inducing insulin resistance, and these abnormalities are likely to be induced in part by inappropriate regulation of gene expression required for adipocyte differentiation or functions.</p><p>The conversion of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes is a strictly controlled process regulated by a series of transcriptional activators. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and three CCAAT/enhancer family members (α, β, and δ) are essential regulators of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tontonoz et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugii et al., 2009</xref>). The adipogenic program is generally composed of two steps. The first step is initiated by adipogenic stimuli that induce early adipogenic activators including C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ and Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) and lead to the formation of early enhanceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mori et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>). In the second step, these early enhanceosomes induce late adipogenic activators including PPARγ and C/EBPα that lead to terminal differentiation by inducing genes necessary for the characteristics of mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefterova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing have shown that transcriptional activators do not function individually but rather cooperate with other activators and form hotspots at specific genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moorman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siersbaek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boergesen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the existence of super-enhancers has been recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loven et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Super-enhancers are large genomic domains occupied by master transcriptional activators and mediators, which induce expression of genes that define cell identity, and are especially characterized by a large amount of localization of Mediator subunit 1 (MED1). During the early phase of adipogenic differentiation, hotspots are central constituents in super-enhancers and have been suggested to cooperate with super-enhancers to drive the differentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siersbaek et al., 2014</xref>). A previous study showed that C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, CREB1 and PPARγ function as candidate master transcriptional activators in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>). Of those master transcriptional activators, PPARγ plays a central role in adipogenesis, whereas other factors cannot induce adipocyte differentiation in the absence of PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>).</p><p>PPARγ has two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. These two isoforms are generated from alternate promoter usage and splicing, and PPARγ2 contains 30 additional amino acids at the amino-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fajas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tontonoz and Spiegelman, 2008</xref>). PPARγ1 is ubiquitously expressed and PPARγ2 is strictly expressed in adipose tissues, while both isoforms are strongly induced during adipocyte differentiation. Although ectopic expression of either of the PPARγ isoforms can induce adipocyte differentiation, PPARγ2 is thought to play a more central role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). It has been reported that PPARγ expression and activity are regulated at different levels such as transcription, protein degradation and post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Beekum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eeckhoute et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Ge, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins (also known as E3 ubiquitin–protein ligases) are characterized by the presence of a RING finger, one or two zinc-binding motifs called B-boxes, and an associated coiled-coil region (RBCC), and there are currently known to be 77 TRIM proteins in humans. TRIM family proteins are involved in a broad range of biological processes, and their alterations result in diverse pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meroni and Diez-Roux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatakeyama, 2011</xref>). TRIM23 is a member of the TRIM family and possesses carboxy-terminal ARF (ADP ribosylation factor) domains. A recent study has shown that TRIM23 mediates atypical lysine 27 (K27)-linked polyubiquitin conjugation to NEMO, which plays an important role in the NFκB pathway, and this conjugation is essential for TLR3- and RIG-I/MDA5-mediated antiviral innate and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimoto et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified TRIM23 as a novel factor that regulates PPARγ protein stability, possibly via atypical ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ. TRIM23 knockdown caused reduction of PPARγ protein levels, which were restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, leading to a severe defect in adipogenic differentiation. TRIM23 is dispensable for the early adipogenic program but is indispensable for the late adipogenic program. By controlling PPARγ abundance, TRIM23 functions as a regulator for a critical link between early and late enhanceosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRIM23 is expressed in mouse adipose tissue during adipogenesis</title><p>To determine whether TRIM23 is involved in adipocyte differentiation, we first examined the expression of TRIM23 during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and in mouse adipose tissue. Real-time PCR analysis and immunoblot analysis revealed that TRIM23 was expressed in preadipocytes and that mRNA and protein levels slightly increased during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Consistent with these results, TRIM23 was found to be predominantly expressed in the preadipocyte-containing stromal vascular fraction (SVF) at a level as high as that in the mature adipocyte fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also measured <italic>Trim23</italic> expression in a model of diet-induced obesity, and we found no significant difference between the expression levels in mice receiving the high-fat diet and those receiving the control chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next examined the subcellular localization of TRIM23. We fractionated 3T3-L1 cells into nuclear extracts and cytoplasmic S100 fraction, and we found that a large amount of TRIM23 was distributed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05615.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRIM23 is expressed during adipocyte differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression of <italic>Trim23</italic> during 3T3-L1 differentiation.

Two different shRNAs (shTRIM23a and shTRIM23b) and a non-targeting control shRNA (shControl) were introduced into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using retroviral vectors. One shRNA (shTRIM23a) efficiently depleted and the other (shTRIM23b) weakly depleted TRIM23 expression levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes relative to shControl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These cells were stimulated to differentiate, and the ability to undergo differentiation to mature adipocytes was evaluated by determination of lipid accumulation using Oil Red O staining, direct measurement of intracellular triglyceride contents and determination of relative mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific genes including <italic>Fabp4</italic>, <italic>Cidec</italic>, <italic>Klf15</italic>, <italic>Adipoq</italic>, and <italic>Retn</italic>. Remarkably, TRIM23 knockdown significantly decreased lipid accumulation and markedly impaired the induction of adipocyte-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether this regulatory network is relevant to human adipocytes, we introduced siRNA into human primary visceral preadipocytes and differentiated them to mature adipocytes. Consistent with the results for mouse 3T3-L1 cells, TRIM23 knockdown significantly decreased lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings indicate that TRIM23 is required for efficient conversion of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. It has been shown that most adipocyte-specific genes are PPARγ target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefterova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>). We next examined the occupancy of PPARγ at a well-described PPARγ target gene, <italic>Fabp4</italic>, during adipocyte differentiation. PPARγ forms heterodimers with RXRα, which specifically bind to PPAR response elements (PPREs). It has been reported that PPARγ is recruited to two PPREs located 5500 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the <italic>Fabp4</italic> gene, and this recruitment mediates activation of the <italic>Fabp4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tontonoz et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nielsen et al., 2006</xref>). We found that TRIM23 depletion decreased the occupancy of PPARγ on the enhancer PPRE at day 4 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). It has been shown that some subunits of Mediator complex are necessary for the adipogenic process. MED14 is required for full activation of PPARγ-mediated transcription and adipocyte differentiation in vitro, and MED23 is required for the early transcriptional events during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grontved et al., 2010</xref>). MED1 is also required for adipogenesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2002</xref>). We tested the occupancy of MED1, one of the Mediator subunits, and found that TRIM23 depletion reduced the occupancy of MED1 at the <italic>Fabp4</italic> gene at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We also found reduced occupancy of Pol II at the <italic>Fabp4</italic> gene in TRIM23 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These findings suggest that the adipogenic defect by TRIM23 knockdown is caused by reduced PPARγ recruitment and subsequent reduced transcriptional activation on the target genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05615.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TRIM23 is required for 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of TRIM23 knockdown before induction of adipogenesis is shown.

To achieve this goal, activators recruit GTFs and Pol II directly or indirectly through binding to many cofactors. The transcription cofactors can be largely classified into two groups. The first group is composed of covalent histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-driven nucleosome remodelers to reorganize the chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belotserkovskaya and Berger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron et al., 2005</xref>).

The second group consists of general cofactors such as the Mediator complex and the SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Timmers and Tora, 2005</xref>). The Mediator complex is an evolutionarily conserved coregulatory complex that typically works in communication between activators and general transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>).

It has also been reported that the <italic>Pparg</italic> promoter is reorganized by ATP-driven nucleosome remodelers and that C/EBPβ binding is required for its chromatin opening. Therefore, we monitored chromatin opening using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giresi et al., 2007</xref>).

This hypothesis is important to clarify a discontinuity in PPARγ expression between early and late adipocyte differentiation. To examine whether TRIM23 mediates PPARγ expression via the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, we measured the activity using a dual luciferase system. TRIM23 showed slight suppression of PPARγ2-mediated transcriptional activity but did not show a dose-dependent relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We therefore investigated whether TRIM23 mediates SUMOylation of PPARγ2. Although PPARγ2 was definitely SUMOylated in cells, TRIM23 did not affect this modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Immunoblot analysis revealed that TRIM23 knockdown did not affect induction of early adipogenic activators but that TRIM23 knockdown impaired induction of late adipogenic activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Protein levels of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were already decreased at day 2 by TRIM23 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), whereas mRNA level of PPARγ1 was hardly reduced and that of PPARγ2 was moderately reduced in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since the amount of PPARγ protein was more greatly reduced than the amount of <italic>Pparg</italic> mRNA in TRIM23-knockdown cells, we speculated that the stability of PPARγ protein was impaired by TRIM23 knockdown. It has been reported that the stability of PPARγ protein is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd and Stephens, 2002</xref>). To determine whether reduction of PPARγ protein in TRIM23-knockdown cells depends on proteasome activity, we observed the levels of PPARγ protein in the presence and absence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated for 48 hr and subsequently treated with MG132. Immunoblot analysis showed that administration of MG132 blocked the reduction of both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 protein levels in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We also examined protein levels of PPARγ in preadipocytes and found that administration of MG132 blocked the reduction of PPARγ in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings indicated that the presence of TRIM23 is sufficient to inhibit degradation of PPARγ not only in a differentiating state but also in an undifferentiated state.

This interaction was not affected by the treatment of troglitazone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We also found that endogenous PPARγ2 was co-precipitated with FLAG-TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that TRIM23 facilitated ubiquitination of PPARγ2 in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). We next examined which domain of TRIM23 was required for adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing shRNA for TRIM23 (shTRIM23a) or a non-targeting control shRNA (shControl) and were subsequently infected with a retrovirus expressing control or shRNA-resistant FLAG-TRIM23 deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Expression levels of TRIM23 were verified by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). These cells were induced to differentiate, and the ability to undergo differentiation to mature adipocytes was evaluated by determination of lipid accumulation using Oil Red O staining. As expected, even a small amount of wild-type TRIM23 expression rescued lipid accumulation; however, a larger amount of TRIM23 deletion mutants failed to rescue lipid accumulation, indicating that both an amino-terminal RING finger domain, which is a ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain, and a carboxy-terminal ARF domain were required for adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). These results suggest that ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ by TRIM23 plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05615.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>TRIM23 interacts with PPARγ2 and promotes ubiquitination of PPARγ2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vivo assay for interaction between TRIM23 and PPARγ2.

We next examined the binding of ubiquitinated PPARγ to GST-ubiquitin receptors and found that ubiquitinated PPARγ purified from cells exogenously expressing TRIM23 bound less efficiently to S5a than did that from cells without exogenous expression of TRIM23. In contrast, HR23B bound to ubiquitinated PPARγ from both cells with and those without exogenous expression of TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). These findings indicate that TRIM23-dependent modification of PPARγ in vivo decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome in a manner dependent on the proteasome subunit S5a/Rpn10. It is well known that K48-linked ubiquitin chains are responsible for proteasomal degradation and that K63-linked chains are involved in various cell signaling processes, though the roles of other atypical ubiquitin linkages through M1, K6, K11, K27, K29 or K33 or mixed linkages within the same chain remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that TRIM23 mediates atypical ubiquitination of PPARγ to inhibit its degradation. We performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using methylated ubiquitin or various ubiquitin mutants (all Lys mutated to Arg except the indicated Lys residue) to study the TRIM23-mediated ubiquitin-linkages of PPARγ. Intriguingly, TRIM23 mediated ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ in the presence of methylated ubiquitin and amino-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged no Lys (K0) ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Considering that methylated ubiquitin is unable to form polyubiquitin chains and that amino-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-ubiquitin mutants interfere with linear ubiquitin conjugation, these findings indicated that TRIM23 ubiquitinated PPARγ at multiple sites. Furthermore, TRIM23 more efficiently mediated ubiquitin conjugation in the presence of untagged K0 ubiquitin or His<sub>6</sub>-K27 ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that TRIM23 can conjugate linear and K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPARγ. To confirm that this atypical ubiquitination of PPARγ is responsible for reduced recognition by 26S proteasome, we performed an in vitro binding assay using PPARγ ubiquitinated by TRIM23 and GST-ubiquitin receptors including HR23B and S5a. Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, although GST-HR23B efficiently bound to M1- and K27-Ub conjugates on PPARγ2, GST-S5a poorly pulled down the conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggested that atypically ubiquitinated PPARγ by TRIM23 decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome, leading to resistance to proteasomal degradation.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05615.015</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>TRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation of PPARγ2, leading to reduced recognition of ubiquitinated PPARγ2 by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PPARγ2 polyubiquitination by TRIM23 leads to reduced recognition by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a.

PPARγ plays a central role in the late phase of adipogenesis. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate PPARγ expression is essential for understanding adipocyte differentiation. In this study, we showed that TRIM23 knockdown in preadipocytes results in decreased expression of PPARγ and a severe defect in late adipogenic differentiation. Ectopic expression of PPARγ2 rescues the adipogenic defect induced by TRIM23 knockdown. Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism by which TRIM23 regulates the expression of PPARγ.</p><p>A considerable number of studies have shown the importance of transcriptional regulation of <italic>Pparg</italic> gene expression. Early adipogenic activators such as C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ provoked by adipogenic stimuli induce low expression levels of PPARγ1, PPARγ2 and C/EBPα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishibashi et al., 2012</xref>). Then PPARγ and C/EBPα directly induce each other's high expression level that supports the maintenance of the differentiated stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen et al., 2002</xref>). The binding of activators to enhancer DNA elements promotes the recruitment of GTFs and Pol II to the promoter DNA in order to form a PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemon and Tjian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thomas and Chiang, 2006</xref>). Activators also mediate the recruitment of covalent histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-driven nucleosome remodeling complexes to the promoter to reorganize the chromatin architecture to be competent for transcription, leading to transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belotserkovskaya and Berger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron et al., 2005</xref>). To elucidate the mechanism of reduced PPARγ expression by TRIM23 knockdown, we investigated the occupancy of activators such as C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, epigenetic marks by ChIP-qPCR analysis and the degree of chromatin opening by FAIRE analysis at the <italic>Pparg</italic> promoters. However, there were no substantial changes in these during the early phase of differentiation, and we therefore concluded that recruitment of early activators and PIC formation were not affected by TRIM23. An apparent change observed in TRIM23-knockdown cells was a decrease in the occupancy of PPARγ and Pol II at the <italic>Pparg</italic> locus during the late phase of differentiation, during which PPARγ and C/EBPα support the high expression level of each other through a positive feedback loop. Therefore, this change caused by TRIM23 knockdown was likely to be provoked by impaired positive-feedback regulation of late adipogenic activators.</p><p>We examined the expression of adipogenic activators in detail, and we found that the protein level of PPARγ2 was already decreased at day 2 by TRIM23 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), whereas the mRNA level of <italic>Pparg</italic> was moderately reduced in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We therefore speculated that TRIM23 regulates PPARγ expression at the protein level. Although numerous studies have focused on the regulation of <italic>Pparg</italic> expression at the transcriptional level, information on regulation of PPARγ at the protein level remains limited. The stability of PPARγ protein is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and PPARγ is actually an unstable protein (t½ = 2 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Waite et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christianson et al., 2008</xref>). Seven-in-absentia homolog 2 (Siah2) facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of PPARγ in vivo, but it is unclear whether Siah2 directly ubiquitinates PPARγ in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilroy et al., 2012</xref>). It has also been reported that PPARγ by itself acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of p65, suggesting that PPARγ as an E3 ligase is critical to terminate NFκB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). PPARγ forms polyubiquitin chains without a substrate using UBCH3 as E2 in vitro, while it has not been determined whether PPARγ is autoubiquitinated or not. In this study, we showed that TRIM23 conjugates atypical polyubiquitin chains including M1- and K27-linked ubiquitin chains to PPARγ, leading to reduced binding to the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a. Functions regulated by K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains have been extensively studied. Past studies have established that K48-linked chains are responsible for proteasomal degradation and that K63-linked chains are involved in various cell signaling processes. Recently, roles of other atypical ubiquitin linkages through K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, M1, or mixed linkages within the same chain have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</xref>). It has been reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) prevents orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 degradation through mediating its atypical ubiquitination via K6 and K27 linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). It has also been shown that RING type E3 ligase SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> stabilizes the oncoprotein Myc by ubiquitination that requires K33, K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which antagonizes SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup>-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Popov et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, Ring1B generates self-atypical mixed K6-, K27-, and K48-linked non-proteolytic polyubiquitin chains on itself, whereas E6AP leads to its degradation via ubiquitination of the same residues of Ring1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Saadon et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we showed that TRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation including M1- and K27-linked ubiquitin chains to PPARγ and that ubiquitination of PPARγ by TRIM23 causes reduced recognition of PPARγ by 26S proteasome. Although the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated, these findings suggest that M1- and/or K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPARγ lead to resistance to degradation via reduced recognition by 26S proteasome.</p><p>In conclusion, TRIM23 is a novel positive regulator of adipocyte maturation via control of switching from early to late adipogenic enhanceosomes through regulating the abundance of PPARγ (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).

What are the atypical ubiquitin chains that lead to the effect on PPARγ turnover?</italic></p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for raising this issue. It has been reported that TRIM23 is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase (Arimoto, K.I. et al., 2010. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 107: 15856-15861) and that some TRIM family proteins have SUMO E3 ligase activities (Chu, Y. et al. 2011. Oncogene. 30:1108-1116). Since TRIM23 did not affect SUMOylation of PPARγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and facilitated ubiquitination of PPARγ2 in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D, E</xref>), we focused on identification of the type of polyubiquitin chains of PPARγ by TRIM23. We performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay to clarify the type of polyubiquitin chain of PPARγ by TRIM23. In this assay, we took advantage of a series of ubiquitin (Ub) derivatives including wild-type Ub (Ub (WT)), methylated Ub (methyl-Ub), Ub (K0) in which all Lys are substituted with Arg, and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ubiquitin mutants Ub (K0), Ub (K6), Ub (K11), Ub (K27), Ub (K29), Ub (K33), Ub (K48) and Ub (K63) in which the indicated Lys alone is not substituted with Arg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Since methylated ubiquitin is unable to form polyubiquitin chains and amino-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagging of ubiquitin interferes with linear ubiquitin conjugation, the assay using these mutated Ubs makes it possible to distinguish various types of ubiquitination including monoubiquitination, multi-ubiquitination and polyubiquitination with different chain types.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, TRIM23 enhanced ubiquitin conjugation of PPARγ in the presence of Ub (WT), Ub (K0) and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Ub (K27), indicating that M1 (linear)- and K27-linked polyubiquitin chains were formed by TRIM23. Of note, weak ubiquitination was observed with other mutants of ubiquitin including methyl-Ub, His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Ub (K0), Ub (K6), Ub (K11), Ub (K29), Ub (K33), Ub (K48) and Ub (K63), suggesting that multiple sites of PPARγ were conjugated with these ubiquitin mutants in this assay. Thus, these findings indicate that TRIM23 conjugates M1- and K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPARγ (in the subsection headed “TRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation, leading to reduced recognition by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a”).</p><p>Next, we tested the possibility that these atypical ubiquitin chains of PRARγ by TRIM23 lead to the effect on PPARγ turnover. To address this question, we examined whether ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ by TRIM23 leads to the acquisition of resistance to proteasomal degradation. Recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to the 26S proteasome is a key step in proteasomal degradation. Several ubiquitin receptors that mediate this process have been identified. Of those, HR23B and S5a/Rpn10 have been shown to play a central role. We performed a GST pull-down assay using GST-tagged HR23B, GST-tagged S5a and HEK293T cell lysates expressing PPARγ and/or TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Whereas GST-S5a efficiently pulled down ubiquitinated PPARγ in the absence of TRIM23, GST-S5a poorly pulled down ubiquitinated PPARγ in the presence of TRIM23. In contrast, GST-HR23B pulled down ubiquitinated PPARγ from both cells with and those without exogenous expression of TRIM23. These findings suggested that atypically ubiquitinated PPARγ by TRIM23 decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome in a manner dependent on the proteasome subunit S5a/Rpn10, leading to resistance to proteasomal degradation (in the subsection headed “TRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation, leading to reduced recognition by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a”).</p><p>To verify that M1- and/or K27-linked ubiquitination of PPARγ is responsible for reduced recognition by 26S proteasome, we tested whether in vitro ubiquitination of PPARγ by TRIM23 affects its binding to GST-tagged ubiquitin receptors. Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, although GST-HR23B efficiently bound to M1- and K27-Ub conjugates on PPARγ2, GST-S5a poorly pulled down the conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and 9D</xref>) (in the aforementioned subsection).</p><p>Collectively, the results show that TRIM23 conjugates M1- and K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPARγ in vitro and that PPARγ modified by TRIM23 has decreased recognition by 26S proteasome. Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, these findings suggest that M1- and/or K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPARγ acquire resistance to degradation via reduced recognition by 26S proteasome.</p><p><italic>2) Is ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ actually mediating the effects observed? There is no direct evidence presented that ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ by TRIM23 is the mechanism responsible for increased protein stability. There could be a different mechanism by which TRIM23 stabilizes PPARγ. Along these lines, the stabilization of PPARγ by TRIM23 in the K48R and K63R mutant background does not necessarily indicate that atypical ubiquitin conjugation is responsible for the stabilizing PPARγ</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue. We agree with the reviewer and think that it is very important to show evidence that ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ by TRIM23 is responsible for increased PPARγ stability. To directly address the question, it is important to clarify whether atypical ubiquitination-resistant PPARγ, in which ubiquitination sites by TRIM23 are mutated, is more unstable in cells. However, there is a technical difficulty in generating a PPARγ mutant, since it is difficult to distinguish the sites conjugated with degradative ubiquitin chains by other E3 ligases and with proteasome-resistant ubiquitin chains by TRIM23. Instead of performing the strategy, we tested the requirement of ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM23 for adipocyte differentiation. As described in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-H</xref>), we added shRNA-resistant FLAG-TRIM23 deletion mutants back to TRIM23-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells and differentiated them to mature adipocytes. As expected, even a small amount of wild-type TRIM23 expression rescued lipid accumulation; however, a large amount of TRIM23 ΔRING mutant, in which E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is lacking, failed to rescue lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). These findings support our idea that ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ by TRIM23 plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation probably through increased PPARγ stability (in the subsection headed “TRIM23 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PPARγ2”).</p><p>To directly address whether atypical ubiquitin conjugation is responsible for the stability of PPARγ, we examined whether ubiquitin conjugation to PPARγ by TRIM23 leads to the acquisition of resistance to proteasomal degradation. As we stated in the response to #1, we tested whether ubiquitination of PPARγ by TRIM23 affects its binding ability to ubiquitin receptors including Rad23 and Rpn10/S5a. We performed a GST pull-down assay using GST-tagged HR23B, GST-tagged S5a and HEK293T cell lysates expressing PPARγ and/or TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Whereas GST-S5a efficiently pulled down ubiquitinated PPARγ in the absence of TRIM23, GST-S5a poorly pulled down ubiquitinated PPARγ in the presence of TRIM23. In contrast, GST-HR23B equally pulled down ubiquitinated PPARγ regardless of TRIM23 coexpression. These results indicated that TRIM23-dependent modification of PPARγ in vivo decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome in a manner dependent on the proteasome subunit S5a/Rpn10 (in the subsection headed “TRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation, leading to reduced recognition by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a”).</p><p>Furthermore, we performed a GST pull-down assay using PPARγ ubiquitinated by TRIM23 in vitro. Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, although GST-HR23B efficiently bound to the PPARγ2 M1- and K27-Ub conjugates, GST-S5a poorly pulled down the conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and 9D</xref>). These results indicate that S5a has more stringent selectivity of ubiquitinated target proteins than does HR23B.</p><p>Taken together, the results show that the RING domain of TRIM23 was required for adipocyte maturation and that TRIM23-mediated atypical ubiquitinations decreased the recognition of PPARγ by 26S proteasome. These findings suggest that ubiquitination of PPARγ by TRIM23 causes the reduced recognition of PPARγ by 26S proteasome, leading to increased stability of PPARγ.</p><p><italic>A third point made by the reviewers that you should consider is the lack of data showing the effect of TRIM23 on PPARγ in vivo, although this point, unlike the above two issues, will not be necessary for publication</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and we think that it is important to elucidate the effect of TRIM23 on PPARγ in vivo. TRIM23 KO mice have been generated in Dr. Vaughan’s laboratory (Meza-Carmen, V. et al. 2011. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 108: 10454-10459). It has been reported that mice lacking the TRIM23/ARD1 gene appeared grossly normal and thus far have presented no obvious pathological phenotype or histopathology of major organs, including the brain, spleen, heart, kidneys, lung, and axial lymph nodes, or problems with breeding. Fatty liver without identified cause appeared in some older KO mice. Dysregulation of PPARγ is linked to severe insulin resistance, and reduced insulin sensitivity plays a major role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Janani, C. et al. 2015. Diabetes Metab Syndr. 9: 46-50; Than, N.N. et al. 2015. Atherosclerosis. 239: 192-202). Since we found that TRIM23 knockdown caused a marked decrease in PPARγ protein abundance in vitro, it is possible that dysregulation of PPARγ is one of the causes of fatty liver in TRIM23 KO mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
