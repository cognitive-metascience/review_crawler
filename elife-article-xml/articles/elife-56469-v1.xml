Long-lived proteins, in postmitotic cells, are particularly difficult to eliminate. Moreover, cellular processes are notoriously adaptive; for example, neuronal synapses exhibit a high degree of plasticity. Ideally, protein disruption techniques should be both rapid and complete. Here, we describe knockoff, a generalizable method for the druggable control of membrane protein stability. We developed knockoff for neuronal use but show it also works in other cell types. Applying knockoff to synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) results in acute disruption of this protein, resulting in loss of synchronous neurotransmitter release with a concomitant increase in the spontaneous release rate, measured optically. Thus, SYT1 is not only the proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast neurotransmitter release but also serves to clamp spontaneous release. Additionally, knockoff can be applied to protein domains as we show for another synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin 1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Knockoff</kwd><kwd>iGluSnFR</kwd><kwd>Synaptotagmin 1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH061876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS098604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vevea</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Knockoff is a tool for researchers who wish to acutely disrupt a membrane protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein function is frequently determined through removal or disruption of the protein of interest, followed by analysis of the resultant phenotype. Removal or disruption of proteins can be achieved through a genetic knockout approach (KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>) or by inhibiting translation of mRNA to knockdown (KD) the protein of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fire et al., 1998</xref>). Disruption of proteins by KO or KD is not rapid (weeks to days), and long-lived proteins may persist for weeks in post mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dörrbaum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, genetic and functional compensation will always be a concern during chronic loss of protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). Other methods, that rely on protein tags, promise faster protein inactivation (usually in a KO or KD background) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Natsume and Kanemaki, 2017</xref>). Some of these methods include: chromophore/fluorophore assisted light inactivation (CALI/FALI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>), auxin-inducible degron (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>), and Trim-Away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clift et al., 2017</xref>). Yet another approach, knocksideways, sequesters the protein of interest away from is site of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). All these methods have benefits and drawbacks. CALI and FALI promise high temporal and spatial control, but the generated inactivating free radical radius is relatively large, so this approach likely affects neighboring molecules. Knocksideways is only applicable to cytosolic proteins, and similarly, AID has only been shown to work with cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and peripheral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). Trim-Away is a potentially powerful method because it does not require a KO/KD background. However, this approach requires highly specific antibodies and involves harsh electroporation of target cells. Additionally, because mass ubiquitination of membrane proteins is also a strong signal for selective organelle autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anding and Baehrecke, 2017</xref>), we developed an alternative approach. There remains an unmet need for a method to conduct non-invasive, rapid, and specific disruption of integral membrane proteins. Here we describe such a method, which we term knockoff, that uses the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease to remove membrane proteins from the bilayer that they are anchored to, leading to acute degradation.</p><p>Use of NS3/4A as a tool has been limited to controlling nonreversible events such as split GFP complementation in TimeSTAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), gene regulation via SMASh tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2015</xref>), protein dimerization with ligand-inducible connection (LInC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tague et al., 2018</xref>), and stabilizable polypeptide linkages (StaPLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we optimized NS3/4A for druggable cleavage of membrane proteins. Knockoff uses the HCV NS3/4A protease and a small 10 amino acid cleavage site for disruption. If the membrane protein is cleaved on the cytosolic side of the bilayer and exposes an N-degron, the cleaved protein is rapidly degraded by the N-end rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varshavsky, 2017</xref>). We found that previously used combinations of NS3/4A and inhibitors presented issues; they resulted in incomplete cleavage of the target protein in the absence of inhibitor, and incomplete protection in the presence of inhibitor. Our goal for knockoff was to develop a robust system where tightly controlled cleavage results in the acute inactivation of a membrane protein. In this study, we screened commercially available NS3/4A inhibitors for toxicity and fast dissociation from the protease, modified the substrate cleavage site to create a completely on or off system, optimized the codon sequence of NS3/4A for mammalian expression, and demonstrated efficient cleavage (substrate-protease interaction) spanning large protein domains.</p><p>We demonstrate the functionality and utility of knockoff by applying the system to synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1). SYT1 functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for the fast, synchronous release of neurotransmitter in central neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman, 2008</xref>). It is well established that chronic loss of SYT1 in KO neurons results in the loss of synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, early studies, focused on the neuromuscular junction of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, concluded that loss of SYT1 also resulted in increased rates of spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiAntonio and Schwarz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>). This result was the first indication that SYT1 might have a dual function: to clamp or suppress spontaneous release under resting conditions, and then to trigger release in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during evoked synaptic transmission. However, subsequent studies, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, concluded that there was no change in mini frequency, suggesting the mini phenotype in larvae was due to homeostatic mechanisms that come into play during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshihara and Littleton, 2002</xref>). Indeed, inhibiting action potential firing of mature neurons leads to increased physical synaptic size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murthy et al., 2001</xref>) and increased spontaneous release frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>). Chronic loss of synchronous neurotransmitter release in <italic>Syt1</italic> KO (S1KO) neurons may result in a similar homeostatic response and explain the increased rate of spontaneous release (mini events) seen in most studies of S1KO neurons. This view became more complicated when SYT1 mouse KO neurons were examined. In the first mouse KO study, changes in spontaneous fusion rates were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>), but this appears to be due to the use of autaptic cultures and mini frequencies were in fact elevated in mass dissociated neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wierda and Sørensen, 2014</xref>) and in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kerr et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to the chronic KO approach, acute disruption of SYT1, using CALI/FALI, had little effect on mini frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>). This result suggested that increases in spontaneous release rates were the result of compensatory mechanisms using a KO approach. However, mutations that uncouple the function of SYT1 in evoked versus spontaneous release led to the opposite conclusion, and indicated that SYT1 may indeed be a fusion clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). At present, the idea that SYT1 inhibits spontaneous release, that is the SYT1 clamping hypothesis, is still the subject of vigorous debate.</p><p>Here, we develop knockoff and apply it, for the first time, to study the function of SYT1. To monitor both the spontaneous and evoked modes of neurotransmitter release, we used the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>). We observed that acute disruption of SYT1 results in not only the expected loss of synchronous evoked release, but also results in a concomitant rise in spontaneous release rates. These findings validate knockoff and support a role for SYT1 in directly clamping spontaneous release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptotagmin 1 is a difficult to disrupt, long-lived protein</title><p>In our first attempt to acutely disrupt SYT1, we expressed CRE recombinase via lentiviral transduction into mature (13DIV) floxed <italic>Syt1</italic> mouse neurons. Expression of CRE causes excision of exon five from this floxed line with loss of <italic>Syt1</italic> transcript, and thus protein. We confirmed CRE transduction at 1DIV resulted in complete loss of SYT1 protein in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Mature neurons are more resistant to transduction than immature neurons and for this reason we used a higher titer of lentivirus (10x). However, regardless of the amount of CRE lentivirus used, transduction at 13DIV resulted in incomplete loss of SYT1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>) even though immunostaining of MAP2 and CRE confirmed complete neuronal coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). Strikingly, approximately half of the SYT1 protein appeared to be lost in 4 to 5 days but the other fraction showed no detectable turnover during our analysis period, greater than 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Therefore, SYT1 is a long-lived synaptic protein with a substantial population of molecules that are resistant to turnover. The discovery of two pools of SYT1 that have very different half-lives highlights the need to target the protein, itself, for degradation. So, we attempted to degrade SYT1 directly using the established auxin-inducible degron (AID) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>). We first constructed a lentiviral IRES expression vector based on a recently published construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zotova et al., 2019</xref>). This construct was modified to express mAID-tagged SYT1 along with the E3 ubiquitin ligase osTIR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> i.). However, we could not detect mAID-tagged SYT1 (data not shown). Therefore, we split osTIR1 and the mAID-tagged SYT1 into separate vectors in order to better control expression levels of each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> ii. and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). We found that the mAID-tagged SYT1 was not stable in the presence of osTIR1, indicating leak. Even addition of the osTIR1 inhibitor, auxinole, could not stabilize mAID-tagged SYT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Given these observations, we can only reason that there is leak in the AID system and that this leak becomes an issue when studying long lived proteins in post-mitotic cells. This may be why AID technology has not been applied to neuronal targets. Indeed, leak in the AID system was recently documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yesbolatova et al., 2019</xref>); and moreover, the entire family of TIR1/AFB proteins all seem to have a significant auxin independent interaction with their targets, limiting the utility of this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parry et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, there is a compelling need for the creation of a well performing technology to control protein levels, especially long-lived membrane proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptotagmin 1 is a difficult to disrupt, long-lived protein.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative anti-SYT1 and anti-CRE immunoblot of WT, <italic>Syt1</italic> KO (generated using 1x CRE lentivirus at day 1), and neurons transduced with 10x CRE lentivirus at 13 DIV. Total DIV, CRE dose, and incubation time post CRE transduction are labeled at the top of the blot.

Only GZV (Grazoprevir) and GCV inhibited cleavage, and this effect was incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The higher immunoreactive band represents mitochondrial bound, uncleaved protein, while the lower band comprises the cytosolic, cleaved protein. We reasoned that modification of the NS5A/5B cleavage sequence might decrease breakthrough cleavage. Using published reports of cleavage site analysis as a guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shiryaev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>), various modified cleavage sequences were tested (data not shown). Substitution of the P1’ serine with a glutamine residue (EDVVCC/QMSY) decreased leak and resulted in more efficient protection from cleavage with all of the inhibitors that were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Moreover, glutamine is a strong signal for N-end mediated degradation from yeast to mammalian cells, so the presence of this residue should facilitate protein degradation after cleavage of amino-terminally cleaved substrates. Mitochondrial localization of SELF-mito was confirmed using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of HEK cells maintained in 5 µM PRV; in the absence of PRV the signal was cytosolic, thus establishing the feasibility of knockoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>The cleavage rate of our model knockoff protein in neurons was examined following removal of the protease inhibitors DNV, PRV, GZV, and GCV. Only DNV and PRV washout resulted in cleavage products within the first hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>), suggesting that these inhibitors rapidly dissociate from the NS3/4A protease. Cleavage products accumulated quickest upon PRV washout, with almost complete cleavage within the first hour.</p><p>Next, synaptic function was monitored in the presence of PRV with the intensity based fluorescent glutamate reporter, iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>). iGluSnFR is targeted to the plasma membrane where it reports the presence of the neurotransmitter glutamate. For these experiments, iGluSnFR with superfolding mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marvin et al., 2018</xref>) was subcloned into a lentiviral vector and expressed using a CamKII promoter. ER and Golgi export sequences were also added to the carboxy terminus to improve trafficking to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parmar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stockklausner et al., 2001</xref>). We confirmed that iGluSnFR reliably reported evoked glutamate release when stimulating neurons and varying the extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>PRV is the ideal inhibitor for this system because it dissociates so rapidly. However, 5 µM PRV increased spontaneous network activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), so we explored lower doses and found that 0.5 µM drug had no effect on spontaneous activity or synchronous neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Neither high nor low doses of PRV altered synapse number or morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Because high doses of PRV had effects, we further tuned the NS5A/5B substrate sequence so that low doses (i.e. 0.5 µM) would be effective. This led to the (ADVVCC/QMSY) substrate sequence. This sequence performed extremely well, with full inhibition of cleavage at 0.5 µM PRV (note the effectiveness as compared to 10 µM GCV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Next, substrate cleavage was monitored via immunoblot analysis to estimate knockoff cleavage kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>). Full-length SELF-mito was quantified using densitometry, plotted, and fitted with a single exponential function, yielding a τ of 41 min, and a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 28 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p>Cleavage was also monitored by fluorescence microscopy using fast Airyscan imaging.

Application of knockoff to the carboxy tail of SYP1 results in degradation of this domain within 24 hr and provides proof of concept for knockoff application to specific domains of proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distinct fates of the S1-SELF cleavage products</title><p>Taking advantage of antibodies that recognize different epitopes of SYT1, in conjunction with super resolution Airyscan imaging, we addressed the fate of the two cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) allowed us to visualize: 1) synaptic vesicle clusters using synaptophysin as a general SV marker, 2) the cytoplasmic domain of SYT1, using an antibody to the C2A domain, and 3) the integral membrane portion of SYT1, using an antibody to the luminal domain (LD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Note that the LD antibody recognizes rat SYT1 with higher affinity than the mouse protein; hence, the WT sample is only weakly stained (note: S1-SELF was constructed using the rat protein sequence and is recognized by this antibody). These ICC experiments also confirmed that knockoff was not associated with major morphological changes in the SV pools. The redistribution of S1-SELF, as it was cleaved, was quantified using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC). When expressed in KO neurons, both the cytoplasmic domain (C2A) and LD of S1-SELF, in the presence of 0.5 µM PRV, were highly colocalized with synaptophysin. Following PRV washout, the correlation between synaptophysin and SYT1 (C2A) steadily decreased. Interestingly, a small number of SYT1 (C2A) puncta remained visible at later time points, but these did not contain synaptophysin. Conversely, the correlation between synaptophysin and SYT1 (LD) remained relatively high even though a portion of the SYT1 (LD) signal spreads from synaptophysin-positive pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This observation suggests that the membrane segment of SYT1 is slowly lost to surrounding membranes in the absence of the C2 domains.

Signals from representative regions of interest (ROIs) from a single field of view (FOV) are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> (black); averages are shown in green. Loss of synchronous release was apparent from the distribution of iGluSnFR (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) peaks. To quantify this effect, peak fluorescence changes were quantified and binned (10 ms) against time across the entire data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Ten ms bins have been used before to quantify synchronous and asynchronous release from WT and S1KO neurons based on electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshihara and Littleton, 2002</xref>). There was no difference in the distribution of iGluSnFR peaks between WT and S1KO + S1-SELF + PRV (S1-SELF protected) following a single stimulus (majority of events are synchronous). In contrast, in S1KO neurons, synchronous release was almost completely absent. These results validate our use of the modified SYT1 construct (S1-SELF).

However, because iGluSnFR has not been used to measure spontaneous release, we first sought to record AMPA-receptor-mediated miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) using conventional patch-clamp measurements. mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of 1 μM TTX from WT, S1KO, S1KO + S1-SELF +/- PRV mature mouse neurons. Neurons that had been without PRV for 4 hr showed a clear increase in mEPSC frequency, analogous to the elevated frequency using S1KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref>; statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

Moreover, plotting the peak amplitude of events versus the signal-to-noise of the same ROI reveals clear separation between mGT events and background ROI peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The frequency of spontaneous mGT events was 2.4-fold higher in S1KO neurons relative to WT and was unchanged in S1KO neurons expressing S1-SELF in the presence of PRV (protected). During washout, the rate of spontaneous release increased until it plateaued at 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>; statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). Similarly, quantifying synchronous release percentage (events within the first 10 ms after single stimulus), shows a similar trend (data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Again, most release events in WT, and S1KO neurons expressing S1-SELF in the presence of PRV, were synchronous; S1KOs were largely devoid of these fast responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>; statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>). To further ensure that homeostatic mechanisms were not invoked, we determined the relative protein levels of a known regulator of homeostatic scaling, CDK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim and Ryan, 2010</xref>). Immunoblot analysis revealed no changes in CDK5 expression levels in any of the samples (WT, S1KO, protected, washout conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Finally, the percentage of synchronous release was plotted against the spontaneous release rates and a clear relationship emerged. As synchronous release is lost, spontaneous release increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>; linear regression yielded an r<sup>2</sup> = 0.7688; p-value=0.0097). Because these two variables are correlated, we conclude that SYT1 directly controls both processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, we report a general method to efficiently cleave targeted membrane proteins with high temporal control. Major issues regarding inducible KOs and shRNA-mediated knock down are that they are slow acting, limited by the half-life of the targeted protein, and are usually irreversible. Knockoff overcomes these limitations and provides exquisite specificity. The combination of HCV NS3/4A protease (codon optimized), inhibitor (PRV), and cleavage sequence (ADVVCC/QMSY), were used here to create a cleavable system that is completely inhibited in the presence of inhibitor. Importantly, cleavage was rapid and complete upon inhibitor washout. Other combinations of protease and cleavage sequence performed poorly because either: 1) the protease did not express well, 2) the inhibitor failed to completely prevent cleavage, 3) the inhibitor was toxic or had off-target effects, 4) the protease did not completely cleave all copies of the targeted protein, or 5) the cleavage reaction proceeded slowly upon inhibitor washout. This is also the first use of the HCV NS3/4A protease in a system where the cleavage site is not immediately adjacent to the protease.</p><p>More generally, acute protein disruption has been a major goal in cellular biology. This is a particularly important issue in neuroscience, as neurons are post-mitotic and synapses are highly plastic. Fast disruption of a target protein greatly increases confidence in any observed resultant phenotype. For decades, researchers have sought to develop new tools to achieve this goal, but the results have been mixed. In the current study, we directly compared our newly developed protocol to acute introduction of CRE in a floxed strain and to an Auxin induced degron (AID) system. We show that, in agreement with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dörrbaum et al., 2018</xref>), SYT1, like other presynaptic proteins, is long-lived and hence difficult to disrupt genetically once the protein has been translated. Moreover, we demonstrate significant leak in the AID system, rendering this method unusable in postmitotic cells that have large numbers of stable proteins.</p><p>Other groups have developed protease-based systems for acute protein control including SMASh tag, a self-excising degron tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2015</xref>) and TIPI, TEV controlled protein cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taxis et al., 2009</xref>). SMASh tag is a an effective tool for turning on or off expression of a protein. However, once the protein is made (in the absence of inhibitor) it cannot be regulated because the degron has been excised and the protein of interest is now governed by its normal cellular half-life. TIPI uses the TEV protease controlled genetically through a selective promoter. Unfortunately, TEV is a ‘sloppy’ protease that cleaves a number of endogenous targets; moreover, promoters are inherently slow, and many promoters require changing carbon source or have toxic side effects (glucose/galactose and TET, respectively).</p><p>The difficulty in creating a robust technique that allows druggable control of a protein, and the creation of acute protein disruption techniques, are major subjects of discussion in the neuroscience community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Südhof, 2018</xref>). In neuroscience in general, and regarding SYT1 function in particular, relying on KO methods has confounded the true function of proteins in synaptic transmission for decades. Knockoff addresses this need by providing the means to acutely disrupt a protein of interest, at its terminal destination, by: 1) demonstrating that the NS3/4 protease can cut at a cleavage site that is not immediately adjacent to itself (in fact, it can cleave across large protein domains such as the C2 domains of SYT1), 2) screening inhibitors of NS3/4 protease for toxicity and fast dissociation rates, 3) modifying the substrate site so that low doses of a fast dissociating inhibitor completely protect the modified protein (100% on or off), and 4) providing evidence that the modified protein is protected from cleavage for weeks at a time (no leak from our system, unlike other systems). This proof of principle, demonstrating the separation of protease and cleavage site, should enable additional, novel applications based on the general knockoff strategy described here.</p><p>We applied knockoff to SYT1, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for synchronous neurotransmitter release, for two specific reasons. First, as discussed above, the function of SYT1 in triggering and synchronizing neurotransmitter release is well documented, and thus provides a robust read-out to monitor the efficacy of knockoff. Second, the hypothetical clamping function of SYT1 remains the subject of debate, and a consensus regarding this important question has not been reached. Using S1-SELF, we were able to monitor not only the loss of synchronous neurotransmitter release, we were also able to measure the rate of miniature (mGT) release as SYT1 was acutely degraded. This work revealed a strong correlation between loss of synchronous release and an increase in rate of spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). This correlation suggests that a single molecule, SYT1, directly controls both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, these changes occur on timescales that aremuch faster than homeostatic plasticity mechanisms (hours versus days). In the course of these experiments, we also demonstrate the utility of the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR for monitoring different modes of glutamate release in dissociated hippocampal cultures. Here, using peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> iGluSnFR fluorescence, we were able to measure synchronous (peaks ≤ 10 ms post stimulus), asynchronous (peaks &gt; 10 ms post stimulus), and spontaneous glutamate release in dissociated WT and S1KO hippocampal neurons. Thus, the combination of iGluSnFR and knockoff provide a powerful new means to interrogate the function of presynaptic proteins involved in release.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the utility of a new, rapid, efficient, protein disruption method. We used this technique to address the unresolved question of whether SYT1 has a second function as a fusion clamp, an issue that has been debated for more than two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman, 2008</xref>). Our results provide a strong argument for the dual function of SYT1, as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that triggers rapid evoked synchronous release, and as a clamp that inhibits spontaneous release under resting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2016</xref>). Knockoff was critical in answering this question as neurons express numerous long-lived proteins, and synaptic transmission is notoriously adaptive (homeostatic plasticity). Importantly, knockoff is also reversible; simply re-adding the inhibitor to culture media will protect newly translated copies of the targeted protein. Hence, proteins can be disrupted during different phases of neuronal development. Additionally, knockoff can be used to disrupt any terminal domain of a protein, there is no a priori need to disrupt the entire protein. However, a caveat of knockoff is that the N-terminal fragment is not rapidly degraded. Such fragments may persist for some time, causing off target effects, including dominant-negative activity, so this should be taken into consideration. We also note that knockoff cleavage sites could even be inserted into intramembrane loops and used to separate domains of polytopic membrane proteins. Given the short length of the cleavage site (10 residues), the relatively small size of the NS3/4 protease, and robust protease activity, knockoff can potentially be applied to myriad proteins. An exciting future direction will focus on testing knockoff in vivo. Application of knockoff in vivo will primarily rely on the pharmacokinetics of paritaprevir. In early clinical testing, high doses of PRV were well tolerated in mice and, in humans, PRV reaches micromolar concentrations in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menon et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal care and experiment protocols in this study were conducted under the guidelines set by the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals handbook.

Standard imaging media, extracellular fluid (ECF) was used for iGluSnFR experiments. For stimulated release experiments, unless otherwise noted, CaCl<sub>2</sub> in ECF, was lowered to 1 mM, and D-AP5 (50 µM) (Abcam; ab120003), CNQX (20 µM) (Abcam; ab120044), Picrotoxin (100 µM) (Tocris; 1128) were added to the imaging media. For spontaneous release experiments, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was used; and in place of D-AP5, CNQX, and Picrotxin; TTX (1 µM) (Abcam; ab120055) was added to the imaging media. Single image planes were acquired with 10 ms exposure (100 Hz) using 488 nm excitation and 520 emission. Single planes were selected so that the highest amount of iGluSnFR expressing dendrite arbor was in focus. Laser intensity was set so that the amplitude of iGluSnFR peaks (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) from a 0.5 Hz field stimulus did not change over the course of at least 20 s (photobleaching error). For single stimuli imaging, 150 frames (10 ms exposure/1.5 s total) were collected and a single field stimulus was triggered at 500 ms after the initial frame. For train stimuli imaging, 200 frames (10 ms exposure/2 s total) were collected and a train of 5 stimuli were triggered at 10 Hz, starting at 500 ms after the initial frame. For spontaneous imaging, 300 frames (200 ms exposure/60 s total) were collected. Single and train (10 Hz) stimuli were triggered by a Grass SD9 stimulator through platinum parallel wires attached to a field stimulation chamber (Warner Instruments; RC-49MFSH). Voltage for field stimulus was set to the lowest voltage that reliably produced presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in all (&gt;95%) presynaptic boutons using synaptophysin-GCaMP6f as a presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter. All iGluSnFR imaging experiments were performed at 33–34°C. Temperature and humidity were controlled during experiments by a Tokai incubation controller and chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>iGluSnFR quantification</title><p>Image series were acquired as described under the iGluSnFR imaging section. Image sets were opened, ROIs created, and fluorescence intensity measured using ImageJ (Fiji) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). ROIs were created based on a custom workflow to identify changes in fluorescence of the selected image series. For stimulated release imaging, the average projection (created using the pre-stimulus fluorescence baseline) was subtracted from the maximum projection (created using the entire image series). This result was duplicated (Duplicate result) and mean filtered (Duplicate filtered) using a rolling ball radius of 10 pixels. These images were subtracted and the result was used to threshold changes in fluorescence. After thresholding, images were made binary and a watershed function was run to separate objects that touched each other. Using this procedure, objects (&gt;10 pixels) were created and ROIs were defined. These ROIs were used to measure fluorescence changes over time from the original image series. The results were copied and imported into Axograph X 1.7.2 (Axograph Scientific) where traces were normalized, and background subtracted using pre-stimulus data. For miniature neurotransmitter release ROI selection, a walking average image series was created using the original image series as a template, then the walking average image series was subtracted from the original image series. From here, spontaneous events were manually identified and counted. For ROI analysis, ROIs were manually drawn around spontaneous events and for background ROIs, these same ROIs were moved off center to an area that was not counted as an event.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Stimulated release macro</title><p><code xml:space="preserve">run(&quot;Duplicate...&quot;, &quot;title=OG duplicate&quot;);

Briefly, HEK293T cells were grown in the presence of various HCV protease inhibitors for one day. Cultures were then incubated with a mix of annexin V-FITC, propidium iodide (PI), and Hoechst 33342 (Thermofisher; H3570) for 30 min. Samples were then immediately imaged using widefield microscopy, using standard blue (Hoechst), green (annexin V), and red (PI) filter sets. Using this protocol, all cells stain blue with Hoechst; necrotic cells will stain blue and red (PI), apoptotic cells will stain blue and green (annexin V), and dead cells will stain blue, red, and green (PI and annexin V). The total number of cells was determined using Hoechst positive puncta. Absolute cell numbers in each trial were normalized to control. Inhibitor toxicity was also assayed using primary rat cortical cultures. For neurons, the ratio of PI+ puncta (Dead) to Hoechst+ puncta (Total) was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The lentivirus used for CRE-mediated excision of <italic>Syt1</italic> exon five from floxed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quadros et al., 2017</xref>), was made using the above lentivirus method and using the transfer plasmid pLenti-hSynapsin-CRE-WPRE (pLenti-hSynapsin-CRE-WPRE was a gift from Fan Wang [Addgene plasmid # 86641; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:86641; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_86641">Addgene_86641</ext-link>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>).

These export motifs improved trafficking of the sensor to the plasma membrane. The knockoff model (SELF-mito) was created by PCR Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) the NS3/4A protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butko et al., 2012</xref>), monomeric-superfolder green fluorescent protein (msGFP - from lab stock), the NS3/4A substrate site (EDVVCC/SMSY), and the mitochondrial targeting signal from OMP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nemoto, 1999</xref>). Flexible GS(GSS)<sub>4</sub> linkers were added in between the protease and msGFP, and msGFP and the cleavage site. Knockoff models with alternate cleavage sites were created using a long, 3’, oligonucleotide primer encoding the alternate cleavage site. The knockoff model (SELF-mito) was subcloned into pEF-GFP (for HEK293T expression) and FUGW (for neuronal expression) (pEF-GFP was a gift from Connie Cepko [Addgene plasmid # 11154; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:11154; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_11154">Addgene_11154</ext-link>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuda and Cepko, 2004</xref>). The cleavable SYT1 (S1-SELF) was created using the rat cDNA from previous lab constructs. The substrate cleavage site (ADVVCC/QMSY) was inserted after amino acid 100 using PCR SOE techniques. Furthermore, the codon optimized NS3/4A (custom geneblock from IDT), was also added to this same construct using PCR SOE, along with a long (67 amino acid) flexible linker composed of primarily of glycine, serine, and alanine at the 5’ end of the protease (3’ of <italic>Syt1</italic>), and a short FLAG tag at the 3’ end of the protease. The cleavable Synaptophysin (SYP1-SELF) was created by inserting the cleavage site into the carboxy terminus at amino acid number 234, just prior to the YG(P/Q) repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Südhof et al., 1987</xref>) that have been shown to control rates of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon and Chapman, 2011</xref>).

that you describe here could be very useful in numerous contexts for many biologists with many different interests and we look forward to its application in different species as well.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Knockoff: Acute disruption of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptotagmin 1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: J Troy Littleton (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data. We did not edit or summarize the reviews and you will notice that there is a major concern related to the novelty of the strategy and that concern should be fully addressed and the references that reviewer 2 lists should be mentioned and discussed.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Vevea and Chapman describes a new method (termed knockoff) to acutely reduce protein function of transmembrane proteins by engineering a construct encoding the druggable HCV NS3/4a protease and a NS3/4 cleavage site into the cytoplasmic portion of the protein of interest. Following removal of the protease inhibitor, the target protein is cleaved and the cytosolic fragment undergoes N-end degradation due to an exposed Q amino acid on the new N-terminus. The authors demonstrate the approach works in hippocampal cultures using the synaptic vesicle proteins Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and Synaptophysin 1. The authors also compare it to several other published approaches using degradation as a tool and show it performs superiorly. As such, the method represents an exciting addition for those interested in acutely (2-8 hours) disrupting a transmembrane protein.</p><p>The authors follow-up on their method development to characterize acute disruptions of Syt1 using the tool. They provide some new iGluSnFR improvements for imaging synaptic transmission in mammalian neurons that will be welcomed in the field. They show convincing data that with both physiology and imaging that similar to CRE-dependent removal of Syt1, degradation of Syt1 in hippocampal cultures reduce synchronous synaptic vesicle fusion and increase spontaneous release. They emphasize their acute approach allows them to exclude long-term compensation as a mechanism for the increased mini frequency (clamp model), arguing for the likelihood that Syt1 indeed functions as both an activator of synchronous fusion and an inhibitor of spontaneous release, as proposed in other studies.</p><p>Overall, it's a nice set of experiments with some valuable toolkits for the neuroscience field, and potentially more broadly for the cell biology community in general.</p><p>A few comments:</p><p>1) Have the authors tried the approach in vivo? Can the drug be administered to mice to block the protease, and then removed to have the protein cleaved in vivo? This would be a very powerful addition to the toolkit if the method could be used outside of cell culture. It's not an essential experiment, but would be nice to know if the authors tried it. Given synaptophysin is not an essential gene, that seems like an ideal system to test it. Alternatively, it could be done with the Syt1 line to see if the mice develop neurological symptoms following removal of the drug. A western analysis could show if Syt1 were cleaved in vivo. It would be a pity if the approach can only be used in cell culture.</p><p>2) It is worth having a paragraph on the caveats of the method. Although I really like the clever toolkit, one could imagine a few issues depending upon the protein being characterized:</p><p>A) The authors show the residual transmembrane fragment is long-lived. That might cause some dominant-negative effects compared to a null mutant depending on the protein.</p><p>B) The Syt1 degradation looks like it could be non-complete. Figure 4C shows the protein levels don't drop to the same as the CRE null situation. Supplementary file 5 indicates evoked release is not reduced as strongly as the null (Control: ~68, Syt1 KO: ~6; Syt1-SELF 8h ~13). Not a big deal, but there is likely to be a small fraction that escapes cleavage. Again, depending on the protein, 5-10% might have significant function for its biology.</p><p>C) What would happen over longer-term expression without the inhibitor. Does cleavage start to happen very early before the protein is actually even on synaptic vesicles, for example, following entry into the ER or on vesicles in transit. Did the authors see any hints of what is happening to Syt1 in the cell body of their long-term 8 hour experiments? Does is still co-localize with other SV proteins during axonal transport in the 8 hour experiments?</p><p>3) I would recommend changing the wording of the + PRV inhibitor experiments. The authors refer to this condition as &quot;rescue&quot;, when it should be called &quot;blocked&quot; or another similar term. Rescue has a specific genetic connotation where a mutant phenotype is reverted by putting back the wildtype gene. Better to avoid that confusion by using &quot;blocked&quot; as the term with inhibitor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Vevea and Chapman developed a knock-out method that depends on depends on NS3/4A cis cleavage of targeted protein that leads to N-end rule mediated degradation of targeted protein and provide proof of principle experiments on integral membrane protein Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and Synaptophysin 1. The authors start by showing that Syt1 has a highly perduring pool that limits the success of genetic knock-out approaches in mature mouse neurons. Moreover, previously established AID mediated knock-down of Syt1 is leaky, limiting temporal control of knock-down. The authors use NS3/4 mediated cleavage of Syt1 as a means to rapidly knock-out syt1. They design and optimize a cis cleavage site and tag syt1 with the cleavage site of NS3/4 and the protease that targets it in the absence of NS3/4 inhibitors. They test and optimize the inhibitor levels and show that the inhibitor PRV is not toxic at varying levels and at low levels it inhibits the cleavage of an optimized (for drug mediated inhibition) target site of NS3/4A. Wash out of the inhibitor leads to cleavage of the cis target site, and N-end rule mediated degradation of the target gene near completion at 166 minutes after inhibitor wash off at mouse hippocampus neuronal cultures. Finally, they show that acute knock-out of syt1 increases spontaneous mini frequency, strengthening the hypothesis that syt1 functions as a clamp against spontaneous vesicle release.</p><p>The technique works and the results are compelling, but the authors fail to refer to and discuss key publications that severely limit the novelty of their paper. Indeed, the NS3/4 mediated cis cleavage is used in SMASh tag (Chung et al., 2015) where the targeted protein would be tagged with NS3 protease and a degron that can be cleaved off by NS3 protease. When an inhibitor is added this cleavage is interrupted, which results in rapid degradation of the target. Moreover, SMASh tag was shown to work with transmembrane protein GluRIIA in that publication. Additionally, TEV mediated target cleavage that results in target degradation through N-end rule was published in Taxis et al., 2009. Due to these references, I believe the novelty of the method is very limited to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56469.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Vevea and Chapman describes a new method (termed knockoff) to acutely reduce protein function of transmembrane proteins by engineering a construct encoding the druggable HCV NS3/4a protease and a NS3/4 cleavage site into the cytoplasmic portion of the protein of interest.

We are confident that they will work because paritaprevir (PRV) has been reported to reach μM concentrations in human serum, and has been shown to be well-tolerated in rodent toxicology studies, using does that are 100-fold greater than the doses used in humans (unlike many other NS3/4 protease inhibitors). We will need to do a full dosing curve with and without ritonavir to assess cost and ultimate feasibility, but we are optimistic about these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is worth having a paragraph on the caveats of the method.

We have added this caveat/clarification to the revised manuscript, and now state: “; however, a caveat of knockoff is that the N-terminal fragment is not rapidly degraded. Such fragments may persist for some time, causing off target effects, including dominant-negative activity, so this should be taken into consideration.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The Syt1 degradation looks like it could be non-complete. Figure 4C shows the protein levels don't drop to the same as the CRE null situation.

Again, depending on the protein, 5-10% might have significant function for its biology.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another good point, and it raises an interesting facet of our findings. The immunoblot from Figure 3 shows 0.4% full length syt1 at 8 hours, however some C2A immunofluorescence can be observed from the ICC in Figure 4 (same antibody, ICC not quantified), and results in a PCC above baseline. In the ICC images, the signal detected from the C2A antibody appears more diffuse at the -4, -6, and -8-hour washout time points. We reason that the C2A domain was cleaved from synaptic vesicles but had not yet been fully degraded by the cell. It is possible that this degradation step takes hours and that is the reason for above baseline signal and residual colocalization. The reviewer also notes that the synchronous fraction in the 8-hour time point is trending higher than the complete syt1 null (although not statistically different). The reviewer asks whether this trend towards more synchronous release could be caused by residual syt1. We cannot answer this definitively because there is no statistical significance. However, it is tempting to speculate that since there is also a trend toward increased spontaneous release in the acute washout conditions, that there is not a significant amount of residual syt1 (since residual syt1 would also be expected to act as a clamp); rather, we speculate that there is some interesting difference in synaptic vesicle (SV) architecture or number when SVs are formed in the presence of syt1, but then the syt1 is acutely removed. This idea will be addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) What would happen over longer-term expression without the inhibitor.

Furthermore, we performed ICC once on a long term, inhibitor removed, experiment and saw no evidence for the presence of either fragment of syt1. Based on these findings we feel confident saying that cleavage happens rapidly after protease translation. As to what happens to the N-terminal fragment, it must get somehow recycled/degraded in/near the ER because it doesn’t show up on ICC (this condition is not shown in the paper due to space and because it was only assayed once). In the acute experiments, the N-terminal fragment persists longer than the C-terminal fragment, but this fragment is lost from SVs and appears as diffuse signal throughout the axon (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I would recommend changing the wording of the + PRV inhibitor experiments. The authors refer to this condition as &quot;rescue&quot;, when it should be called &quot;blocked&quot; or another similar term.

Better to avoid that confusion by using &quot;blocked&quot; as the term with inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another good point, thank you. We thought about this a lot and feel that ‘blocked’ might also cause some degree of confusion, so we have opted for the term “protected”, we hope that this is clear and acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript Vevea and Chapman developed a knock-out method that depends on depends on NS3/4A cis cleavage of targeted protein that leads to N-end rule mediated degradation of targeted protein and provide proof of principle experiments on integral membrane protein Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and Synaptophysin 1.

We failed to make clear how knockoff is different, outperforms, and offers the ability to conduct previously impossible experiments versus these previous methods. As this reviewer cites, cell biologists have long sought after a method to acutely disrupt their protein of interest, as evidenced by these two publications. However, the utility of these previous attempts has been severely limited. We respectfully argue that, in our manuscript, we have finally worked out a degradation method that: (1) targets the protein of interest on its terminal organelle, (2) works quickly, and (3) has no discernable off target effects (no off target cleavage and no degradation of the whole organelle).</p><p>The SMASh tag is a tool for shutting off expression of a protein of interest. This method works well for turning expression off, but once the protein is made, it is no longer under the influence of the tool. This tool works by using the NS3/4 protease to control the a novel degron appended to the protein of interest. In the absence of inhibitor, the degron is cleaved from the protein of interest and the protein is produced. Addition of inhibitor prevents degron removal via protease cleavage and therefore results in degradation shortly after translation. This is important because while this method works on transmembrane proteins, it does so while the protein is presumably in the ER where it can be retrotranslocated for degradation. Furthermore, because this method works on only newly translated protein, the SMASh method will only decrease the amount of a targeted protein that either: a) has a short half-life, or b) is expressed in rapidly dividing cells like yeast or HEK cells. It will not meaningfully decrease the amount of long-lived presynaptic proteins like syt1. Conversely, Knockoff targets the mature protein on its native organelle. It is completely different and only comparable in that knockoff also uses a protease.</p><p>TEV protease has been used in cells to probe the topology of targeted proteins but we feel that it has proven to be a poor choice for studying protein disruption. To be clear, TEV sites can be engineered into proteins of interest and they can be targeted for degradation, however, TEV expression must be controlled via a controlled promoter as it does not have a small molecule inhibitor (translation is slow in postmitotic cells such as neurons, and methods to control transcription like sugar promoters or TET promoters either change the metabolic landscape of the cell or are toxic to mitochondria, both represent huge confounding variables). Additionally, TEV is a ‘sloppy’ protease as it cleaves a number of endogenous proteins; this is far from an ideal situation and is why the TEV protease is not commonly used in cells.</p><p>What we have done with knockoff is create a method to acutely disrupt a protein of interest at its terminal destination by: (1) demonstrating that the NS3/4 protease can cut a cleavage site that is not immediately adjacent to itself (in fact, it can cleave across large protein domains such as the C2 domains of syt1), (2) screen inhibitors of NS3/4 protease for toxicity and fast dissociation rates, (3) modify the substrate site so that low doses of a fast dissociating inhibitor completely protect the modified protein (100% on or off), and (4) provide evidence that the modified protein is protected from cleavage for weeks at a time (no leak from our system, unlike other systems).</p></body></sub-article></article>
