adrenergic receptors (βARs) on cardiac myocytes. Blocking these receptors is part of the basis for β-blocker therapy for heart failure. Recent data demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including βARs, are activated intracellularly, although the biological significance is unclear. Here we investigated the functional role of Golgi βARs in rat cardiac myocytes and found they activate Golgi localized, prohypertrophic, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, that is not accessed by cell surface βAR stimulation. This pathway is accessed by the physiological neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) via an Oct3 organic cation transporter. Blockade of Oct3 or specific blockade of Golgi resident β1ARs prevents NE dependent cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. This clearly defines a pathway activated by internal GPCRs in a biologically relevant cell type and has implications for development of more efficacious β-blocker therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adrenergic antagonists</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>phospholipase C</kwd><kwd>hypertrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smrcka</surname><given-names>Alan V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00HL122508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irannejad</surname><given-names>Roshanak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>β-adrenergic receptors at the Golgi apparatus activate a local signaling pathway, not accessed by cell surface receptors, to drive cardiac hypertrophy and could represent a target for heart failure therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, are the leading cause of disease and death in the developed world. In response to long term pathological stress, such as hypertension or myocardial infarction, the levels of neurohumoral factors such as epinephrine, endothelin and angiotensin II increase. These hormones directly stimulate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including β-adrenergic receptors in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Angelo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rockman et al., 2002</xref>). Chronic stimulation of these receptors, including stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) by catecholamines, drives cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling, ultimately leading to heart failure. The efficacy of β-blocker therapy for treatment of heart failure results, at least in part, by ameliorating chronic βAR stimulation in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bristow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies by our group, and others, have implicated specific phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes downstream of Gq and Gs-coupled GPCRs in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. PLCβ isoforms stimulated by Gq have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy driven by cell surface α-adrenergic receptors (αAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filtz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grubb et al., 2011</xref>). Our laboratory identified a critical role of PLCε in cardiac hypertrophy driven downstream of the endothelin (ET-1A) receptor and cAMP signaling by βARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). PLCε is poised as a nexus for multiple receptor signaling systems due to its diversity of upstream regulators including heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits and small GTPases, including Rap, Rho and Ras, and cAMP via the Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Epac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harden and Sondek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Smrcka et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>PLCε and Epac are scaffolded together at the nuclear envelope in cardiac myocytes by the hypertrophic organizer, muscle-specific A kinase anchoring protein (mAKAPβ), in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dodge-Kafka et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of PLCε in cardiac myocytes induces hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi apparatus leading to release of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inactive IP<sub>2</sub> in the vicinity of the nucleus to facilitate nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) and subsequent downstream hypertrophic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vega et al., 2004</xref>). In previous work we found that either the Epac-selective cAMP analog, cpTOME, or forskolin stimulation of adenylate cyclase, activate PLCε-dependent Golgi PI4P hydrolysis in cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, the βAR agonist isoproterenol (Iso), does not stimulate Golgi PI4P hydrolysis despite strongly stimulating cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nash et al., 2018</xref>). As an explanation for this apparent paradox we demonstrated PLCε-dependent PI4P hydrolysis can be controlled by two distinct pools of cAMP delimited by distinct PDE isoforms. One pool, limited by PDE3 acts through Epac and Rap1 to activate PLCε, while a second pool controlled by PDE2 and/or PDE9A inhibits PLCε activity through activation of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nash et al., 2018</xref>). cAMP generated downstream of Iso cannot access the Epac/mAKAPβ/PLCε complex unless PDE3 is specifically inhibited, partially explaining the lack of activation of Golgi PI4P hydrolysis by Iso.</p><p>A new paradigm for generating localized cAMP signals in cells has been established by a number of recent studies indicating that GPCRs in different intracellular compartments have discrete signaling outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vilardaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irannejad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Irannejad and von Zastrow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stoeber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>). An emergent idea is that βARs internalized into endosomes continue to stimulate cAMP accumulation resulting in cellular outcomes distinct from those generated by βARs at the cell surface. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irannejad et al. (2017)</xref> established that β1ARs expressed at the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells can induce G protein activation in the Golgi when stimulated by either a cell permeant agonist, dobutamine, through passive diffusion, or the physiological hormone epinephrine, when transported across the cell membrane by the organic cation transporter, Oct3. These ideas led us to hypothesize that in cardiac myocytes, βARs resident at the Golgi apparatus could generate cAMP that has privileged access to the Epac/mAKAPβ/PLCε scaffold at the nuclear envelope/Golgi interface, thereby yielding a set of signals divergent from those generated by cell surface βARs. We demonstrate that endogenous β1ARs at the Golgi apparatus in cardiac myocytes are required to stimulate hypertrophic Epac/PLCε-dependent PI4P hydrolysis at the Golgi, and that these intracellular βARs can be accessed by physiological neurotransmitters, and synthetic β-blockers and agonists. These data present a potential new paradigm for drug development for treating heart failure through deliberate targeting of internal βARs in cardiac myocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dobutamine induces β1-AR activation and PI4P hydrolysis at the Golgi</title><p>In previous studies we showed that cAMP produced upon stimulation with the βAR agonist, Iso, does not induce PI4P hydrolysis at the Golgi in NRVMs without addition of a PDE3 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nash et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesized that intracellular βARs may be required to generate a specific pool of cAMP with privileged access to the Epac/mAKAPβ/PLCε complex, and that the cell impermeant agonist, Iso, is unable to access these internal receptors. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the membrane permeant β1AR-agonist, dobutamine, either alone, or in combination with the βAR antagonists, metoprolol and sotalol, which are membrane-permeant and -impermeant, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irannejad et al., 2017</xref>). NRVMs were transduced with an adenovirus expressing the PI4P biosensor, FAPP-PH-GFP and stimulated with dobutamine (100 nM) or PBS. In contrast to Iso, dobutamine stimulated rapid and sustained PI4P hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). Addition of metoprolol, but not sotalol, blocked dobutamine-stimulated PI4P hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> middle and right panels). This indicates that stimulation of an intracellular population βARs is required for dobutamine-mediated PI4P hydrolysis. To visualize βAR activation at the Golgi apparatus, NRVMs were transfected with translocatable Venus-based sensor of Gs coupled receptor activation, NES-Venus-mini-Gs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). When a Gs coupled receptor is activated, NES-Venus-mini-Gs binds to the activated receptor, which is then visualized as translocation from the cytoplasm to membranes where the activated receptor is located, providing information on receptor activation in subcellular compartments. In unstimulated cells NES-Venus-mini-Gs is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. We did not detect translocation of NES-Venus-mini-Gs to endogenously expressed receptors (data not shown), although, as has been previously reported, we were able to detect staining of endogenous β1ARs at the Golgi in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), so NRVMs were cotransfected with FLAG-β1AR. Addition of dobutamine to cells co-expressing NES-Venus-mini-Gs and FLAG-β1AR, caused a rapid clearance of cytoplasmic fluorescence and accumulated fluorescence at the PM and punctate structures, possibly corresponding to microtubules. This was followed by slower translocation of Venus associated fluorescence to the perinuclear region of the cell colocalizing with the CFP-giantin, a marker for the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Iso also caused rapid translocation to the PM but, in contrast to dobutamine, no accumulation at the perinuclear region was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). To further confirm association of NES-Venus-mini-Gs with the Golgi, cells were treated with dobutamine for 8 min to cause NES-Venus-mini-Gs translocation to the perinuclear region, followed by treatment with Brefeldin A. Brefeldin A treatment significantly reversed NES-Venus-mini-Gs association with the perinuclear region, confirming Golgi localization of NES-Venus-mini-Gs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>). Taken together, these data support the idea that a population of βARs present at the Golgi can be activated by exogenous agonists and stimulate Gs, ultimately resulting in PLC activation and PI4P hydrolysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48167.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dobutamine induces PI4P hydrolysis through the activation of internal βARs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NRVMs were transduced with FAPP-PH-GFP and stimulated as indicated.

The non-selective cation transporter, OCT3 has been shown to be responsible for this transport, therefore we utilized three structurally distinct inhibitors of OCT3, corticosterone (100 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), abacavir (10 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and lamotrigine (10 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickens et al., 2018</xref>) to determine if OCT3 is required for NE-stimulated intracellular PI4P hydrolysis. Preincubation of NRVMs with any of these inhibitors prevented NE from inducing PI4P hydrolysis, suggesting that OCT3-mediated transport is required for stimulation of PI4P hydrolysisby this catecholamine. In addition, we sought to determine if receptor internalization is required for NE-mediated PI4P hydrolysis and βAR activation at the Golgi.

The reason for this enhancement is unclear but the differential effects of corticosterone on dobutamine vs NE are consistent with blockade of NE entry into the cell, but not dobutamine.

A number of investigators have characterized GPCRs on the nuclear envelope in neurons and cardiac myocytes, and signaling mechanisms have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boivin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Merlen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dahl et al., 2018</xref>). GPCRs and G proteins have been found on other intracellular compartments including the Golgi apparatus, but signaling roles for receptors at the Golgi are not well defined. This is in part because GPCRs are trafficked through the Golgi apparatus on their way to the cell surface and it has not been clear that GPCRs in the Golgi have a signaling function. The recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irannejad et al. (2017)</xref> definitively demonstrated that Golgi localized β1ARs and Gs can be driven to an active conformation by exogenous ligands. Recent work from the Calebiro laboratory demonstrated that the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor activates Gs in the Golgi in mouse thyroid cells through a mechanism that relies on endosomal retrograde trafficking of internalized receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Godbole et al., 2017</xref>). This is in contrast to what is shown here in cardiac myocytes, and as reported by Irannejad et al. in Hela cells, where activation of Golgi β1ARs does not involve receptor internalization but rather relies on Golgi resident receptors and transport of ligands across the cell membrane via Oct3.</p><p>The work presented here elucidates a possible physiological function for Golgi resident βARs through a signal transduction pathway we previously demonstrated to be involved in regulation of cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nash et al., 2018</xref>). This pathway involves a nuclear envelope scaffolded complex of Epac/PLCε and mAKAPβ. cAMP dependent activation of Epac acts an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap which directly stimulates PLCε enzymatic activity toward Golgi PI4P, resulting in local production of DAG and subsequent nuclear PKD activation. A conundrum arising from previous work was that direct activation of Epac with a cAMP analog cpTOME, or treatment with forskolin strongly stimulates PLCε dependent Golgi PI4P hydrolysis, however; stimulation with Iso had no effect on PI4P hydrolysis despite strongly stimulating global cAMP production. Demonstration that a Golgi resident β1AR can locally activate this system solves this conundrum. Missing from this analysis is demonstration of the presence of adenylyl cyclase (AC) at the Golgi. Due to the inadequacy of AC antibodies and the likely low levels of this enzyme, localization of AC by immunocytochemical analysis is not possible. Nevertheless, binding of AC5 to mAKAPβ in cardiac myocytes has been previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kapiloff et al., 2009</xref>) indicating that AC is likely locally available to be activated by Golgi β1ARs and Gs.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48167.028</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Signal transduction by cell surface and Golgi β1ARs.</title><p>β1ARs are located on both the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus in cardiac myocytes. Stimulation of cell surface β1ARs leads to production of cytosolic cAMP but this cAMP cannot access the Epac/PLCε/mAKAPβ due to PDE3 dependent hydrolysis of cAMP. To access Golgi β1AR, NE crosses the plasma membrane via the Oct3 transporter. We speculate that the Oct3 transporter is also present in the Golgi allowing access to the Golgi lumen and there is evidence for the presence of Oct3 on intracellular membranes as discussed in the text. Once activated in the Golgi, β1AR stimulates Gs and subsequent production of cAMP locally. Missing from this diagram is adenylyl cyclase which we presume is in the Golgi apparatus. There is evidence for adenylyl cyclase binding to mAKAPβ in cardiac myocytes. Local cAMP has privileged access to the Epac/PLCε/mAKAPβ complex which leads to PLCε-dependent production of local DAG from PI4P.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48167-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The purpose of internal GPCR signaling is likely to generate signals that are local and distinct from receptors at the PM or other intracellular locations. In this way specific processes can be controlled by second messengers that have the potential to activate a vast number of global responses if the signals were not restricted. In the case of the cardiac myocyte, during acute sympathetic stimulation, norepinephrine may only access cell surface βARs needed to mediate increases in cardiac contraction required to meet the demands of a sympathetic response. Because signaling by Golgi βARs requires uptake of ligand prior to activation, these processes are slower and may not be accessed during acute sympathetic responses, but rather are only activated during more chronic exposure such as is observed in cardiovascular stress. Separation of the Epac/mAKAPβ/PLCε pathway at the nuclear envelope/Golgi interface from global cAMP dependent PKA activation possibly prevents inappropriate activation of PLCε dependent hypertrophic responses to acute βAR activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Requirement for internal β1ARs for cardiac hypertrophy</title><p>Significantly, stimulation of hypertrophy by the natural sympathetic ligand NE required activity of Golgi localized βARs. As has been discussed, sustained elevated sympathetic drive is one of the major factors responsible for development of cardiac hypertrophy due to chronic hypertension. β-blocker therapy efficacy is thought to result from preventing chronic stimulation of cell surface βARs by elevated catecholamines and subsequent desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bristow, 2000</xref>). Our results suggest that blockade of internal receptors may be required to prevent catecholamine-induced hypertrophy and demonstrates that activation of cell surface GPCRs is not sufficient for natural catecholamines to induce hypertrophy in NRVMs. The importance of blockade of Golgi GPCRs is supported by the fact that the cell permeant βAR antagonist metoprolol is significantly more effective than the cell impermeant antagonist sotalol in prevention of dobutamine stimulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Interestingly, clinically effective β-blockers tend to be relatively hydrophobic. Metoprolol and carvedilol are first line β blockers that are used to treat heart failure and have log P values 1.8 and 4.2 respectively, and are thus relatively cell permeant. Sotalol, which has a log P of −0.85 is relatively cell impermeant, and is not clinically used for heart failure treatment. We speculate that hydrophobicity might be an important factor for β-blocker development allowing these inhibitors to access internal pools of receptor.</p><p>A seeming contradiction is the observation that the cell impermeant agonist isoproterenol induces hypertrophy in vitro and when chronically administered in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iaccarino et al., 1998</xref>). Iso administered in vivo is not at physiological concentrations and has multiple target tissues beyond the cardiac myocyte, such as the vasculature, that could contribute to hypertrophy. For NRVMs in vitro, while Iso can induce hypertrophy by a mechanism that probably does not rely on internal receptors, the effects of the natural ligands epinephrine and norepinephrine are more relevant to the in vivo situation and do rely on Golgi localized βARs. The synthetic agonist Iso seems to rely on an alternative PM mediated pathway that is not engaged by the physiological agonist NE. It will be critical to determine if in the in vivo pathology of heart failure that internal β receptors play a critical role using animal models such as transaortic constriction (TAC) that mimic hypertensive stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Rat)</td><td valign="top">NRVM</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated myocytes from neonatal rats</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">NES-Venus-mini-Gs</td><td valign="top">Nevin Lambert, Augusta University, GA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Golgi localized β1-adrenergic receptors stimulate Golgi PI4P hydrolysis by PLCε to regulate cardiac hypertrophy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The present study by Nash et al. is potentially of high relevance as it provides evidence that beta1-adrenergic receptors signal via Gs proteins on membranes of the Golgi complex in primary cardiomyocytes and is involved in catecholamine-induced hypertrophy. Moreover, they propose a novel mechanism whereby NE reaches (via Oct3) Golgi-resident beta1-adrenergic receptors to stimulate hypertrophic pathways through local activation of Epac/PLCepsilon/PKD. Overall, this is an interesting and well-conducted study on an emerging and highly relevant aspect of GPCR signaling.</p><p>The following are concerns that should be addressed in a significant revision before a final decision can be made.</p><p>1) Further work is needed to rule out the alternative interpretation that the signaling involves retrograde trafficking of internalized receptors/ligands to the trans-Golgi network/Golgi.</p><p>A) The lack of effect of the endocytosis inhibitor Dyngo is an important result and needs a positive to control to show Dyngo effectiveness. This could be done for instance by expressing fluorescently labelled beta1-adrenergic receptors and monitoring their internalization by fluorescence microscopy or, ideally, more quantitative approaches.</p><p>B) Show endogenous beta1-adrenergic receptors at the Golgi capable of activation of Gs (one should consider that showing mini-G recruitment to a certain subcellular compartment does not automatically demonstrate that endogenous G proteins are present and/or are activated by receptors in that compartment).</p><p>C) Confirm the Oct3 inhibitor does not block dobutamine activation of PI4P hydrolysis (similar to the control performed for hypertrophy). Additionally, it would be important to show that, as predicted by their model, beta1-adrenergic signaling at the plasma membrane (e.g. mini-G recruitment) is not affected by the Oct3 inhibitors.</p><p>D) Noticeably, the images and videos (although of relatively poor resolution) actually show rapid mini-G recruitment to what appears to be vesicular structures after agonist stimulation, strongly suggesting the presence of internalized receptors that are active in endosomes. Can the authors exclude that these internalized and active receptors in endosomes subsequently traffic to and accumulate in the trans-Golgi network to induce local Gs activation and PLCepsilon signaling? Could perhaps isoproterenol and dobutamine/NE induce dissimilar internalization/trafficking patterns, which might explain why only dobutamine/NE induce Golgi signaling?</p><p>2) Better establish the responsible signaling mechanisms at the Golgi:</p><p>A) Show adenylyl cyclase localization at the Golgi or that a specific pool of cAMP is induced by the Golgi beta1AR in response to NE.</p><p>B) Can RNAi (or CRISPR) experiments for Epac be performed to validate the link between PI4P hydrolysis by Golgi NE-activated beta1AR and the Epac/mAKAPβ/PLCε complex?</p><p>3) Improve the quantification/presentation of results:</p><p>In single cell experiments, each cell within a separate experiment is a replicate that contributes to the robustness of the mean for each repeat. The figure legends do not make clear how the authors are treating their data and whether they considered individual cells as separate &quot;N&quot; values for determination of variance/SE. This practice would be incorrect. The mean +/- SEM should be calculated from multiple independent experiments &quot;N&quot;, not the cell number/experiments. The method or legend needs to be written in a way that makes it much clearer how statistics were done by indicating the number of independent experiments (N) and the number of cells per experiment (n).</p><p>4) Tone down conclusions regarding physiological relevance:</p><p>A) Given that this study has been performed in cultured cells, the statement &quot;The work presented here elucidates a physiological function for these Golgi localized receptors&quot; (Discussion) seems inadequate. The text should be modified/revised to clearly acknowledge the speculative nature of this with respect of Golgi beta1AR signaling in cardiac function.</p><p>B) Also at issue in this regard is the lack of direct evidence for the role endogenous receptor and Gs at the Golgi (as mentioned in 1B above), which raises questions regarding physiological significance.</p><p>5) Citation of previous work:</p><p>A) In the Introduction, where the authors introduce the new paradigm of signalling by GPCRs at intracellular sites, they should also cite the work on the TSH receptor by Calebiro et al., 2009, which was actually the first study, together with the one on the PTH receptor by JP Vilardaga's group, to show that GPCRs can signal via classical Gs-dependent pathways at intracellular sites.</p><p>B) Besides the recent findings on the beta1-adrenergic receptor, there is strong evidence that the TSH receptor signals in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. This was already hypothesized based on trafficking and colocalization data in Calebiro et al., 2019 and then directly demonstrated in a recent study by the same group (Godbole et al., 2017). Interestingly, whereas in the case of the beta1-adrenergic receptor NA seems to reach Golgi-resident beta1-adrenergic receptors, in the case of the TSH receptor it has been demonstrated that this occurs via retrograde trafficking of receptors and hormones to the trans-Golgi network, where they activate a local pool of Gs, adenylyl cyclase and PKA II to induce efficient nuclear signalling. The authors should cite and discuss these recent findings on the TSH receptor and comment on the similarities/differences with the model they are proposing for the beta1-adrenergic receptor.</p><p>C) Adding references to the last paragraph of the Discussion section on Iso data would be helpful.</p><p>Other issues raised in the review that should be addressed.</p><p>6) The experiments raise the question of how norepinephrine gets from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen in the cell types studied. Is this required for its activation of receptors and, if so, is there a transporter expressed in these cells?</p><p>7) The signaling pathway with all its implicated components is reasonably complicated and should be presented in a schematic that shows their cellular location. This could be supplementary material. In particular, the Discussion leaves unclear the location of adenylyl cyclase that is activated by Golgi localized Gs.</p><p>8) Figures 1A and 4A: legends or figures do not make clear if ligands have been washout. It'd incorrect to state that NE or Dob mediates sustained PI4P hydrolysis without ligand washout.</p><p>9) Figure 1B, C: Specify whether these are merged fluorescent and brightfield images?</p><p>10) Figure 3A: GalT-mApple looks saturated and pixelated. In addition, images showing Nb80 in the Golgi after Rapamycin addition should be provided as a positive control of the experiments.</p><p>11) Figure 4B: these images and Figure 4—video 1 do not convincingly show recruitment of mGs-Venus at the plasma membrane and then to the Golgi. A better analysis should be provided. This reviewer recommends STED microscopy to demonstrate Golgi localization of the beta1AR/mGs complex in response to NE; calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients between mGs-venus and a Golgi fluorescent marker would also support authors' conclusion.</p><p>12) Figure 7A: Scale bars need to be included to show that images were acquired at the same magnification.</p><p>13) Figure 2: Western blot data showing the efficiency of the PLCε shRNA should be included.</p><p>14) The time point when agonists were added should be indicated in Figure 1D.</p><p>15) &quot;si&quot; needs to be corrected to &quot;sh&quot; in Figure 2A.</p><p>16) &quot;NC&quot; in Figure 2B needs to be defined in figure legend. Include RA1 viral transduction protocol in Materials and methods section.</p><p>17) Define &quot;FOB&quot; in figure legends for Figures 7B and 8.</p><p>18) Figure 7B: vehicle and Metoprolol images have what appears to be bubbles on top of the cells. These artefacts usually affect image analysis. Were these images used for the data provided?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48167.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The following are concerns that should be addressed in a significant revision before a final decision can be made.</p><p>1) Further work is needed to rule out the alternative interpretation that the signaling involves retrograde trafficking of internalized receptors/ligands to the trans-Golgi network/Golgi.</p><p>A) The lack of effect of the endocytosis inhibitor Dyngo is an important result and needs a positive to control to show Dyngo effectiveness.

We used N-terminally FLAG tagged β1AR and labeled intact cells with anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to Cy3. All of the labeling was at the cell surface. Dobutamine or NE addition caused weak internalization consistent with previously published results showing that β1ARs do not internalize well (1, 2). No Golgi labeling was observed. Strong stimulation with Iso did cause internalization that was blocked by pretreatment with Dyngo providing a positive control for the efficacy of Dyngo supporting the data shown in Figure 5. Together these data strongly suggest that internalization is not responsible for activation that is observed at the Golgi by these two agonists as had previously been shown (1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Show endogenous beta1-adrenergic receptors at the Golgi capable of activation of Gs (one should consider that showing mini-G recruitment to a certain subcellular compartment does not automatically demonstrate that endogenous G proteins are present and/or are activated by receptors in that compartment).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely. The Mini-G experiments are presented to bolster the majority of the data with endogenous receptors G proteins and signaling components. Significantly, the key experiment using Golgi targeted NB80 to block the endogenous signaling pathway is strong evidence that the endogenous β1ARs are signaling at the Golgi apparatus (1). We have tried to observe recruitment of Mini-Gs with endogenous receptors and have not been able to get convincing images likely due to the relatively low levels of receptor present, that nevertheless are quite capable of stimulating the endogenous signaling cascades. We were able to detect endogenous β1ARs in cardiac myocyte now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Other work has clearly demonstrated the presence of G proteins at the Golgi apparatus (3-5). Thus our conclusions are entirely consistent with the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Confirm the Oct3 inhibitor does not block dobutamine activation of PI4P hydrolysis (similar to the control performed for hypertrophy).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, data showing that Oct3 inhibition does not block dobutamine-dependent PI4P hydrolysis. Surprisingly we see an enhancement of dob-dependent PI4P hydrolysis in the presence of corticosterone which we do not understand at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it would be important to show that, as predicted by their model, beta1-adrenergic signaling at the plasma membrane (e.g. mini-G recruitment) is not affected by the Oct3 inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B that Oct3 inhibition does not affect Iso dependent cAMP production indicating that Oct3 inhibition does not affect β1AR signaling at the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Noticeably, the images and videos (although of relatively poor resolution) actually show rapid mini-G recruitment to what appears to be vesicular structures after agonist stimulation, strongly suggesting the presence of internalized receptors that are active in endosomes.

Could perhaps isoproterenol and dobutamine/NE induce dissimilar internalization/trafficking patterns, which might explain why only dobutamine/NE induce Golgi signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 1A. We do not believe these structures are endosomes but rather may be Gs on microtubules. There are multiple reports that Gs binds to tubulin (6, 7). It is not clear whether they are recruited to these structures due to receptor activation or whether they just become visible when the cytoplasm is cleared of the mini-G fluorescence upon receptor activation. They appear with much faster kinetics than does movement of β1ARs into endosomes with Iso stimulation and once they appear they do not traffic but rather are stationary. Additionally, as discussed in point 1A above, NE and dobutamine cause weak internalization of the βARs, and when we label cell surface receptors with anti-FLAG antibody none of this fluorescence appears in the Golgi when treated with any agonist (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Finally, the results with Dyngo showing that it does not affect NE-dependent PI4P hydrolysis (Figure 5D and E), coupled with the new positive control data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, confirms that the signaling at the Golgi is not dependent on receptor internalization into endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Better establish the responsible signaling mechanisms at the Golgi:</p><p>A) Show adenylyl cyclase localization at the Golgi or that a specific pool of cAMP is induced by the Golgi beta1AR in response to NE.</p></disp-quote><p>Showing adenylyl cyclase localization at the Golgi is likely not possible due to the low abundance of the native protein and poor antibodies. To my knowledge no one has successfully localized native adenylyl cyclase isoforms in cells. On the other hand it has previously been shown that adenylyl cyclase binds to mAKAPβ in cardiac myocytes (8). Thus, there is likely a local adenylyl cyclase that can be accessed by Gs in the Golgi compartment.</p><p>With regard to visualization of a specific pool of cAMP at the golgi: Many others have shown specific compartmentation of cAMP in cells including in cardiac myocytes and are perhaps more adept at these analyses than we are (for example: (9). cAMP compartmentation is a well-established biological phenomenon. I would also argue that just because you can see cAMP in a particular compartment, this does not define a functional role, and if you can’t see it, it does not mean there is none generated due to possible limitations of FRET sensors. We believe that our contribution is to ascribe a <underline>functional</underline> role for a specific cAMP pool and we believe the body of evidence we present is sufficient to support the conclusions of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Can RNAi (or CRISPR) experiments for Epac be performed to validate the link between PI4P hydrolysis by Golgi NE-activated beta1AR and the Epac/mAKAPβ/PLCε complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We could do this but we have already provided extensive evidence in multiple publications that Epac at mAKAPβ is involved in cAMP dependent regulation of PI4P hydrolysis (10-12). The compound we use in this study, HJC, is a highly specific inhibitor of Epac (13). Thus we feel this link is already well established. The primary contribution of this manuscript is to show that Golgi localized receptors are required for cAMP to access Epac in this complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Improve the quantification/presentation of results:</p><p>In single cell experiments, each cell within a separate experiment is a replicate that contributes to the robustness of the mean for each repeat. The figure legends do not make clear how the authors are treating their data and whether they considered individual cells as separate &quot;N&quot; values for determination of variance/SE.

The method or legend needs to be written in a way that makes it much clearer how statistics were done by indicating the number of independent experiments (N) and the number of cells per experiment (n).</p></disp-quote><p>All of the graphs have been remade where N is represents the number of biological replicates from individual experiments with cells isolated from individual animals. These experiments are all done with primary myocytes which requires preparations from separate animals for each experiment since myocytes cannot be passaged in culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Tone down conclusions regarding physiological relevance:</p><p>A) Given that this study has been performed in cultured cells, the statement &quot;The work presented here elucidates a physiological function for these Golgi localized receptors&quot; (Discussion) seems inadequate. The text should be modified/revised to clearly acknowledge the speculative nature of this with respect of Golgi beta1AR signaling in cardiac function.</p></disp-quote><p>I have done this somewhat by changing the wording in various places to say “possible physiological functions”. These are primary cardiac myocytes acutely isolated from neonatal rats. This greatly raises the difficulty of these experiments, with the goal that studies from these physiologically relevant cells have significant relevance to physiology. Neonatal myocytes beat in culture and respond to hypertrophic stimuli with increases in cell size, hypertrophic gene expression, and protein synthesis. We also show that this system operates in adult myocytes. Neonatal myocytes while not always perfect are a well established model for studying cardiac hypertrophy. I agree that these experiments will have to be backed up in an animal model of heart failure, but they should be given credit for having some meaningful level of physiological relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Also at issue in this regard is the lack of direct evidence for the role endogenous receptor and Gs at the Golgi (as mentioned in 1B above), which raises questions regarding physiological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Except for the experiments with Venus-Mini-Gs, which were done with transfected β1AR, <italic>all</italic> of the experiments were done with the endogenous signaling system present in cardiac myocytes. The role of endogenous internal receptors in general was clearly established by multiple methods. The key experiments demonstrating a role for endogenous receptors at the Golgi are shown in Figure 3B and Figure 5F where targeting of a nanobody, Nb80, to the Golgi apparatus blocks the ability of dobutamine or NE to stimulate PI4P hydrolysis, and in Figure 8C and D, blocks cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This nanobody specifically binds to βARs and competes for βAR-G protein interactions, thus demonstrating that endogenous Golgi localized βAR-dependent G protein activation is responsible for stimulation of PI4P hydrolysis and hypertrophy. Finally, this is consistent with previously published work in Hela cells showing endogenous β1AR signaling at the Golgi (1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Citation of previous work:</p><p>A) In the Introduction, where the authors introduce the new paradigm of signalling by GPCRs at intracellular sites, they should also cite the work on the TSH receptor by Calebiro et al., 2009, which was actually the first study, together with the one on the PTH receptor by JP Vilardaga's group, to show that GPCRs can signal via classical Gs-dependent pathways at intracellular sites.</p></disp-quote><p>This reference was added to the last paragraph of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Besides the recent findings on the beta1-adrenergic receptor, there is strong evidence that the TSH receptor signals in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. This was already hypothesized based on trafficking and colocalization data in Calebiro et al., 2019 and then directly demonstrated in a recent study by the same group (Godbole et al., 2017). Interestingly, whereas in the case of the beta1-adrenergic receptor NA seems to reach Golgi-resident beta1-adrenergic receptors, in the case of the TSH receptor it has been demonstrated that this occurs via retrograde trafficking of receptors and hormones to the trans-Golgi network, where they activate a local pool of Gs, adenylyl cyclase and PKA II to induce efficient nuclear signalling. The authors should cite and discuss these recent findings on the TSH receptor and comment on the similarities/differences with the model they are proposing for the beta1-adrenergic receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>A discussion of these concepts has been added to the subsection “Compartmentalized GPCR signaling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Adding references to the last paragraph of the Discussion section on Iso data would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Some references have been added to this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues raised in the review that should be addressed.</p><p>6) The experiments raise the question of how norepinephrine gets from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen in the cell types studied. Is this required for its activation of receptors and, if so, is there a transporter expressed in these cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes the Oct3 transporter has been shown to be present on the plasma membrane AND internal membranes in cardiac cells (14) and other cells (15) and is one possible mechanism for transport into the Golgi lumen. This is now diagrammed in Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The signaling pathway with all its implicated components is reasonably complicated and should be presented in a schematic that shows their cellular location. This could be supplementary material. In particular, the Discussion leaves unclear the location of adenylyl cyclase that is activated by Golgi localized Gs.</p></disp-quote><p>A new figure (Figure 9) now has a schematic showing the various components of the system.

It'd incorrect to state that NE or Dob mediates sustained PI4P hydrolysis without ligand washout.</p></disp-quote><p>The ligands have not been washed out. I’m not sure why this is incorrect. In the presence of agonist the response is sustained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 1B, C: Specify whether these are merged fluorescent and brightfield images?</p></disp-quote><p>These are separate mini-Gs-Venus and CFP golgi images that have not been merged.

A better analysis should be provided. This reviewer recommends STED microscopy to demonstrate Golgi localization of the beta1AR/mGs complex in response to NE; calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients between mGs-venus and a Golgi fluorescent marker would also support authors' conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated a pearson’s coefficient from multiple images and this reported in the figure legend for 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 7A: Scale bars need to be included to show that images were acquired at the same magnification.</p></disp-quote><p>Scale bars have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 2: Western blot data showing the efficiency of the PLCε shRNA should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>A western blot has been added to Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The time point when agonists were added should be indicated in Figure 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) &quot;si&quot; needs to be corrected to &quot;sh&quot; in Figure 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) &quot;NC&quot; in Figure 2B needs to be defined in figure legend.
