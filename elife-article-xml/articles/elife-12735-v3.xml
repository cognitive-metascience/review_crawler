demonstrated that frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides profoundly influence the replication ability of echovirus 7 (Tulloch <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014). Here, we show that that influenza A virus (IAV) with maximised frequencies of these dinucleotides in segment 5 showed comparable attenuation in cell culture compared to unmodified virus and a permuted control (CDLR). Attenuation was also manifested in vivo, with 10-100 fold reduced viral loads in lungs of mice infected with 200PFU of CpG-high and UpA-high mutants. However, both induced powerful inflammatory cytokine and adaptive (T cell and neutralising antibody) responses disproportionate to their replication. CpG-high infected mice also showed markedly reduced clinical severity, minimal weight loss and reduced immmunopathology in lung, yet sterilising immunity to lethal dose WT challenge was achieved after low dose (20PFU) pre-immunisation with this mutant. Increasing CpG dinucleotide frequencies represents a generic and potentially highly effective method for generating safe, highly immunoreactive vaccines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12735.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12735.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>CpG dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>UpA dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>immunization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT103767MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaunt</surname><given-names>Eleanor</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Huayu</given-names></name><name><surname>Atkinson</surname><given-names>Nicky J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004324/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wise</surname><given-names>Helen M</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicol</surname><given-names>Marlynne Quigg</given-names></name><name><surname>Beard</surname><given-names>Philippa M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dutia</surname><given-names>Bernadette M</given-names></name><name><surname>Digard</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004211</institution-id><institution>Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT091663MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Lian N</given-names></name><name><surname>Highton</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Klenerman</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K000276/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Digard</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutants of influenza A virus with increased CpG dinucleotide frequencies show restricted replication and reduced or absent pathogenicity, and powerful host innate and adaptive responses to infection that confer immunity to re-infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The newly developed DNA technology to create viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wimmer et al., 2009</xref>), bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>) and recently, whole eukaryotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annaluru et al., 2014</xref>) with entirely synthetic genomes provides unparalleled opportunities to functionally explore replication and gene regulation. Insertion of sequences with large scale compositional changes using reverse genetic systems established for many RNA and DNA viruses has provided the opportunity to investigate the effect of virus genome composition on replication ability, evolutionary fitness and transmissibility. Large scale recoding of RNA virus genomes can be functionally exploited, for example to attenuate replication in a controllable way so as to create safer, non-reverting viral vaccines. Attenuation may be achieved by increasing the relative frequencies of disfavoured or rare codons encoding the same amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennetzen and Hall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sharp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Based on prokaryotic models, these impair translation rates and accuracy through mismatches with tRNA abundances and effects on ribosomal processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gingold and Pilpel, 2011</xref>). Production of synthetic coding sequences with increasing frequencies of codons or codon pairs that are naturally under-represented in vertebrate and viral genomes have been similarly proposed to reduce translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tats et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutman and Hatfield, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yarus and Folley, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boycheva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nogales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Current methods for virus attenuation have concentrated on sequence alterations designed to influence translation rates. However, it is increasingly recognised that both codon and codon pair de-optimisation (CPD) strategies have additional confounding effects on virus genome composition that are known to also influence virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>). Significantly, selection for disfavoured coding elements increases frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides that are normally suppressed in vertebrate RNA and DNA virus genomes. For RNA viruses, adding CpG and UpA dinucleotides in only a small part of a viral genome severely restricts virus replication, an effect that we have demonstrated to be independent of translation effects on the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism(s) through which dinucleotide composition influences virus replication rates are uncharacterised, and existing data indicates that they are independent of interferon pathways and PKR-mediated recognition of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we have investigated whether the enhanced reactivity of cells to virus infection with high CpG/UpA frequencies in cell culture also modulates their replication and host immune responses in vivo. As an experimental model, we chose to use the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain of influenza A virus (IAV) for which a reverse genetics system has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Wit et al., 2004</xref>) and which replicates in a variety of cell lines and causes pathogenic infections in immunocompetent mice. This system additionally provided the opportunity to investigate whether CpG or UpA elevation showed comparable phenotypic effects on a virus with a substantially different replication mechanism to echovirus 7 (E7), which is markedly attenuated upon increase of the CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequency of its genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of IAV mutants with maximised CpG and UpA dinucleotide composition</title><p>Segment 5 was selected for mutagenesis as it showed no evidence for alternative reading frames, manifested by an absence of suppressed synonymous site variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) apart from the extreme 3’end of the gene, likely reflecting the presence of a segment-specific RNA packaging signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gog et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hutchinson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Segment 5 showed marked suppression of CpG and UpA frequencies across the segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), with averaged values over a window size of 120 bases consistently below the expected frequency of 0.054 based on mononucleotide composition (freq.

Increases in UpA frequencies in sequences maximised for CpG content were re-normalised for UpA composition, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Mutagenesis was carried out between positions 151–1413 of segment 5 to avoid any possible disruption of packaging signals or replication/translation elements at the terminal 150 bases at the ends of the segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gog et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hutchinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ozawa et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The resulting CpG-high mutant contained 86 additional CpG dinucleotides, but only one extra UpA and an identical G+C and mononucleotide content to WT virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Overall the CD4+ T lymphocyte peptide-specific response recorded both locally (lung) and systemically (spleen) was substantially weaker (&lt; 0.5%) than that of CD8+ T cells (data not shown). In order to determine if infection by the attenuated viruses had effects on the hierarchy or magnitude of the T cell response to individual epitopes, ELISPOT assays were performed on thawed frozen splenocytes from mice infected with 200 PFU to quantify their responses against individual peptides used in the ICS cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite alterations to the NP coding sequence, the CpG-high, UpA-high and CDLR groups generated memory CD8+ T cell responses to the dominant NP epitope of equivalent magnitude to the wild-type infected animals. CD8+ and CD4+ cell responses to the unaltered HA protein were unchanged and infection by the attenuated viruses did not appear to alter the hierarchy of dominant epitopes in the peptides measured.</p><p>Induction of neutralising antibody to the PR8 strain of IAV was measured at days 6 and 21 post inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Mice showed minimal weight loss and clinical signs over the infection period (data not shown) and consistent ten- to hundred-fold reduction in lung viral loads as determined by infectivity and quantitative PCR measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This was associated with reduced pathology changes in the lung, with consistent reductions in mean scores for epithelial damage and inflammatory cell infiltrates across all variants of IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Significant differences were observed in the severity of pathology between CpG-high and control mice (WT and CDLR groups). The percentage of peptide specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in the mice given ten-fold lower doses (20 PFU) was correspondingly reduced in all the groups, with an approximately five-fold reduction in local (lung) memory responses and a three-fold reduction in the central (splenic) memory compartment as measured by IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Nonetheless, it is notable that even at the low dose all the modified IAV strains were able to generate T cell memory responses of comparable magnitude to that observed in the wild-type IAV-infected mice. Induction of neutralising antibody, in contrast, was only minimally reduced in mice infected with 20 PFU compared to the original inoculating dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, with the exception of neutralising antibody induction, there was a strong dose dependence on all measured metrics of outcomes and host responses to IAV infection. These findings contrast markedly with the maintained immunoreactivity of CpG- and UpA-high mutants of IAV; despite their impaired replication in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), they maintained comparable innate and T cell responses to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Use of attenuated IAV variants as vaccines</title><p>Mice infected with the original 200 PFU dose of the CpG-high mutant showed an almost entirely non-pathogenic course of infection (absent clinical signs, 4% weight loss), ten–hundred fold lower viral loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and reduced lung pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and yet induced substantial host responses, similar to those of WT virus. This raised the question of whether the response to infection with the CpG high mutant conferred protection from re-infection. To investigate this and to determine the dose of virus required to confer protection, cohorts of 4 mice were infected with reduced doses (100, 50 and 20 PFU) of the CpG-high virus mutant and weight loss was compared with those infected at the original dose (Experiment 3 - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Infection with the 200 PFU dose reproduced the minimal weight loss observed previously at day 6 (97.7% ± 0.4% of starting weight compared to 96.4% ± 2.7% previously observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>]), while mice infected with all lower doses showed no significant weight loss relative to the uninfected control group. No mice showed clinical signs of infection.</p><p>At day 21 post-inoculation, mice in each group (200 PFU, 100 PFU, 50 PFU, 20 PFU and mock) were challenged with 200 PFU of PR8 WT virus. As expected, the mock-immunised group developed severe symptoms of infection comparable to the outcome of WT infection observed in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, none of the mice previously inoculated with any dose of CpG-high virus showed clinical symptoms of infection or weight loss. Lung samples collected at day 6 post-WT inoculation with all doses of CpG-high IAV were consistently virus and PCR-negative, indicating that sterilising immunity had been achieved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Increasing the frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in segment 5 of the PR8 strain transformed the phenotype of IAV in cell culture and in vivo. CpG- and UpA-high variants were attenuated in vitro and showed major alterations in pathogenicity on mouse inoculation. The approximately ten-fold reduction in replication kinetics reproduced the attenuation achieved in different classes of viruses where similar degrees of mutagenesis had been applied (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that attenuation originates through a shared, although as yet immunologically uncharacterised mechanism. Quantitation of virion protein expression and production and of RNA copies from different IAV segments in viral stocks of WT and CDLR, CpG- and UpA-high mutants provided evidence that the mutated segment 5 viral RNA and protein were packaged appropriately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>).</p><p>The similarity in replication kinetics between WT and the permuted control, CDLR furthermore indicated that the attenuated phenotype of the CpG- and UpA-high mutants originated from compositional alterations in the coding sequence and was not the result of impaired translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Simmonds et al., 2015</xref>), unintended disruption of uncharacterised RNA structure or replication elements embedded in the segment 5 coding sequence. Segment 5 is indeed not suspected of coding for additional proteins in alternative reading frames and shows little evidence of RNA structure or other elements in the central coding region that are required for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gog et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hutchinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Priore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mutagenesis applied left codon pair bias relatively unchanged; for example the CPS of the CpG-High mutant was -0.011 compared to a WT score of 0.011 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Use of the permuted control, maintenance of the CPS score in mutants, verification of unimpaired transcriptional and translational profiles in virus stocks and application of mutagenesis in a region without alternative transcript production provides a sufficiently robust framework for us to be confident that the observed attenuation of the CpG- and UpA-high viruses was primarily the result of the introduction of CpG and UpA dinucleotides.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Development of an attenuated vaccine for influenza A virus</title><p>The CpG-high virus was replication defective and infections in mice were associated with a clear reduction in pathogenicity compared to WT and oterIAV mutants. However, the CpG-high mutants induced comparable immune and cytokine responses to WT virus, including potent T cell responses both in the lung and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), equivalent to the response to WT virus despite its &gt;ten-fold reduction in replication. In contrast, the UpA-high virus also showed restricted replication yet infections in mice were accompanied by substantial pathogenicity, including weight loss, clinical signs of infection and inflammatory/necrotic damage to the lung comparable to WT virus.</p><p>Several attributes of the CpG-high mutant produced in the current study are therefore favourable for the potential future use of this attenuation strategy to produce an effective and safe vaccine for IAV. Firstly, we have documented that its attenuated phenotype results directly from the compositional changes in segment 5 since other forms of sequence disruption that retained dinucleotide frequencies (CDLR) was phenotypically equivalent to WT. Thus attenuation is based on the cumulative effect of several hundred individual nucleotide changes associated with increasing CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that cannot readily revert to wild type virulence. This contrasts with conventional attenuation mechanisms, in which replication ability is decreased through the presence of a limited number of nucleotide changes that may potentially revert. For example, attenuation of the currently used temperature sensitive FluMist backbone of IAV is dependent on only 4–5 amino acid changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2003</xref>) and there is at least the theoretical possibility that one or more of these may revert and increase virulence in vaccinees.</p><p>As reviewed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simonsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rimmelzwaan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sridhar et al., 2013</xref>)., attenuated vaccines share with inactivated IAV vaccines an ability to induce powerful T cell responses that represent an important element of the protective immunity to wild type challenge. The CpG-mutant in the current study induced these responses both in the lung and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), equivalent to the response to WT virus despite its &gt;ten-fold reduction in replication in the lung. The presence of T cell epitopes in more conserved genome regions than HA and NA additionally provides the ability of a monovalent attenuated vaccine to confer protection against heterologous IAV challenge, as has been demonstrated in experimental mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nogales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, while both CpG- and UpA-high mutants showed replication impairment in cell culture and in vivo, the CpG-high mutant showed substantially greater attenuation of pathogenicity, despite the greater restriction of replication of UpA-high in vivo These findings suggest the existence of additional host response factors and interactions beyond replication phenotype in determining outcomes of infection. These may potentially be related to the ability of both CpG- and UpA-high mutants to induce powerful innate and adaptive immune responses in infected mice disproportionate to their replication phenotypes. The key observation was the equivalence in T cell and B cell responses and induction of local cytokine responses by virus mutants that replicated ten–hundred fold less in the lung than WT (or CDLR) viruses. Contrastingly, inoculation of all of these viruses at a ten-fold lower dose reduced host response to a degree comparable to their reduction in replication. Similar maintenance of host response despite attenuation of replication has been observed repeatedly in other studies in which codon or codon pair usage was altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nogales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>). As discussed above, these parallel outcomes would be anticipated if their replication impairment arose though unintended increases in CpG and UpA frequencies. Contrastingly, observations of their high levels of apparently enhanced immunogenicity would furthermore be highly problematic to explain had their attenuation been dependent purely on inhibition of replication through retardation of translation.</p><p>Understanding the pathways by which CpG- and UpA-high virus mutants are attenuated is essential before dinucleotide compositional alteration can be adopted as generic vaccine strategy. As discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Simmonds et al., 2015</xref>), attenuation is dependent more on an active restriction pathway within the cell rather than CpG- and UpA-high mutants being intrinsically defective. In the future development of CpG-high mutants as attenuated vaccines, further work is clearly required to understand how this compositional change can uncouple the three outcomes of replication kinetics, host immune response and pathogenicity. The apparent “adjuvanting” effect of increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides on host immune response observed in the current study is highly relevant to the balance between vaccine efficacy and safety.

The four lobes of the right lung were inflated with and then immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, UKSigma-Aldrich) until fixed, then processed using routine methods and embedded in paraffin blocks. 5 μm thin section were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. The sections were assessed (blinded) by a veterinary pathologist (PMB). The individual pathology features assessed were damage to the airway epithelium (degeneration, necrosis and repair), perivascular inflammation, peribronchi/bronchiolar inflammation, interstitial inflammation, interstitial necrosis and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Each feature was scored from 1 (mild) to 3 (marked). The percentage of lung affected was also noted. A challenge experiment was undertaken, whereby mice in groups of 4 were inoculated with 100, 50, or 20 PFU of CpG-high virus, or mock infected (DMEM only). At 3 weeks post-inoculation, mice were challenged with 200 PFU of WT PR8 virus. Mice were euthanised at 6 days post-challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mouse cytokine array</title><p>Equal volume of homogenates of lungs in the same group was pooled together. Levels of cytokines were determined using Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array - Panel A (R&amp;D systems ARY006) commercial kit according to its instruction. Briefly, cytokines in lung homogenates were detected by a detection antibody cocktail and subsequently attached to antibody spots printed on membranes with each spot recruiting one cytokine. A fluorescence dye was then added and fluorescence of each spot was visualised and quantified using LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Cambridge, UK). For each cytokine, spots were printed in duplicate. An average value was calculated and normalized by the mock-infected control. A heat map was generated based on the folds of induction over the mock-infected group. Cytokines with &gt;two fold induction over mock-infected group and with &gt;two fold induction or inhibition compared with the WT-infected group were highlighted in a parallel heat map.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Microneutralisation assay</title><p>Mouse sera were pre-treated with receptor destroying enzyme using the RDE Kit (Cosmos Biomedical, Swadlincote, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Confluent MDCK cells in 96 well plates were washed to remove FCS, and mouse sera were added to plates and two-fold serially diluted down the plate to a final dilution of 1:1280. 200 PFU/ well of PR8 virus stock was added, and wells were overlaid 1:1 with Avicel containing trypsin and BSA as described previously. Cells were incubated at 37°C overnight. Overlay was removed and the cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0.2% Triton-X100. Primary antibody reactive for influenza A NP was added 1/1000 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab20343) in ELISA buffer (10% horse serum, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated for 1 hr. Cells were washed and secondary antibody (peroxidase labelled anti-mouse antibody, Thermo scientific, Loughborough, UK SA1-100) was added 1/1000 in ELISA buffer for 1 hr. Cells were washed and treated with True Blue Peroxidase (KPL, 50-78-02) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and then visually inspected for colorimetric differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and flow cytometry</title><p>Mice were euthanized at day 21 post-inoculation and the lungs and spleen were removed for analysis. Single cell suspensions were generated from perfused lung by incubating the dissociated tissue in RPMI containing DNase and collagenase, and then passing the digested tissue through a 45 µm cell sieve to release the tissue-bound lymphocytes. These were treated with ACK lysing buffer (Life Technologies, Loughborough, UK) to remove red blood cells and then resuspended in RPMI+10% FCS. Spleens were dissociated through a 45 µm cell sieve and then ACK lysing buffer was used to remove red blood cells. The splenocytes were resuspended in RPMI+10% FCS. Lung and spleen single cell suspensions were counted using an automated cell counter (Biorad). 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes or lung lymphocytes were incubated for 6 hr at 37<bold>°</bold>C with a cocktail of peptides (NP<sub>147-155</sub> (TYQRTRALV), HA<sub>518-526</sub> (IYSTVASSL), HA<sub>462–472</sub> (LYEKVKSQL) and HA<sub>126–138</sub> (HNTNGVTAACSHE) (ProImmune, Oxford, UK)) designed to activate both CD8+ and CD4+ influenza PR8-specific T cells. Media-only wells were included as negative controls. Golgi-stop was added 2 hr post-stimulation and stimulation was stopped by storing the cells at 4<bold>°</bold>C 4 hr later. ICS was performed according to methods provided with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Bioscience, Oxford, UK). Briefly, the cells were treated with Fc block (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK) and then labelled with Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies, Loughborough, UK) and the fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies CD8-PerCPCy5.5 (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK) and CD4-eFluor450 (eBioscience), followed by fixation and permeabilisation. The anti-cytokine antibodies IFN-γ-APC (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK), TNF-α-FITC (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK) and IL-2-PE (BD Bioscience, Oxford, UK) were added, and then cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FCS, 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM EDTA). Samples were analyzed on the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>IFN-γ ELISpot assay</title><p>IAV peptides were selected to match the sequence of the PR8 strain of IAV and to represent immunodominant epitopes in the BALB/c strain (Influenza Research Database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fludb.org">http://www.fludb.org</ext-link>). CD8+ T cells from BALB/c mice respond strongly to an epitope in the NP protein NP<sub>147-155</sub> (TYQRTRALV) (NP) and two further epitopes in the HA protein, HA<sub>518-526</sub> (IYSTVASSL) (HA-dom) which is dominant and HA<sub>462-472</sub> (LYEKVKSQL) (HA-sub) which induces weaker responses. The HA protein also contains a CD4+ T cell epitope HA<sub>126-138</sub> (HNTNGVTAACSHE) (HA-CD4), which was measured in these experiments.</p><p>IFN-γ ELISpot assays were performed on frozen splenocytes thawed and rested overnight in 3 ml RPMI+10% FCS (R10) in 37<bold>°</bold>C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Mabtech, Sweden). Briefly, rested splenocytes were plated in duplicate at a concentration of 1–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> splenocytes per well in Hydrophobic Immobilon Membrane plates (Merck Millipore, Watford, UK) coated with 100 µl of anti-IFN-γ (10 µg/ml) (Mabtech, Sweden). Cells were stimulated with the individual peptides (3 µg/ml final concentration) which constituted the peptide cocktail used in the ICS. Cells were stimulated with R10+0.1% DMSO as negative control. After overnight stimulation at 37<bold>°</bold>C, 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> the wells were washed and the number of IFN-γ producing cells detected by addition of biotinylated anti-IFN-γ (Mabtech) (50 µl at 1 µg/ml), followed by Streptavidin-AP (Vectorlabs, Peterborough, UK) (50 µl at 1:750 dilution) and the substrate NBT/BCIP (Thermo Fisher, Loughborough, UK). The number of spots generated in each well was counted using an automated ELISPOT reader (AID Elispot, Wheatley, UK). The number of spots generated in the negative control wells was used to determine the limit of detection of the assay (5 spots per 10<sup>6</sup> cells).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Marc Lipsitch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Losick as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. For reasons stated below we consider this an important Research Advance related to your prior <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes the attenuation of influenza viruses by altering the frequency of CpG and UpA dinucleotides. As way of background, there have been a number of papers arguing that viruses can be attenuated by altering their &quot;codon-pair&quot; frequencies. Some of the authors of this paper have argued that this codon-pair de-optimization was in fact due to the fact that altering codon pairs also increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides. They have published prior work showing that altering the dinucleotide frequencies without altering codon pairs leads to similar levels of attenuation. Based on this work, they have argued that CpG/UpA di-nucleotides mediate attenuation of mammalian viruses though some as-yet unknown mechanism. This study is an important continuation of previous work from this group exploring the biology of codon bias in virus-host interactions using echovirus 7. The paper is lucid and experiments performed at the highest levels of technical competence. The findings will be of general interest for both basic and translational scientists.</p><p>In the current work, the authors generate influenza viruses where they alter the CpG/UpA content in influenza NP. They examine four viruses: wildtype PR8, PR8 with scrambled nucleotides but no systematic change in dinucleotides, viruses with more CpG, and viruses with more UpA. They find that the CpG and UpA viruses are greatly attenuated both in MDCK cells and mice. The scrambled control appears slightly attenuated in MDCK cells and not detectably attenuated in mice. The CpG/UpA viruses induce substantial levels of cytokines despite replicating less well. This is used to note that such viruses might be a good way to create vaccines.</p><p>Reasons for converting the article to a Research Advance:</p><p>Overall, all reviewers found the article interesting but felt it did not demonstrate its central argument – that dinucleotide frequencies are the mechanism of viral attenuation, with sufficient certainty to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The primary problem is as follows: there are undoubtedly a great number of ways that synonymous mutations can alter viral fitness, including altering with RNA structure, altering translation efficiency, altering genome packaging efficiency, introducing spurious splicing, etc. So how are we to know that the CpG/UpA altered viruses are really attenuated <italic>because</italic> of their altered di-nucleotide content, rather than due to some other effect of one of the numerous synonymous mutations. We are supposed to be re-assured that this is not the case because the scrambled control. While such a scrambled control is necessary to make such a case (and certainly should have been included in all of the now dubious codon-pair de-optimization studies), it is not sufficient. In effect, we have one data point for the control (the scrambled control) and two data points for the di-nucleotide alteration.</p><p>Put another way, every nucleotide sequence can be characterized by a number of summary statistics – nt frequency, nt pair frequency, codon frequency, codon pair frequency, codon triplet frequency, RNA folding energy, etc. These often multivariate summary statistics (e.g. codon pair frequency, which contains values for each pair) can be further summarized down to a single summary – such as CPS. Each of these summary statistics is correlated with many of the others. It is certainly true that IF summary statistic A is mechanistically causal, and summary statistic B is not, and there are no other important features of the sequence controlling attenuation <italic>then</italic> creating variant sequences that change A but hold B constant should attenuate, while variants that change B without changing A should not attenuate. The converse doesn't follow. The true cause of attenuation could be some feature that no one has thought to look for, something perhaps as simple as the frequency of one particular codon that tends to change when adapting sequences to measure A but not measure B. Or it could be something extremely complex involving long-range interactions that for some reason tend to be much more sensitive to measure A than to measure B. Just as the recognition that changing CPS tends to change CpG frequencies generated an alternate hypothesis for attenuation, one could generate other alternate hypotheses for summaries that correlate with these measures. For practicable numbers of experiments, it will be hard to exclude – based on the attenuation of certain sequences but not others – all but one hypothesis for the causal mechanism.</p><p>Given the inability to sample all possible properties of a sequence that might attenuate a virus, we believe the only way to establish the scientific point that there is a specific mechanism to inhibit viruses with altered di-nucleotides would be to isolate the host factor(s) that are specifically responsible for the CpG/UpA attenuation, and show that there is a specific biophysical interaction triggered by CpG/UpA dinucleotides. By analogy, the finding that a particular sequence is the mechanism of bacteriophage restriction is made far more convincing by the discovery of a specific restriction enzyme with the specified target sequence that restricts phage replication and that, when knocked out in the bacterial host, no longer does so.</p><p>It is not reasonable in the scope of an <italic>eLife</italic> revision to request such a further discovery. However, in the absence of such data, this study adds further circumstantial evidence to the authors' prior work suggesting di-nucleotides can attenuate viruses. But on its own, the data here don't fully clinch the case and certainly don't provide a sufficient advance over the prior work to merit publication as a new Research Article in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The experimental evidence provided by this work, though not conclusive, is an advance over the prior work. Moreover, another interesting advance is thatthe attenuated di-nucleotide viruses are also attenuated in vivo, and induce good immunity. While not terribly surprising this is potentially useful from a practical perspective and would further justify publication as a Research Advance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were concerned about the comparisons of wt vs. mutated viruses based solely on PFU. As recently reported by a number of labs, flu virus preps can differ widely in their number of semi-infectious particles, and that in one case, this was modulated by sequence alterations. It would be nice to see that the different viruses don't vary widely in their particle to PFU ratios. This can be easily done by flow cytometry at very low MOI to enumerate the number of particles capable of producing viral proteins following infection. For example see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/6/3155.short">http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/6/3155.short</ext-link>. At the same time, the findings can be corroborated just based on HA titrations: which despite its simplicity is perhaps the most accurate method for counting particles (at the end point, there is one particle for every two RBC).</p><p>2) The flow analysis using mAbs for HA, NA, NS1, M1, M2, and NP to stain cells infected at very low MOI would also demonstrate whether to what extent mutants synthesize major viral proteins at the same rate as wt virus from the same number of input particles (one particle per cells).</p><p>3) It is well established that UV or γ-irradiated virus, despite not replicating at all, is highly immunogenic for T cell responses, and similarly less immunogenic for antibody responses. This should be mentioned and incorporated into the Discussion, viz., what are the advantages/disadvantages of dinucleotide modified viruses vs. inactivated virus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12735.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In response to the requested essential revisions, we have made the following changes:</p><p>1) We have performed several further investigations of the infectivity of WT and mutant version of IAV quantified by HA assay (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The principal findings from these additional experiments (as summarised in the second paragraph of the subsection “Replication phenotypes of segment 5 CpG- and UpA-high mutants”) was that there was indeed a consistent 3-5 fold increase in virus particle (quantified by either HA or qPCR assays) to infectivity ratios of CpG-high and UpA-high mutants compared to WT (or CDLR permuted control) variants. We additionally showed that this difference was not the result of a packaging defect since:</p><p>A) Immunostaining of cells infected at low multiplicity for a range of IAV proteins from 5 of the 8 segments at 6 hours post-infection revealed comparable proportions of cells positive for each protein between WT and mutant forms of IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>B) The relative amounts of NP, HA1, HA2 and M viral structural proteins in partially-purified virions from the different mutants were comparable by PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>C) Quantitation of segment 5 and 2 RNAs in virus stocks indicated little variation in the relative proportions of each segment between WT and IAV mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>These new results that were requested by the reviewers are summarised in the Results section in the revised manuscript. We have not attempted to estimate particle numbers from the HA titres as there is unfortunately no universal conversion factor to go from HAU to particle number – binding is affected by many other factors such as HA affinity and specificity for sialic acid, as well as NA activity/specificity and particle shape. However, the relevant analysis is the ratio between HA titre and infectivity and the potential existence of differences in this ratio between WT and mutant strain of IAV.</p><p>Collectively, the additional experiments have provided no evidence for a packaging defect in virions of CpG- and UpA-high mutants, yet has confirmed differences in virion / infectivity ratios. As a more general perspective, increasing CpG and UpA frequencies in other virus systems (e.g.echovirus 7) also increases RNA/particle to infectivity ratios. E7 is a monopartite virus indicating that alterations to RNA / infectivity ratio as a result of dinucleotide frequency changes occur independently of packaging. Summarily, the reviewers requested further analysis in the form of HA assay, which we have undertaken and supported by generating HA:infectivity and RNA:infectivity ratios.</p><p>2) To demonstrate that the rate and of protein synthesis was the same for wildtype and mutated viruses, we (as described in the previous section) have quantified by immunofluorescence the numbers of cells expressing a range of viral proteins: NP, M2, NS1, NA and PB2. Cells produced these proteins at approximately the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To show that the same <italic>amount</italic> of protein is produced, virus stocks were analysed by PAGE, and relative ratios of the different virus structural proteins were quantified. The relative amounts of protein production were consistent, demonstrating that NP production was not defective in our mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, we have not observed any evidence for reduced packaging of individual segments in the CpG and UpA-high virus mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>, 4 and 5).</p><p>3) To meet the guidelines of a Research Advance, we have reduced the word count of the study and it is problematic to include a further discussion of vaccine strategies in the specific context of the paper. We have however edited the section describing different strategies for IAV attenuation to include reference to inactivated vaccines and their ability to induce protective T cell responses (subsection “Development of an attenuated vaccine for influenza A virus”, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
