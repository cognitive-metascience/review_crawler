orchestrate SNARE complex assembly, and Synaptotagmin-1 to trigger fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane fusion. However, it is unclear whether Munc13s function upstream and/or downstream of SNARE complex assembly, and how the actions of their multiple domains are integrated. Reconstitution, liposome-clustering and electrophysiological experiments now reveal a functional synergy between the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1, indicating that these domains help bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes to facilitate stimulation of SNARE complex assembly by the Munc13-1 MUN domain. Our reconstitution data also suggest that Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, αSNAP and the SNAREs are critical to form a ‘primed’ state that does not fuse but is ready for fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Overall, our results support a model whereby the multiple domains of Munc13s cooperate to coordinate synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13696.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13696.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13696.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the brain, neurons communicate with each other using small molecules called neurotransmitters. Electrical signals in one neuron trigger the release of the neurotransmitters, which then bind to receptor proteins on another neuron nearby. Neurotransmitters are packaged into small compartments called synaptic vesicles and are released from the neuron when these vesicles fuse with the membrane that surrounds the cell. Many proteins are involved in regulating this process to ensure that neurotransmitters are released at the right place and time.</p><p>A large protein called Munc13 plays an important role in the release of neurotransmitters. It contains many different regions, including a long domain called MUN and three additional domains called C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C among others. However, it is not clear how all these domains work together to control neurotransmitter release. Here Liu, Seven et al. address this question using purified proteins inserted into membranes as well as experiments in neurons from mice. The experiments show that the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains all play key roles in neurotransmitter release. Together with the MUN domain, these three domains help to form bridges between synaptic vesicles and the membrane surrounding the neuron. These bridges could help other proteins involved in neurotransmitter release to form a group that induces vesicle fusion.</p><p>Liu, Seven et al.’s findings also suggest that Munc13 proteins cooperate with other proteins to form a 'primed' state in which a synaptic vesicle is ready to rapidly fuse with a neuron’s membrane when triggered to do so by an electrical signal. A future challenge is to find out how the proteins that form this primed state promote vesicle fusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13696.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13696.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>Munc13</kwd><kwd>Munc18</kwd><kwd>C2 domain</kwd><kwd>reconstitution</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SynVglut</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS037200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS040944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Munc13 C-terminal domains synergize to coordinate synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of neurotransmitters by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis is a key event for communication between neurons and involves several steps, including vesicle docking at presynaptic active zones, a priming reaction(s) that leaves the vesicles ready for release, and fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sudhof, 2013</xref>).

It is now clear that synaptobrevin-liposomes can fuse with syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 liposomes under some conditions but not others, and that fusion is stimulated to different degrees by Syt1, Munc18-1 or Munc13-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Bogaart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tucker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boswell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parisotto et al., 2012</xref>), but such fusion is abolished by NSF and αSNAP because they disassemble syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). However, inclusion of Munc18-1 and a Munc13-1 fragment enable fusion at least in part because they protect against the disassembly activity of NSF-αSNAP while coordinating SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). These results explained the essential nature of Munc18-1 and Munc13s for neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>) and correlated with earlier studies of the role of the HOPS tethering complex in yeast vacuolar fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite these advances, fundamental questions remain about the mechanism of neurotransmitter release, in particular regarding the functions of Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>). These large proteins of presynaptic active zones contain a variable N-terminal region that in some isoforms include a C<sub>2</sub> domain (the C<sub>2</sub>A domain), and a highly conserved C-terminal region that includes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for Munc13-1): i) a C<sub>1</sub> domain involved in diacyglycerol (DAG)-phorbol ester-dependent augmentation of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basu et al., 2007</xref>); a C<sub>2</sub>B domain that regulates release probability and modifies short term plasticity through its Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylinositolphosphate-binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>); a MUN domain that is key for the crucial function of Munc13 in release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basu et al., 2005</xref>) and mediates the activity of Munc13 in opening syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>); and a C<sub>2</sub>C domain that is also important for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>) and is not predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> but may bind phospholipids because this is a common property of C<sub>2</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rizo and Sudhof, 1998</xref>). The central function of Munc13s in neurotransmitter release was initially associated to an essential role in vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>), but later studies that used stringent definitions of vesicle docking (see discussion) uncovered a critical role for Munc13s in docking that was attributed to their activity in mediating SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imig et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unknown whether Munc13s participate in upstream interactions that might help bridging the two membranes to promote docking and priming. This possibility is attractive because the MUN domain is related to tethering factors involved in diverse forms of membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2011</xref>) and is flanked by domains with demonstrated or potential lipid-binding properties. Moreover, while there is evidence that Munc13s modulate release probability and have a role beyond docking [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>)], it is unclear whether they form part of the primed complex after SNARE complex assembly, influencing membrane fusion downstream of priming.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13696.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN strongly stimulates lipid mixing between V- and T-liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain diagram of Munc13-1.

Our results show that both the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain of Munc13-1 play important functions in release, and suggest that these domains help bridging synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating the activity of the Munc13-1 MUN domain in promoting SNARE complex assembly. Moreover, our results indicate that the neuronal SNAREs, Munc18-1, NSF, αSNAP and a Munc13-1 fragment including the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) are sufficient to generate a ‘primed’ state that is ready to trigger fast membrane fusion upon addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus resembling the primed state of synaptic vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN strongly stimulates SNARE-dependent lipid mixing</title><p>In experiments that followed our recent reconstitution study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>) and were directed at analyzing how different factors affect the efficiency of membrane fusion, we first analyzed lipid mixing between synaptobrevin-liposomes (V-liposomes) and syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 liposomes (T-liposomes) by monitoring de-quenching of the fluorescence of NBD-labeled lipids incorporated in the synaptobrevin-liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weber et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These experiments were initiated in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added at 300 s to examine the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>-dependence of the results. The liposomes contained a synaptic-like lipid composition and, unless otherwise specified, the T-liposomes included DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, which activate the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).

The enhancement of lipid mixing induced by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN was independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was SNARE-dependent, as it was strongly impaired by addition of the cytoplasmic region of synaptobrevin (Syb-cd) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The extent of lipid mixing between V- and T-liposomes in the presence of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN was comparable to that caused by a soluble fragment spanning the two C<sub>2</sub> domains of Syt1 (C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>; in contrast, Munc18-1 had only a small stimulatory effect on lipid mixing, and did not enhance the stimulation caused by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>As expected, addition of NSF-αSNAP abolished the strong stimulatory effect of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN but lipid mixing was highly efficient again when both C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and Munc18-1 were added in the presence of NSF-αSNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with the notion that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and Munc18-1 mediate SNARE complex assembly in an NSF-αSNAP-resistant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Note that these experiments did not include Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB and yet lipid mixing was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent in the presence of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP. Moreover, removal of DAG, PIP<sub>2</sub> or both from the T-liposomes caused increasingly stronger impairments of lipid mixing in these experiments but had much milder effects on the stimulation of lipid mixing caused by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN in the absence of NSF-αSNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). These data show that the effect of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN alone on lipid mixing arises from a property that is largely independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, whereas the lipid mixing observed in the more complete reconstitutions including C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP is stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, thus exhibiting properties that are more similar to those of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN clusters phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes</title><p>The ability of Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB to bind simultaneously to two membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arac et al., 2006</xref>) underlies at least in part its activity in stimulating SNARE-dependent lipid mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tucker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, we tested whether Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is also able to bridge two membranes by monitoring the formation of liposome clusters by DLS. While C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN did not cluster plain liposomes lacking phosphatidylserine (PS), dramatic increases in particle size observed by DLS revealed efficient clustering of PS-containing vesicles caused by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Inclusion of synaptobrevin, DAG+PIP<sub>2</sub> or syntaxin-1 in the PS-vesicles did not have major effects on the clustering induced by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, as shown by the bar diagrams of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B–E</xref> and by the corresponding intensity autocorrelation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The two types of representations provide different views of the DLS data; below we use one or the other depending on the aspect that we want to emphasize. We note that there is some degree of variability among the particle sizes observed, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the small differences observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B–E</xref>. Hence, these data show that PS is the main determinant for the vesicle clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, although we cannot rule out that synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1, DAG or PIP<sub>2</sub> might affect clustering to a small degree. Similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not have a major effect on clustering of PS-vesicles by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, although it might increase clustering to a small extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13696.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN clusters PS-containing liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) The particle size in samples containing phospholipid vesicles alone (gray bars) or after incubation with Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN for 5 min (red bars) in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was measured by DLS.

This activity might contribute to the role of Munc13s in synaptic vesicle docking and is distinct from the function of Munc13-1 in mediating the transition from the syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), but likely potentiates this function in the reconstitutions that include Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP by placing the MUN domain near the SNARE-Munc18-1 machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Simultaneous evaluation of lipid and content mixing</title><p>As expected, Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB could not stimulate lipid mixing between V- and T-liposomes in the presence of NSF-αSNAP because NSF-αSNAP disassemble the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 t-SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), but it was surprising that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB did not have marked effects on the lipid mixing observed in the presence of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP (data not shown; see also below). This observation prompted us to investigate to what extent the lipid mixing observed in these experiments reflects real membrane fusion. For this purpose, we used an assay that simultaneously measures lipid mixing from de-quenching of the fluorescence of Marina Blue-labeled lipids and content mixing from the development of FRET between PhycoE-Biotin trapped in the T-liposomes and Cy5-Streptavidin trapped in the V-liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zucchi and Zick, 2011</xref>). Addition of unlabeled streptavidin to the reaction ensures that the observed FRET arises only from content mixing. Using this approach, we again observed that efficient lipid mixing in the presence of NSF-αSNAP required C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and Munc18-1, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB did not markedly affect lipid mixing under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). However, content mixing in the presence of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>was inefficient in the absence of Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB and was strongly enhanced by Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). The difference between lipid and content mixing in the absence of Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB emphasizes the fact that lipid mixing may not necessarily reflect true membrane fusion, as described in previous studies [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zick and Wickner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2014</xref>)]. Overall, our results show that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB selectively enhances content mixing but not lipid mixing under our conditions. These findings indicate that Syt1 plays a role in membrane fusion, in agreement with results from single vesicle assays using full-length Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13696.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Syt1 is required for efficient content mixing but not lipid mixing in reconstitutions including Munc18-1, Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and NSF-αSNAP.</title><p>Lipid mixing (<bold>A,C</bold>) between V- and T-liposomes was measured from the fluorescence de-quenching of Marina Blue-labeled lipids and content mixing (<bold>B,D</bold>) was monitored from the development of FRET between PhycoE-Biotin trapped in the T-liposomes and Cy5-Streptavidin trapped in the V-liposomes.

Note that in these assays much of the Cy5 fluorescence increase caused by FRET from PhycoE (reflecting content mixing) should occur during the first round of fusion and that no further substantial increases are thus expected in subsequent rounds of fusion or upon detergent addition. Correspondingly, the maximum Cy5 fluorescence observed in our most efficient fusion reactions was similar to that observed upon detergent addition (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, red curve; see Materials and Methods). In contrast, the lipid mixing signal expressed as percentage of maximum Marina Blue fluorescence is much smaller in the same reactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red curve) because fluorescence de-quenching is expected to continue in successive rounds of fusion and to undergo a further, large increase upon detergent addition due to additional probe dilution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain strongly stimulates liposome fusion</title><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane fusion observed in the presence of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB is efficient but is much slower than that of neurotransmitter release, suggesting that our reconstitutions lack at least one key factor that contributes to the high speed of release in vivo. We hypothesized that the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain might be such a factor based on evidence suggesting that this domain plays an important role in release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madison et al., 2005</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we performed fusion assays between V- and T-liposomes, with or without Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and fragments of Munc13-1 that contained the MUN domain alone or together with the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region, the C<sub>2</sub>C domain, or both (MUN, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, MUNC<sub>2</sub>C and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, respectively).

Since these two domains bind DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, respectively, we tested the effects of removing DAG, PIP<sub>2</sub> or both in the T-liposomes in the full reconstitutions including C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and observed considerable impairments of fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), similar to those observed in the lipid mixing assays of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. We also attempted to examine the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of fusion in these full reconstitutions, which were normally performed with 100 μM EGTA to chelate any residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> before addition of 600 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (to make the concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> 500 μM). However, experiments where we added 100 or 120 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 300 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) yielded similar fusion efficiency to that observed when we added 600 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since the EGTA present should chelate most of the added 100 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these results suggest that a small amount of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> (likely in the 1 μM range or below) is sufficient to trigger fusion in these experiments, but further research will be required to assess the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence more accurately. Note that the sensitivity of the reaction to such low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, compared to those that activate Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001</xref>), can be attributed to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain present in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) (see below), and that residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> might arise from the purified C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, which we did not treat with Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators to avoid removal of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to the C<sub>1</sub> domain.</p><p>We also compared the effects of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments on liposome fusion in the absence of NSF-αSNAP.

To investigate the mechanism underlying these findings, we first performed clustering experiments with T- and V-liposomes under the same conditions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A,B</xref> with addition of only C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN or C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C at different concentrations, and monitored the particle size after 3 min by DLS. Although these measurements reflect not only liposome clustering but also fusion, clustering should dominate the formation of large particles. These data indicated that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is somewhat more efficient in liposome clustering than C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, exhibiting substantial clustering activity at 50–100 nM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Liposome co-floatation assays also suggested that the presence of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain might increase the affinity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C for liposomes, but it is not sufficient for stable liposome binding in the context of MUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, it was unclear whether these effects of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain on clustering and liposome affinity are sufficient to explain those observed on membrane fusion.</p><p>Interestingly, when we analyzed clustering of V- and T-liposomes separately, we found that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C clustered V-liposomes only in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> whereas it clustered T-liposomes in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results contrast with those obtained with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, which clusters V-liposomes even in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and suggest a delicate interplay between multiple lipid binding sites within these large protein fragments (see discussion). Since C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C clustered mixtures of T- and V-liposomes more efficiently than C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), these data suggested that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C may preferentially bridge V-liposomes to T-liposomes. To test this notion more rigorously, we analyzed liposome clustering after 3 min at 20°C to minimize contributions of liposome fusion to the DLS data. Lipid mixing assays confirmed that very little fusion occurs under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). At 20°C, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C again was able to cluster T-liposomes but not V-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which required Ca<sup>2+</sup> for clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A–D</xref>). To test whether populations of clustered and non-clustered liposomes can be distinguished by DLS, we used plain vesicles that did not contain PS or proteins and that, correspondingly, were not clustered by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Indeed, a clearly bimodal distribution of clustered and non-clustered liposomes was observed by DLS when we added C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to a 1:1 mixture of plain liposomes and T-liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

However, it is important to note that there are multiple potential explanations for these activities. The findings that PS is a major determinant of vesicle clustering by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) without requiring Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), but C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cluster V-liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), suggest that there are multiple membrane binding sites in these large protein fragments that can cooperate in cis to interact with a single membrane or in trans to bind to two membranes. Indeed, the MUN, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains contain several positive patches, the C<sub>1</sub> domain binds to DAG, and the C<sub>2</sub>B domain binds to PIP<sub>2</sub> weakly in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and more strongly in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The C<sub>2</sub>C domain is likely to have at least one lipid-binding site with moderate affinity that explains the stronger overall liposome clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) (see discussion). Moreover, the sequence spanning residues 1517–1531 at the C-terminus of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN does not form part of the MUN domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al. 2015</xref>) and contains a highly hydrophobic sequence that could bind to membranes, but this sequence may become structured due to the presence of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, which could render it unable to bind membranes. We speculate that this hydrophobic sequence together with positive patches in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region underlie the liposome clustering activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<bold>A</bold>), while in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C the C<sub>2</sub>C domain provides a PS-binding site that cooperates with the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region to favor binding in cis to the same membrane (<bold>B</bold>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain may favor membrane binding of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in a different orientation that facilitates interaction of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in trans with another membrane, which would explain why Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C can bridge V-liposomes; this orientation could also be favored by binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to PIP<sub>2</sub> and of the C<sub>1</sub> domain to DAG in T-liposomes (<bold>C</bold>), leading to the overall notion that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region binds to the plasma membrane and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain to synaptic vesicle membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

These liposomes contained a smaller percentage of PS (6.8%) that resembles that of synaptic vesicles and prevents inhibition of fusion due to binding of Syt1 to the membrane where it is anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stein et al., 2007</xref>).

To test this idea, we analyzed fusion between VSyt1- and T-liposomes in the presence of NSF-αSNAP, Munc18-1 and a mutant Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment where two of the aspartate Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligands were mutated to asparagine (D705N,D711N) to disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. We found that content mixing was strongly impaired by the D706N,D711N mutation while Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent lipid mixing was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain is critical for fusion under these conditions. To examine how these results are related to the membrane bridging activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, we analyzed the particle size in fusion reactions where all protein and liposome concentrations were diluted eight-fold, which still allows a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced stimulation of content mixing for WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (as observed in the experiments performed with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>) but not for the D706N,D711N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). DLS analysis of the 8-fold diluted fusion reactions including WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C showed that much of the liposome clustering had already occurred after 3 min in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while little changes were observed 1 min after adding Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a moderate increase in particle size occurred as the reaction progressed to completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3E</xref>). In analogous reactions with the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C D706N,D711N mutant, efficient clustering occurred after 3 min and did not increase further afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3F</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that, while Ca<sup>2+ </sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C might contribute to more efficient bridging of V- to T-liposomes, it is unlikely that an effect on such bridging alone can explain the dramatic enhancement of content mixing induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Note also that the finding that the D706N,D711N mutation disrupts content mixing but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent lipid mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) correlates with the observation that efficient content mixing in the presence of WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while there is substantial lipid mixing without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9A,C,E</xref>). Indeed, quantification at 300 s, before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, showed that the fluorescence increase reflecting lipid mixing was 28.9% of that observed 200 s after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition while content mixing was minimal at 300 s (fluorescence 3.3% of that observed 200 s after adding Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). This difference is exacerbated by the fact that the maximal fluorescence associated with content mixing is expected to correspond to only one round of fusion, whereas additional rounds of fusion can contribute to the maximal fluorescence in the lipid mixing signal. Hence, these results suggest that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, NSF-αSNAP and Munc18-1 enable formation of a ‘primed state’ that is ready for membrane fusion and includes assembled trans-SNARE complexes, as lipid mixing can occur, but requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain for fast full fusion that might be further accelerated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains are critical for neurotransmitter release</title><p>Rescue experiments in which Munc13-1 fragments were overexpressed using the Semliki Forest virus in neurons from Munc13-1/2 double KO mice indicated that the MUN domain is sufficient to rescue neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basu et al., 2005</xref>), but other functional studies in chromaffin cells and C. elegans indicated that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is also critical to rescue Munc13 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madison et al., 2005</xref>). To clarify the functional importance of different domains for Munc13-1, we performed additional rescue experiments in autaptic neuronal cultures from Munc13-1/2 double KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>) but expressing Munc13-1 fragments with a lentiviral expression vector, which does not overexpress proteins at such high levels as the Semliki Forest virus. Analysis of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) revealed that a Munc13-1 fragment encompassing the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C region rescued close to 50% of the EPSC amplitude compared to rescue with WT Munc13-1, whereas Munc13-1 fragments spanning the MUN, MUNC<sub>2</sub>C or C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN sequences led to only very small levels of rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the readily-releasable pool using hypertonic sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>). These results need to be examined with caution because distinct expression levels were observed for the different fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, all Munc13-1 fragments were expressed at higher levels than WT, and hence their levels should be sufficient to rescue release if the fragments are functional. Indeed, since there is no release in Munc13-1/2 double KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>), the very small amounts of release observed for the rescues with MUN, MUNC<sub>2</sub>C and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragments imply that these fragments can perform Munc13-1 function to some degree, albeit with very low efficiency, and vast protein production may have compensated for functional deficiency in the previous rescues with Semliki Forest virus overexpression of the MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basu et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, the robust rescue observed with the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) shows that the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain indeed plays an important role in neurotransmitter release, in clear correlation with our reconstitution data. Moreover, the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region is also critical for Munc13-1 function, as the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment is much less active than C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in both the rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and in our fusion assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13696.028</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains are critical for neurotransmitter release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representatives traces of single AP-evoked EPSCs from Munc13-1/2 DKO hippocampal neurons rescued with Munc13-1 full length, or C-terminal Munc13-1 fragments, in response to 2 ms somatic depolarization.

Moreover, it was unknown how the functions of the different domains that form the highly conserved C-terminal region of Munc13s are integrated. Our results now show that both the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B-region preceding the MUN domain and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain at the C-terminus are critical for neurotransmitter release, and suggest a strong functional synergy between these domains that arises because they help bridging the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, facilitating the activity of the MUN domain in mediating opening of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results also indicate that the neuronal SNAREs, Munc18-1, Munc13, NSF and α-SNAP are crucial to generate a ‘primed state’ that includes Munc13 as an integral component and is ready to release but needs Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger fast membrane fusion.</p><p>Our reconstitutions recapitulate many key features of synaptic vesicle fusion, providing an ideal system to investigate the mechanism of release. The total abrogation of neurotransmitter release observed in the absence of Munc18-1 and Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>) established that these two proteins are the most central factors of the membrane fusion apparatus together with the SNAREs; accordingly, membrane fusion depends strictly on Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in our reconstitutions, as shown in a compelling fashion by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>. Moreover, fusion exhibits a tight dependence on Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) and removal of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region or the C<sub>2</sub>C domain of Munc13-1 markedly impairs fusion in our reconstitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9B</xref>) as well as neurotransmitter release in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The dependence of fusion on DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) correlates with the notion that these factors enhance neurotransmitter release in part via their respective interactions with the Munc13 C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). NSF and αSNAP are key for the strict requirement of Munc18-1, Munc13-1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> for fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), and for the dependence of lipid mixing on DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), because they disassemble syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weber et al., 2000</xref>), ensuring that vesicle docking, priming and fusion proceed through the Munc18-1-Munc13-dependening pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although our reconstitutions are incomplete (see below), these multiple correlations with physiological data imply that the mechanisms of action of the proteins included are likely to be related at least in part to those operating in vivo. The finding that the Mun13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment can bridge V-liposomes to T-liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is particularly revealing because it suggests a natural model for how the different domains that form the conserved C-terminal region of Munc13s cooperate to mediate synaptic vesicle docking and priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), providing an explanation for why this fragment rescues neurotransmitter release and stimulates liposome fusion much more efficiently than shorter fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). In this model, we assume that NSF-αSNAP disassemble the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 complex in the T-liposomes and Munc18-1 binds to the released syntaxin-1 folded into a closed conformation. Bridging of the two membranes through respective interactions with the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain at opposite ends of the highly elongated MUN domain creates a ‘cage-like’ environment to facilitate SNARE complex assembly, placing the MUN domain in an ideal position to exert its activity in accelerating the transition from the syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This model is consistent with studies that revealed an important function for Munc13s in docking using stringent vesicle-plasma membrane distance criteria [direct contact or &lt;5 nm; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imig et al., 2014</xref>)], and that suggested that docking is equivalent to priming, reflecting partial SNARE complex formation (note that this notion may not be valid for more relaxed definitions of docking). Our model postulates that Munc13s function in docking and priming not only because they promote SNARE complex assembly but also because they participate in upstream interactions that provide a bridge between the two membranes.</p><p>A function of Munc13s in docking in the traditional sense of bridging two membranes (sometimes referred to as tethering when the intermembrane distances are longer) seems natural given the architecture of their conserved C-terminal region, with an elongated MUN domain that is flanked by domains with demonstrated or putative membrane-binding properties and that is related to tethering factors involved in traffic at diverse compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, these tethering factors likely facilitate SNARE complex formation by similar mechanisms to that proposed here for Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>). The presence of C<sub>1</sub> domain and C<sub>2</sub> domains adjacent to the MUN domain in Munc13s provides opportunities for modulation by factors that regulate release such as DAG, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, Munc13-1 contains an N-terminal C<sub>2</sub>A domain that contributes to vesicle docking via interaction with αRIMs [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>); M. Camacho and C. Rosenmund, unpublished results], which underlies the finding that rescue of release by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and further supports the notion of an overall role for Munc13s in docking. We also note that reconstitution studies had previously shown that Munc13-4 promotes docking of V- to T-membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boswell et al., 2012</xref>), but it is unclear to what extent this activity is related to that describe here for Munc13-1 because the C-terminal C<sub>2</sub> domain of Munc13-4 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is not predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rizo and Sudhof, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic vesicle docking and priming occur before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and hence the underlying interactions are not expected to require Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Correspondingly, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C can bridge V- to T-membranes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The interactions that cause such bridging are still unclear and extensive studies will be required to characterize them because the distinct vesicle clustering properties of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggest that these large protein fragments contain multiple membrane binding sites that can cooperate in cis to interact with a single membrane or in trans to bind to two membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have been unable to express the C<sub>2</sub>C domain alone and we have not detected specific interactions of this domain with the SNAREs in preliminary NMR experiments using the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment. Although this fragment does not bind tightly to liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), it seems likely that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain contains a lipid-binding site(s) with moderate affinity, as this feature would explain the stronger overall liposome clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and phospholipid binding is a characteristic property of C<sub>2</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rizo and Sudhof, 1998</xref>). We speculate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C may bridge T- and V-liposomes because the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region binds to the DAG-PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing T-liposomes in a configuration that favors binding of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in trans to another membrane, i.e. a V-liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Cooperation between multiple C<sub>2</sub>C domains could readily strengthen the V-liposome binding and hence the bridging activity.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> had generally small effects on vesicle clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3E</xref>) except for a strong stimulation of V-liposome docking by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) that is unlikely to have physiological relevance. Hence, an effect on docking cannot explain the dramatic effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the reconstitutions that include C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B,D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9B,D</xref>). Note that the ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to stimulate both lipid and content mixing of V- and T-liposomes is largely independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), as expected because Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C clusters V- to T-liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). In the presence of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP, there is substantial lipid mixing but practically no content mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and both lipid and content mixing occur very fast upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations indicate that partial SNARE complex formation already occurs in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in the formation of a ‘primed state’ that is ready for fusion but only fuses (and fast) upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition [note in this context that the lipid mixing observed before adding Ca<sup>2+</sup> can occur through lipid transfer when the SNARE complex brings membranes transiently into proximity without the need for fusion or hemifusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zick and Wickner, 2014</xref>)]. Formation of this primed state requires Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, αSNAP and the three SNAREs, but not Syt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Such requirements correlate with the findings that Munc18-1 and Munc13s are essential for vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>) whereas Syt1 is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacaj et al., 2015</xref>), supporting the notion that the primed state formed in our reconstitutions resembles the primed state of synaptic vesicles.</p><p>The nature of the primed protein complex underlying this state is unclear, but it is likely to include C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and Munc18-1 since the MUN domain binds to membrane-anchored SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guan et al., 2008</xref>) and Munc18-1 also binds to SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulubova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). This proposal is consistent with data suggesting a role for Sec1p (the yeast Munc18-1) after SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grote et al., 2000</xref>) and with the observation that a constitutively open syntaxin-1 mutant fully rescues the docking defect observed in <italic>Unc13</italic> nulls in C. elegans but rescues neurotransmitter release only partially, which also suggested a role for Unc13 downstream of SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>). It is also possible that α-SNAP forms part of this primed complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zick et al., 2015</xref>). Regardless of its composition, our data suggest that the primed state is metastable and requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain for efficient content mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>) either because the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>-bound Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain contributes directly to facilitate membrane fusion or because Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding releases an inhibitory interaction existing in the primed state. The finding that a mutation in a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>-binding loop of the Munc13-2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain increases release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) is consistent with both possibilities and supports the notion that Munc13s form intrinsic part of the primed state of synaptic vesicles.</p><p>Clearly, our reconstitutions raise many questions and are incomplete, as they do not incorporate other important proteins that control release such as CAPS, complexins, RIMs or Rab3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizo and Sudhof, 2012</xref>). While Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB stimulates content mixing in reconstitutions with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the effects of Syt1 become masked with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), likely because this Munc13-1 fragment promotes fusion with high efficiency and no further acceleration can be observed in our experiments. Thus, effects of Syt1 may only be observable at faster time scales, as Syt1 is not essential for release but is key to trigger release with high speed upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sudhof, 2013</xref>). Approaches that allow faster measurements [e.g. single vesicle assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2014]</xref> will be required to test this prediction. An additional advantage of these assays is that they allow distinction of the docking event from lipid and content mixing. Note also that the strong effect of the D705N,D711N mutation in the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain in our reconstitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref>) contrasts with the mild effects of an analogous mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of the related isoform Munc13-2 on evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is plausible that these mild effects arise because this isoform has some functional differences with Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>) or because there is some functional redundancy with another protein not included in our reconstitutions (e.g. CAPS), and the increased release probability caused by the mutation in the Munc13-2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) suggests a role as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that might cooperate with Syt1. Mutating the Munc13-2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites did have marked effects on release during action-potential trains; hence, our reconstitution results, which were obtained in the presence of DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, may be related to hyper-activated states present during these trains.</p><p>Further research will be required to distinguish between these possibilities, but we would like to emphasize that our reconstitutions recapitulate many key features of neurotransmitter release. Hence, unexpected findings from our reconstitutions that appear to contradict physiological data may actually uncover novel mechanistic aspects of release that were not observed in physiological experiments because of functional redundancy or compensatory effects by factors not included in the reconstitutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Expression and purification of full length rat syxtaxin-1A, full length human SNAP-25A (with its four cysteines mutated to serines), full-length rat Synaptobrevin, full-length rat Munc18-1, the rat synaptotagamin-1 C2AB fragment (residues 131–421), full length Cricetulus griseus NSF V155M mutant, full-length Bos taurus αSNAP, and rat Munc13-1 fragments spanning the MUN and MUNC2C regions (residues 859–1531 and 859–1735, respectively, both with residues 1408–1452 from a flexible loop replaced by the sequence EF), were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A construct encoding TM and cytoplasmic regions of Syt1 (residues 57–421 with the following cysteine mutations: C74S, C75A, C77S, C79I, C82L) with a C-terminal His-tag within a Pet28a vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahal et al., 2002</xref>) was a kind gift from Thomas Sollner.

T-liposomes with syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 contained 38% POPC, 18% DOPS, 20% POPE, 20% Cholesterol, 2% PIP<sub>2</sub> and 2% DAG. Lipid mixtures were dried in glass tubes with nitrogen gas and under vacuum overnight. Lipid films were re-suspended and hydrated in buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol (v/v)) with 1% β-OG by vortex and sonication. Purified SNARE proteins and fluorescence labeled proteins were added to lipid mixtures to make Syx:SNAP25:Lipid = 1:5:800 and PhycoE-Biotin 4 µM for T-liposomes; Syb:Lipids = 1:500 and Cy5-Streptavidin 8 µM for V-liposomea; and Syt1:Syb:Lipids = 1:2:1000 and Cy5-Streptavidin 8 µM for VSyt1 liposomes. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and dialyzed against the reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol (v/v)) with 1g/L Biobeads SM2 (Bio-Rad) 3 times at 4°C. The proteoliposomes were purified by floatation on a three-layer histodenz gradient (35%, 25%, and 0%) and harvesting from the topmost interface.</p><p>To simultaneously measure lipid mixing and content mixing, T-liposomes (0.25 mM lipids) were mixed with V-liposomes (0.125 mM lipids) with various additions in a total volume of 200 μl under analogous conditions as those described above for lipid mixing assays, including 100 μM EGTA. All experiments were performed at 30°C, and 0.6 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added at 300 s. The fluorescence signals from Marine Blue (excitation at 370 nm, emission at 465 nm) and Cy5 (excitation at 565 nm, emission at 670 nm) were recorded to monitor lipid and content mixing, respectively. At the end of each reaction, 1% w/v β-OG was added to solubilize the liposomes, and the lipid mixing data were normalized to the maximum fluorescence signal achieved after addition of β-OG. To measure content mixing without interference from vesicle leakiness, most experiments were performed in the presence of 5 μM streptavidin. Control experiments without streptavidin were performed to measure the maximum Cy5 fluorescence attainable upon detergent addition. However, there was a large variability in the maximum Cy5 fluorescence values observed, perhaps because of binding of the dye to the detergent. Since the average maximum values observed in detergent were similar to the maximum Cy5 fluorescence observed at the end of the most efficient fusion reactions (those including the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, blue trace) and the latter was more reproducible, in practice we used averaged maximum values of these reactions for normalization. All the experiments were repeated at least three times with a given preparation and the results were verified in multiple experiments performed with different preparations. For quantification, we calculated the average fluorescence at 500 s, expressed as percentage of the maximum fluorescence, and the corresponding standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measuring the clustering activity of Munc13-1 fragments by DLS</title><p>The clustering activity of Munc13-1 fragments was measured by DLS using a DynaPro instrument (Wyatt Technology; Santa Barbara, CA) basically as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arac et al., 2006</xref>). For experiments with liposomes and Munc13-1 fragments, the conditions and liposome compositions were similar to those of the liposomes used for lipid mixing assays unless specifically indicated. Thus, 0.5 μM Munc13-1 fragments were mixed with T-liposomes (0.25 mM lipids) and/or V-liposomes (0.125 mM lipids) and incubated in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA at 25°C. For titrations with Munc13-1 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), different concentrations of the fragments were mixed with T-liposomes (0.25 mM lipids) and V-liposomes (0.125 mM lipids) and incubated in the same buffer at 30°C. For experiments to monitor particle size in parallel with lipid and content mixing, lipid and content mixing assays were performed at 30°C under the standard conditions described above but with all protein and liposome concentrations diluted 8-fold, and identical samples were analyzed by DLS as a function of time at 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lentiviral constructs</title><p>The cDNAs of Munc13-1 full length and C-terminal fragments (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, aa529-1693; C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, aa529-1508; MUN domain, aa859-1508; and MUNC<sub>2</sub>C, aa859-1693) were generated from rat Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basu et al., 2005</xref>) by PCR amplification.

Your article has been evaluated by Randy Schekman as Senior Editor and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Major revisions are needed before a final decision can be made.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work the function of Munc13 is studied using (1) reconstituted bulk liposome content and lipid mixing assays and (2) electrophysiology experiments in neuronal cultures with rescue using Munc13 DKO hippocampal neurons. The results suggest that the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub> domains (especially C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C) play key roles in priming as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (reconstitution experiments) and 10 (neuronal culture experiments). It is also suggested that the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub> domains act synergistically together with those of synaptotagmin upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering. The study extends a previous one by the authors (Ma et al., 2013) in fundamental ways.</p><p>Since fusion reactions were monitored in bulk, the effects on fusion efficiency cannot be separated from effects on vesicle docking, posing questions on the proposed role on intrinsic fusion mechanisms (points 2, 3, 6 and 9). Moreover, the absence of complexin is a limitation in their reconstituted experiments and may have influenced the effect of Munc13 in their in vitro experiments. While the experiments presented in this work expand on previous work on the role of Munc13 on synaptic vesicle priming and plasticity, the suggested role as acting in &quot;synergy&quot; with the synaptotagmin C<sub>2</sub> domains is less clear and, ideally, should be further tested by additional experiments as outlined below (points 1, 2, and 3). The role of Munc13 in fusion per se is interesting, but the available data are still a bit too inconclusive to make such a strong statement – even in the title. For example, the DD/NN mutation in C<sub>2</sub>B impairs liposome fusion, but corresponding mutations do not affect evoked EPSCs. It might be prudent to discuss these data a bit more carefully.</p><p>The manuscript is rather cumbersome to understand and there are rather different results obtained with the soluble Syt2 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain vs. full-length Syt1. Thus the work would benefit from elimination of all results with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> AB domain (points 5, 8, 9), also considering that full-length Syt1 is more biologically relevant.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> suggests that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding region of the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub>B is important for enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered content/lipid mixing in a bulk assay with SNAREs, full-length Syt1, αSNAP, NSF, and C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (the figure shows that the DN mutant of the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub>B domain has a reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered lipid/content mixing effect). This result is at odds with the results by Shin et al. (2010) using rescue experiments with Munc13-2 in cultured hippocampal neuronal cultures derived from Munc13-1/2 DKO mice. The experiments of Shin et al. revealed no effect of the DN mutant on isolated EPSCs, and on the RRP. However, Shin et al. observed an effect on short term plasticity that was explained by an induced increase in PIP2 concentration upon high frequency stimulation. This discrepancy between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and the EPSC/RRP results by Shin et al. needs to be discussed, and follow up experiments may be necessary (see next point).</p><p>2) As is apparent from both the lipid and content mixing traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, spontaneous fusion reactions occur at a substantial rate before Ca<sup>2+</sup> is injected, i.e., the system has not reached a steady state level at the time point of Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection. Since in their bulk assay, t- and v-vesicles may continuously undergo docking, this produces opportunities for both lipid and content mixing to occur as a consequence of an increasing number of docked vesicles. Upon injection of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the observed burst of both content and lipid mixing signals could be a consequence of an increased probably of vesicle docking upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Munc13-C<sub>2</sub>B rather than an increase of intrinsic fusion probability of already docked vesicle pairs. Thus, it would important to perform clustering experiments plus/minus Ca<sup>2+</sup> with wildtype C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and the DN mutant under the same conditions as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> in order to assess the potential effect of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound C<sub>2</sub>B domain of Munc13 on vesicle clustering.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> suggests that C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C greatly enhances both content and lipid mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> together with SNAREs, compared to just SNAREs alone. However, this result could also be a consequence of enhanced docking by C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rather than an effect on intrinsic spontaneous fusion itself. To assess this question, clustering experiments should be attempted with exactly the same conditions and constructs to assess if C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>MUNC<sub>2</sub>C enhances vesicle clustering.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> suggests that injection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not induce any increase in lipid/content mixing in presence of SNAREs and full length Syt1 (orange curve, i.e., no Munc18, Munc13, αSNAP/NSF). This is at odds with previous reconstitution experiments that showed an increase of both properties with SNAREs and Syt1 alone upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection (Malsam et al., EMBO J 2012; Lai et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014). An explanation is needed.</p><p>5) The effect of Munc13 in spontaneous (Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion are very different when Syt1-C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment or reconstituted full-length Syt1 is used (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), indicating that Syt1-C<sub>2</sub>AB behaves quite differently from full-length Syt1 in their reconstituted system. The use of reconstituted full-length Syt1 is more physiological. For the benefit of a clearer presentation of the results, all experiments with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB could be eliminated from the paper.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show the effect of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN on lipid mixing in the absence or presence of NSF/SNAP and Munc18-1, by the different effects of calcium in this context. The authors suggest that different mechanisms are at play, but there may be other possibilities. The calcium independent lipid mixing effects of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN are thought to reflect support of SNARE complex assembly by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. In the presence of NSF/SNAP and Munc18-1 there are at least two explanations: (1) NSF/SNAP reverts the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN-mediated SNARE complex assembly in the absence of calcium, while in the presence of calcium more C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is recruited to the liposomes and can then override the antagonistic effect of NSF/SNAP. (2) The membrane recruited C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN even protects assembled SNARE complexes from NSF/SNAP.</p><p>7) Surprisingly, Syt1 does not appear to be essential to control either the speed or the calcium-sensitivity of the reaction when the longest forms of Munc13 are included in their assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, in this simplified system, the calcium-switch is encoded entirely within the C<sub>2</sub> domains of Munc13 at a calcium sensitivity somewhere below 100 μM. Establishing this limit with some precision would help ascertain how the activity of this system compares to the resting state in the synapse. The authors also speculate that Syt1-dependence may become apparent if they had faster time resolution in their assay. Given the central role of this calcium-sensor in synaptic biology, establishing whether it has any activity here is essential. However, as pointed out in (5) above, the results with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain are rather different from the results with full-length Syt1. Thus, it might be prudent to eliminate all results with the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain and focus on full-length reconstituted Syt1 throughout this work.</p><p>8) When shorter versions of Munc13 are tested where the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is missing, the authors now see Syt1-dependent effects on membrane fusion. In particular, they make the important point that lipid-mixing proceeds &quot;efficiently&quot; without Syt1, while contents-mixing is strongly enhanced by Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is not obvious that the effect of Syt1 is more pronounced for content vs lipid-mixing. Although the change in the curves for content-mixing appear more dramatic than for lipid-mixing, this seems to be due to the scale of the axes and not necessarily to the rates. The initial rate changes about 3 fold for contents mixing (comparing B and D). A similar increase in lipid mixing would be hard to see at their resolution, but looks plausible when comparing A and C. A similar burst in lipid-mixing appears to be present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Without meaningful resolution over this range, it is challenging to draw the conclusion &quot;the finding that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB selectively enhances content mixing but not lipid mixing provides strong evidence that Syt1 plays a direct role in membrane fusion…&quot;. The same point is echoed strongly in the Discussion. At a minimum, it would be helpful if the authors provided initial rates from each experiment, rather than endpoints. Otherwise, the discussion surrounding whether Syt1 is uniquely designed to support full-fusion should probably be more guarded. However, all these results were generated with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, so again, it might be better to eliminate all results with the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain from this work.</p><p>9) In the Introduction, the authors write &quot;…the mechanism by which Munc13s play an additional role in vesicle docking… is unclear.&quot; The papers cited here do actually propose a mechanism for the role of vesicle docking by Munc13s, i.e. docking/membrane attachment, priming, and SNARE complex assembly may be manifestations of the same process, that is, that Munc13s mediate vesicle priming by promoting SNARE complex assembly (i.e., by opening the Munc18-syntaxin complex and catalyzing trans SNARE complex formation). The data provided in these papers are quite compelling. The three papers should be cited separately, including the corresponding conclusions, and then explain why the authors think that these papers are not helpful or believable in defining (part of) the mechanism by which Munc13 mediates vesicle docking. Somewhat in the same context, can one use the liposome-clustering activity of proteins and protein fragments as a basis to extrapolate towards corresponding roles of the respective proteins in synaptic vesicle docking in neurons? For example, in the case of Syt1, such a conclusion can probably not be drawn – loss of Syt1 does not really affect synaptic vesicle docking much.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Functional Synergy between the Munc13 C-terminal C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> domains&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some relatively minor remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers would like to thank the authors for addressing the concerns raised previously. Based on their new findings, the authors have changed the conclusions from their studies. Rather than suggesting a synergism between the synaptotagmin and Munc13 C<sub>2</sub> domains, they now suggest synergism between the C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1 and that Munc13-1 may bridge V- and T-liposomes in a calcium independent manner (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). The authors' new data correlating the activation of SNARE fusion with (at least in part) a role in the specific clustering/docking of V- and T-liposomes by Munc13 significantly clarifies the primary message of the paper and is a result that will be of general interest.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) The manuscript remains very long. Considering the revised conclusions, the authors are encouraged to take a fresh look and examine if all the data are really essential for the key conclusions.</p><p>2) There are some supplementary figures that are actually quite important (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, and Figure 6—figure supplement 5). Please restrict supplementary figures to repeat experiments, raw data, and non-essential experiments.</p><p>3) A general comment regarding all figures that compare lipid and content mixing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and numerous supplemental figures): both types of experiments (lipid mixing and content mixing, respectively) are normalized differently: for lipid mixing 1% BOG is added and the resulting fluorescence intensity value is used for normalization; whereas for content mixing, it is the maximum value for each group of conditions in the particular panel. So, 100% content mixing could actually correspond to substantially fewer vesicles undergoing content mixing than vesicles undergoing lipid mixing. A suggestion would be to change all figure panel titles from &quot;lipid mixing&quot; to &quot;relative lipid mixing&quot; and &quot;content mixing&quot; to &quot;relative content mixing&quot;, and to change all the y-axis labels from &quot;Fluorescence (% of max)&quot; to &quot;Fluorescence (arbitrary units)&quot;. Another comment: ensemble experiments cannot determine what fraction of vesicles that undergo lipid mixing also undergo content mixing.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>. We appreciate that the authors have performed DLS measurements to address the concern that the large increase in content mixing upon calcium addition could be due to a calcium-dependent docking/clustering effect. However the presence of large vesicles might dominate in the intensity autocorrelation functions shown. Percent Intensity plots (similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) should also be provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref> was only done for the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment. If at all possible, please also perform the DLS experiments also with full-length Syt1. The reason is that there is much less lipid mixing in these experiments prior to calcium addition than for the experiments with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: It is perhaps possible that there could be compensating factors in neurons that do not show a large phenotype for the DN mutant of Munc13. Nevertheless, if the author's model of calcium-independent bridging of T and V-vesicles by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is correct (Figure 6—figure supplement 5), why would calcium binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of Munc13 have such a large effect? Please discuss.</p><p>7) Figure 6—figure supplement 5: While the preference for the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B domain for the T-vesicle membrane can be explained by the presence of DAG and PIP2 in that membrane, what is the mechanism that C<sub>2</sub>C would only interact with the V-vesicle membrane?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>: why does C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN cluster V-vesicles, whereas C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C does not? This question is also related to the Discussion section, paragraph five. Please provide an explanation why the C<sub>2</sub>C domain would favor trans-interactions with V-vesicles.</p><p>9) Subsection “Simultaneous evaluation of lipid and content mixing”, paragraph two&quot;: &quot;A problem…&quot;. Actually, synaptic vesicles are acidic, so the property of sulforhodamine to produce an acidic interior of the proteoliposomes is not necessarily a problem. Moreover, the lack of leakiness under such conditions is desirable. In any case, it is good that the authors confirmed the content mixing results with the different content mixing assay by Zucchi and Zick. Thus, there is really no &quot;problem&quot; with the sulforhodamine content mixing assay.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D and E</xref>: the effect of the different lipid compositions (PIP2 and DAG) appears to be much more pronounced in the presence of NSF/SNAP/Munc18, although C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is present in both experiments.</p><p>11) Discussion, paragraph seven: in addition to Lee and Kyoung, please also cite the improvements of this assay by Diao et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2012); Lai et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2014). Another comment: the single vesicle content mixing assay by Kyoung et al. (2011); Lai et al. (2014) allows discrimination between effects that are due to docking vs. due to fusion probabilities in addition to the improved time resolution offered by such single vesicle assays.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Functional Synergy between the Munc13 C-terminal C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> domains&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>We thank the authors for their thoughtful considerations of the concerns raised previously. However, the Reviewing Editor has two remaining concerns:</p><p>1) Related to Point 9, the authors write:</p><p>&quot;A potential concern with the use of sulforhodamine B fluorescence de-quenching to monitor content mixing in these bulk reconstitution experiments is that de-quenching can also arise from liposome leakiness. We attempted to perform experiments where both liposome populations are loaded with sulforhodamine B to assess how much of the de-quenching arises from leakiness (Yu et al., 2013). However, we were unable to observe lipid mixing in these control experiments. Since the solutions of high sulforhodamine B concentrations trapped in the liposomes are highly acidic (pH about 2), which may underlie the lack of lipid mixing, we attempted to increase the pH of these solutions to 5.5 or 7.4 before trapping them into the liposomes, but at both pH values the liposomes were strongly leaky.&quot;</p><p>Their observation of lack of lipid mixing when both vesicle populations are filled with sulforhodamine B is strange, considering that the authors observed efficient lipid mixing when only one class of vesicles is filled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, Kyoung et al., 2011 and Diao et al. 2012 observed both lipid and content mixing using their sulforhodamine B content mixing method, with only an extremely small fraction of leakage (0.01% of the docked vesicles). Could the problems be related to differences in reconstitution methods, rather than an issue with the sulforhodamine method per se?</p><p>This Reviewing Editor also would like to point out that the pH of the interior of the synaptobrevin/synaptotagmin vesicles (&quot;donor&quot; vesicles) is likely more neutral rather than pH 2 when using the published reconstitution protocol (Kyoung et al. Nat Protoc 8(1):1-16, 2013): the initial protein/lipid/detergent solution uses a detergent concentration that is at the CMC (OG ~ 30 mM), so vesicles do not yet form at this stage. This solution is then injected on a Cl<sup>-</sup>4B column that has been pre-equilibrated with vesicle buffer (pH 7.4, without sulforhodamine B), followed by elution with vesicle buffer (pH 7.4, again without sulforhodamine B) (Kyoung et al. Nat Protoc 8(1):1-16, 2013). Vesicles are forming on the column in a time course of several minutes as the detergent concentration decreases. One would expect that the pH of the interior of the column rapidly reaches 7.4.</p><p>In any case, as the authors point out, the alternative PhycoE-Biotin/Cy5-Streptavidin content mixing assay produces similar results (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). However, as written, the second paragraph of subsection “Simultaneous evaluation of lipid and content mixing” may come across to the casual reader as if there is something wrong with the sulforhodamine B content mixing method. Since this is a rather technical issue that distracts from the main messages of this paper, and that may be related to differences in reconstitution methods, the authors may wish to consider deleting this entire paragraph. In the future, perhaps the authors may wish to investigate a variety of content mixing assay jointly with other groups who have developed these assays for a more technical publication.</p><p>2) Point 11, related to the sentence starting &quot;Approaches that allow faster measurements [e.g. single vesicle assays (Lee et al., 2010; Kyoung et al., 2011); will be required to test this prediction. &quot; It is not just the faster time resolution that is important for future studies. The single vesicle-vesicle lipid/content mixing assay by Kyoung et al. 2011, Diao et al., 2012 et al. (but not the assay by Lee et al., 2010) can distinguish between effects due to docking, lipid mixing and content mixing on a 100 msec time scale for each individual vesicle pair. In addition to the improved time resolution, the discrimination between effects due to docking and/or fusion will be important for future studies. The authors may wish to consider making the discussion of the relevant publications clearer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13696.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary: In this work the function of Munc13 is studied using (1) reconstituted bulk liposome content and lipid mixing assays and (2) electrophysiology experiments in neuronal cultures with rescue using Munc13 DKO hippocampal neurons.

While the experiments presented in this work expand on previous work on the role of Munc13 on synaptic vesicle priming and plasticity, the suggested role as acting in &quot;synergy&quot; with the synaptotagmin C2 domains is less clear and, ideally, should be further tested by additional experiments as outlined below (points 1, 2, and 3). The role of Munc13 in fusion per se is interesting, but the available data are still a bit too inconclusive to make such a strong statement – even in the title. For example, the DD/NN mutation in C2B impairs liposome fusion, but corresponding mutations do not affect evoked EPSCs. It might be prudent to discuss these data a bit more carefully.</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript is rather cumbersome to understand and there are rather different results obtained with the soluble Syt2 C2AB domain vs. full-length Syt1. Thus the work would benefit from elimination of all results with the soluble Syt1 C2AB domain (points 5, 8, 9), also considering that full-length Syt1 is more biologically relevant.</italic></p><p>Please note that we have included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref> and several new supplementary figures, and we have renumbered some of the figures: the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is now Figure 3—figure supplement 1; and the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> are now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, respectively.</p><p>A) We appreciate the assessment that our paper extends the previous Ma et al. 2013 paper in fundamental ways. We also feel indebted to the reviewers because their thoughtful and detailed comments have helped to make the paper of higher quality and more fundamental (see in particular point B below).</p><p>B) We agree that it was premature to draw the strong conclusions on a role of the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub> domains in fusion that we had described in the original manuscript, and we found particularly valuable the concerns from the reviewers regarding the possibility that at least some of the effects observed in the fusion assays arise from effects on clustering. While in the original manuscript we did conclude that the tendency of the Munc13-1 fragments to cluster vesicles contribute to their activity in the fusion assays, we did not make this a major point of the paper because the clustering data did not appear to explain the much stronger stimulation of fusion by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN nor the dramatic stimulation of fusion by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the reconstitutions that included Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and Munc13-1 fragments. We had performed a detailed analysis of the factors that determine the clustering ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and had not seen any strong effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on clustering (shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also felt that it was unlikely that the strong effects of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in the fusion assays could arise from the slightly higher tendency of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to cluster mixtures of V- and T-liposomes, compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> that is now replaced with new data that are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and was performed under conditions analogous to those of the fusion assays).</p><p>We thought that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain was simply adding an additional lipid-binding site to the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub> BMUN sequence but there was an important property that we had not anticipated. Because of the overall concern of the reviewers on the clustering issue, we investigated the clustering properties of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in more detail and found that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C was unable to cluster V-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), in contrast to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly however, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C does cluster all liposomes in mixtures of V-liposomes and T-liposomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>), showing that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C favors bridging of V-liposomes to T-liposomes. These results and the overall data presented in the paper have led us to emphasize in the revised manuscript the notion that Munc13-1 may bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane to contribute to docking and facilitate SNARE complex formation. We believe that this notion makes the paper stronger and with a clearer message that makes a lot of sense because the highly conserved C-terminal region of Munc13s is formed by an elongated MUN domain related to tethering factors that function in diverse membrane compartments, and by adjacent C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> domains with demonstrated or potential membrane-binding properties.</p><p>Because of these new data, and in response to the additional reviewer concerns described in the summary above, in the revised paper we have changed the title and we have drastically toned-down conclusions about a role for the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub> domains in membrane fusion and about synergy with the synaptotagmin C<sub>2</sub> domains. However, because it seems unlikely that clustering alone can explain the strong stimulation of fusion by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see point 2), we still mention that our data suggest the formation of a primed state that needs Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger fast fusion and we make the suggestion that Munc13 may function in docking, priming and fusion. We hope that the reviewers will agree that our overall data support this suggestion even though do not fully prove it.</p><p>C) With regard to some of the other general concerns, we are well aware that our reconstitutions have their limitations, which we point out in the Discussion. However, we would like to emphasize that reconstitution experiments are not physiological by definition. The hope is that by including enough components we can get results that recapitulate at least to a certain extent what happens in vivo. Arguments commonly used to reach such conclusion include: i) there are clear correlations between the reconstitution data and physiological results; and ii) the biochemical properties underlying the reconstitution results make overall sense in the context of what is known about this system from research by a variety of approaches. Thus, many of the papers in the field that used reconstitutions have provided important insights even though they had striking contradictions with physiological data, most notably the fact that lipid and/or content mixing did not require Munc18-1 and Munc13s. Our reconstitutions are the only ones so far that can account for the dramatic disruption of release observed in the absence of Munc18-1 or Munc13s in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> is particularly striking in this regard), they include the (arguably) eight most central components of the release machinery, and there are many correlations between the results obtained with these reconstitutions and physiological data (see Discussion).</p><p>For these reasons, we believe that our reconstitutions provide a great framework to try to understand the mechanism of release and that biochemical properties that explain our data (e.g. the V- to T-liposome clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) are likely to underlie at least in part the mechanism of action of the same proteins in vivo. Similarly, if some of our reconstitution data appear to contradict physiological results (e.g. the effects of the DD/NN mutation in the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain), it is probable that there is an explanation due to functional redundancy or compensatory effects in vivo. In any case, we agree with the reviewers that we should be prudent when drawing conclusions because it is very difficult to have definitive proof for molecular mechanisms. Hence, we have toned down any strong conclusions we made in the manuscript and tried to use soft terms such as ‘suggest’ or ‘indicate’. We have also tried to improve the discussion of the results obtained with the DD/NN mutation but without extending it to avoid further lengthening the manuscript.</p><p>D) With regard to the absence of complexin in our experiments, this protein is believed to inhibit release in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to stimulate release upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Hence, it would not be expected to have much effect in our optimal reconstitutions because there is little fusion before adding Ca<sup>2+</sup> and fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition in the time scale of our experiments (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Indeed, in unpublished experiments we have found that complexin-1 has no measurable effects in our fusion assays, but we prefer not to include these data because we believe that the roles of complexin will be better studied with methods that have faster time scales than our bulk assays (as has already been shown in reconstitution studies of complexin function by the labs of Axel Brunger and Yeon-Kyun Shin). At the end of the Discussion we do point out that our reconstitutions are incomplete and miss several important factors (not only complexin).</p><p>E) We have tried to improve the presentation of the results, adding substantial new data without lengthening the manuscript too much. We are reluctant to remove the results obtained with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment because these results are important for how the story is developed (e.g. the switch to a different method of monitoring lipid and content mixing) and because, based on the abundant data already available in the literature with this fragment, it is natural that many researchers in the field would wonder what happens if we add this fragment. Note that experiments using full-length Syt1 do have the advantage of being more physiological, as pointed out in the review, but do not allow a direct comparison of the results with and without the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains with the same liposome preparations. For instance, there is a clear increase in content mixing when Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB is added in reconstitutions with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but it would be more difficult to reach this conclusion comparing results obtained with different V-liposome preparations that include or lack full-length Syt1. This result is important because it shows an effect of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains in this system and it is likely that this effect cannot be observed when we use C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C because the system is too efficient (see Discussion). Finally, we would like to emphasize that, while it is true that some results obtained with C<sub>2</sub>AB and full-length Syt1 are different (mostly in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP) the data obtained in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and different Munc13-1 fragments are quite similar for C<sub>2</sub>AB and full-length Syt1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> suggests that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding region of the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub>B is important for enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered content/lipid mixing in a bulk assay with SNAREs, full-length Syt1, αSNAP, NSF, and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (the figure shows that the DN mutant of the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub>B domain has a reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered lipid/content mixing effect). This result is at odds with the results by Shin et al. (2010) using rescue experiments with Munc13-2 in cultured hippocampal neuronal cultures derived from Munc13-1/2 DKO mice. The experiments of Shin et al. revealed no effect of the DN mutant on isolated EPSCs, and on the RRP. However, Shin et al. observed an effect on short term plasticity that was explained by an induced increase in PIP2 concentration upon high frequency stimulation. This discrepancy between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and the EPSC/RRP results by Shin et al. needs to be discussed, and follow up experiments may be necessary (see next point).</italic></p><p>This discrepancy was discussed in the original manuscript. We have tried to improve the discussion of this issue, as mentioned in point C of our response to the Summary.</p><p><italic>2) As is apparent from both the lipid and content mixing traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, spontaneous fusion reactions occur at a substantial rate before Ca<sup>2+</sup> is injected, i.e., the system has not reached a steady state level at the time point of Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection. Since in their bulk assay, t- and v-vesicles may continuously undergo docking, this produces opportunities for both lipid and content mixing to occur as a consequence of an increasing number of docked vesicles. Upon injection of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the observed burst of both content and lipid mixing signals could be a consequence of an increased probably of vesicle docking upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Munc13-C<sub>2</sub>B rather than an increase of intrinsic fusion probability of already docked vesicle pairs. Thus, it would important to perform clustering experiments plus/minus Ca<sup>2+</sup> with wildtype C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and the DN mutant under the same conditions as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> in order to assess the potential effect of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound C<sub>2</sub>B domain of Munc13 on vesicle clustering.</italic></p><p>We have performed the requested clustering assays but with reactions diluted 8-fold to prevent saturation of the DLS detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref> for experiments with VSyt1 vesicles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> for experiments with V-vesicles and not Syt1). The immediate effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition on the DLS data are minimal and correlate with the observation that, in general, Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not have strong effects on clustering ability (except for clustering of V-vesicles by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, which is unlikely to have any physiological relevance). Hence, it is unlikely that an effect on clustering underlies the drastic stimulation of content mixing induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p><italic>We would like to clarify that there is substantial lipid mixing before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, but very little content mixing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>, we now present quantification of lipid mixing at 300 s, before adding Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in addition to the quantification at 500 s (200 s after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition) that was included previously. In subsection “Functional importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain” we describe that ‘the fluorescence increase reflecting lipid mixing was 28.9% of that observed 200 s after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition while content mixing was minimal at 300 s (fluorescence 3.3% of that observed 200 s after adding Ca<sup>2+</sup>)’. We also would like to emphasize that this difference is exacerbated by the fact that the maximal fluorescence associated with content mixing is expected to correspond to only one round of fusion, whereas additional rounds of fusion could contribute to the maximal fluorescence in the lipid mixing signal, which could easily correspond to more than 0.5 rounds of fusion if lipid mixing indeed arose from real fusion (which we do not believe). Hence, there is a dramatic difference in the amounts of lipid mixing and content mixing that occur before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. Note also that the clear contrast between lipid and content mixing was also observed in the experiments without Syt1 or with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, blue curves). Moreover, the lipid and content mixing curves are much more similar to each other in experiments performed with T- and V-liposomes plus C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (without Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP; see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, blue curves), showing how content mixing occurs concomitantly with lipid mixing under these conditions but not when NSF-αSNAP and Munc18-1 are present. All of these observations and the fact that there is already extensive clustering before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition provide strong evidence that the drastic effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-αSNAP and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C does not arise because of increased clustering but rather from a role of the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain in fusion and/or in the release of some inhibitory interaction. We have de-emphasized the proposal of a role for Munc13-1 in fusion throughout the Abstract and the Discussion, but we hope that the reviewers will agree that we can suggest these two possibilities based on the available data.</italic></p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> suggests that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C greatly enhances both content and lipid mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> together with SNAREs, compared to just SNAREs alone. However, this result could also be a consequence of enhanced docking by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rather than an effect on intrinsic spontaneous fusion itself. To assess this question, clustering experiments should be attempted with exactly the same conditions and constructs to assess if C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>MUNC<sub>2</sub>C enhances vesicle clustering.</italic></p><p>We agree with the interpretation proposed by the reviewers, which is supported by the new clustering data that we provide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and several <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref> supplements).</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> suggests that injection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not induce any increase in lipid/content mixing in presence of SNAREs and full length Syt1 (orange curve, i.e., no Munc18, Munc13, αSNAP/NSF). This is at odds with previous reconstitution experiments that showed an increase of both properties with SNAREs and Syt1 alone upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection (Malsam et al., EMBO J 2012; Lai et al., eLife 2014). An explanation is needed.</italic></p><p>Comparisons of our data with those obtained with single-vesicle assays such as those of Lai et al. 2014 are difficult because many differences have been observed previously between these assays and bulk assays (for instance in studies of complexins). There is no contradiction with the data of Malsam et al. as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> of this paper. Note that small sudden jumps at the moment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition are difficult to interpret because they may arise from temporarily high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> is added, and that the curve after the jump continues as a natural extension of the curve before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition.</p><p><italic>5) The effect of Munc13 in spontaneous (Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion are very different when Syt1-C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment or reconstituted full-length Syt1 is used (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), indicating that Syt1-C<sub>2</sub>AB behaves quite differently from full-length Syt1 in their reconstituted system. The use of reconstituted full-length Syt1 is more physiological. For the benefit of a clearer presentation of the results, all experiments with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB could be eliminated from the paper.</italic></p><p>See point E of the response to the Summary.</p><p> <italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show the effect of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN on lipid mixing in the absence or presence of NSF/SNAP and Munc18-1, by the different effects of calcium in this context. The authors suggest that different mechanisms are at play, but there may be other possibilities. The calcium independent lipid mixing effects of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN are thought to reflect support of SNARE complex assembly by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. In the presence of NSF/SNAP and Munc18-1 there are at least two explanations: (1) NSF/SNAP reverts the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN-mediated SNARE complex assembly in the absence of calcium, while in the presence of calcium more C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is recruited to the liposomes and can then override the antagonistic effect of NSF/SNAP. (2) The membrane recruited C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN even protects assembled SNARE complexes from NSF/SNAP.</italic></p><p>We have considerably changed the interpretation of these experiments. We hope that the reviewers will agree with the current interpretation.</p><p> <italic>7) Surprisingly, Syt1 does not appear to be essential to control either the speed or the calcium-sensitivity of the reaction when the longest forms of Munc13 are included in their assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, in this simplified system, the calcium-switch is encoded entirely within the C<sub>2</sub>domains of Munc13 at a calcium sensitivity somewhere below 100 μM. Establishing this limit with some precision would help ascertain how the activity of this system compares to the resting state in the synapse. The authors also speculate that Syt1-dependence may become apparent if they had faster time resolution in their assay. Given the central role of this calcium-sensor in synaptic biology, establishing whether it has any activity here is essential. However, as pointed out in (5) above, the results with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain are rather different from the results with full-length Syt1. Thus, it might be prudent to eliminate all results with the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain and focus on full-length reconstituted Syt1 throughout this work.</italic></p><p>It is true that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch does come largely from the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB does have an effect on content mixing in experiments with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and there also appears to be an effect of full-length Syt1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>), although this comparison is difficult to make because of the use of different proteoliposome populations. In the experiments with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, we cannot really expect much of an effect by Syt1 because the stimulation of fusion by Ca<sup>2+</sup> is so fast in the time scale of our measurements. This is why we believe that techniques with faster time scales and that can distinguish docking from fusion, such as single vesicle assays, are more adequate to dissect the relative contributions of Munc13-1 and Syt1 to fusion.</p><p>We would like to clarify that the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> show that fusion is already maximized with 100 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 100 μM EGTA. Hence, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is somewhere around 1 μM or below (not 100 μM or below). In the text we explain the difficulty of assessing this sensitivity more accurately because of the danger of removing the Zn2+ ions from the C<sub>1</sub> domain. See also see point E of the response to the Summary with regard to the issue of removing data obtained with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB.</p><p> <italic>8) When shorter versions of Munc13 are tested where the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is missing, the authors now see Syt1-dependent effects on membrane fusion. In particular, they make the important point that lipid-mixing proceeds &quot;efficiently&quot; without Syt1, while contents-mixing is strongly enhanced by Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is not obvious that the effect of Syt1 is more pronounced for content vs lipid-mixing. Although the change in the curves for content-mixing appear more dramatic than for lipid-mixing, this seems to be due to the scale of the axes and not necessarily to the rates. The initial rate changes about 3 fold for contents mixing (comparing B and D). A similar increase in lipid mixing would be hard to see at their resolution, but looks plausible when comparing A and C. A similar burst in lipid-mixing appears to be present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Without meaningful resolution over this range, it is challenging to draw the conclusion on pg 12 &quot;the finding that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB selectively enhances content mixing but not lipid mixing provides strong evidence that Syt1 plays a direct role in membrane fusion…&quot;. The same point is echoed strongly in the Discussion. At a minimum, it would be helpful if the authors provided initial rates from each experiment, rather than endpoints. Otherwise, the discussion surrounding whether Syt1 is uniquely designed to support full-fusion should probably be more guarded. However, all these results were generated with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, so again, it might be better to eliminate all results with the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain from this work.</italic></p><p>As pointed out in the response to point 4, we cannot draw conclusions from the small jumps observed upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. There are many ways of quantifying the lipid and content mixing assays, and we chose to quantify the data at 500 s because this represents a compromise that reflects in part the initial speed and in part the completion of the reaction at longer times. The quantification provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> strongly supports the conclusion that there is indeed an enhancement of content mixing by C<sub>2</sub>AB in the experiments performed with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, while there is no clear enhancement of lipid mixing. We have reproduced these results in multiple additional experiments with other preparations, and the same conclusions are reached with the sulfhorhodamine assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nevertheless, we have drastically cut the discussion of these data because this is not a main point of this paper. We still conclude that C<sub>2</sub> AB helps with membrane fusion in these experiments and cite other papers that have previously reached similar conclusions regarding the stimulation of fusion by Syt1.</p><p> <italic>9) In the Introduction, the authors write &quot;…the mechanism by which Munc13s play an additional role in vesicle docking… is unclear.&quot; The papers cited here do actually propose a mechanism for the role of vesicle docking by Munc13s, i.e. docking/membrane attachment, priming, and SNARE complex assembly may be manifestations of the same process, that is, that Munc13s mediate vesicle priming by promoting SNARE complex assembly (i.e., by opening the Munc18-syntaxin complex and catalyzing trans SNARE complex formation). The data provided in these papers are quite compelling. The three papers should be cited separately, including the corresponding conclusions, and then explain why the authors think that these papers are not helpful or believable in defining (part of) the mechanism by which Munc13 mediates vesicle docking. Somewhat in the same context, can one use the liposome-clustering activity of proteins and protein fragments as a basis to extrapolate towards corresponding roles of the respective proteins in synaptic vesicle docking in neurons? For example, in the case of Syt1, such a conclusion can probably not be drawn – loss of Syt1 does not really affect synaptic vesicle docking much.</italic></p><p>We have considerably revised the Introduction and the Discussion with regard to everything related to docking, as we now emphasize the role of Munc13s in docking much more than in the original manuscript. We have put our results in the context of different definitions of docking used in the literature and explain that our data are fully consistent with the interpretation of these three papers. In the text we indicate that these papers use a stringent definition of docking that then becomes equivalent to priming and SNARE complex assembly. However, we also propose that Munc13s are involved in upstream interactions with the vesicle and plasma membranes that help to bridge the membranes and facilitates the activity in promoting SNARE complex formation. With regard to the question about extrapolation, this is of course is a very important question and we believe that such extrapolations are more likely to be valid if they involve clear correlations between reconstitution and physiological data, and are consistent with other data in the field about the functions of the proteins under study (see point C of the response to the Summary).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) The manuscript remains very long. Considering the revised conclusions, the authors are encouraged to take a fresh look and examine if all the data are really essential for the key conclusions.</italic></p><p>We have considered this issue very carefully but we are reluctant to remove any of the data presented because, although some of the data may not be essential for the main conclusions, they still make important points that would be lost if the data are not presented here. We tried to reduce a little bit the length of the text while introducing changes to address the remaining concerns. While we agree that the manuscript is long, there are a lot of data that help building the overall story.</p><p><italic>2) There are some supplementary figures that are actually quite important (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, and Figure 6—figure supplement 5).

For consistency with this change, the figure supplements corresponding to the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> have been renumbered and are now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) A general comment regarding all figures that compare lipid and content mixing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and numerous supplemental figures): both types of experiments (lipid mixing and content mixing, respectively) are normalized differently: for lipid mixing 1% BOG is added and the resulting fluorescence intensity value is used for normalization; whereas for content mixing, it is the maximum value for each group of conditions in the particular panel. So, 100% content mixing could actually correspond to substantially fewer vesicles undergoing content mixing than vesicles undergoing lipid mixing. A suggestion would be to change all figure panel titles from &quot;lipid mixing&quot; to &quot;relative lipid mixing&quot; and &quot;content mixing&quot; to &quot;relative content mixing&quot;, and to change all the y-axis labels from &quot;Fluorescence (% of max)&quot; to &quot;Fluorescence (arbitrary units)&quot;. Another comment: ensemble experiments cannot determine what fraction of vesicles that undergo lipid mixing also undergo content mixing.</italic></p><p>The terms ‘lipid mixing’ and ‘content mixing’ in the figures are just meant to be used as titles for easy identification of the data by the reader. We believe that adding the term relative may be more confusing than clarifying. The key issue that we agree needs to be made clearer is why the fluorescence signal reflecting lipid mixing is much smaller than that reflecting content mixing when both are expressed as percentages of the maximum fluorescence. We have clarified this issue in the text with the following paragraph:</p><p>‘Note that in these assays much of the Cy5 fluorescence increase caused by FRET from PhycoE (reflecting content mixing) should occur during the first round of fusion and that no further substantial increases are thus expected in subsequent rounds of fusion or upon detergent addition. Correspondingly, the maximum Cy5 fluorescence observed in our most efficient fusion reactions was similar to that observed upon detergent addition (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, red curve; see Materials and methods). In contrast, the lipid mixing signal expressed as percentage of maximum Marina Blue fluorescence is much smaller in the same reactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red curve) because fluorescence de-quenching is expected to continue in successive rounds of fusion and to undergo a further, large increase upon detergent addition due to additional probe dilution.’</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>. We appreciate that the authors have performed DLS measurements to address the concern that the large increase in content mixing upon calcium addition could be due to a calcium-dependent docking/clustering effect. However the presence of large vesicles might dominate in the intensity autocorrelation functions shown. Percent Intensity plots (similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) should also be provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>.</italic></p><p>We include percent intensity plots for the most critical DLS data in panels C-F of the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref> was only done for the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment. If at all possible, please also perform the DLS experiments also with full-length Syt1. The reason is that there is much less lipid mixing in these experiments prior to calcium addition than for the experiments with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</italic></p><p>The suggested experiments with full-length Syt1 were already described in the previous manuscript and shown in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, which is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref> in the revised manuscript (because of the changes summarized in point 2).</p><p> <italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: It is perhaps possible that there could be compensating factors in neurons that do not show a large phenotype for the DN mutant of Munc13. Nevertheless, if the author's model of calcium-independent bridging of T and V-vesicles by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is correct (Figure 6—supplement figure 5), why would calcium binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of Munc13 have such a large effect? Please discuss.</italic></p><p>We briefly discussed in the previous manuscript that</p><p>‘…Our data suggest that the primed state is metastable and requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain for efficient content mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>) either because the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain contributes directly to facilitate membrane fusion or because Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding releases an inhibitory interaction existing in the primed state. The finding that a mutation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop of the Munc13-2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain increases release probability (Shin et al., 2010) is consistent with both possibilities and supports the notion that Munc13s form intrinsic part of the primed state of synaptic vesicles.’</p><p>We have left this same paragraph in the revised manuscript without additional discussion to avoid further lengthening of the text.</p><p><italic>7) Figure 6—figure supplement 5: While the preference for the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B domain for the T-vesicle membrane can be explained by the presence of DAG and PIP2 in that membrane, what is the mechanism that C<sub>2</sub>C would only interact with the V-vesicle membrane?</italic></p><p>The model proposed in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which was previously Figure 6—figure supplement 5, assumes that the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> B domains bind to the plasma membrane and such binding places Munc13 in an orientation that favors binding of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in trans to another apposed membrane (the synaptic vesicle membrane in this case). The model is discussed in pages 23-24, where we make it clear that the mechanism of liposome clustering by these large Munc13 fragments remains to be established, as there are multiple sites in these fragments that could potentially interact with membranes. Hence, extensive studies will be needed to define this mechanism clearly.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>: why does C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN cluster V-vesicles, whereas C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C does not? This question is also related to the Discussion section, paragraph five. Please provide an explanation why the C<sub>2</sub>C domain would favor trans-interactions with V-vesicles.</italic></p><p>In the previous manuscript, we had provided an explanation for the DLS data but not a model figure because there are multiple potential explanations and we preferred not to favor too much one over another. In response to this concern, we have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript that describes plausible models to explain the DLS data. In the figure legend we make it clear that there are other potential models, as we do not want to mislead the reader into thinking that the proposed models are well established.</p><p><italic>9) Subsection “Simultaneous evaluation of lipid and content mixing”, paragraph two&quot;: &quot;A problem…&quot;. Actually, synaptic vesicles are acidic, so the property of sulforhodamine to produce an acidic interior of the proteoliposomes is not necessarily a problem. Moreover, the lack of leakiness under such conditions is desirable. In any case, it is good that the authors confirmed the content mixing results with the different content mixing assay by Zucchi and Zick. Thus, there is really no &quot;problem&quot; with the sulforhodamine content mixing assay.</italic></p><p>We agree that the acid interior of the liposomes is not necessarily a problem, but the pH in the concentrated sulforhodamine solution that becomes encapsulated into the liposomes is very acidic (pH 2). We devoted extensive efforts to do fusion assays with sulforhodamine in both vesicle populations and were never able to observe efficient lipid mixing. In any case, we have replaced the word ‘problem’ with ‘potential concern’ in that sentence to address this issue.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D and E</xref>: the effect of the different lipid compositions (PIP2 and DAG) appears to be much more pronounced in the presence of NSF/SNAP/Munc18, although C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is present in both experiments.</italic></p><p>Yes, this is an important point that we emphasized in the previous manuscript and still emphasize in the revised manuscript in the sentence (Results section):</p><p>‘These data show that the effect of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN alone on lipid mixing arises from a property that is largely independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, whereas the lipid mixing observed in the more complete reconstitutions including C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub> BMUN, Munc18-1 and NSF-αSNAP is stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, thus exhibiting properties that are more similar to those of neurotransmitter release.’</p><p><italic>11) Discussion, paragraph seven: in addition to Lee and Kyoung, please also cite the improvements of this assay by Diao et al. (eLife 2012); Lai et al. (eLife 2014). Another comment: the single vesicle content mixing assay by Kyoung et al. (2011); Lai et al. (2014) allows discrimination between effects that are due to docking vs. due to fusion probabilities in addition to the improved time resolution offered by such single vesicle assays.</italic></p><p>We have included the additional requested references.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We thank the authors for their thoughtful considerations of the concerns raised previously. However, the Reviewing Editor has two remaining concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Related to Point 9, the authors write:</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;A potential concern with the use of sulforhodamine B fluorescence de-quenching to monitor content mixing in these bulk reconstitution experiments is that de-quenching can also arise from liposome leakiness. We attempted to perform experiments where both liposome populations are loaded with sulforhodamine B to assess how much of the de-quenching arises from leakiness (Yu et al., 2013). However, we were unable to observe lipid mixing in these control experiments. Since the solutions of high sulforhodamine B concentrations trapped in the liposomes are highly acidic (pH about 2), which may underlie the lack of lipid mixing, we attempted to increase the pH of these solutions to 5.5 or 7.4 before trapping them into the liposomes, but at both pH values the liposomes were strongly leaky.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>Their observation of lack of lipid mixing when both vesicle populations are filled with sulforhodamine B is strange, considering that the authors observed efficient lipid mixing when only one class of vesicles is filled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, Kyoung et al., 2011 and Diao et al. 2012 observed both lipid and content mixing using their sulforhodamine B content mixing method, with only an extremely small fraction of leakage (0.01% of the docked vesicles). Could the problems be related to differences in reconstitution methods, rather than an issue with the sulforhodamine method per se?</italic></p><p><italic>This Reviewing Editor also would like to point out that the pH of the interior of the synaptobrevin/synaptotagmin vesicles (&quot;donor&quot; vesicles) is likely more neutral rather than pH 2 when using the published reconstitution protocol (Kyoung et al. Nat Protoc 8(1):1-16, 2013): the initial protein/lipid/detergent solution uses a detergent concentration that is at the CMC (OG ~ 30 mM), so vesicles do not yet form at this stage. This solution is then injected on a Cl<sup>-</sup>4B column that has been pre-equilibrated with vesicle buffer (pH 7.4, without sulforhodamine B), followed by elution with vesicle buffer (pH 7.4, again without sulforhodamine B) (Kyoung et al. Nat Protoc 8(1):1-16, 2013). Vesicles are forming on the column in a time course of several minutes as the detergent concentration decreases. One would expect that the pH of the interior of the column rapidly reaches 7.4.</italic></p><p><italic>In any case, as the authors point out, the alternative PhycoE-Biotin/Cy5-Streptavidin content mixing assay produces similar results (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). However, as written, the second paragraph of subsection “Simultaneous evaluation of lipid and content mixing” may come across to the casual reader as if there is something wrong with the sulforhodamine B content mixing method. Since this is a rather technical issue that distracts from the main messages of this paper, and that may be related to differences in reconstitution methods, the authors may wish to consider deleting this entire paragraph. In the future, perhaps the authors may wish to investigate a variety of content mixing assay jointly with other groups who have developed these assays for a more technical publication.</italic></p><p>We would like to clarify that in the first revision we insisted in keeping these data because the first round of review questioned the conclusion that synaptotagmin C<sub>2</sub>AB was required for efficient content mixing but not lipid mixing in the reconstitutions including C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, and the sulforhodamine assays provided further support for this conclusion. In the second revision we did not remove the data obtained with the sulforhodamine method because the argument made in the second round of review (stating that there is no problem) was not compelling; we did have a big problem with the method when we included sulforhodamine on both vesicles. With regard to the concerns raised in this third round of review, it is unclear whether the buffer can handle the strongly acidic pH caused by the very high concentrations of sulforhodamine that are being used. However, we agree that the problems that we described for the sulforhodamine method could represent a distraction. Hence, we have removed these data in the third revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Point 11, related to the sentence starting &quot;Approaches that allow faster measurements [e.g. single vesicle assays (Lee et al., 2010; Kyoung et al., 2011); will be required to test this prediction. &quot; It is not just the faster time resolution that is important for future studies. The single vesicle-vesicle lipid/content mixing assay by Kyoung et al. 2011, Diao et al., 2012 et al. (but not the assay by Lee et al., 2010) can distinguish between effects due to docking, lipid mixing and content mixing on a 100 msec time scale for each individual vesicle pair. In addition to the improved time resolution, the discrimination between effects due to docking and/or fusion will be important for future studies. The authors may wish to consider making the discussion of the relevant publications clearer.</italic></p><p>After the aforementioned sentence, we have now added the following: ‘An additional advantage of these assays is that they allow distinction of the docking event from lipid and content mixing.’</p></body></sub-article></article>
