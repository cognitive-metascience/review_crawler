helical nucleocapsids, which serve as the template for viral replication and transcription. Here, the clam-shaped nucleocapsid structure, where the NDV viral genome is sequestered, was determined at 4.8 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The clam-shaped structure is composed of two single-turn spirals packed in a back-to-back mode. This tightly packed structure functions as a seed for the assembly of a nucleocapsid from both directions, facilitating the growth of double-headed filaments with two separate RNA strings inside. Disruption of this structure by mutations in its loop interface yielded a single-headed unfunctional filament.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>clam-like shaped structure</kwd><kwd>filament</kwd><kwd>newcastle disease virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31330019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81590761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008871</institution-id><institution>Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016FC007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pujiang Talent Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17PJ1406700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Qing-Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Programme of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0504800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Qing-Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional studies reveal how Newcastle disease virus nucleocapsid protects its viral genome through a self-capping mechanism, which is important for new antiviral drug design.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Members of the order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> encompass some of the most lethal human and animal pathogens, including ebola, rabies virus, measles, nipah virus and the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amarasinghe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuhn et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Mononegaviruses</italic> commonly contain a non-segmented, linear, negative-strand RNA genome, and the replication of this genome is vital for virus survival and pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruigrok et al., 2011</xref>). One remarkable character of negative-strand RNA viruses is that their genomes are enwrapped by the nucleoprotein (N), which results in the formation of helical nucleocapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finch and Gibbs, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heggeness et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Longhi, 2009</xref>). During viral RNA synthesis, the assembled nucleocapsid, rather than the naked RNA genome, is opened and unveiled so that it can be recognized by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and it serves as the template for both replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dochow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emerson and Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emerson and Yu, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fearns et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perlman and Huang, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Severin et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> or <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> viruses, the viral phosphoprotein (P) mediates the ability of RdRp to access nucleoprotein, and the RdRp moves across the nucleocapsid for viral transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourhis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kingston et al., 2004</xref>). RNA is susceptible to nuclease in vivo, so the virus has evolved a complicated mechanism to protect its viral genome, in which its N plays a major role in enwrapping nascent RNA thereby preventing possible damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dortmans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruigrok et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A great deal of effort has been expended on understanding the N assembly mechanism that protects the genome of the <italic>Mononegavirales.</italic> N has two domains, the amino-terminal domain (NTD) and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), with a positively charged cleft in between that is suitable for RNA binding. In the presence of RNA, each N can bind 6, 7 or 9 nucleotides and thus can clamp RNA into the cleft, forming a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tawar et al., 2009</xref>). RNP can further assemble into either a helical or ring structure with 10, 11 or 13 protomers per turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tawar et al., 2009</xref>). In RNP oligomers, the NTD and CTD interact successively with adjacent N proteins, forming long helical filaments that efficiently protect the viral genome, and which serve as the template for viral RNA transcription and the replication of new virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Detailed structural analyses have shown that measles RNP filaments exhibit more rigid and regular single-headed, herringbone-like characteristics after trypsin treatment, and in this state are seemingly not sufficient to protect RNA genome at the tips of the filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schoehn et al., 2004</xref>).

Here, the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a member of the genus <italic>Avulavirus</italic>, family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, which is relatively safe for handling, was selected as the model to look at how NDV RNP protects its viral genome and to provide new insights into the development of nucleocapsid-based antivirus therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clam-shaped NDV nucleocapsid</title><p>Following previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guryanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2016</xref>), the NDV N was expressed in an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> system and pure protein was obtained after tandem affinity and gel-filtration chromatography.

Different from the reported ring-structure and helical spirals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alayyoubi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tawar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>), a novel clam-shaped structure of NDV N with two single-turn spirals packing in a back-to-back manner was identified and determined, corresponding to the extracted nucleocapsid assembly of NDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The clam-shaped structure of the NDV nucleocapsid was verified by in vivo transcription and translation experiments with minigenome analysis. The deletion of the N-arm or the C-arm of N disrupted or affected the formation of highly ordered nucleocapsid and resulted the absence of fluorescence signals in the minigenome assay. However, in a similar minigenome assay in which a truncated C-tail, namely N<sub>∆C-tail</sub>, was used, some weaker fluorescence signals were observed. The previous studies showed that the P protein used its NTD domain (P<sub>NTD</sub>) to uncoil the nucleocapsid and allowed the RdRp to access the genomic RNA and then tethered the RdRp to the nucleocapsid with its XD domain binding to the C-tail of the N protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). One possible explanation is that even though the N<sub>∆C-tail</sub> lacks the C-tail, the P protein can still mediate the formation of the N–RNA–RdRp complex in the minigenome assay due to the interaction of P<sub>NTD</sub> with the nucleocapsid.</p><p>The double-headed spiral uses a self-capping mechanism that involves the clam-shaped core to protect the RNA genome’s integrity. This is the possible reason why the single-headed N<sub>Loop</sub> was not functional in a minigenome assay. More interestingly, this clam-shaped structure functions as a seed for the assembly of double-headed spirals with two separate RNAs inside. The illumination of the clam-like nucleocapsid expands our understanding of the involvement of N in the assembly of the the helical nucleocapsid, especially introducing the clam-like core as the starting point for N assembly and then elongation on both sides, which maintains genome integrity in vivo. A self-capping mechanism is quite common in filaments that are involved in biological processes. For example, in DNA repair, the Rad51 paralog complex RFS-1/RIP-1 induces remodeling at the tips of Rad51–ssDNA filaments to stimulate Rad51 strand exchange activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). In microtubule assembly, γ-tubulin pre-assembles into single-turn spirals that serve as the template to nucleate sequential α/β-tubulin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zehr et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have shown that self-capping is a mechanism that allows proteins or their homologues to fit easily into the spiral assembly and to fine-tune its function efficiently.</p><p>The clam-shaped nucleocapsid also provides possible explanations for the pleomorphism and polyploidy of the <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>. Mononegavirus morphology appears to vary considerably, especially among the <italic>Paramyxoviruses</italic> and <italic>Filoviruses</italic>, in the range of about 110–540 nm in diameter for Sendai virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loney et al., 2009</xref>), 100–250 nm for spherical NDV particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battisti et al., 2012</xref>), and 50–510 nm for the measles virus (MeV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox and Plemper, 2017</xref>). This character of flexible volume of virus could accommodate variation in the copy number of the genome. It is a common observation for mononegaviruses to contain more than one genome; examples include NDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahlberg and Simon, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kingsbury and Darlington, 1968</xref>), hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hosaka et al., 1966</xref>), Sendai virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lynch and Kolakofsky, 1978</xref>), measles virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liljeroos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rager et al., 2002</xref>), RSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiss et al., 2014</xref>) and ebola virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beniac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booth et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of multiple genomes in a virion is essential for their infections, for example, two types of genomic analyses of MeV infections have provided independent evidence of multi-genome MeV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rager et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shirogane et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the multi-genome in one virion seems to be packaged in continuous mode in ebola virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beniac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booth et al., 2013</xref>), and even in a ‘end to end’ mode in HVJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hosaka et al., 1966</xref>). One interesting aspect on self-capping assemblies is that they provide the possibility of accommodating two copies of viral genomes with different lengths in one virion. So, the double-headed mode provides a possible organizing pattern for the multiple genomes of the polyploidy viruses.</p><p>In addition, the C-tail of N may exist inside rather than outside of the nucleocapsids of <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>. Even though full-length N was purified and used for structural analysis, the C-tail (residues 399–489) is not easily recognized in the EM map because of the long, intrinsically flexible domain reported in other structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Houben et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Longhi et al., 2003</xref>). Compared to ring structures, the clam-shaped structure has extra cone-like densities in the center (117 nm<sup>3</sup> at the threshold of 0.0054) of the density map, which are apparently from the C-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The C-tail is located inside the clam-shaped structure, and is only accessible from either end by P or other proteins in order to form the N–RNA–RdRp complex for the replication and transcription of the genomic RNA; this finding differs from those of previous reports that have described outside-orientated C-tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krumm et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>NDV infects many domestic and wild avian species, severely impacting the poultry industries in many countries. The structure of NDV N significantly improves our understanding of how NDV protects itself and infects hosts. It is important to highlight that NDV shares many features with other members of the order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>. For example, measles virus nucleocapsid was reported to assemble into herringbone-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>), similar to the NDV N<sub>Loop</sub> single-headed spiral. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that nucleocapsid of measles virus, as well as that of other mononegaviruses, might adopt a similar self-capping mechanism in order to keep its genome secure. N is a most conserved viral protein and the vital building block for nucleocapsid assembly, which makes it an ideal target for antivirus drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox and Plemper, 2016</xref>). The positive charged clefts between the CTD and NTD lobes of N, and especially the interaction loop between the vertically adjacent N in the clam-shaped structure, are the possible druggable sites for further structure-based design of small-molecule drugs. The structural study of the NDV provides new insights into the negative-sense RNA virus field and represents the starting point for inspiring new antiviral drug design for mononegavirus diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(Newcastle disease virus)</td><td>NDV N</td><td>Sangon Biotech <break/>Company</td><td>GenBank ID: HM063424.1</td><td>Synthetic gene</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21 (DE3) Star competent cells</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>C6010-03</td><td>Cells for protein expression</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(Newcastle disease virus)</td><td>LaSota</td><td>China Veterinary Culture Collection Center</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(hamster)</td><td>BSR-T7/5</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9847328">9847328</ext-link></td><td/><td>Gift from Zhigao Bu's lab from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicalcompound, drug</td><td>elastase</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>E8140-1UN</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemicalcompound, drug</td><td>RNase A</td><td>Promega</td><td>A7973</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>RELION 1.4</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23000701">23000701</ext-link></td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page">https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>RELION 2.0</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845625">27845625</ext-link></td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page">https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>UCSF Chimera</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Coot</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383002">20383002</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014222">SCR_014222</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PHENIX</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22505256">22505256</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014224">SCR_014224</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phenix-online.org/">https://www.phenix-online.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Crystal structure of the paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 nucleoprotein–RNA complex</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25831513">25831513</ext-link></td><td>PDB: 4XJN</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The nucleoprotein (N) gene of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (GenBank ID: HM063424.1) was synthesized by the Sangon Biotech Company (China).

The co-transfection was performed with minigenome and helper plasmids as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peeters et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, the minigenome p-LGT (3 μg), pCI-P (1.5 μg), pCI-L (1.5 μg), with each different N expression plasmid (3 μg), including wild type pCI-N and pCI-N mutants, were cotransfected into BSR-T7/5 cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase. One co-transfection, in which the N expression plasmid was replaced by vector pCI-neo was also conducted as the negative control. The transfection reagent was PolyJet reagent and the transfection procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At 96 hr posttransfection, the GFP fluorescence of different samples was observed by fluorescence microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Ribonucleoprotein complex isolation from NDV strain LaSota</title><p>NDV strain LaSota was propagated in 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs at 37°C for 96 hr. The infected allantoic fluid was collected and centrifuged at 4320 g for 30 min to remove the cell debris. The supernatants were then subjected to pelleting through a 20% sucrose cushion at 38,900 g for 2 hr at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of the EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail complete from Roche Diagnostics, and lysed by five cycles of freezing and thawing (in liquid nitrogen and at 37°C, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schoehn et al., 2004</xref>). The NDV lysate was loaded onto the top of a continuous 10% to 30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 6 hr at 16 × 10<sup>4</sup> g and 4°C with the SW40 rotor (Beckman). The samples were collected by puncturing the tube and dialyzing in PBS buffer. The presence of the N-RNA complex was verified by negative-stain EM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data availability</title><p>The cryo-EM density map of clam-shaped structure was deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) with the accession number EMD-9793.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Z Hong Zhou (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the first high-resolution cryoEM structure of the nucleoprotein (N) protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a negative strand RNA virus. They found that recombinantly expressed N protein forms clam-shaped double-headed filaments that could serve as &quot;caps&quot; or nucleation sites on nucleocapsids for viral RNA replication and/or encapsidation. This novel architecture is potentially of great importance for RNA virus replication. Mutagenesis studies are also provided that are interpreted to show the biological importance of this structure for viral replication. It is not clear how specific the mutational alterations are, i.e., whether the alteration specifically affects formation of the clam-shaped structures or alters the protein more generally. Therefore, there was some concern that these functional studies were over-interpreted. There was also a request from all three reviewers for improved images and analysis of the native RNP structures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The essential revision is to provide more convincing native RNP images and analysis of those structures.</p><p>2) The functional studies are over-interpreted, so those studies should be removed from the manuscript. The least would be to tone down the conclusions because of the reasons outlined below.</p><p>The reviewers have made a number of suggestions in their individual reviews that I think will improve the manuscript. Therefore, I am including those important points below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>In this paper, the groups led by Liu, Shen and Ouyang reports the first high-resolution cryoEM structure of the nucleoprotein (N) of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). NDV belongs to a group of negative-sense RNA viruses that also include such medically important viruses as Ebola and Measles. The authors found that recombinantly expressed N forms clam-shaped double-headed filaments with a clam-like core at the middle of the filament. Isolates have flexible structures, ranging from long to short filaments and spirals, as well as a single species containing double spirals. They used the sample fraction containing primarily the double spiral core to determine the structure at 4.8Å resolution by single-particle cryoEM. Since NDV N has 40% sequence identity to the known crystal structure Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) (Alayyoubi et al., 2015), atomic model of NDV N was built needing only minor modifications and shares great similarity to known N structures of other negatively strand RNA viruses (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 3B showing nearly identical backbone trace). Placement of this atomic model of N to the clam-shaped reconstruction shows two spirals self-capping each other in a back-to-back manner, revealing a loop (residues 114-120) that is not involved in formation the single-headed helix but responsible for the formation of the clam in the double-headed filament. The authors also carried out cryoEM analyses on the filament fraction and obtained low resolution reconstructions (about 15Å) for both the double heads and the helical segment, which are consistent with the single-particle cryoEM reconstruction of the double-headed clam-like core at higher resolution.</p><p>The authors supplement the structural analyses with a series of functional studies with constructs harboring wild-type N, loop 114-120-mutated N (named Nloop), and several other truncation mutants. Most significantly, using mini-genome constructs, the authors demonstrated that minigenome replication was dependent on wild-type, presumably clam-shaped, nucleocapsid. Protease treatment experiments revealed different protection patterns between the double-headed and single-headed helices, yielding 40 kDa verses 30 kDa protein fragment. The clam-shaped filaments were also resistant to nuclease treatment while single-headed filaments formed by Nloop mutant were less resistant to such treatment.</p><p>Taking these results together, the authors posit a self-capping mechanism by which the clam-shaped structure forms double-headed filaments to protect the NDV viral genome in vivo. Overall, I think the studies are well designed and the authors uncovered a novel architecture of N that has not been described before for any negative-sense RNA viruses. This model has the potential to stimulate further future studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This study reports the roughly 5Å structure of a &quot;clam shaped&quot; Newcastle disease virus nucleocapsid by cryo-EM. The clam shape derives from the juxtaposition of 2 NP-RNA complexes packing in a &quot;back to back&quot; manner. This arrangement would juxtapose the 5' end of the 2 encapsidated RNAs. The structure reveals that a loop comprising residues 114-120 participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with the equivalent loop in the back to back arrangement of the two N-RNA spirals. Mutation of all of the residues in that loop results in a defect in a cell based minigenome assay of RNA synthesis, and the bacterial expressed mutant appears distinct by negative-stain EM forming more filaments and less rings. Proteolysis and RNase sensitivity assays indicate the loop mutant produces a distinct pattern of cleavage and the RNA is more sensitive to digestion.</p><p>The structural observations of this study are new, and differ from prior work on other nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus nucleocapsids. The significance of the structural observations is not clear from the manuscript. The manuscript also does an inadequate job of connecting the structures with the biology of negative-strand RNA virus nucleocapsids.</p><p>1) The conclusion that NDV N assembles into a clam shaped dimer is based on the isolation of 200Å diameter round-shaped particles. The dimensions of those particles are similar to the ring-like N-RNA structures attained for several of the <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>. What fraction of the round-shaped particles are closed discs as seen for other viruses vs the clam shaped structures?</p><p>2) The initial clam shaped structure was at 6.4Å resolution with obvious C2 rotational symmetry. Into this structure the authors dock an NP protomer structure. The NP structure was based on homology modeling with that of PIV5 NP which shares 40% sequence identity. Docking of that protomer into the density map shows that the protomers either side of the &quot;seam&quot; have the lowest resolution. This arrangement leads the authors to a model that the junction comprises two NP molecules that are each bound to the 5' end of an RNA. The best evidence for this arrangement is provided by protomers that are, however, furthest away from the seam. What is the evidence that the RNA is fully coated by NP? Could this arrangement reflect interactions of unencapsidated RNA that helps bring the two molecules together? The authors must determine the length of RNAs that are fully coated directly.</p><p>3) Have the authors separately fitted the two lobes of NP into their density map? This would be of particular interest around the &quot;seam&quot; where the resolution is lowest.</p><p>4) The conclusion that viral genome replication is dependent on a clam-shaped nucleocapsid reflects a significant over-interpretation of the data at hand.</p><p>In Figure 3, the authors perform a minigenome assay to determine whether there are functional consequences for RNA synthesis for the loop mutant. The readout of this assay is GFP expression which indirectly reflects transcription of mRNA from the minigenome, which indirectly reflects encapsidation of the RNA. The mutant could however, encapsidate the template perfectly well, but be defective in recruitment of the polymerase to the template, or could alter polymerase processivity – both of which would affect reporter gene activity. However, the authors interpret this to claim that the clam shaped nucleocapsid is required for genome replication.</p><p>A second issue relates to the evidence that the mutation of the loop disrupts the production of &quot;clam-shaped&quot; structures. The negative-stain EM of Figure 3E is offered as evidence that the loop mutant can form filaments, but we have no idea whether those structures bind RNA.</p><p>A more rigorous analysis of the RNA bound, and dissection of the step at which the NP mutant affects gene expression is needed to support the conclusion that the clam-shape is required for replication.</p><p>5) In Figure 4E the authors provide evidence that the NLoop mutant is more sensitive to nuclease attack. It is curious that the extent of NP-RNA disassembly is unaltered at 90s but is affected at 180s. What is the authors explanation for this? Importantly, the values are expressed as% of remaining particles. How where these particles quantified? Were the equivalent number of like particles tested for Nloop vs Nwt? The description in the Materials and methods is inadequate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript, authors use cryoEM to characterize the N protein from NDV. negative sense RNA viral nucleoproteins (N or NP) are critical for several different steps in viral replication cycle and the current structure at 4.8 A (nominal resolution) provides structural insights into the role of NP-NP interactions. Structure derived mutations show loss of function.</p><p>Overall the study provides important structural insights. That said, there are many questions that are not addressed in the manuscript with regard to biology. The structure is derived from in vitro purified samples. Loss of function is easier to generate, but hard to interpret. Thus, the authors could/should think about how best to position their work in the context of the biological processes that N protein plays roles in. For example, in Figure 3 D vs E, no biochemial difference, some difference in the micrographs and a large different in the minigenome. Why? what are the biological consequences.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Self-capping of nucleoprotein filaments protects Newcastle Disease Virus genome&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>There are a few areas where the interpretation, conclusions and writing can be improved as outlined in reviewer 2's comments. We feel that this will significantly improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I am satisfied by the authors' responses and the revised manuscript. In particularly, the authors have made an effort to isolate native NPs and revised Figure 1—figure supplement 4. It is understandable that such effort is very laborious and not very fruitful, as also documented in the old literature of this and related viruses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a revised manuscript that reports the structure of a clam-shaped NDV nucleocapsid. The functional significance of the clam-shape remains to be formally demonstrated, but the structure itself is interesting and suggests a potential – although untested – model for the process of nucleocapsid assembly.</p><p>In revising this work the authors provide new images of the native RNPs – which responds to one of the two main criticisms. The authors state &quot;it is extremely time challenging and time consuming to obtain the nucleoprotein with clam-like structure from the Newcastle disease virus because such kind of nucleoprotein is in very low abundance in the virion.&quot; This should also further caution the authors to not over interpret the functional relevance of the structure – who focus a good deal of their response and discussion on polyploid virions. This reviewer found the structure provocative and wondered whether the true relevance of the structure relates to &quot;seeding&quot; of the correct assembly of the nucleocapsid during RNA replication with the net result that on occasion 2 copies of the genome end up in the virion.</p><p>There remain some serious overstatements of the results in the title and Abstract and some other inaccuracies in the text.</p><p>1) The evidence that the self-capping protects the genome from RNAse is weak. As pointed out in the first review a more rigorous analysis of the bound RNA is needed to make such a conclusion. As it stands, the present data do not tell us anything about the bound RNA itself. Absent this knowledge it is a major over-interpretation that the clam protects the RNA from nuclease digestion. The data of Figure 4E do not look at the RNA, they look only at the presence of clam shapes. Thus it is a significant over interpretation of the data.</p><p>2) The statement in the Abstract &quot;Uncovering the helical assembly mechanism of the negative-strand RNA virus will help the development of new antiviral therapies&quot; is unclear and is entirely speculation and should be removed. Similarly the last sentence of the Abstract.</p><p>3) Throughout the text the authors correctly state that the nucleocapsid is used for replication and transcription. The polymerase displaces the nucleocapsid protein transiently during transcription and replication. Transcription precedes replication and is hence usually referred to first. It is incorrect to state that the RdRP moves across the nucleocapsid for viral translation (Introduction first paragraph).</p><p>4) What is &quot;frontal attack&quot; in the final paragraph of the Introduction? The authors should include some explanation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45057.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The essential revision is to provide more convincing native RNP images and analysis of those structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for the opportunity to resubmit a revised version of our manuscript by Song et al. entitled “Self-capping of nucleoprotein filaments protects Newcastle Disease Virus genome”. All authors of this manuscript have carefully discussed the questions raised by the reviewers, and we are trying to address all the questions and hope that our revised manuscript will be accepted for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the most convincing way is to show the clam-like structure of nucleoprotein complex from the native virus. So, we have attempted to obtain more electron microscopic images of the nucleoprotein-RNA complex purified from the newcastle disease virus propagated in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. We have also obtained more negative stain EM images of the nucleoprotein-RNA complex and added them to Figure 1—figure supplement 4. Please note that it is extremely challenging and time consuming to obtain the nucleoprotein with clam-like structure from the newcastle disease virus because such kind of nucleoprotein is in very low abundance in the virion. We should also point out that several previous reports showed that the nucleocapsids in newcastle disease virus are more prone to be disrupted during purification than those of Hemagglutinating virus of Japan (Hosaka et al., J.Mol.Biol., 1968). This fact added extra hurdles to our effort on obtaining enough samples for the cryo-electron microscopy analysis.</p><p>In summary, we managed to obtain the negative-stain images of nucleoprotein filaments from the newcastle disease virus and we could identify the self-capping filaments which is in similar shape as that of overexpressed nucleoprotein filaments observed by electron microscopy. The new negative-stain images have been added into Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The functional studies are over-interpreted, so those studies should be removed from the manuscript.

However, the structure of round shaped sample is the clam shaped nucleoprotein-RNA complex, while the structure of the filament sample is the clam shaped structure with the helical nucleoprotein-RNA complex extending out from the clam shaped structure.

Why? what are the biological consequences.</italic></p><p>For the Figure 3D and E, though both the N<sub>WT</sub> and N<sub>Loop</sub> are eluted similarly in the void volume of the size exclusion chromatography, yet their three dimensional structures of the N<sub>WT</sub> and N<sub>Loop</sub> are different. The N<sub>WT</sub> has clam-like structure while the N<sub>Loop</sub> shows single-headed spiral as shown in the Cryo-EM images (Figure 2A and Figure 3C). Thus, N<sub>WT</sub> and N<sub>Loop</sub> may function differently in the minigenome assay. The N<sub>WT</sub> succeeds in the transcription and translation for the target GFP gene, while the NLoop fails to transcribe or translate the GFP gene, for reasons, such as the N<sub>Loop</sub> can’t keep the genome integrity, or the N<sub>Loop</sub> affects the formation of N-RNA-RdRp complex by RdRp binding to the nucleocapsid to start the expression of target GFP. But the elaborate mechanism of the N<sub>Loop</sub> above remains to be illuminated. We also added this relative issue in the discussion section of this manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a revised manuscript that reports the structure of a clam-shaped NDV nucleocapsid. The functional significance of the clam-shape remains to be formally demonstrated, but the structure itself is interesting and suggests a potential – although untested – model for the process of nucleocapsid assembly.</p><p>In revising this work the authors provide new images of the native RNPs – which responds to one of the two main criticisms. The authors state &quot;it is extremely time challenging and time consuming to obtain the nucleoprotein with clam-like structure from the Newcastle disease virus because such kind of nucleoprotein is in very low abundance in the virion.&quot; This should also further caution the authors to not over interpret the functional relevance of the structure – who focus a good deal of their response and discussion on polyploid virions. This reviewer found the structure provocative and wondered whether the true relevance of the structure relates to &quot;seeding&quot; of the correct assembly of the nucleocapsid during RNA replication with the net result that on occasion 2 copies of the genome end up in the virion.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, the clam shaped structure of the nucleoprotein-RNA complex has never been reported before, as far as we know, thus we know very little about its functional indications. Due to the limitation of the scope of this manuscript, we have to make extra effort to address the new emerging questions, including the reviewer’s concerns, and hopefully, we can publish the follow up results in the future. However, we’d like to share the current discoveries with the community and speculate the functional influence of the clam shaped structure of the nucleoprotein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There remain some serious overstatements of the results in the title and Abstract and some other inaccuracies in the text.</p><p>1) The evidence that the self-capping protects the genome from RNAse is weak. As pointed out in the first review a more rigorous analysis of the bound RNA is needed to make such a conclusion. As it stands, the present data do not tell us anything about the bound RNA itself. Absent this knowledge it is a major over-interpretation that the clam protects the RNA from nuclease digestion. The data of Figure 4E do not look at the RNA, they look only at the presence of clam shapes. Thus it is a significant over interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Disagree, Figure 4E shows the obvious difference on RNase A digesting NWT and NLoop at different timepoints, where N<sub>WT</sub> rather than NLoop protects the clam-shaped structure after the RNase A digestion. Also, as matter of fact, the NWT contained RNA because of the A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> value was about 0.9, while the NLoop didn’t contain RNA due to its low A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> value of about 0.6 after RNase A digestion. In order to make it more clear, we added the following sentence &quot;Meanwhile, the N<sub><sup>WT</sup></sub> rather than the N<sub>Loop</sub> contained RNA with an absorbance of A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> ∼0.9, while that of NLoop was ∼0.6&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statement in the Abstract &quot;Uncovering the helical assembly mechanism of the negative-strand RNA virus will help the development of new antiviral therapies&quot; is unclear and is entirely speculation and should be removed. Similarly the last sentence of the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted the sentence &quot;Uncovering the helical assembly mechanism of the negative-strand RNA virus will help the development of new antiviral therapies&quot; and the last sentence of the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the text the authors correctly state that the nucleocapsid is used for replication and transcription. The polymerase displaces the nucleocapsid protein transiently during transcription and replication. Transcription precedes replication and is hence usually referred to first. It is incorrect to state that the RdRP moves across the nucleocapsid for viral translation (Introduction first paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted the word &quot; translation &quot; in the sentence &quot; …the RdRp moves across the nucleocapsid for viral transcription and translation &quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is &quot;frontal attack&quot; in the final paragraph of the Introduction? The authors should include some explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the &quot;frontal attack&quot; to &quot;digestion by proteases&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
