Neural progenitors in the spinal cord are organised into discrete dorsoventral (DV) domains that can be identified by the combinatorial expression of conserved transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jessell, 2000</xref>). Differentiated post-mitotic neurons migrate from the medial neural progenitor domain to occupy more lateral regions of the spinal cord.</p><p>To achieve precise patterning, the developing spinal cord employs anti-parallel signalling gradients of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) and Hedgehog (Hh) to specify dorsal and ventral cell fates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Dréau and Martí, 2012</xref>). Cells acquire their fates via sensing both graded inputs. This dual signal interpretation mechanism provides more refined positional information than separate signal interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zagorski et al., 2017</xref>). The action of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the ventral spinal cord is one of the most well studied examples of graded morphogen signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). In vertebrates, Hh signalling requires the integrity of primary cilia, microtubule-based organelles present on the surface of most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eggenschwiler and Anderson, 2007</xref>). In the absence of the Shh ligand, the transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptc) represses signal transduction by inhibiting the ciliary localisation of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). When Shh binds to Ptc, Smo inhibition is released, allowing Smo to translocate to the primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>). This leads to the activation of the Gli family of transcription factors, resulting in expression of downstream target genes such as <italic>ptc</italic>. Shh thus controls the balance between full-length Gli activators and proteolytically processed Gli repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huangfu and Anderson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humke et al., 2010</xref>). In mouse, Gli2 is the main activator and its expression does not require active Hh signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai and Joyner, 2001</xref>). In zebrafish, Gli1 is the main activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlstrom et al., 2003</xref>). Although <italic>gli1</italic> is a direct target of Hh signalling, low-level <italic>gli1</italic> expression is maintained in the absence of Hh signalling via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlstrom et al., 2003</xref>). It is thought that Hh-independent <italic>gli</italic> expression allows cells to respond to Hh signals. In the ventral spinal cord, it has been shown that both the level and duration of Hh signalling is critical to the correct formation of the discrete neural progenitor domains along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dessaud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>). However, the temporal dynamics of Hh signalling has been challenging to visualize in vivo due to the lack of appropriate tools.</p><p>In addition to BMP and Hh signalling, Notch signalling has also been implicated in spinal cord development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pierfelice et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to long-range Hh signalling, the Notch signalling pathway requires direct cell-cell interaction, as both receptor and ligand are membrane bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). The Notch receptor, present at the ‘receiving’ cell membrane, is activated by the Delta and Jagged/Serrate family of ligands, present at the membrane of the neighbouring ‘sending’ cell. This leads to multiple cleavage events of Notch, the last of which is mediated by a γ-secretase complex that releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD then translocates to the nucleus and forms a ternary transcription activation complex with the mastermind-like (MAML) coactivator and the DNA binding protein RBPJ. This activation complex is essential for the transcription of downstream targets, such as the Hes/Hey family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Simpson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pierfelice et al., 2011</xref>). Two major roles of Notch signalling in neural development are to generate binary cell fate decisions through lateral inhibition and to maintain neural progenitor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Formosa-Jordan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kageyama et al., 2008</xref>). However, how Notch signalling interacts with Hh signalling during spinal cord patterning is not clear.</p><p>During spinal cord patterning, as Hh responsive neural progenitors differentiate, they lose their competence to respond to Hh signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ericson et al., 1996</xref>). This temporal change in Hh responsiveness could be an indirect consequence of neuronal differentiation, or alternatively, an actively regulated process. Recent work in chick suggests the latter scenario. Floor plate induction requires transient high level of Hh signalling followed by termination of Hh responsiveness, which is critical for the proper fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribes et al., 2010</xref>). However, how the temporal gating of Hh responsiveness is controlled remains poorly understood. Using zebrafish lateral floor plate (LFP) development as a model, we previously demonstrated that Notch signalling maintains Hh responsiveness in LFP progenitor cells, while Hh signalling functions to induce cell fate identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, differentiation of Kolmer-Agduhr&quot; (KA&quot;) interneurons from LFP progenitors requires the downregulation of both Notch and Hh signalling. Recent reports provide additional support for cross-talk between these pathways during spinal cord patterning in both chick and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stasiulewicz et al., 2015</xref>). Notch activation causes the Shh-independent accumulation of Smo to the primary cilia, whereas Notch inhibition results in ciliary enrichment of Ptc1. Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling enhances the response of neural progenitor cells to Shh, while inactivation of Notch signalling compromises Hh-dependent ventral fate specification. These results suggest that Notch signalling regulates Hh response by modulating the localisation of key Hh pathway components at primary cilia.</p><p>Here, we determine the interaction between Notch and Hh signalling during spinal cord patterning in zebrafish. Given the rapid nature of zebrafish development, combined with the long half-lives of fluorescent proteins, conventional GFP reporters do not allow detecting dynamic cell signalling events with high temporal resolution. To circumvent this issue, we recently developed a photoconversion-based PHRESH technique allowing for visualising cell signalling activation and attenuation in live embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Using the PHRESH technique, we show that Notch and Hh response display similar spatiotemporal kinetics. Gain- and loss-of function experiments confirm that Notch signalling is required to maintain Hh response in neural progenitors. Surprisingly, Notch signalling doesn’t regulate the Hh pathway at the level of Smo or primary cilia, but rather at the level of Gli transcription factors. Together, our data reveal that Notch signalling functions to control the Hh responsiveness of neural progenitors in a primary cilium-independent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a Notch signalling reporter</title><p>Spinal cord patterning is a dynamic process with complex interactions of cell signalling pathways in both space and time. To visualise the signalling events in a spatiotemporal manner, we have previously developed the PHRESH (<underline>PH</underline>otoconvertible <underline>RE</underline>porter of <underline>S</underline>ignalling <underline>H</underline>istory) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis takes advantage of the photoconvertible properties of the Kaede fluorescent protein to visualise the dynamics of cell signalling response at high temporal and spatial resolution. We have utilised the PHRESH technique to visualise Hh signalling dynamics during spinal cord patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). To apply the same technique to Notch signalling, we generated a reporter line for <italic>her12</italic>, a target gene of Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2005</xref>). This target was chosen because among other Notch target genes co-expressed with <italic>her12</italic>, such as <italic>her2</italic>, <italic>her4</italic>, and <italic>hes5</italic>, <italic>her12</italic> had the highest level of expression throughout the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By BAC (bacteria artificial chromosome) recombineering, we generated a <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> reporter by replacing the first coding exon of <italic>her12</italic> with the coding sequence for the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> BAC contains 135 kb upstream and 63 kb downstream regulatory sequences. The <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> reporter line faithfully recapitulated endogenous <italic>her12</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This reporter also responded to different Notch pathway manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). The zebrafish <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutant is unable to activate Notch signalling due to an inability to endocytose the Delta ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itoh et al., 2003</xref>). As expected, the expression of <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> was completely absent in the spinal cord of <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of Notch signalling with the small molecule γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fauq et al., 2007</xref>) completely abolished <italic>her12</italic> expression within 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). By contrast, ectopic expression of NICD (Notch intracellular domain) using the <italic>hsp:Gal4; UAS:NICD</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheer and Campos-Ortega, 1999</xref>) resulted in upregulation and expansion of the <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> is a sensitive reporter for Notch pathway activity in the spinal cord.

All responding cells are initially labelled by green-fluorescent Kaede (Kaede<sup>green</sup>), which can be photoconverted to red-fluorescent Kaede (Kaede<sup>red</sup>) at any specific time (t<sub>0</sub>). If the cell has finished its signalling response prior to t<sub>0</sub>, only perduring Kaede<sup>red</sup> will be detected. Conversely, if the cell begins its response after t<sub>0</sub>, only newly synthesised, unconverted Kaede<sup>green</sup> will be present. Finally, if the cell continuously responds to the signalling both before and after t<sub>0</sub>, a combination of newly-synthesised Kaede<sup>green</sup> and perduring Kaede<sup>red</sup> can be observed and the cell will appear yellow. Thus, Kaede<sup>red</sup> represents ‘past response’ before t<sub>0</sub>, Kaede<sup>green</sup> indicates ‘new response’ after t<sub>0</sub>, whereas Kaede<sup>red+green</sup> corresponds to ‘continued response’ through t<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). For example, if the embryo is photoconverted at 36 hpf (hours post-fertilization) and imaged 6 hr post-conversion at 42 hpf (36 hpf + 6 hr), <italic>Kaede<sup>red</sup></italic> cells have terminated their signalling response before 36 hpf, <italic>Kaede<sup>green</sup></italic> cells initiate the signalling response between 36 and 42 hpf, while <italic>Kaede<sup>red+green</sup></italic> cells have sustained signalling response from before 36 hpf and up to a point before 42 hpf. In our experiments, we photoconverted both <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> and <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> embryos at 6 hr intervals throughout spinal cord development, and imaged their Kaede fluorescent profiles 6 hr post-conversion of each time point. The time interval of 6 hr was chosen as it allowed time for higher levels of Kaede<sup>green</sup> to be synthesised while still providing high temporal resolution. We used 3D reconstruction of lateral z-stacks to generate transverse views in order to analyse both the dorsoventral and mediolateral signalling profiles at each time point. Through quantifying Kaede<sup>green</sup> fluorescence intensity along the dorsoventral (DV) and mediolateral (ML) axes at multiple points along the anterior-posterior axis, we generated representative signalling profiles at each stage to further visualise and compare the spatial dynamics of active signalling response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, graphs). Importantly, these signalling profiles were largely similar throughout the anterior-posterior axis of the photoconverted region (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>) and between different embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the first ‘signalling activation’ phase, active Notch response occurred along the entire dorsoventral axis of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right), while active Hh response constituted roughly the ventral 75% of the spinal cord in a graded manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left). Both pathways had a wide peak of response across the majority of the mediolateral axis, with the weakest response occurring at the lateral edges of the spinal cord. This pattern is consistent with the model that Notch signalling maintains neural progenitor domains, whereas Hh signalling patterns the ventral spinal cord. Interestingly, we found that the signalling response was not entirely homogeneous. In <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> embryos, the majority of cells showed continued Notch response throughout the ‘signalling activation’ phase, but there were some isolated cells in which Kaede expression was completely absent. In <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> embryos, some cells had terminated their Hh response (marked by Kaede<sup>red</sup>), while the majority of cells with the same dorsoventral positioning had continued Hh response. The differential Hh response at the same dorsoventral axis is reminiscent of the differentiation of the lateral floor plate domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the ‘signalling consolidation’ phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we observed a dramatic remodelling of the response profiles of both pathways. First, there was an extensive increase in <italic>Kaede<sup>red</sup></italic> domains for both reporters, indicating the termination of signalling response in these cells. This loss of response was localised to the ventral and lateral regions for Hh signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left) and the ventral, lateral and dorsal regions for Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right). Second, the number of <italic>Kaede<sup>red</sup></italic> cells increased as the ‘signalling consolidation’ phase progressed. Finally, the active signalling domain consolidated into a tight medial region, which sharpened further to encompass 1–2 cell tiers directly dorsal to the spinal canal corresponding to the sharp peaks in DV and ML signalling profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, 54 hpf + 6 hr).</p><p>Finally, during the ‘signalling termination’ phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), both active Notch and active Hh responses (Kaede<sup>green</sup>) slowly reduced to the basal level, and most of the spinal cord was marked by Kaede<sup>red</sup> by the end of this phase. The active Notch response was notably weaker and restricted to a small medial domain above the spinal canal by 66 hpf before returning to a basal level by 72 hpf. Active Hh response displayed similar, albeit slightly delayed, kinetics compared to the Notch response. In <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> embryos, the <italic>Kaede<sup>green</sup></italic> signal marked a small medial domain at 66 hpf and 72 hpf, and reduced to the basal level by 78 hpf. After the end of the ‘signalling termination’ phase, both pathways remained at the basal level as spinal cord development progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of spatiotemporal signalling profiles reveals that Hh and Notch signalling share similar responsive domains. To examine this directly in the same embryo, we performed double fluorescent in situ hybridisation to visualise <italic>her12</italic> and <italic>ptc2</italic> expression together during all three signalling phases of spinal cord development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). During the 'signalling activation' phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3A</xref>, 24 hpf), <italic>ptc2</italic> expression constituted the ventral portion of the <italic>her12</italic> expression domain, while during the 'signalling consolidation' and 'signalling termination' phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3A</xref>, 48 hpf and 72 hpf, respectively), <italic>ptc2</italic> and <italic>her12</italic> expression was present within the same restricted medial domain. These results confirm that Notch and Hh response are active in the same cells of the spinal cord. Indeed, double labelling with neural progenitor cell marker <italic>sox2</italic> showed that the medial domain with continued Notch and Hh response corresponded to the <italic>sox2<sup>+</sup></italic> neural progenitor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>).</p><p>Together, our PHRESH analysis reveals that Hh signalling response follows similar spatiotemporal kinetics as Notch signalling response during spinal cord patterning, raising the possibility that there is a functional relationship between these two signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Notch signalling maintains Hh response</title><p>To explore the interaction between the Notch and Hh signalling pathways, we first performed loss-of-function experiments combining small molecule inhibitors with PHRESH analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We used the Smo antagonist cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) and the γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 to block Hh and Notch signalling, respectively, in a temporally controlled manner. Cyclopamine significantly reduced <italic>ptc2</italic> expression within 4 hr, whereas LY-411575 dramatically downregulated <italic>her12</italic> expression within 2 hr, and completely abolished it after 4 hr of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To ensure complete inhibition of signalling response by the point of photoconversion, <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> and <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> embryos were incubated with the inhibitors starting from 20 hpf, photoconverted at 24 hpf and then imaged at 30 hpf, comprising 10 hr of total drug inhibition. As expected, cyclopamine treated <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> embryos displayed a marked reduction in the amount of de novo synthesised Kaede<sup>green</sup> compared to controls at 30 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, LY-411575 treated <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> embryos showed an almost complete loss of Kaede<sup>green</sup>. In the reciprocal experiments, when <italic>her12:Kaede</italic> embryos were treated with cyclopamine, there was little effect on the levels of Kaede<sup>green</sup>. However, LY-411575 treated <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> embryos showed a dramatic reduction in the levels of Kaede<sup>green</sup>, reminiscent of cyclopamine treated <italic>ptc2:Kaede</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results suggest that Notch signalling is required for maintaining Hh response, but not vice versa.

When Hh signalling was inhibited by cyclopamine, <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in the spinal cord was significantly reduced but not abolished, while <italic>her12</italic> expression in the spinal cord remained unchanged. By contrast, blocking Notch signalling by LY-411575 resulted in complete loss of both <italic>her12</italic> and <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in the spinal cord. As seen in the PHRESH analysis, <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in cells outside of the spinal cord, such as the somites, was largely intact even after Notch inhibition. To confirm the effects of LY-411575 treatment, we examined <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutants as well as embryos injected with morpholinos targeting both <italic>rbpja</italic> and <italic>rbpjb. rbpja/b</italic> genes (previously known as <italic>Su(H)</italic>1 and <italic>Su(H)2</italic>) encode DNA-binding transcription factors required for Notch response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Echeverri and Oates, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sieger et al., 2003</xref>).

Together, these results are consistent with our model that Notch signalling regulates Hh response specifically in the spinal cord. It is also interesting to note that cyclopamine treated embryos showed residual levels of <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in the spinal cord, whereas LY-411575 treatment completely eliminated <italic>ptc2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The complete loss of <italic>ptc2</italic> expression after Notch inhibition suggests that in contrast to cyclopamine, Notch signalling controls Hh response via a different mechanism, likely downstream of Smo.</p><p>In converse experiments, we utilised gain-of-function tools to test the interactions between Notch and Hh signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To activate Hh signalling, we used a transgenic line expressing heat shock inducible TagRFP-tagged rSmoM2, a constitutively activate rat Smo mutant (<italic>hsp:rSmoM2-tRFP</italic>). Induction of rSmoM2 at 11 hpf caused a dramatic upregulation of <italic>ptc2</italic> expression throughout the embryo by 24 hpf, but did not affect <italic>her12</italic> expression in the spinal cord when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, activation of Hh signalling resulted in a substantial increase in <italic>her12</italic> expression around the dorsal aorta and surrounding vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that Hh signalling is upstream of Notch response in the vasculature, the opposite relationship to in the spinal cord.

To examine this scenario, we compared the timing of loss of Hh response (<italic>ptc2</italic>) versus loss of neural progenitor state (<italic>sox2</italic>) after Notch inhibition. Embryos treated with LY-411575 beginning at 21 hpf for 1, 2 or 3 hr, or with DMSO for the entire timecourse, were analysed for <italic>ptc2</italic> and <italic>sox2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Compared to controls, <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in the spinal cord was drastically reduced after 1 hr of LY-411575 treatment, which further diminished to low level limited to only the most ventral region after 3 hr treatment. By contrast, <italic>sox2</italic> expression remained largely unchanged after 1 hr of LY-411575 treatment, and only started to decrease at later time points. Consistent with our observations, when we quantified and compared the normalized expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we found that the <italic>ptc2</italic> domain in the spinal cord was reduced by 44% after 1 hr of LY-411575 treatment, distinct from the 10% decrease for the <italic>sox2</italic> domain. After 2 hr of treatment, both the <italic>ptc2</italic> and <italic>sox2</italic> expression domains were reduced by about 50%, and by 3 hr both expression domains have now shrunk by 61–70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since the loss of <italic>ptc2</italic> expression significantly precedes the loss of <italic>sox2</italic> domain, this result suggests that Notch inhibition results in an immediate loss of Hh response, which in turn leads to a loss of neural progenitor state.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49252.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Notch signalling results in loss of Hh response followed by loss of neural progenitor identity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type embryos were incubated in LY-411575 from 20 hpf for 1, 2 or 3 hr and DMSO for the entire duration.

To explore the molecular mechanisms by which Notch signalling controls Hh response, we determined whether activation of Hh signalling at different points of the pathway can bypass the absence of Notch signalling when the small molecule inhibitor LY-411575 is present (Notch<sup>off</sup> embryos). We first utilised the previously mentioned <italic>hsp:rSmoM2-tRFP</italic> transgenic line to activate Hh signalling at the Smo level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Wild-type control or <italic>hsp:rSmoM2-tRFP</italic> embryos were heat-shocked at 20 hpf, treated with DMSO or LY-411575 for 10 hr, and assayed for gene expression at 30 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). In DMSO treated embryos, induction of rSmoM2 resulted in substantial expansion of <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in both the somites and the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Consistent with this result, activation of Hh signalling by rSmoM2 also led to an expansion of the motor neuron precursor domain, marked by <italic>olig2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). By contrast, when Notch signalling was inhibited by LY-411575, induction of both <italic>ptc2</italic> and <italic>olig2</italic> expression by rSmoM2 was still completely blocked in the spinal cord, similar to LY-411575 treated wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This result suggests that ectopic activation of Hh signalling at the Smo level is not sufficient to restore Hh response in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords and further implies that Notch signalling likely regulates Hh response downstream of Smo. Interestingly, induction of rSmoM2 did cause an expansion of <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in the surrounding somites despite Notch inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that, in the spinal cord, Notch signalling regulates Hh response by modulating the Gli1 transcription factor, as ectopic Gli1 can partially rescue the Hh response in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords. This regulation is partly through transcriptional control of <italic>gli1</italic> expression. However, since the ectopic EGFP-Gli1 was unable to rescue the highest level of Hh response and cannot fully restore <italic>olig2</italic> expression in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords, it is possible that Notch signalling plays additional roles in regulating Gli1 activity at the post-transcriptional level, or alternatively, EGFP-Gli1 expression may not be able to fully specify the <italic>olig2</italic> fate in the absence of additional activity from Gli2a, Gli2b and Gli3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We provide in vivo evidence for cross-talk between two conserved developmental signalling pathways, Notch and Hh signalling, in the zebrafish spinal cord.

Traditional transcriptional GFP reporters fail to provide temporal information due to GFP perdurance, whereas destabilised fluorescent protein reporters can only provide current activity at the expense of signalling history. By contrast, the PHRESH technique utilises Kaede photoconversion to delineate the cell signalling history in any given time window by comparing newly synthesised Kaede<sup>green</sup> (new signalling) with photoconverted Kaede<sup>red</sup> (past signalling). We envision that PHRESH analysis could be combined with cell transplantation and time-lapse imaging to simultaneously analyse cell lineage and signalling dynamics at single cell resolution. Similar approaches can easily be adapted to study other dynamic events by using photoconvertible fluorescent reporters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of Hh and Notch signalling</title><p>Using the PHRESH technique, we created a spatiotemporal map of signalling dynamics for the Hh and Notch pathways during spinal cord patterning. Strikingly, Notch and Hh signalling display similar activity profiles. We have characterised these profiles into three general phases: ‘signalling activation’, ‘signalling consolidation’, and ‘signalling termination’. In the early ‘signalling activation’ phase, Notch signalling is active throughout the spinal cord, while active Hh response occurs in the ventral ~75% of the spinal cord. During ‘signal consolidation’, the responsive domain of both pathways sharpens into a small medial domain dorsal to the spinal canal; in ‘signalling termination’ the response to both pathways returns to a basal level. Our detailed time course reveals three key features of Notch and Hh signalling dynamics. First, early active Hh signalling shows a graded response with the highest level in the ventral domain, as predicted by the classical morphogen model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>). By contrast, active Notch response does not appear to be graded along the ventral-dorsal axis. Second, despite showing the highest level of Hh response early, the ventral spinal cord terminates Hh response earlier than the more dorsal domains. Therefore, the ventral domain shows higher level Hh response for a shorter duration, whereas the dorsal domain shows lower level response for a longer duration. Our observation is reminiscent of the floor plate induction in chick and mouse embryos, where the specification of the floor plate requires an early high level of Hh signalling and subsequent termination of Hh response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribes et al., 2010</xref>). Our result suggests that Hh signalling dynamics is also evolutionarily conserved. Third, lateral regions of the spinal cord lose both Notch and Hh response before the medial domains. As the active signalling response consolidates into the medial domain, so does the expression of <italic>sox2</italic>, a neural progenitor marker, suggesting that neural differentiation is accompanied by the attenuation of Notch and Hh response. Our observation is consistent with the notion that neural progenitors occupy the medial domain of the spinal cord and that as they differentiate they move laterally.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Notch signalling regulates Hh response</title><p>The loss of Hh response is a necessary step for fate specification, as shown in the chick during floor plate induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribes et al., 2010</xref>) and in post-mitotic motor neuron precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ericson et al., 1996</xref>). We have previously shown that the time at which cells attenuate their Hh response is crucial for fate specification in the zebrafish ventral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). How do neural progenitor cells in the spinal cord maintain their Hh responsiveness until the correct time in order to achieve their specific fates? Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Notch signalling is likely part of this temporal attenuation mechanism controlling Hh responsiveness. First, PHRESH analysis reveals that active Hh response correlates with Notch signalling activity spatially and temporally. The active Hh signalling domain initially constitutes part of the active Notch response domain before following similar kinetics in 'signalling consolidation' and 'signalling termination' phases. This result is consistent with the model that Notch signalling is necessary to maintain Hh responsiveness. Second, loss of Notch signalling either by genetic mutants or by small molecule inhibition results in loss of active Hh response in the spinal cord. In contrast, inhibition of Hh signalling does not affect Notch pathway activity. Critically, upon Notch inhibition, Hh responsiveness in the spinal cord is quickly extinguished prior to the loss of neural progenitor identity, suggesting that the loss of the competence to respond to Hh signals might trigger neuronal differentiation. This idea is supported by the role Notch signalling plays in the transcriptional control of the <italic>gli</italic> genes. In particular, <italic>gli2a</italic> and <italic>gli3</italic> genes are not direct targets of Hh signalling and yet their expression is absent in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords, suggesting a direct role for Notch signalling in controlling the Hh signalling pathway. Indeed, constitutive activation of Notch signalling leads to enhanced Hh pathway activation. Together, our results suggest that Notch signalling functions upstream of Hh signalling in controlling Hh responsiveness during spinal cord patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Notch signalling gates Hh responsiveness at the level of Gli transcription factors</title><p>How does Notch signalling control Hh response? Previous reports have implicated Notch signalling in the regulation of ciliary trafficking of Smo and Ptc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stasiulewicz et al., 2015</xref>), thereby modulating cellular responsiveness to Hh signals. However, our previous work in zebrafish has shown that KA&quot; interneuron precursors can turn off their Hh response even when the Hh pathway is constitutively activated by the overexpression of rSmoM2 or by the depletion of <italic>ptc1</italic> and <italic>ptc2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, our current work shows that ectopic expression of rSmoM2 is not sufficient to restore Hh response in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords. These results suggest that regulation at the Ptc/Smo level is unlikely the only mechanism that terminates Hh responsiveness. Indeed, we show that in the absence of primary cilia in <italic>iguana</italic> mutants, the low level Hh response remaining due to constitutive Gli1 activation can be completely blocked by Notch inhibition. This result suggests that Notch signalling can regulate Hh response in a primary cilium independent manner, likely at the Gli level. It should be noted that previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stasiulewicz et al., 2015</xref>) did not examine the effects of Notch activation and inhibition on the <italic>Gli</italic> genes, so it is plausible that the cilium-dependent mechanism functions in parallel with the cilium-independent mechanism to provide redundant control of Hh responsiveness in neural progenitor cells. Alternatively, since zebrafish ciliary mutants display slightly different effects on Hh response compared to mouse due to differential regulation of <italic>gli</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Schier, 2009</xref>), it is also possible that this cilium-independent mechanism is specific to zebrafish. In zebrafish, Gli1 functions as the main activator downstream of Hh signalling, although Gli2a, Gli2b and Gli3 also contribute to the activator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlstrom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tyurina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vanderlaan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, inhibition of Notch signalling abolishes both Hh-dependent and Hh-independent <italic>gli1</italic> expression in the spinal cord. Similarly, <italic>gli2a</italic>, <italic>gli2b</italic> and <italic>gli3</italic> expression in the spinal cord is largely eliminated in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords. These results demonstrate that Notch signalling controls the transcription or mRNA stability of all members of the Gli family in the spinal cord. It is possible that <italic>gli</italic> genes are direct targets of Notch signalling, as shown in mouse cortical neural stem cells where N1ICD/RBPJ binding regulates <italic>Gli2</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Our model is also consistent with previous work on floor plate induction where the down-regulation of <italic>Gli2</italic> expression has been implicated in the loss of Hh response in mouse and chick floor plate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribes et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that regulation of the transcription of <italic>gli</italic> genes might be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to terminate Hh response. Importantly, while ectopic expression of Gli1 from the <italic>hsp:EGFP-Gli1</italic> transgene can re-establish Hh response as indicated by <italic>ptc2</italic> expression in Notch<sup>off</sup> spinal cords, it is unable to fully restore the <italic>olig2</italic> motor neuron precursor domain. This finding suggests two non-mutually exclusive scenarios. The first possibility is that the expression of Gli2a, Gli2b and Gli3 are also required to achieve a full rescue since Notch inhibition abolishes the expression of all <italic>gli</italic> genes in the ventral spinal cord. Alternatively, Notch signalling might play additional roles in regulating Gli1 protein level or activity. A similar mechanism has been suggested in Müller glia of the mouse retina, where Notch signalling controls Gli2 protein levels and therefore Hh response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ringuette et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the study by Ringuette et al. favours a translation or protein stability model because Notch manipulation does not alter the <italic>Gli2</italic> transcript level. Together, our work demonstrates that Notch signalling functions to permit neural progenitors to respond to Hh signalling via <italic>gli</italic> transcriptional regulation and potentially Gli protein maintenance. It is conceivable that Notch signalling regulates the Hh pathway at the level of both Ptc/Smo ciliary trafficking and the Gli transcription factors. This dual regulation might ensure efficient termination of Hh response during neuronal differentiation. Intriguingly, the regulation of Hh response by Notch signalling appears to be specific to the neural tissue. The Hh response in the somites is largely unaffected by Notch manipulations, whereas activation of Hh signalling results in an expansion of <italic>her12</italic> expression in the blood vessels, suggesting Notch response is likely downstream of Hh signalling in the vasculature.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that Notch and Hh signalling share similar spatiotemporal kinetics during spinal cord patterning and that this dynamic interaction is likely required to maintain the neural progenitor zone. We also provide evidence for a primary cilium-independent and Gli-dependent mechanism in which Notch signalling permits these neural progenitors to respond to Hh signalling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Resource type</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source/Reference</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Zebrafish strain <break/>(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>hsp:Gal4</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheer and Campos-Ortega, 1999</xref>, <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10072782">10072782</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-020918-6">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-020918-6</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Zebrafish strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS:NICD</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheer and Campos-Ortega, 1999</xref>, <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10072782">10072782</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-020918-8">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-020918-8</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Zebrafish strain <break/>(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>hsp:rSmoM2-tRFP</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper.</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Zebrafish strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>hsp:EGFP-Gli1</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Schier, 2009</xref> <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700616">19700616</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-110207-11">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-110207-11</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Zebrafish strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>igu<sup>ts294</sup> </italic>(<italic>iguana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sekimizu et al., 2004</xref>;

For immunohistochemistry, rabbit polyclonal antibody to Kaede (1:1000, MBL) was used. The appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1:500, Thermo Fisher) for fluorescent detection of antibody staining and Draq5 (1:10,000, Biostatus) was used for nuclei staining. All staining was performed in two or more replicates with 15–60 embryos per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>PHRESH analysis</title><p>All fluorescent imaging was carried out using the Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope and the Fluoview software.

To achieve complete conversion over a large area, a rectangular area of 1000 by 300 pixels was converted by scanning the area twice with 50% 405 nm laser at 200 μs per pixel. Following confirmation of Kaede<sup>red</sup> expression, embryos were recovered in E3 water with phenylthiourea for 6 hr post-conversion before imaging. Appropriate imaging parameters were established using the unconverted region as a reference to avoid over or under exposure of the Kaede<sup>green</sup> signal. Cross-sections were generated using Fiji-ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) to create a 3D reconstruction of the image, then ‘resliced’ to yield transverse views of the spinal cord.</p><p>To generate PHRESH signalling profiles from the reconstructed transverse views along the dorsoventral axis, three lines were drawn directly through the spinal canal and the fluorescent intensity of Kaede<sup>green</sup> was measured along the lines. Measurements were taken from one section per somite for five neighbouring somites, and the average of the three lines and the five somites was presented in the graph. Similarly, to generate signalling profiles along the mediolateral axis, one line was drawn directly dorsal to the spinal canal and the Kaede<sup>green</sup> fluorescent intensity was analysed in the same manner as described above. In order to control for transgene variability between embryos, the intensity was normalised to the maximum intensity of Kaede<sup>green</sup> in the unconverted region. These profiles were generated using Fiji-ImageJ software then graphically represented using Microsoft Excel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Drug treatment</title><p>Embryos at the appropriate stage were treated with cyclopamine (Toronto Chemical, 100 μM), LY-411575 (Sigma, 50 μM), or DMSO control in E3 fish water.

Please note that it would be treated as a new submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the long-standing problem of spinal cord patterning and a recently appreciated, but understudied question of how Notch signaling regulates neural cell responsiveness to Hedgehog signaling.</p><p>The main strengths of the paper are:</p><p>1) The manuscript is very nicely organized, written and illustrated. It is very easy to read and understand.</p><p>2)The work addresses an important problem in neural development and presents new information to the field. Although we have known for a very long time that Notch signaling has a fundamentally important role in maintaining spinal cord progenitors, we still have very little understanding of the details. Recent publications, including from the senior author of this work, have connected Notch signaling to Hh signaling sensitivity. The conclusions drawn by these authors differ substantially from the conclusions of Kong et al., 2015 and Stasiulewicz et al., 2015 and, if valid, would motivate further examination of the mechanistic intersection of Notch and Hh signaling.</p><p>3) With the exceptions noted below, the data sufficiently support the conclusions.</p><p>The main weaknesses of the paper are:</p><p>1) There is no indication of the number of trials performed or embryos analyzed for any experiment. Although most of these manipulations probably produce very clear changes in gene expression and having some sort of statistical data might not be so helpful, I do think it does become important for the experiments portrayed in Figure 7D. These experiments are key to the authors' conclusions and it is essential to know if the images they show represent the data accurately.</p><p>2) If Notch signaling sensitizes cells to Hh signaling cell autonomously, as expected if Notch does this by acting on Gli1, then a prediction is that the same cells will express <italic>ptc2</italic> and <italic>her12</italic>. However, the double labeling data of Figure 2—figure supplement 3 do not strongly support that prediction. Do higher magnification, higher resolution images reveal that all, or most, ptc2+ cells also express <italic>her12</italic>?</p><p>3) The most important weakness concerns the series of experiments to investigate where Notch acts in the Hh signaling pathway. The authors' approach is to pharmacologically inhibit Notch signaling at 20 hpf and simultaneously manipulate Hh signaling to determine if a particular manipulation can rescue the patterning deficit resulting from loss of Notch function. The problem is that Notch inhibition causes neural progenitors to rather immediately differentiate. Consequently, any subsequent failure in Hh responsiveness might not be due to absence of Notch activity, but because differentiated cells simply are unresponsive to Hh for unrelated reasons. In fact, an interpretation of Figure 2 is that differentiated cells are not Hh signaling active. This is why the data of Figure 7B are so important and therefore must be rock solid. The implication of these results is that elevation of Gli1 can overcome Notch inhibition to maintain some level of Hh signaling and spinal cord patterning. It appears to me that, in this instance, Gli1 overexpression maintains some neural progenitors and prevents their differentiation despite loss of Notch signaling. I therefore predict that delaying heatshock to induce Gli1 expression by an hour would not have the same effect. If that's the case, I'm not convinced that the data can sufficiently support the Notch effect via Gli1 model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Notch signalling maintains Hedgehog responsiveness via a Gli-dependent mechanism during zebrafish spinal cord patterning&quot; by Jacobs and Huang investigates the relationship between the Notch (N) and Hedgehog (Hh) pathways in patterning the zebrafish neural tube. Specifically, the authors a technique, PHotoconvertible REporter of Signalling History, as well as in situ hybridization, to demonstrate that the N and Hh pathways are active at the same developmental time and in a common population of cells during spinal cord development. The authors use a combination of small molecule inhibitors, genetic mutants, and transgenic (gain-of-function) zebrafish to show that in the spinal neural tube (but generally not in non-neural tissues), Notch pathway activity is required for Hedgehog responses, while Hh pathway is dispensable for N activity. The authors show that Notch pathway activity is required for Hh signaling at a step downstream of Smoothened and cilia. They show that expression of all of the <italic>gli</italic> transcription factors (<italic>gli1, gli2a, gli2b</italic> and <italic>gli3</italic>) relies on N activity and that forced expression of Gli1 is sufficient to partially restore Hh responses when the N pathway has been inhibited. The fact that the rescue is not complete raises the possibility that the Notch pathway may also serve a permissive role for Gli activity at the post-transcriptional levels.</p><p>This is important work that advances our understanding of the Hh/N relationship. While previous findings have pointed to a functional relationship, the current work significantly advances our understanding of the mechanistic nature of the relationship and suggests the mechanism acting in zebrafish may differ from that acting in the mouse (Stasiulewicz et al., 2015). The work has been carefully conducted, although it could benefit from some quantitative analysis. Specific comments that relate to overall flow of the writing, data analysis, and interpretation of results are listed below.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) To clearly emphasize the importance of the work, it would be useful to emphasize how this work addresses a previously unanswered question in the introduction section. While it is important, with respect to cell fate specification, that the competence of neural cells to respond to Hh signals be shut down at some point in later development, the mechanism by which this competence is restricted is not understood. By demonstrating that N activity is also time-limited and corresponds to the stages when cells are competent for Hh responses) and that Hh responses are dependent on N activity, the authors provide a clue as to the nature of this temporal gating of Hh responsiveness.</p><p>2) N values should be clearly stated for each experiment and quantification of data in some of the experiments should be performed.</p><p>3) As <italic>gli2a, gli2b</italic> and <italic>gli3</italic> expression in the spinal cord is largely eliminated in Notch(off) spinal cord, is it possible that the failure of hsp:EGFP-Gli1 to fully restore the Olig2+ motor neuron precursor domain is not due to the role of Notch in maintaining Gli1 activity at the post-transcriptional level but, rather hsp:EGFP-Gli1 expression may not be able to fully specify the Olig2 fate in the absence of additional activity from <italic>gli2a, gli2b</italic> and <italic>gli3</italic>. This possibility should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Jacobs and Huang tackles a very interesting problem in the field of signal interpretation. They identify a tissue-specific regulation of Hh signaling that is both surprising and intriguing. They use a range of mutant embryos to uncover the mechanism of this regulation, and identify that this regulation is at the level of Gli itself.</p><p>The paper is logically presented and the argument r.e. Hh regulation, constructed sensibly.</p><p>However, I have a major concern regarding the imaging and analysis. There is very little quantification of data. We are shown snapshots of &quot;representative&quot; embryos at different timepoints under different conditions, and we are encouraged to take the authors word on the results. For the approach outlined, the authors should be quantifying signal levels and recording how they change in time across multiple embryos. What is the embryo-to-embryo variability? How spatially confined are the results? What is the cell-to-cell variability? The quality of the presented fluorescent images is poor and somewhat unconvincing. There is a lot of information in the PHRESH reporter that they are missing because of out-dated analysis approaches.</p><p>A second major issue I have regards the means of perturbation. They rely entirely on drug perturbations to Notch. Are heat shock or Gal4-driven dominant negatives alleles available to test the suppression? The problem with drug treatments is that the whole embryo is affected so deciphering tissue-specific phenotypes needs to be done carefully. Both drug and heat-shock induced perturbations should be used to cross-validate the approach.</p><p>To summarise, I think the paper is potentially very interesting and tackles a problem relevant to a broad range of researchers. However, in its current form it appears dated and does not use suitable analysis techniques that give me sufficient confidence in the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49252.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

Although we have known for a very long time that Notch signaling has a fundamentally important role in maintaining spinal cord progenitors, we still have very little understanding of the details. Recent publications, including from the senior author of this work, have connected Notch signaling to Hh signaling sensitivity. The conclusions drawn by these authors differ substantially from the conclusions of Kong et al.,2015 and Stasiulewicz et al., 2015 and, if valid, would motivate further examination of the mechanistic intersection of Notch and Hh signaling.</p><p>3) With the exceptions noted below, the data sufficiently support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for thoughtful comments on the manuscript and supportive remarks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main weaknesses of the paper are:</p><p>1) There is no indication of the number of trials performed or embryos analyzed for any experiment. Although most of these manipulations probably produce very clear changes in gene expression and having some sort of statistical data might not be so helpful, I do think it does become important for the experiments portrayed in Figure 7D. These experiments are key to the authors' conclusions and it is essential to know if the images they show represent the data accurately.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have provided <italic>n</italic> numbers for all experiments throughout the manuscript in figures and figure legends.

However, the double labeling data of Figure 2—figure supplement 3 do not strongly support that prediction. Do higher magnification, higher resolution images reveal that all, or most, ptc2+ cells also express her12?</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the double fluorescent in situ hybridization and provided new transverse images in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A.

The authors' approach is to pharmacologically inhibit Notch signaling at 20 hpf and simultaneously manipulate Hh signaling to determine if a particular manipulation can rescue the patterning deficit resulting from loss of Notch function. The problem is that Notch inhibition causes neural progenitors to rather immediately differentiate. Consequently, any subsequent failure in Hh responsiveness might not be due to absence of Notch activity, but because differentiated cells simply are unresponsive to Hh for unrelated reasons. In fact, an interpretation of Figure 2 is that differentiated cells are not Hh signaling active. This is why the data of Figure 7B are so important and therefore must be rock solid. The implication of these results is that elevation of Gli1 can overcome Notch inhibition to maintain some level of Hh signaling and spinal cord patterning. It appears to me that, in this instance, Gli1 overexpression maintains some neural progenitors and prevents their differentiation despite loss of Notch signaling. I therefore predict that delaying heatshock to induce Gli1 expression by an hour would not have the same effect. If that's the case, I'm not convinced that the data can sufficiently support the Notch effect via Gli1 model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent point.

Specifically, the authors a technique, PHotoconvertible REporter of Signalling History, as well as in situ hybridization, to demonstrate that the N and Hh pathways are active at the same developmental time and in a common population of cells during spinal cord development. The authors use a combination of small molecule inhibitors, genetic mutants, and transgenic (gain-of-function) zebrafish to show that in the spinal neural tube (but generally not in non-neural tissues), Notch pathway activity is required for Hedgehog responses, while Hh pathway is dispensable for N activity. The authors show that Notch pathway activity is required for Hh signaling at a step downstream of Smoothened and cilia. They show that expression of all of the gli transcription factors (gli1, gli2a, gli2b and gli3) relies on N activity and that forced expression of Gli1 is sufficient to partially restore Hh responses when the N pathway has been inhibited. The fact that the rescue is not complete raises the possibility that the Notch pathway may also serve a permissive role for Gli activity at the post-transcriptional levels.</p><p>This is important work that advances our understanding of the Hh/N relationship. While previous findings have pointed to a functional relationship, the current work significantly advances our understanding of the mechanistic nature of the relationship and suggests the mechanism acting in zebrafish may differ from that acting in the mouse (Stasiulewicz et al., 2015). The work has been carefully conducted, although it could benefit from some quantitative analysis. Specific comments that relate to overall flow of the writing, data analysis, and interpretation of results are listed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for a critical reading of the manuscript and the constructive suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) To clearly emphasize the importance of the work, it would be useful to emphasize how this work addresses a previously unanswered question in the introduction section. While it is important, with respect to cell fate specification, that the competence of neural cells to respond to Hh signals be shut down at some point in later development, the mechanism by which this competence is restricted is not understood. By demonstrating that N activity is also time-limited and corresponds to the stages when cells are competent for Hh responses) and that Hh responses are dependent on N activity, the authors provide a clue as to the nature of this temporal gating of Hh responsiveness.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have revised the introduction to highlight the importance of Hh signaling termination in cell fate specification and also emphasize how the temporal gating of Hh responsiveness is controlled is still poorly understood.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) N values should be clearly stated for each experiment and quantification of data in some of the experiments should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have provided <italic>n</italic> numbers for all experiments throughout the manuscript in figures and figure legends.

This possibility should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the viewer for pointing out this alternative scenario.

There is very little quantification of data. We are shown snapshots of &quot;representative&quot; embryos at different timepoints under different conditions, and we are encouraged to take the authors word on the results. For the approach outlined, the authors should be quantifying signal levels and recording how they change in time across multiple embryos. What is the embryo-to-embryo variability? How spatially confined are the results? What is the cell-to-cell variability? The quality of the presented fluorescent images is poor and somewhat unconvincing. There is a lot of information in the PHRESH reporter that they are missing because of out-dated analysis approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have provided <italic>n</italic> numbers for all experiments throughout the manuscript in figures and figure legends. We have also provided more in-depth quantifications for the key experiments (Figure 5B and Figure 8D). For PHRESH analysis, transverse views were obtained by 3D reconstruction from confocal stacks imaged from lateral views of the spinal cord. Since the axial resolution in the z-dimension is typically less than the lateral resolution in the x- and y-dimension in confocal microscopy, the reconstructed images were of slightly lower resolution compared to lateral images. Despite this limitation, the reconstructed transverse views clearly showed the spatial and temporal dynamics of Notch and Hh signaling response in the spinal cord during embryo development. To further compare the signaling dynamics, we quantified Kaede<sup>green</sup> fluorescence intensity (active signaling) along the dorsoventral (DV) and mediolateral (ML) axes to generate signaling profiles. New graphs are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. In particular, quantifications of signaling profiles across multiple embryos showed consistent trends with small variability (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Comparison of DV/ML signaling profiles across different stages (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1) supports our general conclusions that Notch and Hh signaling display similar spatiotemporal kinetics during spinal cord patterning, going through signaling “activation”, “consolidation” and “termination” phases (subsection “Notch and Hh signalling display similar dynamics during spinal cord patterning”). In this manuscript, we focus on comparing signaling profiles of the entire spinal cord. However, we have previously shown that PHRESH analysis can be combined with antibody staining to examine the temporal dynamics of Hh response at the single cell resolution (Huang et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second major issue I have regards the means of perturbation. They rely entirely on drug perturbations to Notch. Are heat shock or Gal4-driven dominant negatives alleles available to test the suppression? The problem with drug treatments is that the whole embryo is affected so deciphering tissue-specific phenotypes needs to be done carefully. Both drug and heat-shock induced perturbations should be used to cross-validate the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used different tools to examine the effect of Notch inhibition. First, we utilized the <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutant, which has compromised Notch signaling due to defects in the endocytosis of Notch ligands (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Second, we injected wild-type embryos with morpholinos targeting both <italic>rbpja</italic> and <italic>rbpjb</italic> genes (previously known as <italic>Su(H)1</italic> and <italic>Su(H)2</italic>), which encode DNA-binding transcription factors required for Notch response (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, new data). In both <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutants and <italic>rbpja/b<sup>MO</sup></italic>-injected embryos, Hh response was completely lost in the spinal cord but remained largely normal in the somites. This phenotype was recapitulated by LY-411575, a specific inhibitor of Notch signaling (Figure 3). The loss of Hh response in the spinal cord was similarly observed when Notch signaling was blocked by compound E, a different small molecule inhibitor of Notch signaling (Huang et al., 2012). Even though the whole embryo is affected in both drug treatments and genetic mutants, the fact that Notch inhibition results in distinct phenotypes on Hh response in different tissues (the spinal cord versus the somites) in the same embryos is a strong indication that Notch signaling regulates Hh responsiveness in a tissue-specific manner. As drug inhibition provides precise temporal control with fast kinetics of signaling inhibition (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), this was our preferred method of Notch inhibition. As suggested by the reviewer, we also obtained a construct containing a dominant negative form of murine Mastermind-like (MAML) gene tagged with GFP under the control of the heat shock promoter (<italic>hsp:dnMAML-GFP</italic>) (Zhao et al., 2014). MAML is a transcriptional co-activator required for Notch-mediated transcription. Unfortunately, embryos injected with <italic>hsp:dnMAML-GFP</italic> showed only partial inhibition of Notch signaling upon heat shock induction, and it was therefore inconclusive to examine its effect on Hh response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To summarise, I think the paper is potentially very interesting and tackles a problem relevant to a broad range of researchers. However, in its current form it appears dated and does not use suitable analysis techniques that give me sufficient confidence in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the importance of our work.
