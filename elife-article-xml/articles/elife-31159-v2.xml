Long-range control of UPR activation has been demonstrated in invertebrates, but such mechanisms in mammals remain elusive. Here, we show that the female sex hormone estrogen regulates the UPR in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Estrogen treatment increases the capacity of HSCs to regenerate the hematopoietic system upon transplantation and accelerates regeneration after irradiation. We found that estrogen signals through estrogen receptor α (ERα) expressed in hematopoietic cells to activate the protective Ire1α-Xbp1 branch of the UPR. Further, ERα-mediated activation of the Ire1α-Xbp1 pathway confers HSCs with resistance against proteotoxic stress and promotes regeneration. Our findings reveal a systemic mechanism through which HSC function is augmented for hematopoietic regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hematopoietic stem cells</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>estrogen</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>irradiation</kwd><kwd>Ire1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 DK060445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapple</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL132392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA193235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakada</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK107413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakada</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Estrogen is a systemic factor that promotes hematopoietic regeneration by activating the unfolded protein responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to adapt to changing animal physiology or tissue damage, tissue stem cells must respond to long-range signals emitted from other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakada et al., 2011</xref>).

Age-related changes in blood-borne factors regulate muscle and neural stem cell aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>). However, few long-range signals, such as prostaglandin E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">North et al., 2007</xref>) or those that are modulated by prolonged fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>), have been found to augment the ability of tissue stem cells to repair damaged tissues. Understanding how long-range signals regulate tissue stem cell function may pave the way to harness stem cells for regenerative medicine.</p><p>The hematopoietic system has a remarkable regenerative potential demonstrated by the ability of a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) to rebuild the entire hematopoietic system upon transplantation, and to regenerate the tissue upon damage, such as those caused by chemo- or radio-therapies. A network of factors operating cell intrinsically or extrinsically promote regeneration by HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendelson and Frenette, 2014</xref>). Cell-extrinsic factors produced by the HSC niche, such as the stem cell factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zsebo et al., 1992</xref>), angiogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goncalves et al., 2016</xref>), pleiotrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Himburg et al., 2010</xref>), EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2013</xref>), or Dkk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Himburg et al., 2017</xref>) have particular therapeutic potential as they may be used as radioprotectors or radiomitigators to accelerate the recovery of the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Citrin et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the extensive interest in augmenting the regenerative potential of HSCs, much remains to be investigated regarding the factors that promote hematopoietic regeneration by HSCs, and the mode of action of these factors.</p><p>The female sex hormone estrogen is an emerging soluble factor involved in specification and self-renewal of HSCs. Estradiol (E2), the most potent endogenous estrogen, is predominantly produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries and regulates a diverse array of tissues, such as the reproductive organs, bone, breast, brain, and the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards, 2005</xref>). During zebrafish development, maternal E2 stored in the yolk promotes the specification of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2014</xref>). In mice, E2 produced by the ovaries stimulates division of HSCs via the estrogen receptor α (ERα). Exogenous E2, when administered at a physiological level similar to the level observed during pregnancy, also promotes division of HSCs in male mice, indicating that the E2-ERα pathway activation is sufficient induce HSC division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakada et al., 2014</xref>). A selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen also promoted HSC division similar to E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sánchez-Aguilera et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, even though E2 significantly increases HSC divisions, unlike infection or interferon responses it does not lead to HSC depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esplin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Essers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Passegué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2009</xref>). This raises a question of whether HSC function is impaired by E2 at the cost of increased division, or whether E2 elicits a protective mechanism to maintain HSCs while stimulating HSC division.</p><p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionally conserved mechanism that promotes protein homeostasis (proteostasis) upon various stresses by increasing the expression of protein foldases and chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</xref>). Three pathways — the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway, the ATF6 pathway, and the IRE1-XBP1 pathway — coordinately regulate the UPR in mammals. Gpr78 (also called BiP), a chaperone localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), tethers the three ER stress sensors (PERK, ATF6, and IRE1) in inactive states during homeostasis. Upon ER stress, Gpr78 disassociates with PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 to allow them to become activated and induce the UPR. The UPR plays essential roles in highly secretary cells, such as plasma cells and pancreatic β-cells that have high protein flux through the ER. In addition, recent evidence established that the UPR is also involved in a wide range of pathological states, since many stress signals impinge upon the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, evidence in <italic>C.elegans</italic> indicates that the UPR can be extrinsically activated, potentially mediated by an as yet unidentified neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor and Dillin, 2013</xref>). Whether the UPR in mammalian tissue stem cells is regulated by systemic factors remains elusive.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that the female sex hormone E2 increases the regenerative capacity of HSCs upon transplantation, and improves bone marrow and peripheral blood recovery after irradiation. ERα, in response to E2 stimulation, activated a protective UPR by inducing the expression of Ire1α in HSCs. The Ire1α-Xbp1 branch of the UPR augmented proteotoxic stress resistance in HSCs and promoted regeneration. Our results reveal that the UPR in HSCs can be modulated by systemic factors, extending the systemic activation of the UPR to tissue stem cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Estradiol promotes the regenerative capacity of HSCs</title><p>To address the question of whether E2 stimulation affects HSC function, we first performed colony-forming assays by sorting single HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, for gating strategy) from oil- or E2-treated male mice into methylcellulose media. We used male mice unless otherwise noted since estrogen levels fluctuate in females during the estrus cycle. HSCs from E2-treated animals exhibited a greater proportion of immature colonies containing granulocytes, erythrocytes, macrophages, and megakaryocytes (gemM) compared to HSCs from oil-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that E2 increases the multipotency of HSCs. To quantify the effects of E2 in promoting megakaryocytic potential of HSCs we used a collagen-based media that enables outgrowth and enumeration of megakaryocytes. Although freshly isolated HSCs were incapable of forming any colonies in this media, potentially due to the lack of HSC supportive cytokines, HSCs after a brief culture in media containing cytokines exhibited robust megakaryocytic differentiation in this system. We found that HSCs isolated from E2-treated mice not only formed more colonies but they also exhibited a significantly increased capacity to form colonies containing megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with the increased megakaryopoiesis by E2, we observed significantly more megakaryocytes in the bone marrow of E2-treated mice than oil-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).

We identified a subset of peaks that were differentially upregulated in E2-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Both the de novo and the supervised motif search identified ERE as the most enriched motif found in differentially regulated peaks, consistent with the idea that ERα is the major regulator of the transcriptional changes induced by E2 in HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Of interest, one of the differential peaks present in E2-treated HSCs was located approximately 2.5 kb upstream of the TSS of <italic>Ire1α</italic> (termed peak 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further sequence interrogation of this locus revealed that this ATAC-seq peak contains a ERE motif with one nucleotide mismatch (GGTCAnnnTGACa) from the consensus ERE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lower panel). Given that ERE motifs found in prototypical ERα target genes, such as Oxytocin and pS2, contain one base mismatch from the consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruber et al., 2004</xref>), we next functionally validated the ERE in this locus. To this end, we first tested whether the DNA sequence of this region have E2- and ERα-responsive transcriptional activity. We cloned the 4 kb region of <italic>Ern1</italic> into a luciferase reporter plasmid, transfected into 293 T cells with or without a plasmid expressing ERα, and treated the cells with E2 or control vehicle and measured luciferase activity. This revealed that the <italic>Ern1</italic>(−4 kb) construct has E2- and ERα-responsive transactivating capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, this E2- and ERα-responsive transactivating capacity was diminished when the ERE was mutated in the <italic>Ern1</italic>(−4 kb) construct, indicating that the ERE located upstream of <italic>Ern1</italic> is functional. To determine if ERα binds to this locus in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, we performed ChIP-qPCR. c-kit<sup>+</sup> HSPCs were isolated from oil- or E2-treated mice and were subject to ChIP. We found that the ERα occupancy at peak 2 increased significantly upon E2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This result coincides with our finding that this locus becomes more accessible upon E2 treatment and that it contains a functional ERE. These results establish that <italic>Ire1α</italic> is a direct target of ligand-activated ERα in hematopoietic progenitor cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31159.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ERα Associates with the <italic>Ire1α</italic> Upstream Locus in HSPCs (<bold>A</bold>) Metagene analysis indentifying differentially expressed peaks in E2 treated HSPCs.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Homer motif analysis.

Using our recently described mouse and human HSPC genome editing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gundry et al., 2016</xref>), we designed multiple single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) against Ire1α, and electroporated them as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with Cas9 protein into LSK cells. By immunoblotting and sequencing, we identified sgRNAs that efficiently ablated Ire1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), recipients of Rosa26-edited LSK cells demonstrated enhanced hematopoietic recovery when treated with E2, which was largely suppressed when Ire1α was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

E2 treatment increased the capacity of HSCs to reconstitute the hematopoietic system upon transplantation and accelerated hematopoietic regeneration after total body irradiation. E2-ERα signaling transcriptionally induced the expression of Ire1α, which then promoted the splicing of <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA to induce Xbp1s, a transcription factor critical for the UPR. The importance of the Ire1α-Xbp1 pathway-mediated UPR is exemplified by our finding that E2 augments hematopoietic recovery after transplantation through Ire1α. Thus, E2 is a soluble long-range signal that promotes hematopoietic regeneration at least partly by inducing a cytoprotective UPR in HSCs.</p><p>Whether activation of the UPR is beneficial or detrimental for HSC function appears to depend on which pathway becomes activated and to what extent it is activated. Uncontrolled activation of the UPR, particularly of the PERK pathway, has been shown to impair HSC function. Deletion of Grp78 (BiP) in mice activates all three branches of the UPR and reduces the HSC pool, causing lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wey et al., 2012</xref>). Human HSCs activate the PERK pathway upon proteotoxic stress, rendering them susceptible to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Galen et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, activation of the Ire1α-Xbp1 branch or the protein folding capacity improves HSC function. While human HSCs activate the PERK pathway upon proteotoxic stress and undergo apoptosis, downstream progenitors activate the Ire1α-Xbp1 pathway to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Galen et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, overexpression of a molecular chaperone ERDJ4 (encoded by <italic>DNAJB9</italic>) protects human HSCs from proteotoxic stress and increases the reconstitution capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Galen et al., 2014</xref>). Our results are consistent with the model that activation of the Ire1α-Xbp1 branch by E2 protects HSCs from proteotoxic stress and promotes hematopoietic regeneration, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that two other UPR branches (PERK and ATF6) are also involved. IRE1 also promotes decay of mRNA localized to the ER, called regulated IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurel et al., 2014</xref>). However, RIDD seems unlikely to be activated in E2-treated HSCs since translation is not attenuated in HSCs after E2 exposure. Furthermore, RIDD is usually associated with apoptotic cell death, which is not observed in E2-treated cells. It is important to note that Xbp1 is largely dispensable for HSC maintenance during homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettigole et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that although Xbp1 is not required for the homeostatic maintenance of HSCs, its activation provides additional protection against proteotoxic stress. Thus, selective activation of the Ire1α-Xbp1 pathway is key to harnessing the UPR to improve hematopoietic regeneration. How E2 preferentially activates the Ire1α-Xbp1 branch without appreciable activation of the PERK and ATF6 pathways remains to be explored.</p><p>Consistent with our previous finding that E2 promotes division of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakada et al., 2014</xref>), we found that E2-treated HSCs had increased expression of genes known as Myc target genes, some of which were induced in vitro after E2 stimulation. It is important to note, though, that although some of the Myc targets were induced, c-Myc, N-Myc, or L-Myc were not induced by E2. Thus, to what extent the global upregulation of Myc-target genes in HSCs after E2 treatment reflects Myc-induced responses or an indirect consequence of the activated cell cycle remains unclear. More work is needed to determine the direct target of the E2-ERα module that promotes HSC division.</p><p>Our findings indicate that E2 promotes hematopoietic regeneration by protecting HSPCs from irradiation-induced stress. An earlier study reported that female mice are more resistant to acute irradiation than male mice, and that the estrus cycle affects radioresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rugh and Clugston, 1955</xref>), although careful interpretation is required since strain differences also contribute to radioresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grahn, 1958</xref>). Estrogenic compounds such as genistein have also been known to have radioprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ha et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that engraftment of human HSPCs is more efficient in female recipient mice than male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Notta et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanism behind this sexual difference in HSC engraftment remains to be established, but it is tempting to speculate that the female hormonal milieu protects engrafting HSCs from stress. Further investigation on how estrogens, or more broadly hormones, prepare the recipient to accommodate transplanted HSCs, including the involvement of the bone marrow niche, may pave the way to improve the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation. Since estrogens also have detrimental hematopoietic side-effects, such as causing thromboembolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tchaikovski and Rosing, 2010</xref>), future studies should aim to separate the beneficial effects of estrogens on HSC function from other negative effects.</p><p>In concordance with the effect of E2 on HSPC regeneration, E2 also improved the blood cell counts after irradiation or transplantation, although the effects of E2 on mature cells in the blood were less pronounced than the effects on HSPCs. We postulate that since production of mature cells involves multiple intermediate cell stages during differentiation and that it is also affected by a variety of homeostatic mechanisms (such as thrombopoietin production by the liver and the kidney), the end output in the blood may not be as robust as the effects on HSPCs.</p><p>More broadly, our data extend the role of systemic UPR activation to regeneration by adult stem cells. Exciting new data have described that the UPR is a key pathway in intercellular and inter-tissue communication regulating tissue homeostasis and aging. Chemical chaperones, such as osmolytes and hydrophobic compounds, aid in cellular protein folding capacity to maintain proteostasis, and have therapeutic potential in treating metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortez and Sim, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, taurocholic acid, a chemical chaperone that is more abundant in the bile acid of fetal liver compared to adult liver, inhibits protein aggregation in fetal liver HSCs to support their rapid expansion during development and in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miharada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigurdsson et al., 2016</xref>). This illustrates that systemic factor(s) can affect the protein folding capacity of HSCs, although it remains unclear whether bile acid affects the UPR of HSCs in adult animals. In nematodes and fruit flies, impaired proteostasis of a cell type or a tissue can communicate to other cells to coordinate stress responses systemically by upregulating the UPR in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berendzen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto, 2014</xref>). Additionally, activation of the UPR in neurons by Xbp1s expression extends lifespan of <italic>C.elegans</italic>, and strikingly, augments the UPR in the intestine through a cell non-autonomous mechanism involving an unknown neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor and Dillin, 2013</xref>). The Ire1α-Xbp1s pathway appears to be important for systemic UPR activation in vertebrates as well, since Xbp1s expression in murine POMC neurons activates Xbp1s in the liver, paralleling the improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppression of glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, although the secreted systemic factors that activate the UPR in distal tissues remain largely unknown, the UPR is a conserved mechanism that is activated by systemic factors to prepare the perceiving cells against stress by promoting proteostasis. Our work establishes that E2 is a systemic extrinsic regulator of UPR in adult HSCs that endows them with enhanced stress resistance, which is critical during regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The mouse alleles used in this study were <italic>Ubc-GFP</italic> (C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J, JAX Stock #004353) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaefer et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Mx1-Cre</italic> (C.Cg-Tg(Mx1-cre)1Cgn/J, JAX Stock #005673) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuhn et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>Esr1<sup>fl</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>ERAI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwawaki et al., 2004</xref>) on a C57BL/6 background.

Unless otherwise noted, antibodies were obtained from BioLegend, BD Biosciences, or eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Biotin-conjugated antibodies were visualized using streptavidin-conjugated APC-Cy7. HSCs were sometimes pre-enriched by selecting c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells using paramagnetic microbeads and autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Nonviable cells were excluded from sorts and analyses using the viability dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 μg/ml).

Immediately after lysis, the lysis buffer was removed by spinning at 500 x g for 5 min with 4<sup>o</sup>C table-top centrifuge. The nuclei pellet was then resuspended in 10μl of transposase reaction mix (2μl 5xTAPS buffer (50mM TAPS-NaOH, 25mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH8.5)), 0.5μl Tn5 (0.885 mg/mL), 7.5μl of nuclear free water). The transposase reaction was incubated at 37<sup>o</sup>C for 30 min, and then stopped by adding 5μl of 0.2% SDS for 5 min at room temperature. The transposase reaction was then purified by a ZYMO DNA purification kit. Tagmentated DNA was eluted in 10μl nuclease free water, and a half of the elution volume was then used for PCR enrichment reaction with NEBNext Q5 Hot Start HiFi PCR Master Mix (NEB M0543S). The library amplification reaction included 25μl of 2x Q5 master mix, 5 μl of tagmentated DNA template, 2.5μl of 25uM PCR primer 1 (final conc. 1.25μM), 2.5μl of 25μM barcoded PCR primer (final conc. 1.25μM) (all primers from SIGMA), and 15μl of nuclear free water. PCR protocol was 5 min at 72<sup>o</sup>C, 30 sec at 98<sup>o</sup>C, and then n cycles of 10 sec at 98<sup>o</sup>C, 30 sec at 63<sup>o</sup>C, 1 min at 72<sup>o</sup>C, where “n” was determined by qPCR with SYBRGreen to reduce GC and size bias. After that, the library was purified using SPRI beads and eluted in 20μl of nuclear free water (the final concentration ~ 30nM). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped to mm10 using Bowtie2 (Version: 2.2.6), and peaks were called on each sample individually using MACS2 (Version: 2.1.0.20151222). Differential peaks were obtained on overlapping peaks using PePr (Version: 1.1.18). Heatmaps were generated using deepTools computeMatrix algorithm whereby the center each location (from BED file) was used as the reference point and was extended ± 5kb from the center point. </p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>HSC culture and differentiation assays</title><p>For CFU assays, single freshly isolated HSCs from control and E2-treated <italic>Esr<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>and <italic>Esr<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Mx1-Cre</italic> mice were plated into 96-well plates containing M3434 MethoCult methylcellulose media (StemCell Technologies, Cambridge, MA).

To ensure the reproducibility of our findings, all data were derived from multiple independent experiments performed on different days. Sample sizes were chosen based on observed effect sizes and standard errors from previous experiments, and data was checked for normality and similar variance between groups. Only males were used in these studies, and all experimental units were age-matched. In the case of investigating ERα deletion, untreated floxed littermates were used as controls. Animal studies were performed without blinding. To test statistical significance of the means of two samples, two-tailed Student’s t tests or Mann Whitney U Tests were performed. Statistical significance of multiple groups was evaluated with a two-way ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s test for multiple comparisons. Analysis of three or more groups with unequal sample sizes was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis H Test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Survival curves were tested for statistical significance with a log-rank test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Values are reported as mean ± SD unless stated otherwise. </p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>The accession number for the RNA sequencing data reported in this paper is GSE99120.

Linking the UPR to the E2 response is very novel and a finding that advances not only the HSC field.</p><p>The overall work is very good and elegant, however my major concern is the repeated comment that ER works cell intrinsically only. It certainly works within HSCs, however without any experiments with chimeric mice in which either the hematopoietic system or the stroma lack ERα it is impossible to conclude that ER signaling does not play a role indirectly through the stroma/ HSC niche too. In fact, some in vitro experiments only partially reproduce the in vivo findings, and in most experiments HSCs harvested from treated mice are used, rather than HSCs treated ex vivo. The authors could either generate the chimeras, which is however time-consuming as a pre-experiment, or be more careful in their comments.</p><p>2) The other major missing point in terms of functional characterization of HSCs from E2-treated mice is a limiting dilution transplantation assay, so that not only groups of 100 HSCs, but also smaller doses, e.g. single or 5-10 HSCs can be assessed and frequencies can be estimated. This seems important especially in view of up-regulation of cMyc following E2 treatment, with Myc activation being consistently linked to loss of HSC function. Is it possible that E2 treatment leads to further proliferation of already active HSCs rather than dormant (e.g. label retaining) ones?</p><p>3) Another major point regards the connection between ERα and the UPR. Is Ire1α a direct target of ERα? This could already be known, and therefore mentioned, or checked through bioinformatics analysis of the Ire1α promoter, and ideally a ChiP experiment.</p><p>4) Finally, I don't see anywhere the gating strategy used to identify HSC and progenitor cell populations. It is very important that these are shown as different gates are used by different research groups and it is easy to be transparent about the gates used, as long as they are consistent throughout the work shown.</p><p>5) The survival experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not really add much to the previous experiment, showing recovery from a lower dose of irradiation. I would either remove the experiment entirely to avoid any reference to letting mice die as an experimental end point, which is unethical, or explain how the mice were humanely monitored.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript &quot;ERα promotes hematopoietic regeneration through the IRE1α-mediated unfolded protein response&quot; Nakada et al. provide evidence that estrogen receptor (ER) signaling promotes HSC regeneration following irradiation at least in part due to activation of the Ire1a branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Altogether the hypothesis is interesting and the work is a nice extension of prior studies in this area.</p><p>I have a few major comments relating to improving the quality of the study:</p><p>1) The implication of the data (and prior work from the Morrison lab) is that ER signaling promotes HSC proliferation. As such it would be important to distinguish whether the mechanism by which ER signaling promotes recovery is due to protection from apoptosis (given Annexin V data), proliferation or both, as either mechanism can lead to faster recovery of BM cell numbers.</p><p>2) Along these lines, is UPR directly responsible for increased Myc/E2F gene levels and cell proliferation or vice versa? This can be tested in regenerative conditions using the CRISPR system developed by the authors and would define the epistatic relationship between these important and functionally interleaved gene programs in hematopoietic regeneration.</p><p>3) Overall a key finding of the paper is the dependence on Ire1α based on CRISPR. To fully substantiate the Ire1α findings to the reader I recommend that the authors show the full timecourse of hematopoietic regeneration following IR such as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and demonstrate by directly interrogating the BM whether similar kinetics of BM and LSK recovery are observed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, at least looking in the donor compartment if not BM as a whole.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows sensitization of LSK to stressors; on the flipside does Ire1α KD also abrogate any increases in colony forming activity in LSK, or is the colony forming phenotype only specific to HSCs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study is an extension of a previous study showing E2 increases HSC proliferation and frequency and erythropoiesis (Nakada et al., 2014), showed E2 increases broad myelopoiesis, and uncovered the mechanistic link between E2 and UPR, a protective mechanism for HSCs (van Galen et al., 2014). They showed that IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR is responsible for E2's effect on HSCs, as deleting IRE1 using CRISPR in LSK cells blunted E2's effect on HSCs.</p><p>1) Non-autonomous UPR refers to the phenomenon that ER stress in one tissue induces UPR in a remote tissue. If the authors claim that what they found here represents an example of non-autonomous UPR, they would need to show that ER stress in ovaries leads to release of E2, which activates UPR in HSCs. However, it does not seem to be the case here.</p><p>2) The observation that E2 increases myelopoiesis but not lymphopoiesis is interesting. Do myeloid primed HSCs have increased ER stress than lymphoid primed HSCs? The authors propose IRE1 as an underlying mechanism. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, it appears that the effects of E2 and IRE1α are uncoupled. E2 increased WBC but IRE1α deletion had no effect on WBC. E2 had no effect on RBC but IRE1α deletion reduced RBC.</p><p>3) The authors performed RNA-seq and found that UPR genes are upregulated in E2-treated HSCs. Importantly, they showed that the UPR upregulation upon E2 is dependent on ERα. How does E2-ERα upregulate IRE1? Does IRE1 promoter have ERα binding site? Does ERα bind to IRE1 promoter?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, what's the editing efficiency? Typically, a pool of CRISPR edited cells do not show knockdown, but need to be selected for single clones that have efficient knockdown. Since the novel aspect of this study is the connection of E2 with UPR and the knockout mouse models for all three branches of UPR are well established, it makes more sense to use the KO mice.</p><p>5) The effect of E2 on hematopoiesis is inconsistent throughout the manuscript. e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F, E2</xref> significantly increases platelets. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, E2</xref> has no effect on platelets. It is unclear how robust the effect of E2 is.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> is missing.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;ERα promotes murine hematopoietic regeneration through the Ire1α-mediated unfolded protein response&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We performed our CRISPR electroporation protocol outlined in our previously published manuscript (Gundry et al., 2016). Briefly, RNP complexes are assembled by co-incubating Cas9 protein and either 1 or 2 sgRNAs (Rosa26 and Ire1α respectively), and then delivered to LSKs via electroporation. We then sorted single LSKs into 96 well plates of methylcellulose medium to allow for colony formation. Clones were isolated and genomic DNA was profiled using Sanger sequencing. We then used a decomposition algorithm (TIDE) specifically designed to identify and quantify the major mutations at projected cut sites. The results of this analysis are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>. We found that a large percentage (&gt;75%) of clones contained a mutation using this approach. Of those that were edited, one-third contained a large deletion consisting of an ablation of the DNA between the two sgRNA sites. The remaining colonies contained 1-4bp indels that were characterized as homozygous, heterozygous, or undetermined. Given the highly efficient editing of our technique, combined with our immunoblot results showing significant reduction in total Ire1α protein levels using this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), we concluded that this technique is sufficient for use in investigating the role of Ire1α in HSPCs.</p><p>In regards to the issue of whether “bulk” edited cells without selection of edited cells could be used to study the function of genes, we note that recent studies have used a similar “bulk” approach as we did. For example, Michael Kharas and colleagues deleted METTL3 from leukemia cell lines without selecting clones, and observed that METTL3 deletion reduced proliferation and survival in the bulk cell population (Nature Medicine. 23:1369). Ken Anderson and colleagues deleted KDM6B from multiple myeloma cells and observed reduced growth and survival of these cells (Leukemia. 31:2661).</p><p>Additionally, CRISPR dropout screens that have brought important insights into various area of biology depends on the principle that “bulk” edited cells with heterogeneous mutation profiles, even including some unedited cells, could be used to observe phenotypic changes, such as survival or gene expression changes (for example, Cell. 163:1515, Science. 350:1096, Cell Reports. 17:1193). These screens are performed by selecting cells that have been transduced with sgRNA libraries, but not by selecting clones with verified knockout efficiencies (Discussed by David Root in Genome Biol. 16: 260.). It is inevitable that the efficiency of knockout based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the key for the success of such screens and other experiments that depend on the phenotypic changes in heterogeneously edited cell population. Our results indicate that we do achieve efficient knockout of Ire1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and observe clear phenotypic changes upon deletion of Ire1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, 6G</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the link between ER and IRE1, please see reviewer 1 point 3 and reviewer 3 point 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Two reviewers brought forth inquiry about the regulation of Ire1α activation on HSPCs. We started by investigating the changes that occur to the global chromatin landscape in hematopoietic precursor cells using ATACseq. Using bioinformatics analyses, we identified differentially regulated peaks in Oil- and E2-treated HSCs, and discovered that differential ATAC-seq peaks in E2-treated HSCs are enriched for estrogen response elements (ERE). One of the E2-specific ATAC peak was found upstream of Ern1 (which encodes for Ire1α) and contained a consensus ERE. To determine if this region was sufficient to activate Ire1α expression, we cloned the upstream regulatory region of Ire1α into a luciferase dual reporter assay and found that luciferase activity increased in an E2- and ERα-dependent manner. This activity depended on ERE since mutating the ERE ablated the transactivation property of this sequence. Finally, we performed ChIP-qPCR to test whether ERα occupies Ire1α upstream locus in HSPCs. We observed an increase in ERα binding at the ERE locus of Ire1α in E2-treated hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results indicate that Ire1α is a direct target of ERα in HSPCs. These data have been compiled into a new section of the manuscript, the results of which can be found in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the effect on target genes, including Myc, please see reviewer 1 point 2 and reviewer 2 point 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We adopted our CRISPR strategy to address the potential relationship between Ire1 and Myc target activation. We cultured CRISPR-edited LSK cells in vitrowith or without exogenous E2 and checked mRNA expression of several Myc targets identified in the GSEA. We first confirmed that Ire1α is induced upon E2 treatment in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), similar to what we observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). E2 induced the expression of several Myc target genes identified by GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-H</xref>). Among these Myc target genes, some of them depended on Ire1α to become induced by E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>), whereas other genes did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-H</xref>). This indicates that some of these target genes are downstream of Ire1α, but the entire Myc target gene set does not behave in this manner. We also note that although GSEA detected global upregulation of Myc target genes, c-Myc, L-Myc, or N-Myc were not induced. Since Myc has a large impact on the expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation (Cell. 151:56-67), it is likely that many stimuli that promote proliferation will exhibit increased “Myc target” expression by GSEA even though those stimuli may not involve Myc.</p><p>An additional question was on the heterogeneity of HSCs, and whether E2 is acting upon a certain subset of HSCs. We addressed this question by using CD150 as a surrogate marker for myeloid-biased HSCs (PNAS. 107:5465,</p><p>Cell Stem Cell. 6:265). We sorted CD150<sup>HI</sup>, CD150<sup>LO</sup>, and CD150<sup>NEG</sup> CD48<sup>-</sup> LSKs from Oil- and E2-treated mice and measured Ire1α expression. Ire1α expression was increased upon E2-treatment equally in each population, suggesting that E2 is not specifically acting on myeloid-biased CD150<sup>HI</sup> HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>).</p><p>These data address the main concerns brought forth by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, there was agreement on the need to further clarify the cell autonomous/non-autonomous action of E2, including a deeper discussion of the consistency of results (see reviewer 1 point 1 and reviewer 3 point 1.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the aforementioned data, we revised the manuscript to address several other comments. Of note, there was discussion regarding the cell autonomous vs. cell non-autonomous action of E2 on HSPCs and an issue of clarifying the consistency of the results. We have revised the text to reflect our position that E2 is acting as a systemically acting extrinsic regulator of HSC function, and removed any claims implying that ERα acts solely on HSCs. Moreover, we performed additional experimental shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and examined how E2 and Ire1α regulates HSPCs recovery in the bone marrow.</p><p>These additional experiments highlight the robustness of E2 as a positive regulator of hematopoietic regeneration. We believe that the new data and revisions have resulted in substantial improvement of the original manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Addressing the other points raised would of course be beneficial; however there is a concern that addressing the two major concerns may require mouse models or time course experiments that might require a longer timeframe of revision than normally allowed by eLife and it is for this reason that we invite you to let us know what timeline you could propose.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors investigate in detail the role and mechanism of action of estrogen stimulation on hematopoietic stem cells, and perform important transplantation experiments that were missed in previous studies.

We have toned down our comments that the effect of E2 is solely dependent on ERα in hematopoietic cells (subsection “Estradiol promotes the regenerative capacity of HSCs”, third and last paragraphs; subsection “Estradiol promotes hematopoietic recovery after irradiation”, first paragraph; subsection “Estradiol accelerates hematopoietic progenitor cell regeneration after ionizing radiation”, last paragraph).

We demonstrated that E2 promotes proliferation of both H2BGFP(high) and H2B-GFP(low) HSCs contains dormant and active HSCs, respectively, suggesting that E2 is not selective on the subtypes of HSCs it acts on.</p><p>To further test whether E2 acts on a particular subpopulation of HSCs, we investigated Ire1α expression HSC subpopulations distinguished by the level of CD150 expression. It has been shown by Derrick Rossi’s group that CD150-high HSCs are enriched for myeloid-biased HSCs, whereas HSCs with lower CD150 expression contain balanced and lymphoid-biased HSCs (PNAS. 107:5465). It is also known that CD150-high HSCs are enriched for those with lower side population (SP) phenotype, which are also more quiescent than the upper SP HSCs (Cell Stem Cell. 6:265). Ire1α expression did not differ between these populations, suggesting that E2 does not specifically act on myeloid-biased CD150-high HSCs. We have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>.</p><p>We also note that although GSEA detected global upregulation of Myc target genes, c-Myc, L-Myc, or N-Myc were not induced. Since Myc has a large impact on the expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation (Cell. 151:56-67), it is likely that many stimuli that promote proliferation will exhibit increased “Myc target” expression by GSEA even though those stimuli may not involve Myc. Additionally, it has been shown that adult HSCs are generally c-Myc-low, but fetal liver HSCs, which are more proliferative than adult HSCs and have extensive self-renewal capacity, have higher Myc expression than adult HSCs (Nature Immunology. 11:207). Interestingly, we found that the expression of Lin28 and Hmga2 are induced in E2-treated adult HSCs. These two genes are highly expressed in fetal liver HSCs compared to adult HSCs and regulate self-renewal (Nature Cell Biology. 15:916, J Exp Med. 213:1497). This raises a possibility that E2 induces a fetal-type self-renewal program in adult HSCs (potentially through Lin28 or Hmga2), paralleling the activation of the cell cycle and increased myeloid reconstitution potential. We hope to test this hypothesis in near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another major point regards the connection between ERα and the UPR. Is Ire1α a direct target of ERα? This could already be known, and therefore mentioned, or checked through bioinformatics analysis of the Ire1α promoter, and ideally a ChiP experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>For the full response, please see response to main concern point #2 above. The revised manuscript includes a new section in which we demonstrate that ERα associates with an upstream locus of Ire1α, highlighting that Ire1α is a direct target of ERα. We used ATAC-Seq to identify differentially regulated regions of accessible chromatin in HSPCs after E2 treatment, and identified a differentially regulated region of the Ire1α upstream region that contained a consensus estrogen response element (ERE). Using a dual luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR assay, we confirmed that this region possesses E2- and ERα-dependent transactivation property, and that ERα occupies this site upon E2 stimulation in HSPCs. These new data are provided in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, I don't see anywhere the gating strategy used to identify HSC and progenitor cell populations. It is very important that these are shown as different gates are used by different research groups and it is easy to be transparent about the gates used, as long as they are consistent throughout the work shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the gating strategy for HSCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The survival experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not really add much to the previous experiment, showing recovery from a lower dose of irradiation. I would either remove the experiment entirely to avoid any reference to letting mice die as an experimental end point, which is unethical, or explain how the mice were humanely monitored.</p></disp-quote><p>We included these experiments because it has been previously established that the main cause of mortality after radiation is due to hematopoietic failure. The survival analysis is a standard assay used in many of the papers we cited in the manuscript that describes factors regulating hematopoietic regeneration after irradiation injury (for example, Nature Medicine. 23, 91–99). We monitored morbidity in accordance to IACUC guidelines for humane endpoints for laboratory animals, and this will be highlighted in the revised text.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their manuscript &quot;ERα promotes hematopoietic regeneration through the IRE1α-mediated unfolded protein response&quot; Nakada et al. provide evidence that estrogen receptor (ER) signaling promotes HSC regeneration following irradiation at least in part due to activation of the Ire1a branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Altogether the hypothesis is interesting and the work is a nice extension of prior studies in this area.</p><p>I have a few major comments relating to improving the quality of the study:</p><p>1) The implication of the data (and prior work from the Morrison lab) is that ER signaling promotes HSC proliferation. As such it would be important to distinguish whether the mechanism by which ER signaling promotes recovery is due to protection from apoptosis (given Annexin V data), proliferation or both, as either mechanism can lead to faster recovery of BM cell numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that both protection from apoptosis and increased proliferation may contribute of the faster recovery of BM cells. Determining the relative contribution of these two processes on BM recovery is a challenge, since we will need to block apoptosis and proliferation of HSPCs separately and examine the consequences of blocking these processes on BM recovery after irradiation. A previous report demonstrated that overexpression of BCl<sup>-</sup>2 substantially blocked apoptosis of BM cells after irradiation, but the BM cell number nonetheless dropped to ~10% of the steady-state level (Blood. 91:2272). Blocking HSC proliferation is also difficult since multiple cyclin/CDKs act redundantly (reviewed in J Cell Biol. 195:709). We modified the text to conclude that E2 promotes HSC proliferation and block IR-induced apoptosis, both of which may contribute to the faster recovery of BM cells, and avoid potential over-interpretation regarding the relative importance of preventing apoptosis vs. promoting proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Along these lines, is UPR directly responsible for increased Myc/E2F gene levels and cell proliferation or vice versa? This can be tested in regenerative conditions using the CRISPR system developed by the authors and would define the epistatic relationship between these important and functionally interleaved gene programs in hematopoietic regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>For the full response to this comment, please main concern point #3 above. We now provide new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-H</xref> showing that some Myc target genes are dependent on Ire1α for the induction after E2 treatment, whereas some other targets do not depend on Ire1α. It is likely that the Myc targets identified in the GSEA are not collectively downstream of Ire1α, and that other Ire1α- or UPR-independent mechanisms are likely to be in play.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Overall a key finding of the paper is the dependence on Ire1α based on CRISPR. To fully substantiate the Ire1α findings to the reader I recommend that the authors show the full timecourse of hematopoietic regeneration following IR such as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and demonstrate by directly interrogating the BM whether similar kinetics of BM and LSK recovery are observed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, at least looking in the donor compartment if not BM as a whole.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this advice. We have performed the analysis of quantifying HSPCs in the bone marrow after transplanting Ire1αedited LSK cells with or without E2 treatment. Whereas E2 treatment increased the frequency of Rosa26-edited LSK cells and myeloid progenitor cells, E2 treatment failed to promote HSPC regeneration when Ire1α was deleted. These results reinforce the idea that E2 promotes hematopoietic regeneration in a manner dependent on Ire1α. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref>. We opted not to perform detailed time course experiment after Rosa26- or Ire1α-editing and transplantation, followed by oil- or E2-treatment, since not only does this experiment use large numbers of mice (please note, that the same recipient mouse cannot be bled on two consecutive time points particularly after irradiation since it increases the mortality rate, requiring multiple cohorts for bleeding at different time points. Also LSK cells are scant before day 14 after TBI) but also because analyzing HSPCs as suggested by this reviewer is a more direct way to examine hematopoietic regeneration. In fact, we observed a much more clear effect of E2 and Ire1α deletion when we analyzed HSPCs as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows sensitization of LSK to stressors; on the flipside does Ire1α KD also abrogate any increases in colony forming activity in LSK, or is the colony forming phenotype only specific to HSCs?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a CFU assay with LSK cells isolated from oil- or E2-treated mice, similar to what we performed for HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We did not see significant effects of E2 on the frequency or the types of colonies formed after E2 treatment when LSK cells were plated, suggesting that the effects of E2 in enhancing the ability of form immature myeloid colonies are specific to HSCs.</p><p>Also, as shown in our previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), left panel black bars, deletion of Ire1α in control LSK cells showed no difference in CFU potential. Thus, Ire1α appears to be more important for colony formation when cells are challenged with proteotoxic stress.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study is an extension of a previous study showing E2 increases HSC proliferation and frequency and erythropoiesis (Nakada et al., 2014), showed E2 increases broad myelopoiesis, and uncovered the mechanistic link between E2 and UPR, a protective mechanism for HSCs (van Galen et al., 2014). They showed that IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR is responsible for E2's effect on HSCs, as deleting IRE1 using CRISPR in LSK cells blunted E2's effect on HSCs.</p><p>1) Non-autonomous UPR refers to the phenomenon that ER stress in one tissue induces UPR in a remote tissue. If the authors claim that what they found here represents an example of non-autonomous UPR, they would need to show that ER stress in ovaries leads to release of E2, which activates UPR in HSCs. However, it does not seem to be the case here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text (Introduction, fourth paragraph and Discussion, last paragraph) to illustrate our viewpoint, which is that E2 is a systemic factor that activates UPR in HSPCs, and removed any claims that implied non-autonomous UPR in HSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The observation that E2 increases myelopoiesis but not lymphopoiesis is interesting. Do myeloid primed HSCs have increased ER stress than lymphoid primed HSCs? The authors propose IRE1 as an underlying mechanism. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, it appears that the effects of E2 and IRE1α are uncoupled. E2 increased WBC but IRE1α deletion had no effect on WBC. E2 had no effect on RBC but IRE1α deletion reduced RBC.</p></disp-quote><p>Using CD150 as a proxy for myeloid- and lymphoid-biased HSCs, we fractionated CD48<sup>-</sup> LSK cells and examined whether Ire1α is induced in a particular subpopulation of HSCs (for example, myeloid-biased CD150-high HSCs). We observed similar increases of Ire1α mRNA levels in HSCs regardless of the CD150 expression levels, suggesting that E2 is not acting upon a subset of the HSC pool. This new data is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>. In regards to the second part of the comment, we included additional replicates to the data illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which allowed for a more robust and convincing interpretation of the data. Importantly, our new results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref> demonstrates that E2 promotes the recovery of immature HSPCs in the bone marrow of recipient mice, and this recovery depends clearly upon Ire1α. We believe that assessing HSPCs is a more direct way to examine hematopoietic regeneration, since the number of blood cells in peripheral blood can be regulated by multiple homeostatic mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors performed RNA-seq and found that UPR genes are upregulated in E2-treated HSCs. Importantly, they showed that the UPR upregulation upon E2 is dependent on ERα. How does E2-ERα upregulate IRE1? Does IRE1 promoter have ERα binding site? Does ERα bind to IRE1 promoter?</p></disp-quote><p>For our full response to this comment, please see main concern point #2 above. As discussed above, we have provided a large amount of new data showing that ERα associates with the upstream region of Ire1α in E2 treated HSPCs. These data are provided in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, what's the editing efficiency? Typically, a pool of CRISPR edited cells do not show knockdown, but need to be selected for single clones that have efficient knockdown. Since the novel aspect of this study is the connection of E2 with UPR and the knockout mouse models for all three branches of UPR are well established, it makes more sense to use the KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>For our full response, please see main concern point #1 above. A clonal analysis of Ire1α-editing efficiency was conducted on LSK cells. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, a</xref> high proportion (~75%) of LSKs are edited using our previously established protocol, consistent with the immunoblotting data provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>. We agree with the reviewer that selecting clones with efficient knockout is a robust strategy to study the effects of gene ablation. Multiple clones should be selected to avoid potential clone-specific phenotypes. This approach is technically difficult to perform with HSPCs, since these cells cannot be maintained for a long period of time, which is needed to select single clones by antibiotics resistance or fluorescent marker expression. Our approach takes advantage of the high efficiency of editing (~75%) in the bulk population, enabling us to examine the phenotypic changes in the bulk population, which has been taken by other groups as well (see response to main concern #1). It is true that there will be a small fraction of cells that were not gene ablated in our approach, which might explain the modest effects we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> of the original manuscript. To address this issue, we have repeated the experiments and we observed statistically significant effects of Ire1α ablation in all three parameters we tested (WBC, RBC, PLT), as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>. As mentioned in response to comment #2, we have added new data showing that E2 promotes the recovery of immature HSPCs in the bone marrow of recipient mice, and this recovery depends clearly upon Ire1α.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The effect of E2 on hematopoiesis is inconsistent throughout the manuscript. e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F, E2</xref> significantly increases platelets. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, E2</xref> has no effect on platelets. It is unclear how robust the effect of E2 is.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have included additional experimental replicates to the figures in question. These additional replicates clarify the effects observed on hematopoietic regeneration. Furthermore, we have analyzed HSPCs in the bone marrow of the recipient mice (reviewer 2, comment 3). These additional data provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref> are in agreement with our findings based on blood cell counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), and demonstrate that E2 enhances recovery of HSPCs in an Ire1α-dependent manner. We postulate that since production of mature cells (such as platelets) involves multiple intermediate cell stages during differentiation and that it is also affected by a variety of homeostatic mechanisms (such as thrombopoietin production by the liver and the kidney), the end output (CBC data) may not be as robust as directly examining HSPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight.
