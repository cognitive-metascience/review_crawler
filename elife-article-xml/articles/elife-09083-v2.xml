However, studies here that couple high-dimensional FACS sorting with large-scale quantitative IgH deep-sequencing demonstrate that B-1a IgH repertoire differs dramatically from the follicular and marginal zone B cells repertoires and is defined by distinct mechanisms. We track B-1a cells from their early appearance in neonatal spleen to their long-term residence in adult peritoneum and spleen. We show that de novo B-1a IgH rearrangement mainly occurs during the first few weeks of life, after which their repertoire continues to evolve profoundly, including convergent selection of certain V(D)J rearrangements encoding specific CDR3 peptides in all adults and progressive introduction of hypermutation and class-switching as animals age. This V(D)J selection and AID-mediated diversification operate comparably in germ-free and conventional mice, indicating these unique B-1a repertoire-defining mechanisms are driven by antigens that are not derived from microbiota.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09083.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09083.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09083.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our immune system protects us by recognizing and destroying invading viruses, bacteria and other microbes. B cells are immune cells that produce protective proteins called antibodies to stop infections. These cells are activated by ‘antigens’, which are fragments of molecules from the microbes or from our own cells. When an antigen binds to a B cell, the cell matures, multiplies and produces proteins called antibodies. These antibodies can bind to the antigen, which marks the microbe for attack and removal by other cells in the immune system.</p><p>Each antibody consists of two ‘heavy chain’ and two ‘light chain’ proteins. B cells are able to produce a large variety of different antibodies due to the rearrangement of the gene segments that encode the heavy and light chains. In mice, there are two kinds of B cells – known as B-1a and B-2 cells – that play different roles in immune responses. B-1a cells have long been known to produce the ‘natural’ antibodies that are present in the blood prior to an infection. On the other hand, B-2 cells produce antibodies that are specifically stimulated by an infection and are better adapted to fighting it. Previous studies have shown that both types of antibodies are required to allow animals to successfully fight the flu virus.</p><p>Here, Yang, Wang et al. used a technique called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (or FACS) and carried out extensive genomic sequencing to study how the B-1a and B-2 populations rearrange their genes to produce heavy chains. This approach made it possible to separate the different types of B cells and then sequence the gene for the heavy chain within the individual cells. The experiments show that the “repertoire” of heavy chains in the antibodies of the B-1a cells is much less random and more repetitive than that of B-2 populations.</p><p>Furthermore, Yang, Wang et al. show that B-1a cells produce and maintain their repertoire of heavy chains in a different way to other B-2 populations. B-1a cells develop earlier and the major genetic rearrangements in the gene that encodes the heavy chain occur within the first few weeks of life. Although the gene rearrangements have mostly stopped by adulthood, the B-1a antibody repertoire continues to evolve profoundly as the B-1a cells divide over the life of the animal. On the other hand, the gene rearrangements that make the heavy chains in the B-2 cells continue throughout the life of the animal to produce the wider repertoire of antibodies found in these cells. In addition, the processes that continue to change the antibody reperotire in the B-1a cells during adulthood do not occur in the B-2 populations.</p><p>Importantly, the these reperotire-changing processes in B-1a cells also occur in mice that have been raised in germ-free conditions, which demonstrates that – unlike other B cells – the repertoire of heavy chains in B-1a cells is not influenced by antigens from microbes. Instead, it is mainly driven by antigens that are expressed by normal cells in the body. These findings open the way to future work aimed at understanding how B-1a cells help to protect us against infection, and their role in autoimmune diseases, where immune cells attack the body’s own healthy cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09083.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09083.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>V(D)J</kwd><kwd>diversify</kwd><kwd>IgH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-Al1076434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herzenberg</surname><given-names>Leonore A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK078938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mazmanian</surname><given-names>Sarkis K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The B-1a cell heavy chain antibody repertoire differs dramatically from the follicular and marginal zone B cell repertoire and is defined by distinct mechanisms driven by self antigens rather than antigens derived from the microbiota.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Follicular B (FOB), marginal zone B (MZB) and B-1a cells are the major mature B cell populations in the mouse. Although these B cell subsets all produce functionally important antibodies, they differ profoundly in function and developmental origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kantor and Herzenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgarth, 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that B-1a cells are efficiently generated during fetal and neonatal life, and are maintained by self-replenishment in adult animals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayakawa et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kantor et al., 1992</xref>). In contrast, both FOB and MZB populations emerge later and are replenished throughout life by <italic>de novo</italic> development from bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Our recent studies show that BM HSC reconstitute FOB and MZB, but fail to reconstitute B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosn et al., 2012</xref>), which are derived from distinct progenitors at embryonic day 9 yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshimoto et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>For each B cell subset, their antibody responses are enabled by the basic processes that generate the immunoglobulin (Ig) structure. Multiple mechanisms contribute to creating the primary Ig heavy (IgH) and light chain (IgL) diversity. For IgH, these include combinatorial assortment of individual variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments, nucleotide(s) trimming in the D-J and V-DJ joining site, and, template-dependent (P-addition) and independent (N-addition) nucleotide(s) insertion at the joined junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yancopoulos and Alt, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkham and Schroeder, 1994</xref>). The V(D)J joining processes define the third IgH complementarity-determining region (CDR3), which often lies at the center of antigen binding site and plays a crucial role in defining antibody specificity and affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Davis, 2000</xref>).</p><p>After encountering antigen, “‘naïve”’ B cells are activated and can further diversify their primary antibody repertoire by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)–mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM), which introduces single or multiple mutations into the IgV regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagner and Neuberger, 1996</xref>). SHM commonly occurs in germinal centers (GC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012</xref>), where memory B cells expressing high affinity antibodies are selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajewsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gitlin et al., 2014</xref>). Since the antigen-driven SHM-mediated secondary Ig diversification is viewed as a crucial adaptation to the environmental needs, the IgH repertoire(s) expressed by FOB, MZB and B-1a cells from non-immunized animals are thought to be free of SHM. Our studies here, however, introduce a previously unrecognized SHM mechanism that increasingly diversifies the B-1a pre-immune IgH repertoire as animals age. Importantly, the SHM operates equally in the presence or absence of microbiota influence.</p><p>The B-1a antibody repertoire is commonly thought to be ‘restricted’ with expressing germline genes, largely because the hybridomas generated from fetal and neonatal B cells, which are mainly B-1a, have few N-insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlsson and Holmberg, 1990</xref>) and preferentially express the proximal 7183, Q52 V<sub>H</sub> family genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perlmutter et al., 1985</xref>). The N diversity deficit is ascribed to the absence of expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (<italic>Tdt</italic>), which adds the N nucleotides to the CDR3 junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilfillan et al., 1993</xref>), during fetal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feeney, 1990</xref>). These early studies left the impression that the proximal V<sub>H</sub> gene usage predominates and that there is little N-addition in the B-1a IgH repertoire.</p><p>Later studies by the Rajewsky group, however, showed that although neonatal (4 day) splenic B-1a cells contain very few N-insertions, N addition is readily detected in substantial numbers of peritoneal B-1a cells from adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 1990</xref>), indicating that B-1a cells are continuously generated after <italic>Tdt</italic> is expressed. Holmberg lab similarly found the low N-region diversity in the adult peritoneal B-1a repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tornberg and Holmberg, 1995</xref>). Our early studies confirm and extend these findings by showing that roughly two thirds of the IgH sequences from individually sorted peritoneal B-1a cells have N additions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kantor et al. 1997</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that B-1a progenitors from both fetal liver and adult BM sources generate peritoneal B-1a cells with substantial N-addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holodick et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the peritoneal B-1a IgH repertoire diversity is greater than previously thought.</p><p>However, these studies mainly characterized the repertories of B cells in the peritoneal cavity (PerC) and leave the questions open as to whether and how the repertoire changes throughout ontogeny in B cells at various sites of development and function. Studies here address these issues. We show that the B-1a IgH repertoire differs drastically from the repertories expressed by splenic FOB, MZB and peritoneal B-2 cells. In addition, we track the development of B-1a cells from their early appearance in neonatal spleen to their long-term residence in adult peritoneum and spleen, and elucidate the previous unrecognized somatic mechanisms that select and diversify the B-1a IgH repertoire over time. Most importantly, the potent mechanisms that uniquely act in B-1a (not in FOB and MZB cells) operate comparably in germ-free (GF) and conventional mice reared under specific pathogen free (SPF) condition, indicating that these repertoire-defining mechanisms are not driven by microbiota-derived antigens.</p><p>The dearth of these advanced understandings in the previous studies is largely due to technical difficulties that limited both their scope and depth. Studies analyzing Ig sequences from immortalized cell lines (e.g., hybridomas) or LPS-stimulated B cells had obvious sampling biases. In addition, earlier studies mainly focused on particular V<sub>H</sub> families (e.g., J558, 7183), even though the mouse IgH locus contains over 100 functional V<sub>H</sub> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkham and Schroeder, 1994</xref>). The introduction of single cell analyses enabled higher precision and lower bias than the bulk measurements. However, they were constrained profoundly by sequencing costs and technical challenges. Indeed, our previous single cell analysis reported only 184 IgH sequences derived from 85% recovered sorted single cells representative of three types of peritoneal B subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kantor et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, while the data yielded key insights, hundreds or thousands of single cells would need to be analyzed to obtain a more comprehensive view for a single B subset repertoire. Finally, difficulties in defining and cleanly sorting rare B subsets (e.g., splenic B-1a) further compromise the attempt to develop a thorough view of repertoire(s) expressed by various B cell subsets at the different anatomic location and ontogenic stage.</p><p>To overcome these obstacles, we have coupled high-dimensional (Hi-D) FACS sorting with unique IgH multiplex PCR technologies, which allow inclusive amplification of IgH transcripts for each sorted B subset and ultimate sequencing of these sequences. Using barcoded sample multiplexing, we have performed a large-scale quantitative and comparative study of the ‘pre-immune’ IgH repertoires expressed by various functionally and developmentally distinct mature B subsets (splenic FOB, MZB and B-1a; peritoneal B-2 and B-1a) from non-immune C57BL/6J mice. In addition, since microbiota are often thought to influence the Ig repertoire, we have compared the B-1a IgH repertoires in GF or conventional mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The B-1a pre-immune IgH repertoire is far more restricted and repetitive than the repertoire expressed by FOB and MZB subsets</title><p>We sorted splenic and peritoneal B-1a (dump<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> CD93<sup>-</sup>IgM<sup>hi</sup> IgD<sup>lo/-</sup> CD21<sup>-/lo</sup> CD23<sup>-</sup> CD43<sup>+</sup> CD5<sup>+</sup>); splenic FOB and peritoneal B-2 (dump<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> CD93<sup>-</sup> IgM<sup>lo</sup> IgD<sup>hi</sup> CD23<sup>+</sup> CD43<sup>-</sup> CD5<sup>-</sup>); and splenic MZB (dump<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> CD93<sup>-</sup> IgM<sup>hi</sup> IgD<sup>lo/-</sup> CD21<sup>hi</sup> CD23<sup>lo/-</sup> CD43<sup>-</sup> CD5<sup>-</sup>) from non-immune C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

were too few B-1a cells to reliably sequence with our method. In essence, FACS analysis of embryonic day 19 (E19) fetal liver cells shows that IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells represent only 0.6% of CD19<sup>+</sup> total B cells and that only around 20% of these IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells express the B-1a CD43<sup>+</sup> CD5<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The frequencies of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell in E18 fetal liver are even lower (0.2% of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells). These numbers are too low for us to recover enough material for sequencing from a feasible number of embryos.</p><p>The IgH CDR3 tree maps for each B cell subset show that splenic FOB and peritoneal B-2 cells express highly diversified IgH CDR3 nucleotide sequences, as do MZB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, CDR3 nucleotide sequences expressed by B-1a cells from either spleen or PerC are far less diverse and recur much more frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The recurrent CDR3 sequences include the well-studied V<sub>H</sub>11-encoded sequences specific for phosphatidylcholine (PtC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and known to occur frequently in B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mercolino et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardy et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seidl et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>D50 metric analysis quantifying the IgH CDR3 nucleotide sequence diversity shows that the IgH CDR3 nucleotide sequences expressed by the FOB and MZB subsets are significantly more diverse than those expressed by splenic and peritoneal B-1a cells (p = 0.0002, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this finding, IgH CDR3 peptide pairwise sharing analysis, which measures the similarity of IgH CDR3 peptide expression for each B cell subset sorted from different mice, shows that the same CDR3 peptide sequences frequently appear in both splenic and peritoneal B-1a cells from different mice whereas the common CDR3 peptides are rare in FOB and MZB subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the B-1a pre-immune IgH repertoire is far more restricted and repetitive than IgH repertoires expressed by FOB and MZB subsets.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09083.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The B-1a pre-immune IgH repertoire is far more restricted than the pre-immune IgH repertoires expressed by splenic FOB, MZB and peritoneal B-2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) D50 metric analysis quantifying the IgH CDR3 diversity for B cell subsets from mice at the indicated age.

We have since corrected this problem so that V<sub>H</sub>12-3 primer is now part of our new set of primers. Comparison of sequence data obtained with old vs. the new set of primers shows that, aside from now detecting V<sub>H</sub>12-3 sequences with the new set of primers, the sequences obtained with both primer sets are highly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09083.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09083.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09083-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09083.010</object-id><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>V<sub>H</sub> gene usage profile pair-wise comparison of B cell groups.</title><p>The colors shown at the bottom right distinguish the B cell groups (n = 4-9).

Importantly, the class-switched Ig (mainly IgG3, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgA) represents a significantly higher proportion of the mutated sequences than of the non-mutated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>), indicating that the increased SHM with age in the splenic B-1a IgH repertoire is accompanied by increased class-switching. However, despite the increased class switching among mutated sequences, the frequency of class-switched sequences appears not to correlate with the increased number of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Since all of the cell preparation, staining and sorting were performed equivalently for all samples, our finding that the class-switched transcripts were selectively and predominantly detected in splenic B-1a cells from 4–6 month old mice argues that the detection of these transcripts is not due to contamination or other technical problems.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The V(D)J selection and AID-mediated diversification that uniquely act in B-1a IgH repertoire operate comparably in germ-free and conventional mice</title><p>The microbiota are often thought to participate in shaping the repertoire of ‘natural’ antibodies, which is largely produced by B-1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarth et al., 2005</xref>).

i.e., the frequency of mutated sequences and the mutation rate are comparable under two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,E</xref>). Indeed, AID introduces mutations into the identical V(D)J sequences expressed by splenic B-1a cells from either SPF or GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Finally, similar to SPF mice, AID-mediated class-switch occurs comparably in splenic B-1a cells from GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Since the V(D)J selection, hypermutation and class-switching operate comparably in splenic B-1a from GF and SPF mice, we conclude that the somatic mechanisms that select and diversify B-1a IgH repertoire over time are not driven by microbiota-derived antigens.</p><p>Nevertheless, the environment has a strong impact on the isotype representation. IgA transcripts are readily detected in splenic B-1a from 4–6 month old SPF mice; however, these transcripts are minimally detected in the splenic B-1a from age-matched GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>). This finding is consistent with the recognition that class-switching to IgA is strongly associated with the presence of gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroese et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macpherson et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies presented here open a new perspective on the origin and breadth of humoral immunity that protect against invading pathogens and regulate autoimmunity. Recent studies have already shown B-1a develops prior to and independent from BM HSC, which fail to generate B-1a but fully constitute FOB and MZB compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshimoto et al., 2011</xref>). Cohering the fundamental difference in their development origin, our studies reveal two distinct IgH repertoires that develop at different times and are shaped by distinct functional mechanisms.</p><p>The first of these repertoires is expressed in B-1a cells. The <italic>de novo</italic> IgH rearrangements in this repertoire occur mainly during the first few weeks of age and largely cease thereafter. Then B-1a cells persist as a self-replenishing population. The B-1a repertoire, however, continues to evolve under stringent selection. Thus, certain V(D)J sequences increase with age, and certain V(D)J nucleotide sequences gradually emerge as the predominant recombinations encoding the specific CDR3 peptides in all adults. Furthermore, the age-dependent V(D)J selection coincides with the progressive introduction of IgV<sub>H</sub> mutation and increased class-switch. Importantly, the V(D)J selection and AID-mediated diversification occur comparably in <italic>germ-free</italic> and conventional mice, indicating that these unique repertoire-defining mechanisms are not driven by microbiota-derived antigens.</p><p>In contrast, MZB, FOB and peritoneal B-2 cells develop later, and continuously develop <italic>de novo</italic> from BM HSC throughout life and express drastically different IgH repertoire(s). Their IgH repertoires tend to preferentially utilize V1 (J558) family, are far more diverse and less repetitive and, unlike B-1a cells, show no apparent selection for particular V(D)J recombination sequences and do not show IgV<sub>H</sub> mutation and class-switch. In essence, AID introduces SHM and CSR in these B cell subsets only when they respond to their cognate antigens that are largely exogenous in nature.</p><p>These findings were enabled by employing the amplicon-rescued multiplex PCR technology, which allows the capture and amplification of Ig transcripts from a given B cell population in an inclusive and quantitative fashion. Specifically, the first RT-PCR reaction, which uses an array of gene-specific primers for almost all V<sub>H</sub> families and all constant (C<sub>H</sub>) genes, is carried out only for a few cycles. The second round of PCR is then carried out with communal primers that recognize the unique sequences tagged into each of the V<sub>H</sub> and C<sub>H</sub> primers. Since these ‘tag sequences’ were already introduced during the initial cycles, the use of the communal primers assures that all of the targets are amplified with reduced bias during the following exponential phase of amplification. Coupled with the next generation sequencing, our method is quite robust and allows detection of diverse Ig transcripts that collectively carry about 100 V<sub>H</sub> genes associated with different isotypes.</p><p>As with other bulk RNA sequence measurement, our methods cannot determine the absolute number of each Ig transcript in a given B cell population. Hence the actual number of cells expressing a certain Ig sequence is unknown. In addition, our methods do not allow determination of whether certain sequences associated with distinct isotypes belong to the same cell. Further, since the Ig transcript copy number variation among cells is unknown, the frequency of a given Ig transcript is roughly viewed as the relative index of the frequency of cells expressing this Ig transcript. This assumption is generally valid since our studies exclude plasmablast and plasma cells, which do not express surface CD5. Since B-1a cells are well-known to undergo self-replenishment in adult, the dramatic increase in certain V(D)J sequences in the B-1a IgH repertoire over time likely reflects the expansion of cells expressing this particular V(D)J sequence.</p><p>Single cell sequencing analysis has advantages in reducing technical bias and in enabling paired IgH/IgL sequencing. Nevertheless, sequencing costs are still a big hurdle to the large-scale single cell analysis, which, as our studies demonstrate, is necessary to develop a comprehensive view of the various B cell subset repertoires. Therefore, at least for the present, our approaches are more efficient and practical.</p><p>B-1a produce ‘natural’ antibodies, many of which recognize endogenous (self) antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarth et al., 2005</xref>) and play house-keeping roles in clearing the cellular debris or metabolic wastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binder and Silverman, 2005</xref>). Since the natural antibodies can also react/cross-react with microorganism-derived antigens, they also participate in the first line of immune defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ochsenbein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgarth et al., 2000</xref>). Germ-free mice have normal levels of circulating ‘natural’ IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bos et al., 1989</xref>). Earlier immunologists have postulated that the natural antibody repertoire is selected by endogenous (self) antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jerne, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coutinho et al., 1995</xref>). Our studies, which demonstrate that B-1a IgH repertoire (hence the re-activities of natural antibodies) is highly similar between individual adult C57BL/6 mice, regardless of whether the animals are reared in conventional or germ-free facilities, introduce the solid evidence supporting this argument.</p><p>Our studies also demonstrate that the B-1a IgH repertoire is selected over time. Thus, recurrent V(D)J sequences appear later, and most of the V(D)J sequences that are selected to be conserved in all individuals do not emerge until the animals reach the adulthood. As a result, the sequence composition of B-1a IgH repertoire in adult mice becomes much less random than that expressed in neonate and younger mice. Furthermore, the convergent selection of a particular V(D)J recombination sequence encoding a specific CDR3 peptide indicates that the selection is strikingly precise and occurs at both the protein and the nucleotide level.</p><p>Unexpectedly, our studies find that both SHM and CSR participate in diversifying the B-1a IgH repertoire. However, unlike GC response SHM, which occurs within a few days following antigenic stimulation, SHM in B-1a IgV<sub>H</sub> starts after weaning and is cumulative with age. The progressive increase in the SHM is also associated with increased class switching. Most importantly, SHM and CRS occur comparably in <italic>germ-free</italic> and conventional mice, indicating that SHM and CSR in the B-1a primary IgH repertoire are not driven by microbiota-derived antigen. Since B-1a cells are well-known to produce anti-self antibodies, stimulation by endogenous antigens is likely the major driving force for the AID-mediated diversification processes.</p><p>Ongoing SHM in the absence of external antigens influence have been reported in sheep B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reynaud et al., 1995</xref>). The accumulation of SHM in B-1a IgV<sub>H</sub> over time likely represents a similar strategy to further diversify their restricted Ig repertoire as animal age. Such diversification may potentiate defenses against newly encountered pathogens. However, the age-dependent accumulative SHM, which is likely driven by self-antigens, may also increase the risk of autoimmune disease due to pathogenic high affinity auto-reactive antibodies. Indeed, deregulated B-1a growth have been reported in NZB/W mice, where autoantibody-associated autoimmune disease develops as animal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayakawa et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p>AID-mediated mutagenesis in B-1a IgV<sub>H</sub> may occasionally introduce mutations elsewhere in the genome that facilitate dysregulated growth and neoplastic transformation, e.g., B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stall et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kipps et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phillips and Raveche, 1992</xref>). Although the mechanism by which the IgM<sup>+</sup> splenic B-1a cells from older mice express class-switched Ig transcripts remains elusive, this finding suggests that certain cells are undergoing vigorous genetic alteration that may share the similar mechanisms that underlie the malignant transformation. In fact, cells with simultaneous expression IgM and class-switched Ig transcripts have been reported in B-CLL and other B cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oppezzo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinashi et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>The splenic and peritoneal B-1a IgH repertoires show similar characteristics. Both repertoires become more restricted with age with increased recurrent V(D)J sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and retain the positive selected V(D)J sequences in adult animals. However, our studies reveal the key repertoire differences between B-1a cells at their two native locations. Although both repertoires show extensive CDR3 sharing among individual mice, the peritoneal B-1a IgH repertoire is more similar to neonatal splenic B-1a repertoire and shows a significantly higher level of CDR3 peptide sharing among individual mice than the splenic B-1a repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, the peritoneal B-1a IgH repertoire is more biased in using V6-6 (J606), V9-3 (Vgam3.8), V2-9 (Q52) and V2-6-8 (Q52), which are preferentially expressed in splenic B-1a from neonate and younger mice.</p><p>These findings suggest that peritoneal B-1a cells are enriched for cells that are generated during neonatal and young age of life, thus are largely consist of cells migrated from spleen into PerC when the animals were younger. This argument is further supported by the findings that the frequencies of mutated sequences in the peritoneal B-1a cells from 4-6 month old mice are substantially lower and the mutations are mainly single nucleotide changes whereas a proportion of IgH sequences with multiple mutations is detected in splenic B-1a cells from the same aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>MZB and B-1a share many phenotypic and functional characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Kearney, 2001</xref>). Our studies show that the MZB IgH repertoire differs drastically from the B-1a IgH repertoire, but is very similar to the repertoires expressed by splenic FOB and peritoneal B-2. Since MZB and FOB cells are mainly derived from BM HSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosn et al., 2012</xref>), there findings collectively support the idea that these B cells belong to the same (i.e.,B-2) developmental lineage. Nevertheless, the MZB repertoires from individual mice contain substantially higher levels of common CDR3 sequences (peptides) than the splenic FOB and peritoneal B-2 repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Years ago, we postulated that B-1a and B-2 B cells belong to distinct developmental lineages that are evolved sequentially to play complementary roles in immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herzenberg and Herzenberg, 1989</xref>). The sequence data presented here, which reveal the key distinctions in the repertoires as well as the repertoire-defining mechanisms between B-1a and B-2 subsets, support this argument and greatly extend our earlier version. These key distinctions provide the genetic bases for their well-known fundamental functional difference between B-1a and other B subsets. In particular, they are central to vaccine development, where the recognition that the B cells have distinct targeting antibody repertoires clearly invites attention. In addition, our findings offer insights in understanding the origins and behaviors of B cell neoplasms, particularly B-CLL, and the autoimmune diseases in which over production of autoantibodies is implicated in the pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

RT-PCR reactions were conducted using a set of sequence specific primers covering almost all of mouse V<sub>H</sub> genes (forward primers) and constant C<sub>H</sub> primers covering all of isotypes (reverse primers). Illumina paired-end sequencing communal primer B is linked to each forward V<sub>H</sub> primer. Illumina paired-end sequencing communal primer A and a barcode sequence of 6 nucleotides are linked to each reverse C<sub>H</sub> primers. In brief, cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA sample using mixture of forward V<sub>H</sub> and reverse C<sub>H</sub> primers and reagents from the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The first round of PCR was performed at: 50°C, 40 minutes; 95°C, 15 min; 94°C, 30 s, 58°C, 2 min, 72°C, 30 s, for 15 cycles; 94°C, 30 s, 72°C, 2 min, for 10 cycles; 72°C, 10 min. After the first round of PCR, primers were removed by Exonuclease I digestion at 37°C for 30 min (New England Biolabs, lpswich, MA). Then 2 μL of the first-round PCR products were used as templates for the second round of amplification using communal A and B primers and reagents from the Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen). The second round PCR was performed as: 95°C, 15 min; 94°C, 30 s, 55°C, 30 s, 72°C, 30 s, for 40 cycles; 72°C, 5 min. About 400bp long PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The IgH libraries were pooled and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq pair-end read-length platform. The output of IgH sequence covers CDR2, CDR3 and the beginning of the constant region.

Trimmed pair-end reads were joined together through overlapping alignment with a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. If paired forward and reverse reads in the overlapping region were not perfectly matched, both forward and reverse reads were thrown out without further consideration.

Two sequence reads were considered related if the best mapped V<sub>H</sub> sequences are related and the CDR3 segments have less than 1 mismatch. If two sequences are related and the frequency of the minor one is less than 5% of the dominant one, the minor one is removed from further consideration. In addition, single copy CDR3s are removed from further consideration.</p><p>To allow multiplexing of multiple samples in a single sequence run, C<sub>H</sub> primers were linked with barcodes containing 6 different nucleotides. The barcode C<sub>H</sub> primers were used in a first round RT-PCR. To compensate for potential in chemical synthetic, PCR and/or sequencing error, barcodes were designed with a Hamming distance ≥3. Given that the chemical synthetic error is roughly 5% per position, there is about a 1/8000 chance that one barcode is mistakenly synthesized as another barcode.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the reviewers, Harry Schroeder, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript compares the IgH repertoires of mouse B-1a and conventional B cells from postnatal day 2 to adulthood using Hi-D FACS sorting, multiplex PCR, and deep sequencing. The data provide a detailed view of the global B-1a IgH repertoire diversity, and demonstrate its continuing generation and selection during the animal's lifetime. Remarkably, the data show that B-1a B cells, like conventional B cells, undergo AID-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) and Ig class switch recombination (CSR), yet, microbiota play no substantive role in either repertoire selection, SHM or CSR in B-1a B cells in contrast to conventional B cells. The manuscript thus represents a substantial contribution to B-1a B cell biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript treats B-1a B cells as originating in the neonatal spleen, but makes no effort to examine the IgH repertoire in immature B cells of the fetal liver (as distinct from bone marrow) vis-a-vis the later B-1a repertoire. Both positive and negative results from such a comparison would be informative.</p><p>2) The observation that the IgH repertoire of B-1a cells in adult mice contain a high frequency of TdT-dependent N nucleotide additions suggests that a large fraction of B-1a cells in adult mice are of postnatal and not fetal origin. However, this observation is consistent either with self-renewal of the cells that were generated during the first weeks after birth or with continuous output from the bone marrow, possibilities that cannot be discriminated based on the presented data. The interpretation in the manuscript suggesting that postnatal de novo B-1a B cell development only occurs during the first few weeks of life but not thereafter thus needs to be appropriately modified. In fact, the striking finding that B-1a cells in adult animals show a very high frequency of postnatal N nucleotide addition requires highlighting.</p><p>3) The manuscript argues that the germ-free mouse data indicate that there is an endogenous antigen-driven selection program at work, but does not rule out food antigens as sources for this selection. In the absence of data from antigen-free mice, this interpretation would best be appropriately modified as showing an absence of a role for microbiota rather than a definitive role for 'endogenous' antigens alone.</p><p>4) In the pairwise sharing analysis of IgH CDR3 sequences comparing various B cell subsets of individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), splenic B-1a cells from very young mice (day 2-7) show very high CDR3 sharing. However, since 'each dot represents the data for a sample from an individual mouse except for the day 2 splenic B-1a data, which are derived from sorted cells pooled from 8 mice', it is conceivable that the very high CDR3 sequence sharing is an artifact of comparing samples of 8 mice with each other instead of individual mice like for the other developmental time points. This needs to be clarified, with exclusion of the data points of the 2-7-day-old mice if necessary. Also, the measurement of the CDR3 sequence sharing and the exact nature of the values plotted should be better explained in the text.</p><p>5) The nomenclature of VH genes used throughout the manuscript is undefined, and needs to be clarified.</p><p>6) VH11-2/Vk9-128 and VH12-3/Vk4-91 are the two most dominant PtC-binding BCRs in the IgH repertoire of B-1a cells. The authors discuss only the VH11-2 specificity, and V(D)J rearrangements involving VH12-3 segment are not even listed among conserved CDR3 sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). It would be useful to comment on this and clarify if this is related to technical issues and limitations.</p><p>7) A conclusion in the Results section that '...since SHM in splenic B-1a IgVH initiates later and progresses with age, these findings suggest that peritoneal B-1a in older animals are largely derived from B-1a that have migrated from the spleen when the animals were younger' while a tenable and interesting hypothesis, belongs in the Discussion, since other scenarios remain possible.</p><p>8) While germ-free mouse data are shown all along, they are only addressed at the end. This is confusing and reorganization would be useful.</p><p>9) The tree-map plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> highlight the repertoire biases in B-1a cells in a very intuitive way. However, with randomly assigned colors, it is impossible to trace the same specificity even across panels of the same figure – yet this is crucial for following the story. It would be advisable to add numbers to the symbols of the most highly reoccurring CDR3 sequences and correlate the numbers with the actual VH gene segments at the bottom of the figure.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> requires radical revisions to reduce complexity by retaining key components of FO and B-1a B cell comparisons in the main figure and moving some components to supplementary data, rectifying invisible X-axis labels and VH gene labels. Also, the fact that the data in this figure are presented 'as the normalized distribution, which counts the value of each distinct CDR3 nucleotide sequence expressing a given VH gene as one, no matter how many of this sequence are detected' needs to be included in the text as well for the sake of clarity.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> needs restructuring so that its panel order follows the text. Also, it is not clear where the graphical representation of B-1a cells from AID-null mice, mentioned in the text, is shown in this figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>12) Generally, figure contents need to be comprehensively edited for readability. Similarly, the text needs proofreading as well. The Discussion could also use editing to avoid repetitions and digressions into peripheral issues such as the evolutionary origins of B-1a B cell lineage, which are not directly addressed by the present data.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09083.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript treats B-1a B cells as originating in the neonatal spleen, but makes no effort to examine the IgH repertoire in immature B cells of the fetal liver (as distinct from bone marrow) vis-a-vis the later B-1a repertoire. Both positive and negative results from such a comparison would be informative.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers, we believe, are referring to our statement in the manuscript Abstract and Introduction that “we track B-1a cells from their origin in neonatal spleen...” We appreciate this comment by the reviewers since the wording we used is not what we meant. We apologize for this confusion. The correct wording is “we track B-1a cells from their early appearance in neonatal spleen”.</p><p>Actually, our laboratory is working quite intensively on the origin of B-1a cells and has shown that they arise from progenitors distinct from the progenitors that give rise to B-2 cells. We are now nearing publication of a paper tracing the B-1a progenitors in the embryo to a considerably earlier time-point than neonatal spleen.</p><p>In addition, we agree with the reviewers that it would be quite informative to compare the repertoire expressed by the immature (not fully developed) B cells in the fetal liver with the repertoire of the mature B-1a in neonates and adults. However, our methods do not give us this option. That is, we are not sequencing genomic DNA, which could be recovered equally from mature and immature B cells. Instead, we are sequencing mature IgH message, which is expected to be present, if at all, only in a very small proportion of immature B cells, whether in adult bone marrow or fetal liver.</p><p>Basically, there are too few mature IgM + B cells in fetal liver for reliable IgH sequencing with current methods. In our study, we harvested late fetal liver just prior to birth (E19) and examined the B cell development by FACS. We found that the IgM + B cells (i.e., those that have completed IgH V(D)J recombination) are detectable only at very low frequencies (0.6% of CD19 + total B cells) of which only 20% express the mature B-1a CD43 + CD5 + phenotype (see FACS plots at right). The IgM + B cell frequencies are even lower in E18 fetal liver (0.2% of CD19 + B cells; data not shown). These numbers are too low for us to obtain enough material for sequencing from a feasible number of embryos.</p><p>We will be happy to include the Figure in our paper as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> if the editors wish. It responds to a question that we feel many readers may also have.</p><p><italic>2) The observation that the IgH repertoire of B-1a cells in adult mice contain a high frequency of TdT-dependent N nucleotide additions suggests that a large fraction of B-1a cells in adult mice are of postnatal and not fetal origin. However, this observation is consistent either with self-renewal of the cells that were generated during the first weeks after birth or with continuous output from the bone marrow, possibilities that cannot be discriminated based on the presented data. The interpretation in the manuscript suggesting that postnatal de novo B-1a B cell development only occurs during the first few weeks of life but not thereafter thus needs to be appropriately modified. In fact, the striking finding that B-1a cells in adult animals show a very high frequency of postnatal N nucleotide addition requires highlighting.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers that based on the information we provided, it is hard to distinguish the possibilities between the self-renewal of B-1a cells and their de novo generation from the bone marrow. This uncertainty, however, is due to our failure to clearly state in the manuscript that the N-nucleotide distribution profile that we present is based on normalized data. We use normalized data because it specifically minimizes the impact of B-1a self-replenishment on the overall N-insertion distribution profile, and hence weights the repertoire for de novo generated sequences. Thus, we score each distinct IgH sequence containing the indicated N nucleotide insertions as a single sequence, regardless how many times this sequence was detected. We have clarified this part in the text of the Result section “The B-1a IgH repertoire integrates rearrangement from de novo B-1a development that occur mainly during the first a few weeks of life” of the manuscript to make the data more understandable.</p><p>In addition, as the reviewers requested, our modified manuscript now highlights our finding that B-1a cells in adult animals show a very high frequency of N nucleotide additions, which indicates that the majority of the B-1a cells are actually generated postnatally after Tdt is expressed.</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript argues that the germ-free mouse data indicate that there is an endogenous antigen-driven selection program at work, but does not rule out food antigens as sources for this selection. In the absence of data from antigen-free mice, this interpretation would best be appropriately modified as showing an absence of a role for microbiota rather than a definitive role for 'endogenous' antigens alone.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that the food antigens cannot be ruled out as the sources for the selection in our studies. However, we believe that self-antigens are likely to be the major driving force, if only because B-1a cells are well-known to produce anti-self antibodies. We agree that food antigens may mimic self, or vice versa. Nevertheless, Occam’s razor suggests that the minimal hypothesis, i.e., stimulation by self-antigen, rather than microbiota, is likely the major influence on the selection of the B-1a repertoire. We have revised our manuscript to reflect this point.</p><p><italic>4) In the pairwise sharing analysis of IgH CDR3 sequences comparing various B cell subsets of individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), splenic B-1a cells from very young mice (day 2-7) show very high CDR3 sharing. However, since 'each dot represents the data for a sample from an individual mouse except for the day 2 splenic B-1a data, which are derived from sorted cells pooled from 8 mice', it is conceivable that the very high CDR3 sequence sharing is an artifact of comparing samples of 8 mice with each other instead of individual mice like for the other developmental time points. This needs to be clarified, with exclusion of the data points of the 2-7-day-old mice if necessary. Also, the measurement of the CDR3 sequence sharing and the exact nature of the values plotted should be better explained in the text.</italic> </p><p>In responding to the concern raised by the reviewers, we have excluded the data of the day 2 sample from the CDR3 pairwise sharing analysis. The amended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> now shows data from which the day 2 sample is excluded. In addition, as per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added a detailed explanation for CDR3 pair-wise sharing analysis.</p><p><italic>5) The nomenclature of VH genes used throughout the manuscript is undefined, and needs to be clarified.</italic> </p><p>The nomenclature of IgH V, D, J genes used in this study is based on IMGT IgH gene nomenclature. We have made this statement in the paper to clarify this issue.</p><p><italic>6) VH11-2/Vk9-128 and VH12-3/Vk4-91 are the two most dominant PtC-binding BCRs in the IgH repertoire of B-1a cells. The authors discuss only the VH11-2 specificity, and V(D)J rearrangements involving VH12-3 segment are not even listed among conserved CDR3 sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). It would be useful to comment on this and clarify if this is related to technical issues and limitations.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers correctly pointed out, the sequence data we presented do not contain VH12-3 encoded sequences. The absence of these VH12-3-encoded sequences is due to a technical limitation of the methods we used. In essence, when we designed the primers for VH gene families about three years ago, we inappropriately overlooked the VH12 reference gene and only included a primer for VH12-1 gene. Since VH12-1 and VH12-3 differ in the primer-aligning region, the VH12-1 primer does not capture VH12-3-encoded sequence and hence VH12-3 encoded sequences are not included our earlier dataset, which includes the bulk of the data we report in the manuscript.</p><p>We have corrected this problem by adding VH12-3 primer in our new primer sets. While we cannot retroactively correct our initial oversight, we have now noted the problem in the text of the manuscript. We believe that this omission of VH12-3 is not fatal for the data we present. However, relevant to this issue, we have recently completed additional sequencing studies in which we compared the sequence data generated by using old version of primer set with the sequence data generated by using new version of primer set that contains the VH12-3 primer. We found that sequence results for the libraries obtained by using old and new version of primers are highly similar. In fact, the most highly represented reads from the paired data sets are identical in sequence and show similar representation order.</p><p>Specifically, we sorted two splenic B-1a populations individually from two 4 months old C57B/l6 mice. We extracted RNA from each population and divided the RNA from each into two parts. For one part, we prepared an amplified library using the old primer set and for the other, we prepared an amplified library using the new primer set. We then sequenced these amplified IgH libraries. Analysis of the resultant sequences showed that, regardless of the primer set used (old or new), the sequences obtained from the IgH library are highly similar. In essence, the top 10 highly recurring CDR3 sequences (both peptide and V(D)J recombination) are identical between each pair of libraries (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, we detected VH12-3 encoded sequences from the splenic B-1a IgH libraries prepared with the new primer sets, and these VH12-3 encoded sequences included several published PtC-binding VH12-3 encode sequences, i.e., AGDYDGYWYFDV (VH12-3 D2-4 J1), AGDRDGYWYFDV (VH12-3 D3-2 J1), AGDRYGYWYFDV (VH12-3 D2-9 J1).</p><p>The mutation profiles for the libraries prepared by using either old or new primer sets are also highly similar. In two separate comparisons, we detected identical IgH sequences with identical nucleotides substitutions in each library (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7-figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We hope the editor will agree that while there is a clear need to collect VH12-3 data in future studies, the absence of this sequence in our current data is not a fatal flaw. To resolve this issue for the journal readers, we would be pleased to include the comparison data presented here in the supplement data of the manuscript. Importantly, these comparisons also show the reliability of the technology we have developed for this study.</p><p><italic>7) A conclusion in the Results section that '...since SHM in splenic B-1a IgVH initiates later and progresses with age, these findings suggest that peritoneal B-1a in older animals are largely derived from B-1a that have migrated from the spleen when the animals were younger' while a tenable and interesting hypothesis, belongs in the Discussion, since other scenarios remain possible.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewers and have moved this part to the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>8) While germ-free mouse data are shown all along, they are only addressed at the end. This is confusing and reorganization would be useful.</italic> </p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about our decision to show the germ-free data throughout the Results section but to put off discussion of these germ-free data until the last section of the Results, in which we explicitly focus on addressing the germ-free data. We did this to efficiently utilize the space available in the manuscript. If the editor wants to relax this restriction, we will be please to discuss this material in the text when it appears. As an alternate solution, we have added the statement “The data for germ-free animals is discussed at the end of the Results section” to the current table and figure legends.</p><p><italic>9) The tree-map plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> highlight the repertoire biases in B-1a cells in a very intuitive way. However, with randomly assigned colors, it is impossible to trace the same specificity even across panels of the same figure – yet this is crucial for following the story. It would be advisable to add numbers to the symbols of the most highly reoccurring CDR3 sequences and correlate the numbers with the actual VH gene segments at the bottom of the figure.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> by adding numbers to identify the top four highly recurring CDR3 sequences that are shared in splenic B-1a and peritoneal B-1a CDR3 tree-map plots. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, in</xref> which there are many tree-map plots showing recurring CDR3 sequences, we added a supplementary table in which we list the top ten CDR3 sequences for the CDR3 tree-map plot that show recurring CDR3 sequences in each figure.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> requires radical revisions to reduce complexity by retaining key components of FO and B-1a B cell comparisons in the main figure and moving some components to supplementary data, rectifying invisible X-axis labels and VH gene labels.

To better match the text, we show the comparison between MZB and splenic B-1a cells from 2-6 months old mice. In addition, as reviewers requested, we also now include the requisite statement in the text as well as in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> needs restructuring so that its panel order follows the text. Also, it is not clear where the graphical representation of B-1a cells from AID-null mice, mentioned in the text, is shown in this figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewers’ advice, the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> have been re-organized to correspond more closely to the text.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and E, we</xref> have shown data for each B cell sample obtained from 4-5 months old AID knockout mice.

These include four splenic B-1a samples, each from an individual mouse; one peritoneal B-1a sample; one follicular B and one peritoneal B-2 samples. We have clarified the text to match.</p><p><italic>12) Generally, figure contents need to be comprehensively edited for readability. Similarly, the text needs proofreading as well. The Discussion could also use editing to avoid repetitions and digressions into peripheral issues such as the evolutionary origins of B-1a B cell lineage, which are not directly addressed by the present data.</italic></p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have comprehensively edited our figure contents and text to make them clearer and more understandable. We also removed the repetitions in the Discussion section. Our sequence findings are consistent with developmental data that we and other labs have presented showing that B-1a and B-2 cells belong to evolutionarily distinct B lineages. While we agree with reviewers that our data do not directly bear on this lineage distinction, we believe that the drastic differences between the repertoire-defining mechanisms in B-1a and B-2 is consistent with, and sheds light on, the B-1a/B-2 lineage split. We agree with the reviewers that the “lineage” discussion in our manuscript should be shortened and have modified the text of the Discussion in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
