This network requires inputs from visual landmarks to anchor the HD signal to the external world. We investigated whether information about HD and visual landmarks is integrated in the medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum, resulting in neurons expressing a conjunctive code for HD and visual landmarks. We found that parahippocampal HD cells could be divided into two classes based on their theta-rhythmic activity: non-rhythmic and theta-rhythmic HD cells. Manipulations of the visual landmarks caused tuning curve alterations in most HD cells, with the largest visually driven changes observed in non-rhythmic HD cells. Importantly, the tuning modifications of non-rhythmic HD cells were often non-coherent across cells, refuting the notion that attractor-like dynamics control non-rhythmic HD cells. These findings reveal a new population of non-rhythmic HD cells whose malleable organization is controlled by visual landmarks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>head-direction cells</kwd><kwd>grid cells</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>theta oscillations</kwd><kwd>visual landmarks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AL 1730/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Head-direction cells in the parahippocampal region can be divided into two functionally distinct classes that are differentially constrained by attractor network dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Efficient navigation in mammals depends on several classes of spatially selective neurons. The animal’s sense of direction is encoded by head-direction (HD) cells that track ongoing angular movements of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taube et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2017</xref>). Each HD cell fires maximally when the head of an animal points in a particular direction, with different cells having different preferred directions. HD cells are located in both subcortical and cortical areas including the dorsal tegmental nucleus, lateral mammillary nucleus, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, nucleus reuniens, postsubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, parasubiculum, and the medial entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taube et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taube, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stackman and Taube, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sharp et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cacucci et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jankowski et al., 2014</xref>). The HD signal is generated in subcortical areas, possibly in the dorsal tegmental and lateral mammillary nuclei, and depends on intact vestibular inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stackman and Taube, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoder and Taube, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valerio and Taube, 2016</xref>). This signal reaches cortical areas via the thalamocortical excitatory projections of the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus. Accordingly, lesions to the subcortical components of the HD system strongly impair HD representations in cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodridge and Taube, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Continuous attractor network models provide a mechanistic framework explaining how the HD signal is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redish et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang, 1996</xref>). In these models, neurons are conceptually arranged in a circle according to their preferred firing direction. The connectivity between any two neurons depends on their relative position. While neighboring cells with similar preferred HD excite each other, distant cells tend to inhibit each other. This connectivity leads to the emergence of an activity packet which represents the moment-to-moment HD of the animal. These models predict that the differences between the preferred directions of HD cells never change because the connections within the network are immutable, and most empirical data support this prediction. For example, rotation of a distal visual landmark in an environment causes an equivalent rotation of the preferred direction of all HD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taube et al., 1990b</xref>). When distal and proximal cues are rotated in opposite directions, HD cells in the anterior thalamus rotate coherently with one of the two sets of cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoganarasimha et al., 2006</xref>). The firing associations of HD cells (i.e. their tendency to fire together) have also been compared across different brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsanov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>). As predicted by the models, firing associations of HD cells during exploratory behavior are maintained during sleep. In addition, reliable spike transmission is observed between HD cells in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and the presubiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that cortical cells inherit their preferred HD from thalamic HD cells.</p><p>All models of HD cells require a mechanism to anchor the preferred direction of HD cells to the external world, thereby preventing error accumulation inherent to head-movement integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redish et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicanski and Burgess, 2016</xref>). In these models, the anchoring mechanism involves the interaction between HD cells and cells encoding information about visual landmarks. Recent experimental work has shown that a subset of directional cells in the retrosplenial cortex are indeed controlled primarily by local visual landmarks, and that these cells can change their preferred directions independently of classic HD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest that cortical regions containing both classic HD cells and cells controlled by visual landmarks might be key sites where visual landmarks gain control over the head direction signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodridge and Taube, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum (MEC/PaS) are located at the top of hierarchical ascending HD pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark and Taube, 2012</xref>). There, HD cells intermingle with speed cells and grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boccara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>). It has been proposed that a key function of these cells is to compute an estimate of the animal’s position in space, which is optimally represented by the activity of modularly organized grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herz et al., 2017</xref>). To keep track of the animal’s position during movement, the grid cell network is thought to integrate direction and speed of movement using the activity of HD and speed cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, this spatial code likely depends on the properties of its HD inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The MEC/PaS also receive important visual and visuospatial inputs from the postrhinal and retrosplenial cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Czajkowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koganezawa et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have established that a substantial fraction of MEC/PaS neurons encode information about visual patterns or contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez-Escobar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diehl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ismakov et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of cells influenced by visual landmarks in the MEC/PaS raises the possibility that the MEC/PaS is a site of interaction between information about HD and visual cues. We therefore investigated whether some MEC/PaS neurons express a conjunctive code for HD and visual landmarks. We recorded the activity of HD cells in the MEC/PaS and tested whether their activity was also controlled by visual landmarks. The recording environment consisted of an elevated platform surrounded by four walls. Two distinct light patterns located on different walls were turned on and off. We report that HD cells in the MEC/PaS could be divided into two classes: non-rhythmic and theta-rhythmic HD cells. Changing which visual pattern was presented caused alterations in the tuning curves of both non-rhythmic and theta-rhythmic HD cells, but the magnitude of the changes was larger for non-rhythmic HD cells, with some non-rhythmic HD cells switching from active to nearly silent when the light pattern changed. Simultaneous recordings from multiple HD cells revealed that while theta-rhythmic HD cells maintained their firing associations when landmarks changed, the tuning changes of non-rhythmic HD cells were often non-coherent, demonstrating that non-rhythmic HD cells were not constrained by attractor-like dynamics but rather controlled by visual landmarks. We suggest that landmark-controlled non-rhythmic HD cells might contribute to setting the preferred directions of classic HD cells when an animal enters visually distinct environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the impact of visual landmarks on the HD signal, we recorded the activity of MEC/PaS neurons together with oscillatory field potentials using multichannel extracellular techniques in freely behaving mice.

To ensure that HD selectivity was not a byproduct of spatial selectivity coupled with unequal HD sampling across the recording environment, we calculated a directional distributive ratio for each HD cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muller et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cacucci et al., 2004</xref>) (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>).

Out of 104 HD cells, 10.6% (<italic>N</italic> = 11) were conjunctive grid x HD cells and were excluded from the HD cell category, leaving a total of 93 HD cells.

A similar percentage was obtained when analyzing HD cells from hemispheres containing recording sites in the PaS, presubiculum or cortex (76.9%, 20 out of 26 cells, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.1996, <italic>df</italic> = 1, p=0.66).</p><p>It was previously shown that the width of a prominent visual landmark could affect the width of the HD tuning curves of hippocampal neurons during navigation in a virtual environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2016</xref>). In the same study, a prominent visual landmark could also bias the distribution of preferred directions toward the landmark. To address whether these two effects could contribute to the differences observed between vp1 and vp2 trials, we analyzed selectively HD cells that showed a tuning curve change between vp1 and vp2 trials. No difference in HD scores was observed between vp1 and vp2 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Moreover, there was no clear indication of an accumulation of preferred directions toward either vp1 or vp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>Finally, one explanation of the strong response of non-rhythmic HD cells to landmark manipulations is that these cells might encode egocentric landmark bearing information instead of allocentric HD. Egocentric landmark bearing cells fire when a landmark is located at a given position in the animal’s field of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicanski and Burgess, 2016</xref>). If a HD cell is an egocentric landmark bearing cell, its preferred HD should change systematically as a function of the animal’s position within the arena due to the parallax effect.

We found that HD cells could be divided into two functionally distinct classes based on whether they fired rhythmically at theta frequency. Theta-rhythmic and non-rhythmic HD cells showed significant changes in their tuning curves when visual landmarks were manipulated, but the magnitude of the changes was larger for non-rhythmic HD cells. Moreover, non-rhythmic HD cells displayed non-coherent responses to visual landmark manipulations, whereas theta-rhythmic HD cells showed stable firing associations.</p><p>These properties of MEC/PaS HD cells set them apart from classic HD cells. Indeed, in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and presubiculum the peak firing rate and directional tuning of HD cells were unchanged when an animal explored visually distinct environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taube et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoder et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggest that, in these two brain regions, HD cells are driven mainly by self-motion cues derived from vestibular, proprioceptive, and motor efference information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stackman and Taube, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoder and Taube, 2014</xref>) and the principal effect of visual landmarks on HD cells is to anchor the HD signal to the external world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoder and Taube, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoder et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that the impact of visual information on MEC/PaS HD cells extends beyond this anchoring mechanism. The firing rate of several non-rhythmic HD cells was strongly modulated by the two visual landmarks, with some cells being almost silent with one of the two landmarks. This indicates that some HD cells are driven by visual landmarks, rather than being simply anchored by them. We suggest that a significant proportion of HD cells in the MEC/PaS express a conjunctive code for HD, visual landmarks and position. The origin of this 2D visual landmark modulation of HD cell activity is still unknown. Two possible origins are other MEC neurons changing their firing patterns depending on visual landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez-Escobar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diehl et al., 2017</xref>), or afferent connections from visual cortical areas (e.g., postrhinal or retrosplenial cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Czajkowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koganezawa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A core tenet of HD cell models is that cells within the network have a fixed connectivity and that differences in preferred direction between HD cells do not change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redish et al., 1996</xref>). Although the HD signal is generated at the level of the dorsal tegmental nucleus and the lateral mammillary nucleus, the evidence supporting this assertion has been obtained mainly from recordings performed in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, presubiculum or cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taube et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stackman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoganarasimha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the attractor-like network dynamics of the HD signal generator propagate from subcortical networks to cortical areas via ascending excitatory connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>). In the current study, we found that the firing pattern of non-rhythmic HD cells within the MEC/PaS is not strictly controlled by these attractor-like network dynamics. Indeed, the firing associations of non-rhythmic HD cells reorganized when visual landmarks were changed. This result indicates that the firing associations of non-rhythmic HD cells are malleable and controlled by visual landmarks.</p><p>A recent study also reported the existence of a population of HD cells in the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex that was controlled by local landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). In a two-compartment environment in which the compartment cue cards had the opposite orientation to one another, some HD cells had unimodal tuning curves within each compartment but their preferred direction rotated by 180<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> when the animal moved across compartments. A second population of HD cells had bimodal tuning curves within each compartment, and their direction associated with the highest firing rate rotated 180<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> across compartments. Thus, the preferred direction of these cells was likely controlled by the visual landmarks in each compartment. Importantly, bidirectional cells were recorded simultaneously with classic HD cells that did not change their tuning curves across compartments, demonstrating that bidirectional HD cells could re-align independently of the main HD system. The data currently available on non-rhythmic HD cells and bidirectional HD cells of the retrosplenial cortex suggest that, despite being both being controlled by visual landmarks, they might operate differently. One potential difference is their internal coherence as a population. Whereas bidirectional cells rotated coherently with one another when the animal moved across compartments, changing the visual landmarks in our experiment caused a reorganization of firing associations within the non-rhythmic HD cell population. Whether this difference originates from distinct cell properties will need to be investigated more directly by testing the two populations in similar recording conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that the HD signal in cortical areas is more heterogeneous than in the anterodorsal thalamus or the presubiculum.</p><p>The different firing properties of theta-rhythmic and non-rhythmic HD cells suggest that they support different functions. Theta-rhythmic HD cells showed no reorganization during our experiment. This coherent HD signal could be well suited for providing directional information to grid cells. Indeed, computational models of grid cells assume that the HD signal remains coherent, and recordings from grid cells indicates that they do not show major reorganization after visual cue manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez-Escobar et al., 2016</xref>). The theta modulation of rhythmic HD cells might also play an important role in the integration of the HD signal by grid cells. It has previously been proposed that the HD signal needs to be transformed into a theta-modulated signal to be used for navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cacucci et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the segregation of HD cell ensembles during individual theta cycles might also contribute to grid periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandon et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore suggest that an important function of theta-rhythmic HD cells is to provide a directional input to the grid cell network.</p><p>One function of non-rhythmic HD cells might be to act as an interface between visual landmarks and the coherent HD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicanski and Burgess, 2016</xref>). These non-rhythmic HD cells show large, non-coherent tuning changes upon landmark manipulations. An interesting mechanism that links visual landmarks to the HD signal has been put forward by Jacob and colleagues based on their recordings in the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page and Jeffery, 2018</xref>). In this model landmark-controlled HD cells could mediate a two-way interaction between visual landmarks and a coherent HD signal. This idea can be applied to the two HD cell populations identified in our study. The tuning curves of non-rhythmic HD cells would be established partly based on landmark-dependent inputs. The HD selectivity of these cells would make them co-active with a subgroup of classic HD cells (e.g. theta-rhythmic HD cells) with similar HD preferences. Over time, if the visual landmarks controlling the non-rhythmic HD cells remain stable, the association between the non-rhythmic HD cells and the coherent HD signal would be strengthened, allowing stable visual landmarks to gain preferential control over the coherent HD signal. This way, the population activity of landmark-controlled HD cells could contribute to setting the preferred directions of theta-rhythmic HD cells when an animal enters visually distinct environments. One interesting possibility is that this interaction between non-rhythmic and rhythmic HD cells might contribute to the orientation of grid cells within each grid module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that theta-rhythmic and non-rhythmic HD cells could form anatomically distinct populations. The differences in spike waveforms indicate that the two populations have distinct intrinsic biophysical properties. Moreover, the low incidence of pair recordings comprising a theta-rhythmic and a non-rhythmic cell HD suggests that the two populations are only partially overlapping in the MEC/PaS area. Histological analysis also points to the possibility that non-rhythmic cells could be preferentially located in the dorsal-most portion of the MEC. This could potentially correspond to the large cytochrome-oxidase positive, putatively parasubicular, patches previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgalossi et al., 2011</xref>). The high degree of HD selectivity in anatomically identified neurons located in these patches is consistent with this idea, although we note that most neurons in the large patches had strong theta modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgalossi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results establish that HD cells of the MEC/PaS comprise two functionally distinct types of cells. Theta-rhythmic HD cells react coherently when visual landmarks are altered and resemble more closely classic HD cells recorded in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus or presubiculum. In contrast, non-rhythmic HD cells not only show larger responses to visual landmark manipulations, but also respond non-coherently to these manipulations. This study therefore reveals the existence of landmark-driven reorganization within a population of HD cells. Previous work has shown that non-periodic place selective neurons of the MEC react to alterations in the recording environment by shifting the location of their firing fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diehl et al., 2017</xref>). The findings presented here indicate that an equivalent context-dependent reorganization occurs within the MEC/PaS HD code.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data analysis was performed in the R software environment and the source code is available from GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornienko and Allen, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/prog_kornienko_2018">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/prog_kornienko_2018</ext-link>).

The differences in preferred HD, HD score and mean firing rate between the reassigned vp1 and vp2 trials were calculated. These last steps were repeated 500 times to obtain a distribution of changes expected to occur by chance for the three variables. The observed changes of the HD cell were considered significant if they were larger than 99% of the differences obtained with the shuffling procedure.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Head-direction cells escaping attractor dynamics in the parahippocampal region&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Adrien Peyrache (Reviewer #1); Shane M O'Mara (Reviewer #2); Kate J Jeffery (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The referees all found the results, showing differential responses to a change in visual landmark configuration, which would not be possible within the simplest interpretation of the ring attractor model, quite interesting. Moreover, the mapping onto sub populations of theta and non-theta modulated head direction cells is of significant interest. However, they also recommend some revisions aimed at clarification and increasing the framing with respect to previous findings. Thus, that fact that head direction cell firing can be modulated by factors external to the attractor network itself needs to be raised earlier, most obviously the previous experimental work by Jacob et al., 2017 which showed similar differential responses of sub-populations of head direction cells to visual landmarks. Indeed, it might be worth pointing out that any attractor model of head-direction cell firing must include inputs from cells encoding the angles to specific landmarks for the spatial stability of the attractor tuning. Some other factors to address include whether the directional tuning might vary with uncertainty, e.g. depending on the size of the angle to the landmark, or to the width of the landmark. Please details see below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the Introduction and Discussion focuses on the independence of the landmark-sensitive directional neurons from the putative head direction attractor network. This is interesting, but it is not novel, since it was reported by Jacob et al. for the RSC head direction cells (indeed that paper is entitled &quot;An independent, landmark-dominated head-direction signal…&quot;.) The present cells are highly reminiscent of those cells and seem to have similar properties – this fact is mentioned only briefly and yet is surely relevant and important, since RSC is one of the big inputs to MEC/PaS. The closeness of the properties of these MEC/PaS neurons to the dysgranular RSC ones is sufficiently striking as to be meaningful, and the theta modulation differences have a potentially important message about the way in which these subsystems interact with the hippocampal formation.</p><p>2) The truly novel observation, which is that the landmark-preferring neurons are not theta-modulated while the &quot;normal&quot; HD cells are, suggesting they are possibly in different circuits, is relegated to second place and is not even mentioned in the title.</p><p>The current presentation of manuscript is hard to follow. First, the authors report that HD cells changed their properties depending on the landmarks. Then, in Figure 6, when the cells are divided between theta and non-theta modulated, the difference seems to be of another kind: in the theta group, cells seem pretty stable, and in the non-theta group, some show changes larger than the theta group (which could then be considered as the 'chance level'). Presenting Figure 5 with a color code indicating theta and non-theta pairs would help. But it would make the paper easier to follow by presenting from the beginning the distinction between the two classes of neurons.</p><p>3) There is also a third observation, that some cells switch on and off in response to the landmarks, that is barely mentioned, and yet is novel and important and additionally separates these neurons from &quot;ordinary&quot; HD cells. The switching on and off of some cells suggests that – as the authors themselves note – the cells are “driven” by landmarks rather than merely anchored by them.</p><p>The Abstract makes much reference to &quot;HD cells&quot;. However given the findings then presented, one starts to wonder whether &quot;head direction cells&quot; is not the right term – that they can follow visual landmarks around so easily suggests they are more interested in the visual scene than head direction per se. And yet, without the landmark manipulations, these certainly look like classic HD cells and have been labelled so previously. I wonder, though, about calling them something slightly more vague – directional cells perhaps – and then, at the end, suggesting a new name – landmark directional cells?</p><p>Overall, the bi- or multi- directionality of the cells in the presence of multiple landmark configurations requires some greater theoretical consideration. The obvious point to be made regards the need for all attractor systems for stable spatial coding to be anchored to environmental cues, which requires an interaction with cells coding for the directions of landmarks, and is not a trivial problem given the parallax problem (e.g. Bicanski and Burgess, 2016)</p><p>4) Can the authors present evidence that theta and non-theta neurons are not intrinsically different? (e.g. waveforms, firing rates, and putative layers / distance from dorsal border, if available?). There is a basic level of phenotyping required – and the authors need to discuss possibilities here a little more than they have.</p><p>5) Overall, the number of cells (and pairs) is rather small. Can the authors demonstrate that, at least, the off-diagonal outliers in Figure 5B (which are likely responsible for the strong decrease in the reported correlation values) are from more than one or two neurons, and from different animals if possible?</p><p>We need to be told (Results section) how many cells were recorded in each animal.</p><p>6) Another possible interpretation for differences in tuning is that animals are more 'lost' in one condition than in the other. One way to control for this would be to check whether the change in tuning depends on the preferred direction of the neurons. For example, a HD cell pointing in the opposition direction of the white card in the vp2 condition may be more affected than a cell pointing to the white card just because, in average, more error accumulates in this direction. The authors should report that the preferred direction of the HD neurons that showed changes between the two conditions is homogeneously distributed.</p><p>Along the same lines, the work of Acharya et al., 2016 suggests that, for HD cells of the hippocampus, the width of a visible landmark has an influence on the cell's tuning (i.e. HD score) and direction (toward the landmark). This paper, by the way, was already a first demonstration that, in some conditions, certain HD neurons are not rigidly coordinated. If one assumes that the LED arrays are more salient than the white card, it is then possible that the effect of vp1 or vp2 on the HD network is different. Although the two examples shown in Figure 2B suggest that instead the change can occur in both ways (lower or higher HD score), was it the case at the population level? Have the authors observed any redistribution of preferred direction toward the smaller landmark (vp1)?</p><p>Why no manipulations of ambient lighting? One particular concern is that the LED strips were switched from vp1 to vp2 in the presence of the animal – with no intervening period of darkness. It is possible that there will be important differences in firing activity depending on prior visual circumstance – there are substantial visual inputs to the areas recorded from. This should be discussed.</p><p>7) Title – this needs a revision. As stated it can be read, not unreasonably, as an unmasking phenomenon resulting from the presence of an inhibitor in a particular projection. Something along the lines of 'Theta-rhythmic and non-theta-rhythmic HD cells in PHC do not show attractor dynamics”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35949.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the Introduction and Discussion focuses on the independence of the landmark-sensitive directional neurons from the putative head direction attractor network.

The Introduction has now been considerably modified to better frame our work with respect to previous findings. The work of Jacob et al., 2017 is discussed at length, with a particular focus on the idea that attractor networks of HD cells require interactions with visual landmark information in order to remain stable (Bicanski and Burgess, 2016). Also, we now put less emphasis on the independence of the non-rhythmic HD cells from a putative HD attractor network.</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, the two principal similarities between bidirectional (BD) cells (Jacob et al., 2017) and non-rhythmic HD cells is that visual landmarks control their preferred direction and that their activity is not coherent with the main HD system. However, we note one potentially important difference in the internal dynamics of the two populations. In the work of Jacob et al., 2017, between-compartment BD cells showed a 180<sup>o</sup> rotation in their tuning curves when the animal moved from one compartment to the other. Similarly, most of the within-compartment BD cells showed a 180<sup>o</sup> rotation of their dominant peak between compartments (their Figure 3C). Thus, as a population, BD cells appeared to rotate coherently. In contrast, the non-rhythmic HD cell population showed non-coherent changes and non-rhythmic HD cells changed their firing associations with one another. We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion to highlight the similarities and differences between BD cells and non-rhythmic HD cells. Of course, a clear assessment of the differences between BD cells and non-rhythmic HD cells will ultimately require recording the two cell populations in the same experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The truly novel observation, which is that the landmark-preferring neurons are not theta-modulated while the &quot;normal&quot; HD cells are, suggesting they are possibly in different circuits, is relegated to second place and is not even mentioned in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>The presentation of the important theta-rhythmic / non-rhythmic dissociation now comes much earlier in the Results section.

We did not want to use the term “directional cells” as this is very vague and the analysis is all based on the direction of the head. We are also hesitant to call them “landmark directional cells” as it suggests that the cells encode egocentric landmark bearing. We now show in the revised manuscript that this is unlikely to be the case (see next point below). For this reason, we decided to keep the term “non-rhythmic HD cells” until we have a more complete understanding of their function. If the reviewers think that another term would be more appropriate, we can, of course, modify the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the bi- or multi- directionality of the cells in the presence of multiple landmark configurations requires some greater theoretical consideration. The obvious point to be made regards the need for all attractor systems for stable spatial coding to be anchored to environmental cues, which requires an interaction with cells coding for the directions of landmarks, and is not a trivial problem given the parallax problem (e.g. Bicanski and Burgess, 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the Abstract and Introduction to highlight the importance of visual landmarks in anchoring an attractor network of HD cells to the external world.</p><p>In addition, we investigated the possibility that non-rhythmic HD cells were in fact egocentric landmark bearing cells, as described in Bicanski and Burgess, 2016. Egocentric landmark bearing cells fire when a landmark is located at a given position in the animal’s field of view.</p><p>We set 8 possible anchor points (putative landmarks) located 8 cm away from the edge of the arena (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We calculated an egocentric landmark bearing tuning curve for each of these points. The best egocentric landmark bearing tuning score (vector length) out of the 8 scores served as egocentric score. In theory, if an egocentric landmark-bearing cell has a sharp place field, its best egocentric tuning curve resembles its allocentric HD tuning curve (Bicanski and Burgess, 2016). However, if an egocentric landmark bearing cell fires throughout an environment, its egocentric tuning curve becomes narrower than its allocentric HD tuning curve. This is because the position of a visual landmark in the animal’s field of view when an animal faces in a specific direction will vary with the position of the animal.</p><p>We therefore tested whether the improvement from allocentric HD score to egocentric score was larger for non-rhythmic HD cells with low spatial information scores. This is not what we observed. The improvement from allocentric HD score to egocentric score was not significantly related to the information score of the HD cell (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, r = -0.004, P = 0.98). Therefore, it seems unlikely that most non-rhythmic HD cells were egocentric landmark bearing cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors present evidence that theta and non-theta neurons are not intrinsically different? (e.g. waveforms, firing rates, and putative layers / distance from dorsal border, if available?). There is a basic level of phenotyping required – and the authors need to discuss possibilities here a little more than they have.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a more thorough description of the two HD cell classes. We added new figure panels (Figure 3 D-F) to further characterize the intrinsic properties of the two HD cell populations and refer to these findings in the Discussion section.</p><p>The average firing rates of theta-rhythmic and non-rhythmic HD cells were not significantly different (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, N = 34 and 59, w = 993, P = 0.94). This is now shown in Figure 3C, right panel.</p><p>We investigated whether the two cell populations could be partially anatomically segregated within the MEC/PaS. By analyzing pairs of HD cells simultaneously recorded on the same tetrode (N = 17), we found only one mixed pair. This suggests that the two cell populations are at least partially anatomically segregated. In addition, we found that fewer non-rhythmic HD cells were recorded on same tetrodes as grid cells compared to theta-rhythmic HD cells (N = 9 and 42, respectively) (Chi-squared test: Χ²= 15.66, df = 1, P &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>). Finally, non-rhythmic HD cells tended to be recorded during earlier recording sessions compared to theta-rhythmic HD cells (Figure 3D, w = 497, P &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>), suggesting that non-rhythmic HD cells are found more dorsally and/or in deeper layers.</p><p>We decided to implant additional mice (N = 4 mice) to obtain clearer histological data regarding the anatomical localization of non-rhythmic HD cells. The minimal spacing between tetrodes was increased to approximately 0.50 mm, making it possible to assign each cell to a tetrode track. These mice were recorded on a similar protocol and the experiments stopped as soon as non-rhythmic HD cells were encountered and the tetrodes were not moved further. Although this approach has a sampling bias (i.e., only the most dorsal non-rhythmic cells will be recorded), it provides a finer localisation of the recorded cells. In these mice, we found that non-rhythmic HD cells are found in the dorsal part of the MEC (Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). Interestingly, we also observed non-rhythmic HD cells in the postrhinal cortex (two mice).</p><p>Taken together, the results suggest that non-rhythmic HD cells are mainly located near the dorsal border of the MEC/PaS. In contrast, theta-rhythmic HD cells appeared more equally spread along the dorso-ventral axis of the MEC/PaS.</p><p>Finally, analysis of the spike waveforms in the two populations revealed that non-rhythmic HD cells had longer spike durations (Figure 3F, N = 30 and 52, w = 1347, P &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup>) and larger spike asymmetry compared to theta-rhythmic HD cells (Figure 3F, w = 463, P = 0.002). Cells which had inverted waveforms (N = 4 non-rhythmic and 7 theta-rhythmic) were excluded from this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Overall, the number of cells (and pairs) is rather small.

The authors should report that the preferred direction of the HD neurons that showed changes between the two conditions is homogeneously distributed.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we first tested whether the mice might be more lost in one condition than in the other. This analysis is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. We first compared the HD score of HD cells between vp1 and vp2 trials for cells with a significant tuning curve change and found no significant differences (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A; paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test for HD score, N = 59, v = 995, P = 0.41). We then reported the preferred direction of the HD neurons that showed changes between the two conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). The preferred directions of the neurons were widely distributed. A test of uniformity revealed that the preferred directions deviated marginally from uniformity during vp1 trials but not during vp2 trials (Rayleigh test of uniformity, vp1: test statistic = 0.2303, P = 0.0437, mean resultant length = 0.23, vp2: test statistic = 0.1116, P = 0.4798, mean resultant length = 0.11). There was no clear accumulation of preferred directions at directions associated with vp1, vp2 or the cue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines, the work of Acharya et al., 2016 suggests that, for HD cells of the hippocampus, the width of a visible landmark has an influence on the cell's tuning (i.e. HD score) and direction (toward the landmark).

Although the two examples shown in Figure 2B suggest that instead the change can occur in both ways (lower or higher HD score), was it the case at the population level? Have the authors observed any redistribution of preferred direction toward the smaller landmark (vp1)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the work of Acharya et al., 2016. This study is highly relevant to our work and is now cited in the Results section.</p><p>As suggested by the examples shown in Figure 4B, both increase and decrease in HD score could be observed from vp1 to vp2 trials. This resulted in similar HD scores for vp1 and vp2 trials for those HD cells with significant tuning curve alterations (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A) or all HD cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2F).</p><p>There was no clear accumulation of the preferred direction for directions associated with vp1 and vp2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). When considering all HD cells, the distribution of preferred direction was homogeneous in both trial types (Rayleigh test of uniformity, vp1: test statistic = 0.0931, P = 0.4466; vp2: test statistic = 0.0479, P = 0.81). This finding suggests no accumulation of preferred directions towards the smaller landmark. The HD scores as a function of preferred direction for HD cells changing their tuning curves are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2C. A linear-circular correlation suggests that the two variables are only weakly correlated (vp1: R = 0.07 P = 0.02; vp2: R = 0.09, P = 0.005). There was no clear trend for sharper HD curves towards or away from the visual patterns.</p><p>Furthermore, the change in HD tuning was only weakly correlated with the preferred direction of the neurons for vp1 trials (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, vp1: R = 0.06, P = 0.03). Lastly, these two variables were not correlated during vp2 trials (vp2: R = 0.035, P = 0.13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why no manipulations of ambient lighting? One particular concern is that the LED strips were switched from vp1 to vp2 in the presence of the animal – with no intervening period of darkness. It is possible that there will be important differences in firing activity depending on prior visual circumstance – there are substantial visual inputs to the areas recorded from. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the sequence of light presentation and the absence of dark trials are important factors (Taube et al., 1990, Knierim et al., 1995; Jeffery et al., 1999; Jeffery et al., 2016). Our aim was that the spatial representation of grid cells remained anchored to the static cues (i.e., cue card, uncontrolled cues on the floor) when the visual patterns switched. We assumed that this would be more likely if the animal had a precise estimate of its position when the light switch occurred. In previous work, we and others found that after a few seconds in darkness, the spatial representation of grid cells in mice is severely impaired (Pérez-Escobar et al., 2016, Chen et al., 2016). Therefore, we decided to leave the dark period out of the current recording protocol. We have added a sentence in the Materials and methods section to justify this choice in our paradigm (subsection “Recording protocol”).</p><p>In cue rotation experiments, the rotated and stationary cues compete for their influence on spatially selective cells (Taube et al., 1990, Knierim et al., 1995; Jeffery et al., 1999; Jeffery et al., 2016). For example, when a cue is rotated in the presence of the animal, the preferred direction of HD cells often under-rotate (Taube et al., 1990), indicating that the control of the cue on the HD cells is reduced. A similar effect has been observed for place cells (Jeffery et al., 1999). One interpretation of these results is that when a cue is perceived as unstable, either by being directly seen moving or by being in conflict with an internal path integrator, it has less influence on the HD or place cell activity. In our experiment, the two distinct landmarks had stable spatial locations and, as long as the mouse could discriminate one from one another, provided reliable spatial information when turned on. Whether the influence of spatial representation would be more pronounced if darkness periods were to be introduced between the vp1 and vp2 trials is something that remains to be tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Title – this needs a revision. As stated it can be read, not unreasonably, as an unmasking phenomenon resulting from the presence of an inhibitor in a particular projection. Something along the lines of 'Theta-rhythmic and non-theta-rhythmic HD cells in PHC do not show attractor dynamics”.</p></disp-quote><p>The title was changed to “Non-rhythmic head-direction cells in the parahippocampal region are not constrained by attractor network dynamics”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
