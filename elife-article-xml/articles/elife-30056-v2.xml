Little is known about the neural representation of punishment risk during reward-seeking behavior. We modeled this circumstance in rats by designing a task where actions were consistently rewarded but probabilistically punished. Spike activity and local field potentials were recorded during task performance simultaneously from VTA and mPFC, two reciprocally connected regions implicated in reward-seeking and aversive behaviors. At the single unit level, we found that ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons and mPFC neurons encode the relationship between action and punishment. At the network level, we found that coherent theta oscillations synchronize VTA and mPFC in a bottom-up direction, effectively phase-modulating the neuronal spike activity in the two regions during punishment-free actions. This synchrony declined as a function of punishment probability, suggesting that during reward-seeking actions, risk of punishment diminishes VTA-driven neural synchrony between the two regions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30056.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When deciding what to do, we usually try to predict the likely outcomes of our actions. This helps us choose behaviors that will lead to positive outcomes, or rewards, and avoid those that will lead to negative outcomes, or punishments. But in practice, actions that offer the possibility of reward often involve varying degrees of risk. When animals forage for food, for example, they risk encountering a predator. In our complex social world, applying for a job or asking someone out on a date means risking rejection. Being able to weigh up the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes is vital for effective decision-making.</p><p>Park and Moghaddam have now studied how the brain’s reward system takes account of possible negative outcomes. Rats learned to poke their noses into a window inside a testing box whenever a light came on, to earn a sugar reward. The rats completed three blocks of trials. During the first block, they received only rewards. But for a few trials during the second and third blocks, they also received a mild electric shock as well as their reward.</p><p>Throughout the task, Park and Moghaddam monitored the activity of two regions of the brain that encode rewards, the ventral tegmental area (or VTA for short) and the medial prefrontal cortex. The VTA sits deep within the brain and produces the brain’s reward chemical, dopamine. The prefrontal cortex is at the front of the brain and helps support cognition. In the reward-only block of trials, neurons in the VTA synchronized their firing with neurons in the prefrontal cortex. In blocks two and three, where there was a risk of shock, this synchrony decreased. This suggests that the prefrontal cortex takes greater control of decision-making when an unpleasant outcome is possible.</p><p>Consistently overestimating the risk of things going wrong will lead to anxiety. Underestimating the risks will lead to impulsivity and poor decision-making. Park and Moghaddam’s experiment offers a way to study the mechanisms underlying these processes in animals. The results also suggest that using scalp electrodes to track prefrontal cortex activity in patients could be helpful in clinical trials for anxiety or impulse-control disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>punishment</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>instrumental action</kwd><kwd>neural synchrony</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56MH084906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moghaddam</surname><given-names>Bita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Risk of punishment during reward seeking behavior is associated with a functional &quot;disconnection&quot; of the PFC-VTA circuit due to a transient loss of VTA-driven theta oscillation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Goal-directed actions aimed at obtaining a reward often involve exposure to an aversive event or punishment. For example, foraging for food in the wild may result in encountering a predator. In a causally and socially complex world, appropriate representation of punishment that lurks around during reward-seeking actions is critical for survival and optimal action selection. Deficits in this representation may be associated with detrimental behavioral patterns observed in impulsive behavior and addictive disorders while exaggerated representation of punishment risk may be linked to anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bechara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gillan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartley and Phelps, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mineka et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>How is risk of punishment associated with reward-seeking actions represented by the brain? To begin to address this question, we focused on the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Neurons in the VTA including dopamine (DA) and non-dopamine neurons are critical components of the reward circuitry including reward-mediated actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wise, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wood et al., 2017</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that ensembles of VTA neurons represent risk of punishment associated with reward-guided behavior. Importance of VTA notwithstanding, the mPFC is also implicated in reward representation and reward-guided action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barraclough et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buschman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powell and Redish, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rich and Shapiro, 2009</xref>), as well as control of aversive and anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). At the network level, the mPFC and VTA (both DA and non-DA neurons) send reciprocal projections to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carr and Sesack, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2000b</xref>). The VTA neurons projecting to mPFC have been shown to respond to stressful and anxiogenic drugs with a greater degree of sensitivity compared to the mesolimbic or mesostriatal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradberry et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moghaddam et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thierry et al., 1976</xref>). Furthermore, photostimulation of the VTA DA input to the mPFC elicits anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a more causal role for this neural circuit in aversive behavior. Given this, we further hypothesized that the interaction between VTA and mPFC provides a dynamic representation of punishment risk during reward-seeking actions.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we first designed and validated a task that allowed us to assess reward-guided actions in the absence or presence of punishment risk in the same recording session. The latter criterion was critical because it allowed us to track the activity of the same ensembles of neurons as a function of punishment risk. The task was designed so that an instrumental action always procured a reward, but the same action probabilistically led to punishment with blockwise varying degrees of contingency. Thus, different blocks had varying risk of punishment associated with an action while action-reward contingency remained constant. We then recorded single unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) from the VTA and mPFC simultaneously during this task. The simultaneous recording allowed us to compare the inter- and intra-regional neural codes for punishment risk-based modulation of behavioral events.</p><p>At the single unit level, we found that VTA and mPFC neurons encode risk of punishment and blockwise/trial-by-trial behavioral modulation during action execution. At the network level, we found that coherent theta oscillations synchronize the VTA and mPFC in a bottom-up direction, effectively phase-modulating the neuronal spike activity in the two regions during punishment-free actions. This oscillation-mediated neural synchrony declined as a function of punishment risk, suggesting that desynchronization of coordinated activity in these two regions signals punishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of punishment risk on reward-seeking behavior</title><p>Blockwise changes in punishment risk resulted in changes in behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1 and 2</xref>).

Comparing the ωPEV statistics of the original spike trains with the ωPEV distribution of surrogate spike trains created by shuffling block labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>, Materials and methods) allowed us to identify punishment encoding units, i.e. units that responded to the same events (cue, action, reward) differently in different blocks. The most robust punishment encoding occurred during the peri-action epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) given that ωPEVs during this period was greater than that of the peri-cue or peri-reward epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). There was a significant interaction between time and unit groups in the peri-action ωPEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; Repeated measures ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>38, 5054</sub> = 2.68, p&lt;0.001), indicating distinct time-varying patterns in representation of punishment by different unit groups. Similar time-varying patterns were observed in the proportion of units representing punishment risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To examine the time course of individual neuronal encoding in the peri-action epoch, we recalculated the peri-action ωPEV using a narrower moving window (50 ms width, 5 ms step) to reveal time points of individual neuronal representation of punishment at a higher temporal resolution. Response of VTA putative DA neurons appeared to be concentrated specifically around the time of the action, whereas non-DA and mPFC units displayed temporally diffuse patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This result suggested that DA units may be involved in more precise signaling of action and punishment risk, whereas the mPFC and VTA non-DA units may represent more persistent effects of punishment on motivational/emotional states. Consistent with this function, substantial proportions of mPFC (31%) and non-DA (32%) units significantly modulated their baseline firing rates across blocks, suggesting that they represent punishment on a longer temporal scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

To better understand the relationship between the behavioral and neural data, we examined whether, and to what extent, RT variability is related to mPFC and VTA neuronal activity. At the single neuron level, only a small fraction of single units exhibited significant correlation between firing rate and the RT across trials (mPFC, 10.2%; VTA putative DA, 36.4%; VTA putative non-DA, 25.5%). This result indicated that inferring trial-by-trial behavior from single neuronal activity was limited. We, therefore, moved on to correlating single-trial RT with neuronal population activity. A conventional measure of the neuronal population activity is averaging across neurons, but the bi-directionality in the individual neuronal representation of risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) undermined the feasibility of this approach. As an alternative approach, we used a neuronal population state space analysis that detected patterns of activity co-modulation in simultaneously recorded mPFC or VTA populations (comprising of 10 or more units). Trial-by-trial neural population trajectories were extracted within this state space using a dimensionality reduction method Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA; Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Examining the correlation between the neural population trajectory and the RT across trials revealed that mPFC and VTA population trajectories track trial-to-trial variation in RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Specifically, the deviation (Euclidean distance) of each trial’s neural trajectory from the block 1 mean trajectory was significantly correlated with the deviation of each trial’s RT from the block 1 mean RT. Simply put, the further each trial’s neural trajectory departed from the block 1 mean trajectory, the greater the RT appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).

In reality, however, an action rarely retains such unitary outcome. In particular, reward-guided actions often involve varying risk of punishment. This risk must be computed by the brain for optimal selection and execution of actions. Here we addressed how mPFC and VTA represent risk of punishment during rewarded actions by simultaneously recording from both regions as animals performed an instrumental task where an action consistently procured a reward but probabilistically led to punishment. We found that these structures use multiple coding schemes, involving spike-rate and LFP-mediated neural synchrony, to compute risk of punishment. At neuronal ensemble level, putative DA and non-DA VTA and mPFC units responded to the same action differently if that action was punishment-free versus punishment-prone, suggesting that these neurons encode the relationship between action and punishment. At the network level, coherent theta oscillations, which synchronized mPFC and VTA activity during punishment-free actions, declined during punishment-prone actions, indicating that risk of punishment disrupts the mPFC-VTA synchrony that emerges during reward seeking behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>VTA and mPFC neurons represent risk of punishment on different timescales</title><p>Using a novel behavioral paradigm that assessed punishment risk during reward-guided behavior, we found that the majority of VTA and mPFC neurons respond to punishment risk by modulating their firing rates. Critically, this response was most pronounced at the time of the action as compared to other task events such as cue or reward delivery. This suggests that neurons in both structures preferentially encode risk of punishment during reward-seeking actions.</p><p>Given the relatively low probability and modest experience of punishment in the present task, one may wonder to what extent animals were cognizant of the punishment contingency on the action. Our data suggest that the punishment based behavioral changes is due to both learning of action-punishment contingency and state-dependent effects of punishment. Learning of contingency is supported by data showing a selective increase in instrumental RTs but not in reward RTs. As shown in the video reproducing stereotypical risky actions, animals were timid/cautious at the time of instrumental actions and made many ‘incomplete’ nose pokes, which was not the case for nose pokes to the food trough. The latter is mechanically the same action to which punishment was never contingent on. These suggest that pronounced changes in neural activity within the peri-action epoch may reflect changes in action-punishment contingency. We also observed a correlation between behavior and neuronal responses as behavioral variability increased with risk of punishment suggesting that the direct impact of shock experiences may contribute, in part, to behavioral and neural changes irrespective of learned contingency.</p><p>Punishment influences behavior, and neuronal representation associated with that behavior, on multiple timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Somerville et al., 2013</xref>). On short timescales, real-time neural processing of punishment may be important to signal contingency of punishment on a specific event in order to promote rapid behavioral adaptation. Our data suggest that VTA DA neuronal signaling may be involved in this context. DA neurons displayed phasic excitatory responses tightly linked to each of the task events (cue, action, and reward). Importantly, the DA neuronal encoding of punishment was concentrated around the time of the action compared with other task epochs, suggesting that DA neuronal signaling of punishment may primarily reflect the action-punishment contingency. On longer timescales, punishment can elicit persistent changes in motivational and emotional states – e.g., changes in mood. We found that mPFC and VTA non-DA neurons display temporally diffuse encoding of punishment within the peri-action window. Likewise, many of the mPFC and non-DA neurons showed significant modulation of their baseline firing rates, suggesting that these neurons may encode punishment with persistent changes in activity. This sustained change in activity may be responsible for longer-lasting affective impact of punishment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neurons display bidirectional responses to punishment risk</title><p>Subpopulations of VTA putative DA, non-DA, and mPFC neurons responded to punishment risk by increasing or decreasing their peri-action firing rates. This is not surprising given that while punishment is an aversive event that should be avoided, it is highly salient and deserving prioritized attention. These aspects of punishment need to be represented for appropriate behavioral coping. In general, the direction of neuronal responses to appetitive vs aversive events is thought to carry information about motivational properties encoded by the neuronal activity. While heterogeneous response patterns have been widely observed in PFC neurons that respond to punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seo and Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ye et al., 2016</xref>), there is some debate on whether the VTA DA neurons respond to punishment with excitatory or inhibitory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schultz, 2016</xref>). It has been demonstrated that reward prediction error (RPE)-coding DA neurons respond to appetitive (better-than-predicted) vs aversive (worse-than-predicted) events by excitation and inhibition, integrating information about appetitive and aversive events into a common currency of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eshel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mileykovskiy and Morales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roitman et al., 2008</xref>). We found that a subset of VTA putative DA neurons conformed to this pattern. These neurons responded to punishment-free (purely appetitive) actions with phasic excitation, which decreased as a function of punishment risk.</p><p>In contrast, a greater proportion of putative DA neurons showed excitatory responses to punishment; that is, they treated appetitive and aversive components in the same direction, and responded to actions prone to punishment with further excitation. We observed that excitatory representation of punishment risk was predominant among DA neurons, suggesting that risk of punishment is not simply encoded as reduced value of the action. Previous studies have reported that a subpopulation of putative DA neurons show similar excitatory responses to appetitive and aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joshua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valenti et al., 2011</xref>). An excitatory DA neuronal encoding of aversive or neutral events has been interpreted as conveying motivational salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>), detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nomoto et al., 2010</xref>), intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiorillo et al., 2013</xref>) of a sensory event, as well as generalization effect of rewarding stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</xref>). Combination of these factors may comprise the excitatory DA neuronal encoding of punishment-prone actions we observed. Furthermore, the DA neuronal encoding of aversion has been suggested to depend on animals’ behavioral state. A recent study demonstrated that DA neurons encoded aversive events with inhibition in a low reward context but with biphasic responses in a high reward context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, different DA neural responses have been reported based on how animals responded to an aversive event. For example, DA concentration in the ventral striatum increased or decreased when rats displayed active avoidance or passive reaction (freezing) to shock-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wenzel et al., 2015</xref>). These patterns of state dependency in DA neural responses to aversion are in line with our observation of excitatory encoding of punishment when risk was taken for reward in a highly rewarding context. Thus, our results support the view that DA neuronal signaling of aversion is not a uniform process and depends on behavioral states and reward availability in the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>VTA-mPFC neural synchrony declines with punishment</title><p>At the network level, we observed that coherent theta oscillation synchronizes VTA and mPFC specifically during punishment-free actions, effectively phase-modulating the neuronal spike activity in the two regions. Analyses of the temporal relationship indicated that the neural synchrony arose in the VTA-to-mPFC direction. That is, VTA-driven theta oscillation entrained mPFC LFPs and neuronal spike activity during punishment-free actions. The theta oscillation preferentially entrained putative DA neurons but much fewer non-DA neurons in the VTA. Considering the phasic excitatory responses of DA neurons during action, the theta oscillation-mediated neural synchrony may promote phase-coupling between VTA DA and mPFC neurons selectively during reward-seeking behavior when there is no risk of punishment. This phase-coupling diminished during punishment-prone actions. Thus, prediction of punishment can be inferred by dual alterations in the phase and the rate of the DA neurotransmission in the mPFC (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9h</xref>). Our data showing preferential DA (vs non-DA) neuronal phase-locking with VTA and mPFC theta oscillations supports the theoretical model suggesting that the VTA DA input may play a crucial role for cortical theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</xref>). In addition, our data is consistent with previous studies showing that inhibiting DA D1 receptors in mPFC diminishes theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parker et al., 2014</xref>). Establishing the causality of VTA DA neuron driving mPFC theta oscillation, however, would require future experiments with pharmacological or optogenetic manipulation of specific cell types.</p><p>While somewhat out of the scope of the present study, it is noteworthy that theta oscillations in the mPFC and/or VTA have been related to the hippocampal theta oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hyman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>). Local infusion of DA in mPFC enhances theta oscillations and coherence between mPFC and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>), while both mPFC and VTA neurons exhibit phase coherence to the hippocampal theta oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011</xref>). Thus, the theta-mediated neural synchrony we observed in the VTA-mPFC circuit may be coupled with the hippocampal theta oscillation, including the possibility that the theta oscillation are led by the hippocampus and/or a third structure.</p><p>Recent studies have reported slow (4 Hz) oscillation in mPFC during fear-conditioned freezing in synchrony with other regions including the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>). The distinct behavioral states associated with 4 Hz oscillations in these studies taken together with theta oscillations observed in our study may suggest that mPFC is entrained by different bands of oscillations in appetitive vs aversive states. However, the 4 Hz oscillation in the VTA-mPFC circuit has also been associated with working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011</xref>). The fast vs slow mPFC oscillations occurring in appetitive vs aversive states may arise in preferential synchrony with VTA or amygdala in appetitive vs aversive states, thereby the bottom-up information transfer from the two subcortical regions can be routed depending on the behavioral context. This scenario would predict that the theta-oscillation-mediated VTA-mPFC synchrony decreases in the presence of punishment while 4 Hz oscillation increases in the mPFC. Consistent with this, we observed that mPFC theta-oscillation-mediated synchrony significantly declined as a function of action-punishment contingency. We did not observe the emergence of 4 Hz oscillation presumably because, unlike fear conditioning paradigms, our task involved instrumental actions. Of note, entrainment of a neural circuit with varying frequency oscillations as a function of a task variable has been widely observed in sensory cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jia et al., 2013</xref>). Such frequency modulation, along with the power modulation, could promote selection and binding of task-relevant neuronal ensembles to give rise to a functional neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fries, 2015</xref>). Likewise, our data may reflect the rise and fall of coherent VTA and mPFC neuronal ensembles that may promote a flexible control of instrumental behavior as a function of punishment contingency.</p><p>The neural synchrony mediated by different bands of oscillations in distinct behavioral states may also implicate neuron groups in the other connected structures such as nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and lateral habenula that are critical for appetitive and aversive behaviors. Mounting evidence suggests that distinct neuron groups within these regions selectively respond to appetitive vs aversive events and display different patterns of input-output connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roeper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ye et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting that projection specificity may be the foundation for selective recruitment of distinct neuron groups in distinct-valence experiences. The anatomical connectivity alone, however, may not be sufficient to bind the neuron groups tuned to appetitive or aversive events into a functional neural network in a timely manner. Therefore, the neural synchrony mediated by coherent oscillations, such as that demonstrated here, may play a key role for the rise and fall of the functional neural networks depending on the behavioral context.</p><p>In conclusion, proper encoding of punishment risk and its contingency on actions and outcomes are fundamental to adaptive behavior and survival. Our data reveal dynamic coding schemes of the VTA-mPFC neural networks in representing risk of punishment and punishment-based modulation of rewarded actions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and surgical procedure</title><p>Male Long Evans rats weighing 300 ~ 400 g (Harlan) were singly housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 7 p.m.).

To minimize generalization of the action-punishment contingency across blocks, they were organized in an ascending shock probability order – Block1: 0, Block2: 0.06, Block3: 0.1, interleaved with 2 min timeout between blocks. In block 2 and 3 of each session, 3 and 5 trials were pseudo-randomly selected and followed by an electrical foot shock. No explicit cue was provided on shock trials to keep the shock occurrence unpredictable. The cue onset only signaled initiation of a trial. Animals were informed of the block shift by the 2 min darkened timeout in between blocks. In addition, the first shock trial of block 2 and the first two shock trials of block 3 were randomly selected from the initial 5 trials of each block. Also, animals completed two sessions of this task before the recording session, thus the shock occurrence and the task design including the ascending punishment contingency were not novel to them at the time of the recording session. All training and recording sessions were terminated if not completed in 180 mins, and data from the completed sessions only were analyzed. Animals displayed stable behavioral performance overall without any sign of contextual fear conditioning, since they performed fearless in the safe block across all sessions. In addition, there was no evidence for habituation to the shock as they showed equivalent punishment-based behavioral changes across sessions. For the diazepam pretreatment experiment, a separate group of rats (N = 9) were trained using abovementioned procedure, and they underwent three test sessions with intraperitoneal pretreatment of saline – diazepam (2 mg/kg, Hospira, Inc.) – saline. After injection, animals were returned to their home cage for 10 min before they were placed in the operant chamber. Three days of washout period was allowed between sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously using a pair of eight channel Teflon-insulated stainless steel 50 µm microwire arrays (NB Laboratories). Unity-gain junction field effect transistor headstages were attached to a headstage cable and a motorized commutator nonrestrictive to the animals’ movement. Signals were amplified via a multichannel amplifier (Plexon). Spikes were bandpass filtered between 220 Hz and 6 kHz, amplified ×500, and digitized at 40 kHz. Single-unit activity was then digitally high-pass filtered at 300 Hz and LFP were low-pass filtered at 125 Hz. Continuous single-unit and LFP signals were stored for offline analysis. Single units were sorted using the Offline Sorter software (Plexon). Only the single-units with a stable waveform throughout the recording session were further analyzed. If a unit presented a peak of activity at the time of the reference unit’s firing in the cross-correlogram, only either of the two was further analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neural data analysis</title><p>Single unit and LFP data analyses were conducted with Matlab (MathWorks) and SPSS statistical software (IBM). For single unit data analyses, 1 ms binned spike count matrix of the peri-cue, action, and reward periods (starting 2 s before each event and ending 2 s after each event) were produced per unit. The baseline period was a 2 s time window beginning 2.5 s before the cue onset. For all neural data analyses, the trials with shock delivery (three and five trials for block 2 and 3, respectively) were excluded as single-unit and LFP signals in these trials were affected by electrical artifacts during shock delivery.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Trial-averaged firing-rate analysis</title><p>Spike count matrices were further binned using a 50 ms rectangular moving window with steps of 50 ms within the −2 to 2 s epoch aligned to the task event occurring at time = 0, and smoothed across five 50 ms time bins for the firing rate analysis.

The trial-averaged firing rate of each unit was Z-score normalized using the mean and standard deviation of its baseline firing rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>VTA cell classification</title><p>The VTA single units were classified into putative dopamine (DA) or non-dopamine (non-DA) neurons based on two criteria. First, units whose mean baseline firing rate slower than 12 Hz, waveform width greater than 1.2 ms were considered as potential DA units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grace and Bunney, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schultz and Romo, 1987</xref>). This traditional classification, however, has been suggested to be potentially inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margolis et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the second criterion utilized the neuronal reward response properties for the putative DA and non-DA cell identification. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated by comparing the distribution of firing rates across trials in 100 ms bins (starting 0.5 s before reward delivery and ending 1 s after reward delivery) to the distribution of baseline firing rates. Principal component analysis was conducted using the singular value decomposition of the area under the ROC (auROC). Units were mapped in the 3-d space comprising the top three principal components. Within the 3-d PC space, unsupervised clustering was conducted by fitting Gaussian mixture models using the expectation-maximization algorithm. This method found two clusters: one with phasic excitation to reward (Type 1), one with sustained excitation or suppression to reward (Type 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c–e</xref>). Units in the former class were classified as putative DA units, as previous studies have shown that optogenetically tagged dopamine neurons displayed similar phasic excitatory reward responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, we defined a VTA unit satisfying both criteria as a putative DA unit and a unit that met either or none of the criteria as a putative non-DA unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). mPFC units were not classified based on their firing and spike-waveform properties. Only 2 out of the total 293 mPFC single units had the mean baseline firing rates higher than 20 Hz, thus few fast-spiking interneurons should be included in our data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Spike rate selectivity</title><p>To quantify single neuronal encoding of blockwise action-punishment contingency, we computed a bias-corrected percent explained variance (ωPEV) statistic with binned spike counts calculated in a 200 ms rectangular window moving with steps of 50 ms within the 2 s peri-event epochs (−1 to 1 s with an event occurring at time = 0).<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ω</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where SS<sub>Blocks</sub> and SS<sub>Total</sub> are the between-blocks (action-punishment contingency) and total sums of squares, df<sub>Blocks</sub> is degrees of freedom, and MS<sub>Error</sub> is the mean squared error.

A unit was determined to encode action-punishment contingency if its peri-event ωPEV surpassed ‘the global ωPEV band’, which was defined as the upper bound of the 99% confidence interval of the trial-shuffled (1000 times) surrogate ωPEV distribution – that is, fewer than 1% of the trial-shuffled ωPEVs crossed the global band across all time bins in the peri-event epoch (α = 0.01). To find the global ωPEV band, we computed the mean and standard deviation of the trial-shuffled ωPEV distribution. By stepping up from the mean by one-hundredth of the standard deviation, we found the pointwise band at each time bin and the global band across time bins both at α = 0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>). This approach effectively resolves the issue of multiple comparisons that can arise as statistical comparisons made separately across multiple time bins increase the rate of false rejection of the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>).

The mPFC and VTA LFPs during the baseline and peri-action 4 s time windows were bandpass filtered to isolate oscillations within 5–15 Hz frequency range. The instantaneous phase of each filtered LFP segment was determined using the Hilbert transform and each spike was assigned the phase of its contemporaneous LFP segment. The phase-locking value (PLV) of each unit was defined as the circular concentration of the resulting phase angle distribution, which was quantified as the mean resultant length (MRL) of the phase angles. The MRL is the modulus of the sum of unit vectors indicating instantaneous phases of each spike occurrence normalized by the number of spikes, thus the MRLs were bound to take a value between 0 (no phase-locking) to 1 (perfect phase-locking).<disp-formula id="equ12"><mml:math id="m12"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mfenced close="|" open="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the phase assigned to n<sup>th</sup> spike occurrence, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the total number of spikes. Since the MRL statistic is sensitive to the number of spikes, we calculated MRL 1,000 times with 100 spikes of each unit randomly selected for each iteration, and the PLV was the MRL averaged across all iterations. As comparing PLVs across blocks with varying action-punishment contingency was of our central interest, PLV was computed per each block. Only the units with their peri-action spike counts within each block greater than 100 in all three blocks were included in the phase-locking analysis. Units passing the Rayleigh’s z-test at α = 0.05 were determined to be significantly phase-locked. The directionality of the LFP and spike phase relationship was inferred by a time-lagged phase-locking analysis, in which the spike times were shifted relative to the LFP time series, stepping by 4 ms within the range of −100 to 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>). At each time lag, the PLV of each single unit and its significance were assessed, and the maximum PLV across all time lags was found for each unit. We repeated the analysis with different time lags and analysis windows, and confirmed that the results were very similar across different parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Parametric statistical tests were used for z-score normalized data and non-normalized data that are conventionally tested using a parametric test. Nonparametric approaches, such as conventional nonparametric tests or bootstrapping were used for a hypothesis test of data, of which statistical distribution is unknown, e.g. phase-locking values (PLVs). For all tests, the Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied as necessary due to violations of sphericity. All statistical tests were specified as two-sided. Multiple testing correction was applied for all tests including multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Byron Yu, Sara Morrison, and members of BM laboratory for critical discussion and reading of this manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sabine Kastner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Geoffrey Schoenbaum (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kay M Tye (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors record from MPFC and VTA in rats nosepoking for a food reward on an FR1 schedule in the face of possible punishment. Recordings are made across three 50-trial blocks. In block 1, there is no punishment. In block 2, there is one shock delivered in the initial 5 trials and two more delivered in the next 45 trials. In block 3, there are 2 shocks delivered in the first 5 trials and 3 more delivered in the next 45 trials. Two minute intervals are inserted between blocks to cue the rats, and the rats received 2 training sessions prior to recording. Rats exhibited longer latencies to nosepoke in the punishment blocks, which disappeared if no shock was given (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or with diazepam pretreatment. Reward retrieval latencies were unaffected. In this context, they report that neural activity in both regions is modulated by shock frequency (block), particularly around the time of action. Putative dopamine neurons showed this effect strongly, while also responding to the trial cue and reward. Finally oscillations in both areas showed reduced coherence in punishment blocks. The authors conclude that both areas are important for incorporating possible punishment into a reward-seeking behavior, and that oscillatory drive from VTA to MPFC may be important for their coordination.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that there is a major question over whether the rats understand the contingency between nose poking and punishment given the low probability and modest experience they have or whether the effects of punishment are more of a state dependent effect. In other words, would the same effect have been achieved by delivering increasing numbers of non-contingent shocks in the blocks? The reviews mention several ways to address this analytically in the current data or by running a behavioral group and/or recording group with non-contingent shock. If it cannot be clearly established that the current results reflect contingency and/or the authors do not want to run more subjects, then it might be acceptable to refrain from making strong claims about this in the Introduction and Results, and then discuss the possibilities in the Discussion. The current design is obviously appropriate to model predator risks during foraging anyway, as predators are not contingent on picking a berry necessarily. But in this case, the reviewers want to emphasize that the changes to the way this is described in the Introduction and Results must be substantive, removing up front claims that there is an action-punishment contingency. It was also felt that a finer grained analysis of individual rats' behavior and neural activity might be useful in addressing this question and more generally. Other important, but less essential points are outlined below.</p><p>Title: According to <italic>ELIFE</italic> guidelines, I believe it needs to mention the model species.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors record from MPFC and VTA in rats nosepoking for a food reward on an FR1 schedule in the face of possible punishment.

The authors conclude that both areas are important for incorporating possible punishment into a reward-seeking behavior, and that oscillatory drive from VTA to MPFC may be important for their coordination.</p><p>Overall the study was interesting and presented a number of new results that potentially fit with and extend the current literature. These include the finding that reward responsive dopamine neurons are modulated by punishment. As the authors note in their discussion, this can be accounted for in a variety of ways, but the ongoing dispute over this question makes this result alone particularly important to me. It is probably outside the scope of what they are interested in and it may not be possible in the context of their task, but it would be obviously interesting to know if the variance in this response reflects punishment per se or changes in punishment, and how it relates to RPEs (versus just reward responses). It is also very interesting to see the changes in oscillations and potential impact on single unit signaling.</p><p>For me the overriding question is whether the rats understand the contingency between their behavior and the punishment or whether the behavior and resultant neural changes reflect a change in anxiety state independent of contingency. This is an issue, because the probability of punishment is extremely low given the number of trials and amount of training. This is not inappropriate, since the authors predicate the significance of their model on foraging and the example that reward seeking often involves risk. In this context, I think it is not critical that the risk be contingent on the action. It is enough that it is contingent on the rats' presence in the block or the environment. So one way to address this is to change the language in the paper to reflect this distinction, deal with this issue forthrightly in the Discussion, etc. Indeed it is a bit unclear whether the authors really mean to make the strong argument one way or the other.</p><p>Alternatively, the authors could do more to show behaviorally and also neurally that the findings reflect a learned action-outcome contingency. This is difficult to show definitively, but you might find clues by examining behavior during the pre-recording sessions to show that the punishment-associated changes increase with learning and become more closely tied to the actions. It might also be of interest to look at behavior and neural activity immediately after a punished trial (i.e. trial N+1, N+2, N+3, versus trials far removed but in the same block). Changes that reflect a true knowledge of the random 6% or 10% contingency should be stable. And obviously, adding recordings made in sessions with non-contingent punishment would also be amazingly interesting. This comparison would provide a potential additional level of detail at which the question could be asked, one that I think would increase the elegance of the work substantially no matter the outcome, but particularly if such sessions showed behavioral differences and/or neural distinctions. For example, what if the current behavior develops with learning, but neural activity recorded in the true non-contingent sessions was exactly as reported here? This would show in fact that the modulations of the dopamine activity occurred in the absence of contingency. I think this would alter the interpretation of these changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript 'Discrete and coordinated encoding of punishment contingent on reward actions by prefrontal cortex and VTA' by Park and Moghaddam sought to examine spike and LFP activity in the mPFC and VTA during a reward guided action task that contains three blocks of 50 trials each with 0, 0.06 and 0.1 action-punishment probabilities. The data reported in the manuscript show that RT to initiate an action increases as does immobility with increase probability of punishment across training blocks. Single units in the mPFC and VTA encoded the increase in punishment probability at time of action. Theta oscillations were found to be synchronized between the mPFC and VTA in a VTA&gt;&gt;mPFC direction during the rewarding 0 punishment trials, but this synchronization was disrupted when punishment was added. Further analyses showed phase modulation of neuronal spike activity in the mPFC and VTA in reward but not punishment sessions. The manuscript presents nice evidence for VTA&gt;&gt;mPFC directionality in theta oscillations using Granger causal inferences and phase-locking analyses.</p><p>The data are interesting and add to a growing body of research implicating VTA DA neurons in the integration of appetitive and aversive information. The manuscript goes further by linking the VTA and mPFC during reward action and showing that this link is disrupted when punishment is added on the background of reward. The manuscript is certainly strong and the neural analyses impressive. Below I have outlined some concerns/questions:</p><p>What is the question the manuscript is asking and attempting to answer? This isn't clear.</p><p>A substantial problem lies in the experimental design and the reference to the punishment blocks as action-punishment contingency. The wording suggests that the manuscript is explicitly examining an action followed by an aversive event. However, there is no evidence that the behaviour and neural changes seen across blocks are due to a 'contingency'. Given the few punishment trials (3/50 in block 2 and 5/50 in block 3), it is possible that random shock delivery could yield the same behavioural and neural data. Unfortunately, in the absence of these data, the conclusions would need to be altered. I feel it would be better to stick to more appropriate wording that describes the changes in the blocks as increased punishment probability on the background of rewarded actions with no claims whether the punishment needs to be contingent on the action.

For example, behavioural and neural data from the start of block 2 prior to first shock delivery would provide evidence whether the rats entered block 2 knowing about the increased shock probability (as argued in the manuscript) or behaved similarly to block 1 and altered their behaviour following the first shock presentation.

This work is of interest, adding to the growing literature of the role of VTA-DA neurons and its relationship to the mPFC and aversively-motivated behavior. It certainly has many merits including the novel behavioral paradigm and the simultaneous recordings in PFC and VTA. Perhaps the most intriguing finding, is that punishment contingencies increase the number of putative VTA-DA units that are excited at the time of action (nose-poke). It is unfortunate that the manuscript cannot shed more light on the nature of the precise connections between the VTA and mPFC or the causal relationship between their findings and behavioral output. That said, I believe this manuscript could be revised to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) One of the most significant features of this manuscript was the use of a novel behavioral paradigm. This was creative and the authors should be commended for developing this paradigm with a key control in place – the no-shock control group. However, the behavioral performance for this group were not shown. This is critically important in the readers' interpretation of the results. It is likely that the behavior within the no-shock control group would be different – if so, this could change the interpretation of the punishment-induced changes in theta/firing rate as either causing the behavioral change, resulting from a behavioral change, or signaling the perception of a punishing or potentially threatening context. I would like to see the behavior in both the experimental and control groups analyzed and displayed in greater detail to allow readers to appreciate 1) the variability within groups (animal-by-animal basis), 2) the variability between groups (was the variance greater for the punished group?), 3) the variability within-subjects (trial-to-trial variability). This should be done for both the shock and no-shock groups. I would also like to see how no-shock animals would behave under the influence of diazepam (presumably they would either have little to no change or even an increase in RT). Note that these comments can be addressed without further electrophysiology, and largely by reanalyzing data that the authors have already collected.</p><p>2) Along these lines, it would be useful to see a finer-grained time course across the session. Is the behavior stable within each block? Or is there a ramping across the session? Alternatively, do different animals respond differently at the beginning of each block?</p><p>3) The non-shock control was nice to see and convincingly controls for confounding variables such as time across the session and satiety. However, it was unclear if these are the same animals and in what order they were run, and whether these animals were naïve to the context and shock experience – please provide this information. Ideally, the experimental paradigm would have included an additional &quot;no shock&quot; block following the 3rd (10% shock) block within the same recording session to allow us to see how the same neurons would respond. While it raises the question of whether this is reversible and bidirectionally flexible, I understand that progressing nonlinearly (0%--&gt;10%--&gt;6%) may potentially be difficult to interpret since DA and/or the effects of DA receptor signaling could persist. But the time course of returning to baseline would be valuable to see.</p><p>4) The authors correctly described their groups as &quot;putative VTA DA&quot; in one figure but then proceed to refer to these neurons as &quot;VTA DA neurons&quot; throughout the rest of the manuscript. Without further support (using a genetic indicator for dopamine in addition to electrophysiological characteristics), they must refer to these neurons as putative throughout the manuscript (at least in the figures). At this point in the field, it is common to see both genetically-identified (using a histologically-verified transgenic rodent line, and sometimes even multiple lines) DA neurons as well as studies using electrophysiologically-identified DA neurons which has been shown to be a less reliable method for identification.

In other words, would the same effect have been achieved by delivering increasing numbers of non-contingent shocks in the blocks? The reviews mention several ways to address this analytically in the current data or by running a behavioral group and/or recording group with non-contingent shock. If it cannot be clearly established that the current results reflect contingency and/or the authors do not want to run more subjects, then it might be acceptable to refrain from making strong claims about this in the Introduction and Results, and then discuss the possibilities in the Discussion. The current design is obviously appropriate to model predator risks during foraging anyway, as predators are not contingent on picking a berry necessarily. But in this case, the reviewers want to emphasize that the changes to the way this is described in the Introduction and Results must be substantive, removing up front claims that there is an action-punishment contingency. It was also felt that a finer grained analysis of individual rats' behavior and neural activity might be useful in addressing this question and more generally.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid concern; it was clearly an oversight not to include more behavioral data in the original manuscript. We have made the following text revisions and addition of new data to address this major concern:</p><p>1) We have removed up front claims on acquisition of action-punishment “contingency.” In fact, the word “contingency” has been removed from most of the text including the title. Instead, we refer to the primary manipulation of our task as punishment risk. We have also added a discussion of this concern in the subsection “VTA and mPFC Neurons represent risk of punishment on different timescales”. For us, the overarching scientific question of the study was how risk of punishment lurking in the background of reward-seeking behavior is represented by the VTA-mPFC neural ensembles. Thus, this change in wording provides a better representation of the work.</p><p>2) As requested by reviewers, we provide additional data to reveal that risk of punishment increases trial-to-trial variability in reaction time in individual animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also include new data to show that neural population trajectories of simultaneously recorded units significantly correlated with the trial-to-trial variation of reaction times. These new analyses suggest that the VTA and mPFC ensembles track the behavioral alteration as a function of punishment risk on a trial-by-trial basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).</p><p>3) The current task design does have the punishment contingent on the action albeit at low probabilities (0.06 or 0.1). To support this point, we have added a video showing the stereotypical pattern of action in the face of punishment risk as a qualitative evidence for the contingency representation. This video shows that animals are timid/cautious at the time of instrumental action and make many “incomplete” nose pokes, which is never the case for nose pokes to the food trough. The latter is mechanically the same action to which punishment was never contingent on. Given this, we discuss possibilities that behavioral and neural correlates of punishment risk may be due both to state dependent effects and partial learning of action-punishment contingency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other important, but less essential points are outlined below.</p><p>Title: According to eLife guidelines, I believe it needs to mention the model species.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] For me the overriding question is whether the rats understand the contingency between their behavior and the punishment or whether the behavior and resultant neural changes reflect a change in anxiety state independent of contingency. This is an issue, because the probability of punishment is extremely low given the number of trials and amount of training. This is not inappropriate, since the authors predicate the significance of their model on foraging and the example that reward seeking often involves risk. In this context, I think it is not critical that the risk be contingent on the action. It is enough that it is contingent on the rats' presence in the block or the environment. So one way to address this is to change the language in the paper to reflect this distinction, deal with this issue forthrightly in the Discussion, etc. Indeed it is a bit unclear whether the authors really mean to make the strong argument one way or the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this was a major issue – please see our general response above as well as the new text in Discussion subsection “VTA and mPFC Neurons represent risk of punishment on different timescales”.

This isn't clear.</p><p>A substantial problem lies in the experimental design and the reference to the punishment blocks as action-punishment contingency. The wording suggests that the manuscript is explicitly examining an action followed by an aversive event. However, there is no evidence that the behaviour and neural changes seen across blocks are due to a 'contingency'. Given the few punishment trials (3/50 in block 2 and 5/50 in block 3), it is possible that random shock delivery could yield the same behavioural and neural data. Unfortunately, in the absence of these data, the conclusions would need to be altered. I feel it would be better to stick to more appropriate wording that describes the changes in the blocks as increased punishment probability on the background of rewarded actions with no claims whether the punishment needs to be contingent on the action.

We decided against including this data in the original (and revised) manuscript because the number of cell pairs with meaningful cross-correlations was low. The small sample size would make it difficult for us to validly quantify how the neuronal pairwise interaction alters across blocks. We believe the interaction and potential alteration by punishment risk is a critical issue that can be better addressed in a future study with larger sampling of cell pairs (using a high-density silicon probe) ideally with a better labelling of cell identities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is hard to know if the rats knew about the upcoming shock probabilities in Block 2 and 3 or if they learned about those on the fly (i.e. state vs. learning effects).

These results suggest that animals were aware of the upcoming increase in punishment risk at least to some extent due to learning effects. On the other hand, we show that RT varies significantly across trials as a function of the trial lag from the previous shock trial in block 2 and 3. This variation in RT is suggestive of state effects on animals’ behavior. Considering these, we do not believe nor claim that behavioral changes we observed are due exclusively to either learning or state effect. Our data rather suggest that both learning and state effects contribute to behavioral changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall, I am enthusiastic about this study – though I do have some suggestions for improving the manuscript.
