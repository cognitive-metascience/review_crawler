In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, mild developmental mitochondrial stress activates UPR<sup>mt</sup> reporters and extends lifespan. We show that similar developmental stress is necessary and sufficient to extend <italic>Drosophila</italic> lifespan, and identify Phosphoglycerate Mutase 5 (PGAM5) as a mediator of this response. Developmental mitochondrial stress leads to activation of FoxO, via Apoptosis Signal-regulating Kinase 1 (ASK1) and Jun-N-terminal Kinase (JNK). This activation persists into adulthood and induces a select set of chaperones, many of which have been implicated in lifespan extension in flies. Persistent FoxO activation can be reversed by a high-protein diet in adulthood, through mTORC1 and GCN-2 activity. Accordingly, the observed lifespan extension is prevented on a high-protein diet and in FoxO-null flies. The diet-sensitivity of this pathway has important implications for interventions that seek to engage the UPR<sup>mt</sup> to improve metabolic health and longevity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>UPRmt</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial signaling</kwd><kwd>PGAM5</kwd><kwd>FoxO</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG028127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yanyan</given-names></name><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>Rebeccah</given-names></name><name><surname>Jasper</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Breakthroughs in Gerontology Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasper</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007469</institution-id><institution>Alfred Benzon Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borch Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG050104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yanyan</given-names></name><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>Rebeccah</given-names></name><name><surname>Jasper</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A signaling pathway involving PGAM5, ASK1 and JNK induces persistent FoxO activation, chaperone expression and lifespan extension following developmental mitochondrial stress, which can be blocked by mTOR signaling through GCN-2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A wide range of studies in genetically accessible model systems have led to the realization that aging is a malleable process, responsive to both genetic and pharmacological interventions. An integrated view of the aging process has emerged from these efforts, spurred by the identification of a select group of biological processes and pathways that drive, influence, and regulate the physical decline characteristic of the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>). Many of these pathways involve mitochondria: either through their role in metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2016</xref>), as a source of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaban et al., 2005</xref>), or as signaling hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandel, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) has emerged as a unifying mechanism for several of these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen and Jasper, 2014</xref>). As the name implies, the UPR<sup>mt</sup> is a conserved cellular mechanism that serves to restore proteostasis in mitochondria. The response was first described in mammalian cells more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>) and has since been studied primarily in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> In worms, strong evidence suggests that the UPR<sup>mt</sup> is involved in delaying aging and promoting adult lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durieux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merkwirth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang and Hekimi, 2010</xref>). This work has revealed the UPR<sup>mt</sup> to be reminiscent of, but distinct from, the cytoplasmic (heat shock) and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haynes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2010</xref>). Through the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, mitochondrial stress induces a nuclear transcriptional response that promotes the expression of a group of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldridge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoneda et al., 2004</xref>). The primary transcription factor in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is ATFS-1, which is regulated by membrane potential-dependent import into and degradation in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nargund et al., 2012</xref>). Mitochondrial stress blocks this import and ATFS-1 instead moves to the nucleus, where it interacts with DVE-1 and UBL-5 to turn on the transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benedetti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haynes et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to proteostatic elements, this response includes a metabolic reconfiguration to increase glycolytic capacity while restoring oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nargund et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, a separate branch of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> mediates a general downregulation of translation, through GCN-2 and eIF2Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for the evolutionary conservation of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> has emerged in recent years. In mice, perturbation of mitochondrial translation has been implicated in long lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>), and recent findings have revealed the conservation of the ATFS-1 regulated transcriptional response (mediated by ATF5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorese et al., 2016</xref>)). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a UPR<sup>mt</sup>-like response was first described in a paradigm where a misfolding ornithine transcarbamylase (ÎOTC) was overexpressed, resulting in upregulation of mitochondrial chaperones and induction of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pimenta de Castro et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, knocking down electron transport chain (ETC) components has been shown to extend lifespan and to induce the UPR<sup>mt</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Copeland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013</xref>). However, the signaling pathway mediating UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains to be clarified. ETC knockdown results in induction of the insulin signaling inhibitor ImpL2, and promotes the expression of target genes of the insulin-regulated transcription factor Forkhead Box O (FoxO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013</xref>). FoxO activation is a well-established lifespan-extending condition, yet its involvement and specific regulation in this context remain to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kappeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Selman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tatar et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Activation of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> has also been implicated in the lifespan-extending effects of various drugs, including resveratrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>), rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>) and NAD precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, it is not clear which cellular consequences of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> contribute to organismal health, nor whether resistance to a particular type of stress underlies lifespan extension by the UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Indeed, the generic view that stimulating this response invariably leads to longer life has been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding how conserved elements of UPR<sup>mt</sup> signaling connect to longevity pathways will be useful in resolving this contention.</p><p>An interesting observation from both fly and worm studies is that lifespan extension by the UPR<sup>mt</sup> is contingent upon its activation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durieux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013</xref>). This is consistent with earlier observations that lifespan extension by disrupting the ETC in some cases require developmental treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Copeland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rea et al., 2007</xref>). An important step toward understanding this lasting effect came from work in worms, in which the UPR<sup>mt</sup> leads to changes in histone methylation and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merkwirth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2016</xref>). The H3K27 demethylases <italic>jmjd-1.2</italic> and <italic>â3.1</italic> were found to be required for UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation and lifespan extension, while the histone methylase <italic>met-2</italic> is required for induction of most UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes. This effect involves global chromatin condensation, while opening up specific sites for occupation by DVE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2016</xref>). The loci thus revealed have yet to be characterized, so the lasting cellular changes and longevity pathways influenced by these epigenetic mechanisms remain unclear.</p><p>Here, we have explored the signaling pathway regulating the transcriptional response to mitochondrial proteostatic stress in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and have identified a role for persistent FoxO activation in promoting longevity after developmental mitochondrial stress. We find that Phosphoglycerate Mutase 5 (PGAM5) is required to activate a pathway that includes ASK1, JNK, Relish and FoxO and promotes protective gene expression in response to mitochondrial stress. Activation of this pathway during development leads to persistent FoxO activation and increased expression of chaperones in adult flies, and is required for longevity. We further find that lasting FoxO activation is sensitive to dietary conditions, as it can be abolished by elevated protein intake and elevated mTORC1 and GCN-2 activity. Our findings identify a new diet-sensitive pathway of lifespan regulation by mitochondrial stress. Since the identified pathway components are evolutionarily conserved, we anticipate that these results inform our understanding of similar interactions in vertebrate systems, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acute mitochondrial stress upregulates proteostatic, immune and stress signaling pathways through PGAM5- and JNK-dependent FoxO activation</title><p>To gain an overview of the gene expression changes induced by the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we sequenced mRNA extracted from adult female thoracic tissue after 24 hr of mitochondrial stress.

Initial experiments confirmed these phenotypes in both male and female flies (data not shown), and we opted to use females for all following experiments.</p><p>Activation of a transcriptional program that includes immune response genes by the UPR<sup>mt</sup> has previously been noted in worms, where both immune and proteostatic gene induction is dependent on the ATFS-1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nargund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pellegrino et al., 2014</xref>). Since a homologous mediator of the response to mitochondrial stress in flies had not been described, we set out to identify transcription factors that could mediate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in this organism. We performed a targeted RNAi screen of transcription factors known to regulate immune and stress genes. Of the two methods initially used to induce the mitochondrial proteostatic stress, we opted to use ÎOTC for further experiments to minimize potential secondary effects of inducing ETC dysfunction. Because of its robust, specific and stable induction, we focused on the expression of the antimicrobial peptide <italic>metchnikowin</italic> (<italic>Mtk</italic>) as a reporter of mitochondrial stress.

Because RNAseq further suggested activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and since JNK has been reported to regulate FoxO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), we asked whether knocking down the <italic>Drosophila</italic> JNK <italic>basket</italic> (<italic>bsk</italic>) would prevent <italic>Mtk</italic> induction.

Since our data showed that the pathway responsible for activating immune-response genes during mitochondrial stress is also required for longevity, we hypothesized that the UPR<sup>mt</sup> might extend lifespan by improving the ability to fight off infections and/or by altering the microbiome. To test this hypothesis, we repeated our lifespan experiments in two conditions where flies are not exposed to microbes; in one condition, eggs were washed in bleach (HClO) to eliminate microbes, then transferred to a sterile hood and reared on autoclaved food throughout development and adult life. In the second condition, we added a cocktail of antibiotics shown to eliminate all culturable strains of the microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>) to the food of adult flies. Both conditions prevent pathogen exposure and eliminate the adult microbiome, while the first condition further prevents the formation of a larval microbiome. In both cases, we observed increased median and maximal lifespan after developmental ÎOTC expression, just as in flies reared normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2eâf</xref>). Larval ÎOTC expression also did not affect pathogen resistance at day 7 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3a</xref>).

To test whether this high-protein diet affects FoxO localization through the main amino-acid-sensing pathway mTORC1, we repeated this experiment with supplementation of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin at 200 ÂµM. This prevented the loss of nuclear FoxO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that mTORC1 activation can override the persistent nuclear translocation of FoxO produced by developmental ÎOTC expression. In support of this role for mTORC1, activating mTORC1 during developmental stress (by RNAi of its inhibitor TSC1) prevents lasting FoxO activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, left), while reducing developmental survival in the same manner as FoxO deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, simultaneous over-expression of TSC1 and 2 to inhibit mTORC1 activity in adult flies is sufficient to promote nuclear translocation of FoxO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, right). mTORC1 activity has previously been reported to inhibit the FoxA ortholog Fork Head by preventing its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">BÃ¼low et al., 2010</xref>). This involves signaling through the protein kinase GCN-2, which has previously been implicated in the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, overexpression of GCN-2 was sufficient to induce nuclear localization of FoxO, while knocking down GCN-2 during developmental ÎOTC expression abrogates the lasting effect on FoxO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). To test whether GCN-2 acts downstream of mTORC1 in this context, we knocked down GCN-2 in flies treated with rapamycin and observed a reduction in nuclear FoxO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><p>Because FoxO activity is required for lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and a high-protein diet erases the persistent FoxO activation seen after developmental ÎOTC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), we hypothesized that adult diet would affect the longevity effects of mitochondrial proteostatic stres. To test this hypothesis, we repeated our lifespan experiment with developmental ÎOTC expression but switched flies to the high-protein diet after eclosion. The high-protein diet reduced the lifespan of the control group relative to our standard fly food, consistent with previous literature, but also completely abolished the lifespan extension normally induced by ÎOTC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). This supports our proposed pathway for lifespan extension, and suggests diet as an important regulator of beneficial UPR<sup>mt</sup> effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data identify a signaling pathway that responds to mitochondrial proteostatic stress through the phosphatase PGAM5, leading to activation of JNK and FoxO. This results in the FoxO- and Rel-mediated induction of immune, antioxidant and metabolic gene expression, as well as of genes encoding heat shock proteins. When activated during development, FoxO remains active throughout life, inducing a select group of genes that extend lifespan. Interestingly, this activity is subject to regulation by GCN-2/mTORC1-dependent nutrient sensing, providing a clue for how diet may interfere with lifespan extending stress signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26952.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for UPR<sup>mt</sup>-mediated longevity.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26952-fig6-v3"/></fig><p>Our genetic studies suggest a pathway of UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation from the mitochondrial membrane protein PGAM5, through ASK1 and JNK, to the FoxO transcription factor. FoxO increases the expression of Relish, and thereby induces antimicrobial peptide expression. Persistent activation of FoxO also leads to lasting upregulation of chaperones, which improves proteostasis and extends lifespan. Meanwhile, sensing of amino acids can activate mTORC1 and GCN-2, which negate the persistent activation of FoxO and block lifespan extension.</p><p>PGAM5 has not been fully characterized but plays a role in regulating cell death pathways in flies and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhuang et al., 2013</xref>). It has been reported to localize to either the inner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lo and Hannink, 2008</xref>) or outer mitochondrial membrane, where it is cleaved upon loss of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sekine et al., 2012</xref>). While a member of the PGAM family based on sequence, it displays phosphatase rather than mutase activity in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takeda et al., 2009</xref>). PGAM5 also interacts with the mitophagy factor PINK1, and loss of <italic>PGAM5</italic> rescues the muscle degeneration phenotype of <italic>dPINK1</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of PGAM5 inhibits mitophagy in vitro, and leads to Parkinsonâs-like symptoms in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Regulation of mitophagy by PGAM5 may depend on its interaction with the PARL protease, which is normally responsible for cleaving PINK1 to prevent mitophagy of healthy mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sekine et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, induction of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in HeLa cells has been reported to trigger PINK1 accumulation, Parkin recruitment and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin and Youle, 2013</xref>). In our experiments, PGAM5 does not seem to regulate longevity directly by stimulating apoptosis, however, suggesting a more complicated biological role for this phosphatase. It is tempting to speculate that it may act as a rheostat to dictate whether mitochondrial stress results in UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation, mitophagy, or cell death. Further exploration of the intra-mitochondrial signals that activate PGAM5, as well as its immediate downstream partners, should be interesting topics for future studies of mitochondrial stress.</p><p>The importance of developmental activation of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> for lifespan extension was previously observed in studies exploring this mitochondrial stress response and the response to ETC dysfunction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Copeland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durieux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rea et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings confirm this and identify persistent FoxO activation and FoxO-induced gene expression as associated with the lasting benefits of developmental mitochondrial stress in the adult organism. Two recent papers have identified a role for the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in regulating histone methylation and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merkwirth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2016</xref>). The studies show that demethylase activity during developmental UPR<sup>mt</sup> is required for lifespan extension, and that <italic>atfs-1</italic> acts synergistically with these epigenetic changes. It will be interesting to explore the interplay between elevated FoxO activity and demethylase-regulated chromatin accessibility in future studies.</p><p>The hypothesis that a combination of signaling and epigenetic changes are required for UPR<sup>mt</sup> longevity could help explain recent reports that commonly used UPR<sup>mt</sup> reporters in <italic>C. elegans</italic> correlate poorly with longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ren et al., 2015</xref>): the UPR<sup>mt</sup> likely involves several pathways, which can also be activated by other stimuli. However, a crucial combination of signaling and epigenetic changes could be induced by specific types of mitochondrial stress. This would prompt caution about using a single gene reporter as a measure of âUPR<sup>mt</sup> activationâ and suggest using multiple assays to determine its role in each biological process. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism other than <italic>C. elegans</italic> showing improved longevity from UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation that does not involve direct ETC disruption. This lends support to the UPR<sup>mt</sup> as a conserved longevity mechanism, which overlaps with but is not fully explained by ETC function.</p><p>Our work also provides further support for the observation that the UPR<sup>mt</sup> triggers the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pellegrino et al., 2014</xref>) and shows that this feature is conserved outside of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. As in worms, this activation provides acute resistance to infection in flies, but we find that immune function is not responsible for the effects of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> on longevity. The activation of antimicrobial gene expression in response to FoxO activation is not surprising, as it has previously been reported that the FoxO transcription factor can induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides independently of classical innate immune pathways in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, we have shown previously that FoxO activation in the larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body can induce <italic>Relish</italic>/<italic>NF-ÎºB</italic> signaling by stimulating <italic>Rel</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karpac et al., 2011</xref>). Our data indicate that mitochondrial proteostatic stress activates this FoxO/Relish cassette, but that the FoxO-dependent upregulation of chaperones in adult flies is likely responsible for lifespan extension.</p><p>Our results are also consistent with reports that the UPR<sup>mt</sup> can be activated by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>) and identify high-protein diet as a critical intervention that activates mTORC1 and overrides the positive effects of developmental mitochondrial stress. It was also previously reported that NAD precursors and <italic>sirt-2.1</italic> activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> and extend lifespan in a <italic>daf-16</italic>/<italic>FOXO</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>). Our experiments did not suggest a role for NAD precursors or <italic>Sirt2</italic> in regulating the <italic>Drosophila</italic> UPR<sup>mt</sup>, but it remains possible that exploring different sirtuins or dietary conditions could reveal such a role. This is especially true in light of the observed effect of diet on UPR<sup>mt</sup> activity and lifespan extension. The regulation of FoxO by amino acid sensing/mTORC1 rather than insulin signaling is surprising, but is supported by a previous observation that mTORC1 activity regulates longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through activation of <italic>daf-16</italic>/<italic>FOXO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These findings thus reveal a critical vulnerability of developmental UPR<sup>mt</sup>-mediated physiological changes that promote longevity: they can be erased by a high-protein diet. If the observed mTORC1-induced signaling interactions are conserved in vertebrates, this has important implications for the development of interventions that aim to engage the UPR<sup>mt</sup> to increase metabolic health and extend health- or lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>The following lines were obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, <italic>y<sup>1</sup> w<sup>1</sup></italic>, Da::GS, tub::GS, <italic>PGAM5</italic> RNAi (#34744), <italic>ASK1</italic> RNAi (#32646), <italic>foxo<sup>21</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">JÃ¼nger et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>foxo<sup>Î94</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slack et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>bsk</italic><sup>DN</sup> (#6409).</p><p>The following lines were obtained from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Center: <italic>Hrd1</italic> RNAi (#6870), <italic>PGAM5</italic> RNAi (#51657), <italic>ASK1</italic> RNAi (#110228), <italic>TSC1</italic> RNAi (#110811), <italic>bsk</italic> RNAi (#34138), <italic>foxo</italic> RNAi (#30556).</p><p>The following lines were gifts from other labs: UAS-ÎOTC (Martins lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pimenta de Castro et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>PGAM5<sup>1</sup></italic> (Ichijo lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imai et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>jun</italic> and <italic>fos</italic> RNAi (Bohmann lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hyun et al., 2006</xref>)), UAS-<italic>GCN-2</italic> and <italic>GCN-2</italic> RNAi (Leopold lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>), UAS-TSC1 and TSC2 (Tatar lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hwangbo et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>ND75</italic> and <italic>Rel</italic> RNAi (Perrimon lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agaisse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly husbandry and demographics</title><p>Standard fly food was prepared with the following recipe: 1 l distilled water, 13 g agar, 22 g molasses, 65 g malt extract, 18 g brewerâs yeast, 80 g corn flour, 10 g soy flour, 6.2 ml propionic acid, 2 g methyl-p-benzoate in 7.3 ml of EtOH.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Utpal Banerjee, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Edward Owusu-Ansah (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and appreciate the importance of the findings and the overall quality of the data. The summary of these reviews and discussions are summarised below by the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>A set of specific issues raised by the reviewers that we believe can be addressed by new experiments and/or rewriting the manuscript are summarized below as &quot;other concerns&quot;. However, there is one major issue that needs special attention. During the post-review discussions, the reviewers unanimously agree that the data lack direct evidence for a sustained FOXO activation (which, as the title suggests, is central to the conclusions derived from this work).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper Jensen et al. investigate how mitochondrial dysfunction during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development leads to a stress response that has lasting effects on the flies, most notably on extension of lifespan. The authors characterize the steps that signal mitochondrial dysfunction to modulate nuclear gene expression, using an immune response gene as an output. In adult flies that were subjected to mitochondrial stress during development, a subset of stress response genes are expressed (even though the original stimulus is removed); it is proposed that these genes (all FoxO targets) mediate lifespan extension. The lasting effects of developmental mitochondrial dysfunction can be reversed through exposure to a high protein diet during adulthood.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(major concerns):</p><p>The key weakness regards the study's (implied) inference on the role of lasting FoxO activation as the longevity mechanism. Epistasis analysis is needed to test this idea.</p><p>The important required study is to conduct mtUPR (in any way) in FoxO-null epistasis. Alternatively, the authors could test the effect of co-expression of the OTC construct and RNAi to FoxO, using the gene-switch system. This approach allows the genotype without RU to serve as its own co-isogenic control. One needs to measure the longevity of the OTC expression alone, using geneswitch again, to confirm there is a longevity benefit in that period. And, one should do the same by driving the FoxO RNAi with the same geneswitch (which should do very little to the survival).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(other concerns):</p><p>1) Are phenotypes due to a UPR<sup>mt</sup> stress response per se? How much is due to a more general response caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. This is unclear because of the nature of mitochondrial stressors. ND75 knockdown will cause mitochondrial dysfunction (possibly affecting ATP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ROS, NADH, NAD+ etc.). The ÎOTC mutant in flies also severely impacts mitochondrial function (ATP, oxygen consumption etc.). Therefore, it is not clear that a UPR<sup>mt</sup> or some other type of mitochondrial stress response is being studied. Presumably studies in worms, where chaperone up-regulation has clear linkage to UPR<sup>mt</sup> provides the inspiration, but this is not yet in flies. For example, ÎOTC causes ETC dysfunction in flies (Pimenta de Castro et al. 2012). If this is not true for this system, then some functional data are required, or the description of the model should be modified.</p><p>2) Is the PGAM5/ASK/JNK signaling pathway a bona fide UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway (analogous to the ATFS-1)? If a chaperone important in the UPR<sup>mt</sup> response affecting proteostasis directly was chosen as a marker rather than a gene involved in the immune response, then the relation of this new signaling pathway to UPR<sup>mt</sup> could be better assessed. Either a more specific UPR<sup>mt</sup> output marker should be used, or discussion of UPR<sup>mt</sup> should be reserved for the Discussion.</p><p>3) In the same vein, it is unclear whether the canonical markers of the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, such as Hsp60, Hsp10, mortalin (mt-Hsp70) and the ClpP protease are induced under the conditions used to activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in this study. The authors should comment on this, and provide a possible explanation for this apparent disparity.</p><p>4) The exact dosages of RU456 used in the gene-switch experiments should be listed in the figure legends.</p><p>5) The link between UPR<sup>mt</sup> and longevity is not yet settled, and while this work provides important advancements, the authors will do well to tone down the enthusiasm with which they link expression of the OTC construct with UPR<sup>mt</sup> induction. OTC induces other genes as well (such as antimicrobial peptides). Therefore several bold statements such as the subheading &quot;UPR<sup>mt</sup>-mediated longevity is not caused by improved adult immune function, or by changes to the microbiome&quot; and &quot;Developmental UPR<sup>mt</sup> affects the metabolic state of adult flies and leads to persistent FoxO&quot; or (based on point 1 above), &quot;Of the two methods initially used to induce the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, we opted to use ÎOTC for further experiments to avoid potential secondary effects of inducing ETC dysfunction&quot; should be modified to reflect the fact that the results observed are due to OTC expression and not necessarily all due to the UPR<sup>mt</sup>.</p><p>6) ADaGSxOTC itself yields less than 50% eclosion. Survivors of this cohort may live longer because of frailty selection: weak larvae that would produce shorter-lived adults do not eclose. Some rescue-type data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) argues against this potential confound, but the evidence is thin.</p><p>7) UPR<sup>mt</sup> induced in adults activates FoxO, but such cohorts are not long-lived when RU is constantly applied. That FoxO is only transiently activated when RU is given for just one week is not a satisfactory explanation.</p><p>8) The data with HPD is unclear. Presumably, HPD resets both this TF and the lifespan, and this is used to infer causality between the induced longevity and FoxO activation. But in the sole survival experiment to this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), the shape of the plots is a concern: they are too linear, suggesting that age-independent mortality is the overriding cause of death. This can mask any potential impact on age-dependent mortality; and there are no data to rule this out (or in). Perhaps the HPD is toxic, and all flies die for reasons besides aging. There are no other data to address the relevance of activated FoxO (by any of the interesting, observed mechanisms) as relevant to the larval UPR<sup>mt</sup> impact on adult longevity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26952.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(major concerns):</p><p>The key weakness regards the study's (implied) inference on the role of lasting FoxO activation as the longevity mechanism.

Per the reviewerâs suggestions, we have now carried out duplicate lifespan experiments where DaGS was used to drive ÎOTC expression in a FoxO null background (the foxo<sup>Î94/21</sup> transheterozygotes already described in the manuscript). In parallel, we replicated the DaGS x ÎOTC lifespan experiment already included in the paper. In support of our model, developmental mitochondrial stress leads to a significant shortening of lifespan in FoxO null flies, in sharp contrast to the lifespan extension observed in normal flies. The FoxO null data is presented in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, alongside statistics for the positive control in 2G. The graph for the positive control is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>. Combined with our observations of drastically reduced survival through developmental mitochondrial stress in FoxO nulls (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), this solidifies FoxO activity as a necessary factor for the lifespan extension elicited by developmental mitochondrial stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(other concerns):</p><p>1) Are phenotypes due to a UPR<sup>mt</sup> stress response per se?

In our original manuscript, we decided to follow the nomenclature of previous studies (Pimenta de Castro et al. 2012, Owusu-Ansah et al. 2013). However, to our knowledge (and as suggested by the reviewers), all methods of inducing the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in any organism leads to mitochondrial dysfunction of some sort. It does not yet seem clear whether and which such dysfunctions should be classified as causative or part of the UPR<sup>mt</sup>. For example, some parts of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> have been characterized as ROS-dependent. We originally chose to define the UPR<sup>mt</sup>as any response occurring in two distinct types of mitochondrial proteostatic stress, but we agree with the reviewersâ point that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> UPR<sup>mt</sup> remains imperfectly described. We have thus rewritten several parts of the manuscript to refer to âmitochondrial stressâ rather than UPR<sup>mt</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the PGAM5/ASK/JNK signaling pathway a bona fide UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway (analogous to the ATFS-1)?

For this reason, the markers mentioned by reviewers were not included in the set of 3-fold upregulated genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and we chose <italic>metchnikowin</italic> as our marker for subsequent screens due to its higher dynamic range of induction.</p><p>To address the pertinent comments by the reviewers, we have added a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) showing that expression of ÎOTC using the regime reported in Owusu-Ansah et al. leads to a similar upregulation of hsp60, hsc70-5 and hsp10. We further show that this induction is blocked in the absence of PGAM5, bsk or FoxO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The exact dosages of RU456 used in the gene-switch experiments should be listed in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>200 Î¼m RU486 was used throughout, and this has now been added to figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The link between UPR<sup>mt</sup> and longevity is not yet settled, and while this work provides important advancements, the authors will do well to tone down the enthusiasm with which they link expression of the OTC construct with UPR<sup>mt</sup> induction.

In response to the comment that âOTC induces other genes as well (such as antimicrobial peptides).â, we note that Pellegrino et al. 2014 showed that AMPs are induced by ATFS-1 activation even absent mitochondrial stress, and were thus described as part of the core UPR<sup>mt</sup> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) ADaGSxOTC itself yields less than 50% eclosion.

However, our new FoxO null lifespan data shows that FoxO activity not only correlates with, but is required for lifespan extension. It is pertinent to this specific concern that while FoxO null mutants show strongly reduced survival through developmental ÎOTC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), even the survivors showed reduced adult lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Our interpretation is that the negative effects of chronically impairing mitochondrial function through expression of ÎOTC has detrimental effects that overshadow the improved proteostasis conferred by activating the FoxO pathway. This is consistent with observations by Pimenta-Castro et al. 2012, who show impaired mitochondrial function and survival with chronic adult ÎOTC expression. In the case of developmentally expressed ÎOTC, on the other hand, the mitochondrial stress is eliminated in adults while FoxO activation is retained chronically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The data with HPD is unclear.

There are no other data to address the relevance of activated FoxO (by any of the interesting, observed mechanisms) as relevant to the larval UPR<sup>mt</sup> impact on adult longevity.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have now obtained additional evidence that FoxO activity is required for lifespan extension by developmental ÎOTC expression (new lifespan data for null mutants). We have edited the manuscript to merely note that the lack of extension on HPD is consistent with our demonstration that HPD blocks FoxO activation and with the fact that FoxO is required for lifespan extension by developmental mitochondrial stress.</p></body></sub-article></article>
