Inversely, NGFR ablation activates p53, consequently inducing apoptosis, attenuating survival, and reducing clonogenic capability of cancer cells, as well as sensitizing human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents that induce p53 and suppressing mouse xenograft tumor growth. NGFR is highly expressed in human glioblastomas, and its gene is often amplified in breast cancers with wild type p53. Altogether, our results demonstrate that cancers hijack NGFR as an oncogenic inhibitor of p53.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15099.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15099.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15099.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer often develops as a result of alterations to “tumor suppressor” genes within cells. This results in the cells growing and dividing too much, which causes a tumor to form. One of the most important tumor suppressor genes produces a protein called p53, which is lost or mutated in roughly half of all human cancers. In the other half of cancers p53 itself is normal, but is often disabled by proteins that promote tumor growth.</p><p>One of the remaining challenges in the field of cancer research is to identify which proteins inhibit p53 directly. Identifying these proteins would help clarify why many human cancers, such as some brain cancers, breast and skin cancers, often maintain a normal form of the p53 tumor suppressor protein.</p><p>Zhou et al. now provide evidence that shows that a protein called nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) is one such protein. NGFR was known to be important for the healthy development of the brain and nervous system. Unexpectedly, however, Zhou et al. found that NGFR binds directly to p53 and disables it in several types of human cancer cells. This finding is likely to be important because NGFR is produced in abnormally high amounts in several human cancer types, including skin, breast, bone and some brain cancers.</p><p>Reducing the levels of NGFR in cancer cells caused the cells to become more sensitive to some anti-cancer drugs. Overall, the results presented by Zhou et al. suggest that developing new drugs that target NGFR could produce new treatments for human cancers that have a normal form of the gene that produces p53. More experiments are also needed to find out whether NGFR has other ways of promoting the development of cancerous tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15099.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15099.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NGFR</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>MDM2</kwd><kwd>protein stability</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>cell viability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31171359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Shiwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31460305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Shiwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81472607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Shiwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA095441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA172468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA127724-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA190775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) protein regulates p53 via two negative feedback mechanisms, which are hijacked by cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumorigenesis is highly associated with inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53, as it is mutated in ~50% of all types of human cancers, and its functions are impaired through various mechanisms in the rest of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine and Oren, 2009</xref>). p53 executes its tumor suppressive function mainly by inducing the expression of a large number of genes involved in cell cycle control, senescence, apoptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the detrimental effects of p53 on normal cells, the cells have developed mechanisms to monitor its activity, which are often hijacked by cancer cells.</p><p>One key monitor of p53 is MDM2 (HDM2 in human), an oncoprotein encoded by a p53 transcriptional target gene that is amplified or overexpressed in several human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fakharzadeh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Momand et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliner et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 1993</xref>). MDM2 inhibits p53 activity primarily by binding to and concealing the N-terminal transcriptional activation (TA) domain of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oliner et al., 1993</xref>) and by mediating its poly-ubiquitination and proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haupt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubbutat et al., 1997</xref>). Genetically, disruption of the <italic>TP53</italic> gene completely rescues the lethal phenotype of Mdm2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montes de Oca Luna et al., 1995</xref>). A myriad of stresses can orchestrate this MDM2-p53 feedback loop. The ARF tumor suppressor directly associates with MDM2 and inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation upon oncogenic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zindy et al., 1998</xref>). Also, several ribosomal proteins boost p53 activation by untying the MDM2-p53 loop in response to ribosomal or nucleolar stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2015a</xref>). But, oncogenic proteins can enhance MDM2 E3 ligase activity towards p53. MDMX (also called MDM4), the MDM2 homologue, can enhance MDM2-mediated p53 proteasomal degradation by binding to MDM2, besides directly interacting with p53 and repressing its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shvarts et al., 1996</xref>). High expression of MDM2 and MDMX in several cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma, is often considered as the reason why these cancers sustain wild type (wt) p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wade et al., 2013</xref>), but this could only account for a portion of wt p53-harboring cancers. Thus, it is still unknown if there are other proteins that can also suppress p53 function in the remaining cancers.</p><p>In this study, we revealed a novel feedback regulation of p53 by <underline>n</underline>erve <underline>g</underline>rowth <underline>f</underline>actor <underline>r</underline>eceptor (NGFR, also called p75NTR or CD271). NGFR is a 75 kD single-transmembrane protein without kinase activity and widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2004</xref>). Often partnering with other receptors, such as TrkA, it is involved in a multitude of processes during neurogenesis, such as neural cell death, neuronal differentiation, neurite growth, and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2004</xref>). Also, the NGF-NGFR cascade activates NF-κB, leading to inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 1996</xref>) and increased survival of schwannoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gentry et al., 2000</xref>) and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Descamps et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, overexpression of NGFR observed in many metastatic cancers promotes tumor migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Civenni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>). But, in prostate and bladder cancers, NGFR appears to suppress tumor growth and/or metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krygier and Djakiew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tabassum et al., 2003</xref>). It remains largely elusive why and how NGFR plays opposite roles in the context of different cancers.</p><p>These studies together with our initial findings that p53 binds to the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter and induces its expression in cancer cells motivated us to further explore the functional interplay between NGFR and p53, and its role in cancer development. As detailed below, we surprisingly found that NGFR inactivates p53 by directly binding to its central DNA-binding domain and preventing its association with its target promoters and by enhancing its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis. This function is ligand-independent because it occurred in the nucleus and without ligand treatment of cancer cells. Biologically, cancer cells hijack the negative feedback regulation of p53 by NGFR to their growth advantage, as down regulation of NGFR induced p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest as well as suppressed tumor growth. Furthermore, NGFR was found to be highly expressed in 68.75% (33/48) of human gliomas examined. Consistently, NGFR is amplified in breast cancers that harbor wt TP53 based on the TCGA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, our discovery of NGFR as another feedback suppressor of p53 could explain why some cancers sustain wt p53 and also suggest NGFR as a potential target for the development of new anti-cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>NGFR</italic> is a bona fide transcriptional target of p53</title><p>From our previous studies to assess the global effects of Inauhzin (INZ) on p53 pathway in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao et al., 2012</xref>), we identified <italic>NGFR</italic> as a potential p53-regulated gene. To confirm this result, we treated three types of p53-containing cancer cell lines (HCT116<sup>p53+/+</sup>, H460 and HepG2) with INZ, Doxorubicin (Dox) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). The expression of <italic>NGFR</italic> mRNA was drastically elevated by all the three agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B and C</xref>). Consistently, NGFR protein level increased in response to Dox or 5-FU treatment in p53-intact, but not p53-null (HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup>) or mutated (PCL/PRF/5), cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).

Conversely, knockdown of p53 markedly reduced <italic>NGFR</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

Thus, we re-determined the role of NGFR in cancer cell growth and proliferation and whether this role is p53-dependent. Surprisingly, knockdown of NGFR elicited significant apoptosis of H460 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) cells as measured by flow cytometric analyses, consequently reducing cell viability during the 4-day culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). To verify if NGFR supports tumor cell growth and proliferation and to see if this role is p53-dependent, we performed colony formation assays by knocking down NGFR in p53-containing H460 and p53-deficient H1299 cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). NGFR ablation more dramatically repressed the colony formation of H460 cells than that of H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This result suggests that NGFR may support cancer cell survival through both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms. Since NGFR was found to be required for nerve growth factor-mediated NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 1996</xref>), knockdown of NGFR in H1299 may impair NF-κB activation, thus leading to partially restrained cell viability and reduced colonies. Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of human gliomas and their adjacent normal tissues exhibited hyperexpression of NGFR in the tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Indeed, p53 level induced by Dox or 5-FU was markedly reduced by ectopic NGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Inversely, knockdown of NGFR strikingly elevated the level of endogenous p53 and that of its target genes p21 and PUMA in human p53-containing H460, HepG2, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, melanoma SK-MEL-103 and SK-MEL-147 and HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), whereas did not affect PUMA expression in HCT116 <sup>p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of NGFR led to the global expression of a group of known p53 target genes, as measured by RNA-seq analysis in H460 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This result was further confirmed by utilizing a second siRNA (siNGFR#2), as NGFR knockdown by this siRNA also induced the protein level of p53 and the mRNA levels of its target genes, including BAX, BTG2, MDM2, p21, and PUMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Also, ablation of NGFR prolonged p53’s half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that NGFR might regulate the stability of p53. Next, we tested if NGFR affects MDM2-induced p53 ubiquitination by conducting a p53 ubiquitination assay in H1299 cells with ectopic proteins. Surprisingly, ectopic NGFR enhanced MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), although this protein was found to mainly reside in the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2004</xref>).

Without MDM2, NGFR was unable to alter p53 protein level in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Interestingly, ectopic NGFR inhibited p53-induced luciferase activity driven by the miR-34a promoter in MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells in a dose dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Also, NGFR repressed ectopic p53-induced expression of p21 and Puma in MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistently, ectopic NGFR markedly reduced the association of p53 with the endogenous p21 and Bax promoters in these cells as analyzed by ChIP assays in H1299 or MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since MDMX, the partner of MDM2, also bound to NGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-; Mdmx-/-; p53-/-</sup> cells were used to determine if MDMX is required for p53 inactivation by NGFR. NGFR still inhibited p53 activity as measured by p21 and Puma expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NGFR also inhibits p53 by directly binding to its central DNA-binding domain and preventing its association with its target promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Depletion of NGFR sensitizes tumor cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin</title><p>The discovery that NGFR is an inhibitor of p53 in cancer cells suggested the possibility of that depletion of this protein could sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. We tested this idea by treating H460 and SK-N-SH cells with different doses of Dox and Cisplatin after introducing control or NGFR siRNAs into the cells. Indeed, both of the chemotherapeutic drugs induced p53 and its target PUMA or p21 more apparently when the cells were transfected with NGFR siRNA compared to those with control siRNA in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). Also, this more robust p53 induction led to more cytotoxicity, as the IC50 of Cisplatin in NGFR siRNA-transfected H460 was 2.2-fold less than that in control siRNA-transfected H460 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The result was repeated in HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> cells, in which the IC50 of Cisplatin dropped by 1.6 folds in response to NGFR knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

NGFR shRNA or control shRNA-packaged lentivirus was produced to infect H460 and SK-MEL-147 cells. As expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the expression of p53 and its target genes p21, PUMA, and MDM2 was induced by knocking down NGFR using the shRNA-expressing lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In line with this result, the xenograft tumors derived from NGFR-shRNA H460 cells grew remarkably slower than those from control-shRNAH460 cells in the SCID mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Also, the average tumor weight from control cells was ~ten-fold heavier than that from NGFR-shRNA cells by the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).

Here, we identified NGFR as a novel p53 inactivator that serves as an example of a previously unidentified oncoprotein that may allow tumorigenesis in lieu of wt p53. NGFR inhibited p53 transcriptional activity as a feedback regulator in the nucleus of several cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), even though it normally resides in the cellular membrane of a neuron in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2004</xref>). Remarkably, targeting NGFR led to the suppression of tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Also, NGFR was highly expressed in human gliomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition to the xenograft model generated by human lung non-small cell carcinoma H460 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), NGFR has also been shown by others to enhance cell survival of schwannoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gentry et al., 2000</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2010</xref>), and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Descamps et al., 2001</xref>), and to promote metastasis of glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2010</xref>), and head and neck cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murillo-Sauca et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Most of these cancers harbor wt p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soussi et al., 2005</xref> and IRAC TP53 database, R17). Analysis of the TCGA genomic database also showed that the NGFR gene is often amplified in human breast cancers that display no p53 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, our study highly suggests that NGFR plays an oncogenic role by targeting p53 in these human cancers that harbor wt p53. Also, our study leads to several new findings to the p53 field.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NGFR feedback negation of p53 functions</title><p>First, we demonstrate that <italic>NGFR</italic> is a bona fide p53 target gene. The expression of <italic>NGFR</italic> at both mRNA and protein levels was induced by INZ, Dox, and 5-FU in several p53-positive, but not in p53-null, cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Also, overexpression of wt, but not mutant, p53 stimulated the expression of NGFR in p53-null cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). In addition, knockdown of p53 in HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> and H460 impaired the induction of NGFR mRNA by Dox and 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Furthermore, p53 stimulated the expression of luciferase gene driven by the p53RE sequence derived from the NGFR promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). Finally, in response to Dox, p53 was induced to associate with the p53RE-containing NGFR promoter in H460 cells. Undoubtedly, <italic>NGFR</italic> is an authentic p53 target gene, which is also in line with a recent finding that NGFR is a transcriptional target for the p53 analog, p73, in the mouse nerve system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niklison-Chirou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, NGFR surprisingly counteracted p53 function, as knockdown of this protein in p53-containing HCT116 or H460 cells led to drastic apoptosis and significant growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Also, knockdown of NGFR led to a more significant decrease of colony formation in p53-containing H460 cells compared to p53-deficient H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Of note, the suppressive effect of NGFR knockdown on H1299 colony formation might be due to the oncogenic function of this protein via other oncoproteins, such as NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 1996</xref>). But, this result does not affect our conclusion that negation of p53 function is one of the oncogenic functions of NGFR, as it is strongly supported by the evidence that knockdown of NGFR leads to activation of the p53 pathway in H460, HepG2, SK-N-SH, HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> and melanoma SK-MEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Remarkably, a number of p53 responsive target genes were induced to different degrees when NGFR was knocked down in H460 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The NGFR inhibition of p53 is further supported by the fact that it inactivates p53 by two distinct mechanisms as detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NGFR assists MDM2 in p53 degradation</title><p>One mechanism for NGFR inactivation of p53 is by working with MDM2. First, ectopic NGFR enhanced MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Inversely, knockdown of NGFR led to p53 stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These actions appeared to be implemented through direct interaction of NGFR with MDM2, as NGFR interacted with MDM2 both in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–K</xref>) via its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although stress signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shieh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zindy et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2015a</xref>) have been shown to compromise MDM2-induced ubiquitination and proteolysis of p53 and thus activate p53 in normal cells, cancer cells employ oncogenic molecules, such as MDMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gembarska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wade et al., 2013</xref>), which strengthen MDM2-mediated inhibition of p53 and thus induce cell resistance to p53 activation. Our data indicates that NGFR is one of these molecules as knockdown of NGFR enhances chemotherapeutic agents-induced p53 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>) and cell growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E– H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>NGFR inactivates p53 independent of MDM2</title><p>Surprisingly, NGFR can also inactivate p53 independent of MDM2. First, NGFR binds to p53 in cells and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>). Interestingly, NGFR bound to the central DNA-binding domain of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and reduced the binding of p53 to the p21 and BAX promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). All of these activities of NGFR are MDM2-independent, as they were all detected in MEF<sup>p53-/-/MDM2-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–6D</xref>). However, without MDM2, ectopic NGFR was unable to mediate p53 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results demonstrate that NGFR can directly bind to the central DNA-binding domain of p53 and impair its ability to bind to its target promoters in addition to facilitating MDM2-dependent p53 ubqiutination and degradation. Hence, our study illustrates two novel mechanisms by which NGFR inactivates p53, which are ligand-independent as further described below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>NGFR inactivates p53 in the nucleus independently of ligand</title><p>Our findings that NGFR can directly and indirectly suppress p53 activity were unexpected, as NGFR was originally found to be a transmembrane pan-receptor involved in the initiation, development, and maintenance of the nervous system and human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molloy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patapoutian and Reichardt, 2001</xref>), which binds with low affinity to all mature neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5), as well as their precursors, pro-neurotrophins, with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2004</xref>). Although a previous study showed that in response to neurotrophin signaling, NGFR might mediate p53-dependent neuron cell death by activating the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aloyz et al., 1998</xref>), our studies as presented here unveil a novel nuclear function of this membrane receptor, i.e., to promote cancer cell proliferation and survival by directly inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity and indirectly destabilizing p53 protein via MDM2. Convincingly, we showed that NGFR binds to MDM2 in the nucleus and assists this E3 ligase to ubiquitinate p53 and promote its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Also, independently of MDM2, NGFR directly bound to the central domain of p53 in the nucleus and prevented p53 from binding to its target promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These inhibitory activities of NGFR toward p53 are ligand-independent, as they occurred in the nucleus and NGF treatment did not appear to affect p53 level and activity in H460, HCT116, and HepG2 cancer cells tested (Data not shown). Hence, our results for the first time uncover a ligand-independent and nuclear p53 inhibitory function of this membrane neurotrophic receptor by acting on the MDM2-p53 loop.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cancer cells hijack NGFR to inactivate p53</title><p>Although it remains to be studied if NGFR can also regulate p53 stability and activity in a negative feedback fashion in normal nerve systems, our findings demonstrate that cancer cells hijack this anti-p53 activity of NGFR toward their growth advantage in a way similar to that for MDM2 and MDMX inactivation of p53 in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Momand et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliner et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shvarts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 1993</xref>), as knockdown of NGFR markedly induced p53-dependent apoptosis and cytotoxicity as well as eliminated xenograft tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). In line with our findings, a growing body of evidence has identified NGFR as a robust cell surface biomarker not only for neural crest stem cells, but also cancer initiating or stem-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomellini et al., 2014</xref>). Also, NGFR was highly expressed in a number of cancers, including the cancer initiating cells of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2010</xref>), squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murillo-Sauca et al., 2014</xref>), osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tian et al., 2014</xref>), brain cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biagiotti et al., 2006</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biagiotti et al., 2006</xref>). Particularly, patient derived NGFR-positive, but not NGFR-negative, melanoma cells were remarkably capable of generating tumors, promoting metastasis, and maintaining self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2010</xref>). Also, we detected the high expression of NGFR in several melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and primary human gliomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Several of these cancers, such as breast cancer, melanoma, osteocarcoma, and neuroblastoma, often display less or no TP53 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petitjean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soussi et al., 2005</xref>). Although MDM2 and MDMX have been shown to play a role in suppressing p53 in these cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gembarska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wade et al., 2013</xref>), it is highly likely that NGFR might also contribute to the reason why these cancers harbor wt p53. Our findings as demonstrated here further support this likelihood and provide novel mechanisms underlying NGFR inactivation of p53 in these cancers or cancer stem cells. Together with the aforementioned studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomellini et al., 2014</xref>), our findings also suggest that NGFR might play a role in maintaining the renewal and proliferating capabilities of stem cells or cancer stem cells by inactivating p53, as p53 has been shown to be crucial for stem cell differentiation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009</xref>) and to be a major roadblock for these stem cells to renew and proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cicalese et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marion et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Utikal et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our findings and the oncogenic role as described above, NGFR has also been shown to exert a tumor suppressive function by repressing tumor growth in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molloy et al., 2011</xref>), which has been largely attributed to its receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bredesen and Rabizadeh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Yazidi-Belkoura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khursigara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nykjaer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomellini et al., 2014</xref>). One previous study showed that the pro-neurotrophin-NGFR signaling can induce neuron death through the JNK-p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aloyz et al., 1998</xref>), but little is known about if this is also true in cancer or if NGFR can activate p53 independent of its ligands. All these studies did not notice the receptor-independent intracellular function of NGFR. Thus, our study not only offers new insights into the mechanism of intracellular NGFR-mediated tumor promotion, but also demonstrates that this oncogenic function is p53-dependent, which could explain why several human cancers that express high levels of NGFR harbor wt p53. Finally, our study suggests NGFR as a potential therapeutic target for cancers that harbor wt p53 and high levels of NGFR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>The RFP-tagged plasmid pDSRed-NGFR was purchased from Addgene created by Dr. Moses Chao.

In addition, the paper demonstrates that NGFR inactivates p53 transcriptional activity independent of MDM2 through its ability to bind to the central DNA-binding domain of p53, thereby diminishing its ability to bind target promoters. That NGFR has a role in the nucleus and forms a negative feedback loop with p53 is a unique observation. Data are also presented showing that NGFR is frequently overexpressed in human glioblastomas; thus the NGFR-mediated negative regulation of p53 may have important implications in glioblastoma biology and therapeutics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>For this paper to be considered for <italic>eLife</italic> it is essential that the authors provide convincing demonstration that endogenously expressed NGFR is present in the nucleus and interacting with p53 there as outlined in Points 1 and 2.</p><p>1) Given that the membrane and nuclear NGFRs have completely different functions, it is of great importance to provide quantitative data on NGFR subcellular distribution and correlate them with the biological function.

It would be also of interest to know how NGFR distribution is regulated.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We carefully performed immunostaining and confocal microscopy analyses using a NGFR antibody (D4B3) from Cell signaling technology. This monoclonal antibody is produced by immunizing animals with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues surrounding Arg198 which locates in the extracellular domain of human NGFR. As expected and in line with our fractionation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), we found that NGFR expression could be detected in the nucleus of all cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), although NGFR signals are more intensive in the cytoplasm and membrane than in the nucleus. While NGFR was originally found to be a transmembrane receptor in the neuronal cells, we have added new evidence that NGFR also resides in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cancer cells by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results, taken together with other results as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), strongly support our conclusion that cancer cells hijack NGFR to overcome the cytotoxic effect of p53. Interestingly, the nuclear expression of NGFR increased when genotoxic insult was triggered by Doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This elevated level of NGFR in the nucleus is likely due to p53 activation in response to Doxorubicin, as the NGFR gene is a p53 target gene. It is likely that the nuclear accumulated NGFR is to inactivate p53 thus inducing chemo-resistance of cancer cells, which is also consistent with our results shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>Given that p53 can be sequestered and degraded by MDM2 in the cytoplasm, it is reasonable that the cytoplasmic NGFR may also be involved in this process by binding to both p53 and MDM2 in the cytoplasm. Actually, we have some preliminary data from our ongoing project showing that NGFR retains p53 in the cytoplasm by associating with another novel p53 regulatory protein, which will be described in a separate report in the near future.</p><p>It is intriguing and worthwhile to figure out the mechanism underlying the intracellular translocation of NGFR in cancer cells. By treating melanoma cells with DNA damaging agents, we observed that the nuclear portion of NGFR increased in some of the cells by confocal microscopy analysis. However, to elucidate the exact molecular basis, more precise and quantitative experiments need to be designed and a multitude of cancer-associated signals will be explored. I hope that you would allow us to address this mechanistic question on how NGFR is transported to the nucleus in an independent study in the future</p><p>By sharing these incomplete studies with you and the reviewers, I want to let you know that the relationship between subcellular localization of NGFR and its tumorigenic role might be more complicated than one could imagine in primary human cancers. Also, it is more challenging to use currently available anti-NFFR antibodies for detailed IHC analysis of primary human cancers in order to distinguish NGFR in different subcellular compartments and to correlate its subcellular localization with different stages of human tumors or different types of tumors. Nevertheless, our studies as shown in this manuscript do confirm that nuclear NGFR can bind to p53 and MDM2, consequently inactivating p53 by directly inhibiting its transcriptional activity and facilitating MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation.</p><p> <italic>2) The use of H1299 cells expressing ectopic NGFR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–4F</xref> is not appropriate since NGFR may be overexpressed and mis-localized as a result of the overexpression. H460 cells expressing ectopic NGFR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> is not appropriate for the same reason. Demonstration of the endogenous interaction between NGFR, MDM2 and p53 in SK-N-SH cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> is central to the paper and this needs to be repeated using reciprocal IPs and cell fractionation. The fractionation experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> using HCT116/p53+ and SK-MEL-147 cells show very little NGFR in the nucleus. Confocal microscopy is necessary to determine the proportion of endogenous NGFR present in the nucleus of these cells.</italic> </p><p>In response to these suggestions, we have performed more experiments. To confirm our data presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> (SK-N-SH cell line) and 4I (NGFR-stably expressed H460 cell line), we conducted cell fractionation and reciprocal IP assays using another cell line, SK-MEL-147 melanoma cell line, that also highly expresses NGFR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, the nuclear extracts were subjected to IP using anti-NGFR, anti-p53 or anti-MDM2. In line with the former results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), NGFR could be co-immunoprecipited with p53 and MDM2 in a reciprocal pattern.</p><p>As mentioned in our response to the point 1, we carefully designed confocal microscopy analysis by using an antibody (D4B3, Cell signaling tech) recognizing the N-terminal extracellular domain of NGFR. As shown in this experiment, NGFR is detected in all of the cellular compartments including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrance of all the SK-MEL-147 melanoma cells examined, although less NGFR was found in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm and membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors have carefully addressed most the comments raised by the reviewers by providing new data and additional information.

First, the bands of p21 and PUMA on an SDS gel are often close to each other, sometimes when the concentration of the polyacrylamide gel is not optimal to separate small proteins. In this case, we only detected either p21 or PUMA expression as an indication of p53 activity, since knockdown of NGFR has been shown to activate the p53 pathway markedly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> with not only the WB data, but also the RNA-seq data. Because of the convincing reproducibility of these findings each time in each of our assays, we thus thought it is unnecessary to show p21 or Puma in all of the blots, such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. However, convincingly, knockdown of NGFR can sensitize these cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin or doxorubicin, as tested here. This sensitization is more apparent in p53-positive cancer cells, though Doxorubicin could also induce p21 independently of p53.</p></body></sub-article></article>
