K<sub>v</sub>10.1 or Eag1 also has three intracellular domains: PAS, C-linker, and CNBHD. We demonstrate that the Eag1 intracellular domains are not required for voltage-dependent gating but likely interact with the VS to modulate gating. We identified specific interactions between the PAS, CNBHD, and VS that modulate voltage-dependent gating and provide evidence that VS movement destabilizes these interactions to promote channel opening. Additionally, mutation of these interactions renders Eag1 insensitive to calmodulin inhibition. The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains and calmodulin may prevent this rotation by stabilizing interactions between the VS and intracellular domains. Intracellular domains likely play a similar modulatory role in voltage-dependent gating of the related K<sub>v</sub>11-12 channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>voltage-gated potassium channel</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>CHO cells</kwd><kwd>HEK293S GnTI-</kwd><kwd>SF9 cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2212-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whicher</surname><given-names>Jonathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interactions between the voltage sensor and intracellular domains modulate voltage-dependent gating and calmodulin inhibition in the voltage-gated potassium channel Eag1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated potassium channels (K<sub>v</sub>s) conduct potassium ions in response to changes in membrane voltage.

S1-S4 form the voltage sensor (VS) and S5-S6 form the potassium pore. The S4 helix of the VS is positively charged and was proposed to move within the membrane in response to changes in membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>). Upon membrane hyperpolarization the S4 was predicted to move ‘down’ towards in the intracellular side of the membrane to close the potassium pore and upon membrane depolarization the S4 was predicted to move ‘up’ to the extracellular side of the membrane to open the potassium pore. In K<sub>v</sub>s 1–9 movement of S4 is coupled to the potassium pore by a ~ 15 residue, helical S4-S5 linker, which forms a domain-swapped linkage between S4 and S5 that positions it directly above the pore lining S6 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Long et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). In this position, the S4-S5 linker was proposed to function as a mechanical lever to couple movement of the S4 to the S6 helices to open and close the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Long et al., 2005b</xref>). However, in K<sub>v</sub>s 10–12 the S4-S5 linker is only six residues, which is not long enough to form the domain-swapped linkage observed in K<sub>v</sub>s 1–9. Indeed, recent structures of Eag1 (K<sub>v</sub>10.1) and hErg (K<sub>v</sub>11.1) revealed that the S4-S5 linker forms a non-domain swapped linkage between S4 and S5 and is unlikely to be domain swapped in any conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). Due to the non-domain swapped transmembrane architecture, the S4-S5 linker is not in the same position and does not appear to form a similar mechanical lever, suggesting an alternative mechanism of voltage-dependent gating in K<sub>v</sub>s 10–12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lörinczi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tomczak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49188.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the PAS loop in Eag1 and hErg.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of Eag1 (PDB: 5K7L) in the closed conformation (PAS is orange, VS is yellow, S4-S5 linker is blue, pore is green, C-linker is red, CNBHD is cyan, CaM is purple, and membrane is indicated by gray bars) with a black box indicating the view for panel (<bold>B</bold>).

Interactions between the VS and intracellular domain observed in the structure of Eag1 suggests that the intracellular domains may function in voltage-dependent gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For example, the PAS domain, which is positioned directly below the VS, has a 15-residue N-terminal loop (PAS loop) that is directed, through interactions with the VS and CNBHD, towards the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The PAS loop has been implicated in voltage-dependent gating and the large Cole-Moore effect observed in Eag1, in which more hyperpolarized (negative) resting membrane potentials result in slower rates of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cole and Moore, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ju and Wray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ludwig et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Terlau et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, the C-linker forms an intracellular ring directly below the S6 helices, which are positioned to couple movements of the intracellular domains to the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The C-linker ring is near the S4-S5 linker and the S4, which adopts a depolarized or up conformation in the Eag1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). Since the S4-S5 linker of Eag1 appeared unlikely to function as a mechanical lever, we proposed a voltage-dependent gating mechanism in which the S4 helix moves towards the intracellular side of the membrane during hyperpolarization to interact with and rotate the C-linker and S6 helices to close the potassium pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). This proposal was based on structural data alone and awaits further examination by functional analysis.</p><p>In addition to voltage-dependent gating, Eag1 is also gated by the calcium sensor calmodulin (CaM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schönherr et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ziechner et al., 2006</xref>). CaM binds to Eag1 only in the presence of calcium and holds the pore closed even during membrane depolarization. Each PAS and CNBHD domain has a CaM binding site and thus there are eight binding sites per tetramer. In the Eag1 structure, each CaM molecule occupies two binding sites, one on the PAS and one on the CNBHD, clamping the two domains together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). This binding orientation was shown to be essential for channel inhibition but it is unclear how CaM binding prevents opening of the pore. Here we investigate the role of the intracellular domains in voltage-dependent gating and CaM inhibition. We identify interactions between the VS, PAS loop, and CNBHD that modulate voltage-dependent gating and are essential for CaM inhibition. We provide evidence that VS movement during depolarization may destabilize this interface between the PAS loop and the CNBHD to promote channel opening and find that CaM seems to function by stabilizing this interface to inhibit the channel. Finally, we determine a new structure of an Eag1 channel mutant that is insensitive to CaM inhibition. The structure revealed a pre-open conformation of Eag1 (i.e. a conformation that plausibly lies on the conformational pathway leading to opening) and suggests that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Role of the Eag1 intracellular domains in voltage-dependent gating</title><p>Based on the previous structure of Eag1, we proposed that membrane hyperpolarization causes S4 to interact with and rotate the C-linker to close the pore. To test this hypothesis, we characterized an Eag1 channel in which the PAS, C-linker, and CNBHD were deleted (Eag1TM). The C-terminal assembly domain (887-962) was included in Eag1TM as this domain is needed for tetramer assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ludwig et al., 1997</xref>). Eag1TM forms functional channels that are voltage dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>), indicating that the intracellular domains are not essential for voltage-dependent gating and that an interaction between the S4 and C-linker is not required to close the potassium pore. However, the intracellular domains do modify the gating kinetics, which was demonstrated by both the Eag1TM construct and the Eag1/hErg chimera where the PAS, C-linker and CNBHD from hErg were inserted onto Eag1TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Eag1TM had a right shifted V<sub>0.5</sub> of 46 mV (zero-slope on the activation curve was not reached up to 100 mV and therefore an accurate value for V<sub>0.5</sub> could not be measured) compared to the WT Eag1 (19 mV). In addition, the Eag1/hErg chimera has a V<sub>0.5</sub> (2.5 mV) that is in between that of WT Eag1 and hErg (−22 mV) and exhibits slow rates of channel closure (deactivation), a characteristic of hErg channels. We also recorded the Cole-Moore effect for each construct by holding the cell at increasing holding potentials, from −190 mV to the voltage of channel activation, and stepping to the same depolarized voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To compare the Cole-Moore effect from different mutants we plotted holding potential as a function of current at 10 ms following the depolarization step. Then we fit the plot with a Boltzmann function (defined in the Materials and methods) to estimate the holding potential that produces half maximal rates of activation (V<sub>0.5CM</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Neither mutant channel exhibits a Cole-Moore effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which, along with the slow deactivation of the Eag1/hErg chimera and the shifted V<sub>0.5</sub> of both channels, demonstrates that the intracellular domains influence voltage-dependent gating kinetics. In addition, this result suggests that the Cole-Moore effect may arise from an interaction between the transmembrane and intracellular domains.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49188.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Role of intracellular domains in voltage-dependent gating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Voltage family current trace of WT Eag1, Eag1TM, and the Eag1/hErg chimera with the voltage-pulse protocol shown above.

However, in the open conformation of hErg the homologous Asp is near (~6 Å) two Arg residues in the PAS loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). In all K<sub>v</sub>s 10–12 the PAS loop has at least one positively charged residue. In Eag1, the corresponding Arg residues are Arg 7 and 8. We mutated the Arg residues to Ala (R7A/R8A) and deleted residues 3–9 (Δ3–9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The V<sub>0.5</sub> of R7A/R8A and Δ3–9 are right shifted to a similar extent as Eag1TM and the D342A mutant. Therefore, Arg 7 and 8 promote channel opening, like Asp 342, and mutation of these residues has a similar effect on V<sub>0.5</sub> as loss of the intracellular domains. In addition, the R7A/R8A and Δ3–9 mutations result in a right-shifted V<sub>0.5CM</sub>, indicating that more depolarized holding potentials are required for fast activation of these mutants than WT Eag1. The right shifted V<sub>0.5</sub> and the modified Cole-Moore effect of R7A/R8A and Δ3–9 suggest that Arg 7 and 8 might form a functional interaction with Asp 342. Furthermore, since mutation of Arg 7 and 8 did not result in complete loss of the Cole-Moore effect, Asp 342 likely interacts with additional residues on the intracellular domains. Taken together, the functional data along with the proximity of the PAS loop and Asp 342 in the open conformation of hErg suggest that an interaction between Asp 342 and the PAS loop may occur in the open conformation to promote channel opening.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Implications for voltage-dependent gating</title><p>How might an interaction between the PAS loop and Asp 342 promote channel opening? One hypothesis is that the interaction between the PAS loop and Asp 342 stabilizes the depolarized state of the voltage sensor. This hypothesis would explain why deletion of the intracellular domains (Eag1TM) and mutation of Asp 342 and Arg 7 and 8 disfavors channel opening as indicated by a right shift in the voltage-dependence of activation. However, further analysis of PAS loop residues that are adjacent to Arg 7 and 8, Leu 10, Val 11, Ala 12, and Pro 13, revealed an additional function of the PAS loop in voltage-dependent gating. Leu 10, Val 11, Ala 12, and Pro 13 interact with Tyr 639, a conserved residue in K<sub>v</sub>s 10–12 that is located on the CNBHD, and Tyr 213, a Phe, Tyr or Cys in K<sub>v</sub>s 10–12 that is located on the loop before S1 of the VS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>).

To study the functional consequences of altering this region of contact, we generated Tyr 213 to Ala (Y213A) and Tyr 639 to Arg (Y639R) mutant channels and PAS loop mutant channels with successive deletions of residues 10–13 (Δ3–10, Δ3–11, Δ3–12, and Δ3–13). These mutants show inactivation and hooked tail currents at more depolarized potentials (40–100 mV), as was previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Terlau et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). These mutants also produce channels that open at more negative (hyperpolarized) potentials than WT Eag1 (−80 mV) and exhibit slow deactivation, demonstrating that the interaction between residues 10–13, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 promotes the closed state of Eag1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49188.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Interaction between residues 10–13, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Voltage family current trace for the Δ3–13, Y213A, and Y639R with the voltage-pulse protocol shown above.

The N-terminus seems to promote channel opening and may interact with Asp 342 of the S4-S5 linker. The C-terminus seems to promote channel closure and interacts with the CNBHD. Furthermore, in the open state structure of hErg the PAS loop C-terminus does not interact with either Tyr 403 (equivalent to Tyr 213 in Eag1) or Tyr 827 (equivalent to Tyr 639 in Eag1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) suggesting that destabilization of this interface might be necessary for channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the following structural interactions take place in association with voltage dependent gating. Upon depolarization, Asp 342 interacts with the PAS loop N-terminus to stabilize the open state of the VS and destabilize the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to promote channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When the VS is hyperpolarized, movement of the S4 disrupts the interaction between Asp 342 and the PAS loop N-terminus, allowing the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to form and promote channel closing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>Two experiments support this hypothesis for the role of the intracellular domains in voltage-dependent gating. First, co-expression of two halves of a split Eag1 construct (L341 split), in which the N-terminal half of the channel includes Met 1-Leu 341 and the C-terminal half includes Asp 342-Ser 962, produces a partially constitutively open channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tomczak et al., 2017</xref>). This functional behavior can be explained by the above hypothesis because in the split Eag1 construct Asp 342 is no longer connected to S4 of the VS and thus is no longer forced to move when the VS moves. Consequently, Asp 342 can maintain its interaction with the PAS loop to promote channel opening. Therefore, if Arg 7 and 8 and Asp 342 functionally interact to promote channel opening then mutation of this interface should produce a split channel that is no longer constitutively open. In agreement with this conclusion, introduction of the D342A and Δ3–9 mutations into the Eag1 split construct produce channels that close at hyperpolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tomczak et al., 2017</xref>). Second, this mechanism provides an explanation for the Cole-Moore effect. The Cole-Moore effect was proposed to be due to the existence of multiple closed states that the VS must transition through in order to reach an active or depolarized conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cole and Moore, 1960</xref>). At more negative potentials the VS must transition through more closed states to reach an active conformation, which results in slower activation times. In Eag, at more negative holding potentials the VS might have to transition through more closed states in order for the S4 and Asp 342 to interact with the PAS loop N-terminus, which will result in slower activation times. Therefore, if we remove the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639, which we propose is destabilized when Asp 342 interacts with the PAS loop N-terminus, then the Cole-Moore effect should be lost. In agreement with this line of reasoning, Δ3–12 and Δ3–13 do not exhibit a Cole-Moore effect while Y213A, Y639R, Δ3–10, and Δ3–11 show a reduced Cole-Moore effect compared to the WT channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49188.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>L341 split channels.</title><p>Voltage family current trace for the L341 split (<bold>A</bold>), D342A L341 split (<bold>B</bold>), and Δ3–9 L341 split (<bold>C</bold>) with the voltage-pulse protocol shown above.

This hypothesis is consistent with a number of observations on the function. First, insertion of the intracellular domains of hErg onto Eag1 (Eag1/hErg chimera) causes a 20 mV left shift in the V<sub>0.5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Second, the V<sub>0.5</sub> of Eag1 is right-shifted by 40 mV compared with hErg and Eag1TM is right shifted by 80 mV when compared to a hErg channel lacking the intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hausammann and Grütter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). What might cause Eag1 to be more stable in a closed conformation? In Eag1, Phe 475 and Gln 477 are located at the interface of the S6 helices on either side of Gln 476, the intracellular gate. In K<sub>v</sub>11 and K<sub>v</sub>12, which have a left shifted V<sub>0.5</sub> compared to Eag1, these residues are Ile and Arg respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer and Schwarz, 2018</xref>). The Eag1 double mutant F475I/Q477R causes a 50 mV left shift in the V<sub>0.5</sub> to −20 mV when introduced into the full-length channel and a 16 mV left shift in the V<sub>0.5</sub> to 30 mV when introduced into Eag1TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b,c</xref>). In addition, when the F475I/Q477R mutation is introduced into the Eag1/hErg chimera the channel remains open at hyperpolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the intracellular domains and Phe 475 and Gln 477 cause Eag1 to be more stable in a closed conformation. Therefore, we propose that the Eag1 intracellular domains, when viewed from the extracellular side, rotate in a counterclockwise direction to promote the opening of the pore. However, due to the stability of Eag1 in a closed conformation and the conditions under which the Cryo-EM structure was determined we suspect that pore opening is transient and thus not observed in the Eag1 Δ3–13/CaM structure.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49188.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Eag1 pore mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phe 475 and Gln 477 (shown as green sticks, with red O, and blue N) are at the interface of the S6 helices (green).

This finding suggests that binding of CaM does not clamp the PAS and CNBHD domains together to prevent rotation of the intracellular domains and channel opening as we previously proposed. Instead, we think that more likely CaM binding to the channel helps to stabilize the hydrophobic interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639. As discussed above, this interaction seems to be important for channel closure. Thus, by stabilizing this interaction CaM can inhibit the channel. In support of this hypothesis, deletion of this interaction by removing residues 3–13 results in a channel that is no longer inhibited by CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

First, the intracellular domains are not required for voltage-dependent gating but do modulate voltage-dependent gating kinetics and cause the Cole-Moore effect. Second, an interaction between Asp 342 at the intracellular side of the S4 helix and the intracellular domains is essential for the Cole-Moore effect. Through mutagenesis in full length and split channels, we identified Arg 7 and 8 in the PAS loop N-terminus as potential interaction partners for Asp 342. However, mutation of Arg 7 and 8 results in modification but not complete loss of the Cole-Moore effect, suggesting that Asp 342 may interact with other residues on the intracellular domains. Third, interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213 of the VS, and Tyr 639 of the CNBHD plays an important role in gating of Eag1. Deletion of residues 3–13 from the PAS loop produces a channel that opens at more hyperpolarized potentials than WT Eag1 and has slow deactivation kinetics, suggesting that this interaction promotes channel closure. In addition, this interface is important for the mechanism of CaM inhibition as Eag1 Δ3–13 is constitutively open in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Finally, the structure of Eag1 Δ3–13 bound to CaM in a pre-open conformation demonstrates that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from the extracellular side of the membrane.</p><p>Based on the data, we propose the following general mechanism of modulation of voltage-dependent gating by the intracellular domains. In the depolarized conformation of the VS, Asp 342 interacts with the PAS loop N-terminus to stabilize the depolarized state of the VS as well as destabilize the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to promote channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In the hyperpolarized conformation of the VS, movement of the S4 disrupts the interaction between Asp 342 and the PAS loop N-terminus to allow for the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to form and promote channel closing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The structure of Eag1 Δ3–13/CaM in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a counterclockwise rotation of the intracellular domains and channel closing may occur through a clockwise rotation of the intracellular domains. This mechanism is consistent with previous functional data examining split Eag1 channels that do not have a covalent linkage between the VS and pore and provides an explanation for the Cole-Moore effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lörinczi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tomczak et al., 2017</xref>). At more negative holding potentials the S4 and Asp 342 may have to transition through more closed states in order to interact with the PAS loop N-terminus, which will result in slower activation times. Furthermore, CaM seems to function through this proposed mechanism by stabilizing the interaction between residues 10–13, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to prevent pore opening. Perhaps by binding to the PAS domain, CaM may be able to stabilize the PAS loop in a closed conformation.</p><p>These interactions also help to understand the gating of related channels. For hErg, which does not exhibit a Cole-Moore effect, the PAS loop Arg residues (Arg 4 and 5) and the S4 Asp (Asp 540) function in slow deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morais Cabral et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muskett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sanguinetti and Xu, 1999</xref>). How do equivalent residues in Eag1 and hErg function in different voltage-dependent gating outcomes? As discussed above, in Eag1 deletion of the intracellular domains or mutation of Asp 342 causes a positive shift in the V<sub>0.5</sub>, suggesting that the interaction between the PAS loop N-terminus and Asp 342 is important for channel activation and thus functions in the Cole-Moore effect. However, in hErg deletion of the intracellular domains and mutation of Asp 540 does not change the V<sub>0.5</sub>, suggesting that the interaction between the PAS N-terminus and Asp 540 is not important for channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hausammann and Grütter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morais Cabral et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sanguinetti and Xu, 1999</xref>). Instead, we propose that in hErg, which we have shown apparently has a more stable open conformation than Eag1, the interaction between Asp 540 and the PAS loop forms after channel activation and prevents pore closing, which results in slow deactivation. Like Eag1, the interaction between Asp 540 and the PAS loop N-terminus in hErg may prevent pore closing by destabilizing the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 403, and Tyr 827. In support of this idea, splitting the hErg channel, analogous to the Eag1 L341 split, so that Asp 540 is not covalently linked to the voltage sensor, produces a channel that displays slowed deactivation compared to WT hErg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of Eag1 gating by its intracellular domains&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Gary Yellen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal his identity: Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper addresses the molecular mechanisms by which the voltage gating of the Eag1 (Kv10.1) channel and other Kv10-12 family members are regulated by their intracellular PAS, C-linker, and CNBHD domains. These channels have a different architecture from the Kv1-9 channels, which couple voltage sensing to gating using an apparently mechanical linkage (the S4-S5 linker). The authors show that the intracellular domains of Eag1 are not required for voltage gating (contrary to their earlier proposal) but that they both substantially modulate the open-closed bias of the channels and can produce the classic &quot;Cole-Moore&quot; effect (a pronounced delay in channel opening after strong hyperpolarization). This extends earlier functional exploration by Pardo and colleagues (2015) and Tomczak et al., 2017, and others, as well as previous structural work by the present authors. The work also addresses the interesting structural and functional analogy between the Cole-Moore effect (delayed opening after strong hyperpolarization) of the Kv10 channels and the slowed deactivation of hErg (Kv11.1) channels.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>No new experiments are requested, but revisions to the text and figures are important for making the complex arguments here more transparent to the readers, for improving the precision of the explanations, and for providing access to relevant previous studies that bear on the conclusions here.</p><p>The paper should include at least one and probably two additional display elements to help explain the proposed model. The Introduction discusses many interesting structural elements in EAG and would greatly benefit from adding a new Figure 1 (or an additional panel) to help the reader see these features. The existing Figure 2 doesn't really suffice for this, and it also doesn't suffice to show all of the residues mutated or deleted. We would suggest a figure that shows everything in detail that is relevant to this study, including residues in the S4-S5 linker or loop. It would also be helpful to include a figure or table that explains the different general gating states essential to thinking about the authors' proposal (something similar to stably shut, pre-open, open, and stably open) and which interactions are thought to occur (for instance PAS-C/Y213/Y639, PAS-N/D342, clockwise or counterclockwise rotation), for both the Eag1 and hErg channels. This would help readers follow the proposal, and it might also help explain more precisely the analogy between the Cole-Moore shift in Eag1 and the slow closure of hErg.</p><p>The explanation (in the Discussion, third paragraph) for the slow deactivation of hErg is confusing. The idea is vaguely apparent, but the statement that the slow deactivation in hErg (which arises from open-state stabilization) &quot;arises from the same mechanism as the Cole-Moore effect&quot; (which is a pronounced closed-state stabilization) is not helpful. For the hErg channels, the N-PAS – D342 interaction stabilizes the open state (kinetically if not thermodynamically); for the Eag1 channels, it stabilizes the open state thermodynamically and speeds entry into it. In hErg channels, this produces slow deactivation; in Eag1 channels, the disappearance of this interaction at extreme negative voltages produces the Cole-Moore shift, a kinetic delay in subsequent opening that appears due to the slowness of the re-establishment of this interaction. However, as the authors point out, a simple stabilization in hErg channels does not quite fit, because there is no shift in activation midpoint. Instead, the interaction &quot;prevent&lt;s&gt; pore closing&quot; (but through a kinetic effect). The parallels between the Cole-Moore shift and the slow deactivation are interesting, but the authors should state their case more precisely here.</p><p>The authors propose a hypothesis for why the Eag1 delta3-13/CaM structures (the new structures here) remain closed – the Eag1 channels are more biased to closing than the hErg channels [p 10 &quot;A hypothesis for why the pore remains closed in the Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM structure is that, compared to hErg, Eag1 may be more stable in a closed conformation.&quot;]. But the fact remains that this exact construct is constitutively open when studied functionally (Figure 6A). So the discrepancy cannot really be explained as a difference between family members – it is clearly a difference between the bilayer and the cryoEM conditions.</p><p>In general, please consider alternatives to the proposed model, and explain why you think that your model is better. For instance, the proposed mechanism has the interaction between D342 and the PAS loop as promoting opening by destabilizing closed state interactions between Y213/Y639 and the PAS loop. Instead, or in addition, could the D342-PAS interaction directly stabilize the open state? Or the activated state of the voltage sensor?</p><p>Please also address the following questions in the revision, to help clarify the model and the interpretation of the data:</p><p>1) If the primary effect of the intracellular domains is to inhibit opening, as suggested in the Abstract (&quot;…provide evidence that VS movement destabilizes these interactions to promote channel opening&quot;) and other places in the paper, then why does deletion of intracellular domains, mutation of D342, mutations R7A/R8A, and Δ3-9, destabilize opening (shift the voltage-dependence to the right)?</p><p>2) Since there are no estimates of the energetics of the interactions in the structure or the energetic effects of the mutations, the paper should be more cautious about attributing the interactions proposed to the total effects of the intracellular domains.</p><p>3) Abstract: &quot;The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant suggests that rotation of the intracellular domains promotes channel opening.&quot; This sentence is misleading. It should be indicated in the Abstract that the structure presented here is closed, like the original structure of Eag1. It is not clear how a closed structure tells us anything about promoting opening since Ca-CAM doesn't promote opening in Eag1Δ3-13 (does it?). Also, while it seems plausible that the counterclockwise rotation of the intracellular domains is helpful for opening, do we know that it is necessary (it is clearly not sufficient)?</p><p>4) Introduction section: &quot;Due to the non-domain swapped transmembrane architecture, the S4-S5 linker is not in the correct position and does not have the required structure to function as a mechanical lever, suggesting an alternative mechanism of voltage-dependent gating in Kvs 10-12.&quot; This sentence should be supported by citing previous split experiments.</p><p>5) Subsection “Interactions between the voltage sensor and intracellular domains”: &quot;…we first investigated the S4-S5 linker.…by alanine scanning mutagenesis &quot; Wasn't alanine scanning and cysteine scanning mutagenesis previously done on the S4-S5 linker of hErg channels (Gianulis et al., 2013, and Wang et al., 1998 respectively)? This work should be cited.</p><p>6) Subsection “Insights into voltage-dependent gating”: &quot;Furthermore, in the open state structure of hErg the PAS loop and the CNBHD Tyr do not interact (Figure 2B)…&quot; What about interaction of the PAS loop and the 213 equivalent residue in the hErg structure?</p><p>7) Subsection “Insights into voltage-dependent gating” and elsewhere &quot;…this mechanism provides an explanation for the Cole-Moore effect because at more negative holding potentials the S4 and Asp 342 will be driven further down and away from the PAS loop N-terminus, which will result in slower activation times.&quot; Further down from what? Are you suggesting that there is a down state of the VS that is further down than the normal resting state? Wouldn't any movement down prevent interactions of the N-terminal end of the PAS loop with D342?</p><p>8) Subsection “Structure of constitutively open Eag1”: &quot;… this opening is transient and thus not observed in the Eag1 Δ 3-13/CaM structure.&quot; This is the first mention I found of the previous finding that PAS loop deletions in Eag cause inactivation. This should be mentioned earlier and properly cited.</p><p>9) Could the authors discuss why they think the new structures are not inactivated? Could they comment on the position of the S4 helix? Does it appear to be activated as suggested by the earlier CaM-inhibited structure?</p><p>10) The IV plots in Figure 5D, 6A and 7D look rather odd because they reverse near -20 mV (the holding voltage) rather than at a voltage near EK<sup>+</sup>. Oocytes normally have internal K<sup>+</sup> set to 100K<sup>+</sup>, and according to the Materials and methods, these recording were obtained using an external solution with only 2.5 mM K<sup>+</sup>, which puts EK near to -100 mV. The simplest explanation I can think of is that these plots were obtained with much higher external K<sup>+</sup>, perhaps around 50-60 mM, but again the Materials and methods state it is 2.5 mM. Might the authors have plotted the difference between current measured at the holding voltage of -20 mV and each test potential, in some cases then normalized to that difference measured at +100 mV? But this is rather unconventional, and nothing is stated about how this was done. If -20 mV really is the Vrev for these constructs and external K- is 2.5 mM, then either these constructs are no longer K-selective, or the internal concentration of K is way off due to expressing these constructs. Please explain and fix as appropriate. In addition, are the oocytes currents being manipulated in any way? The capacitive currents seem to be largely compensated or subtracted, but nothing is stated in the Materials and methods. Are all the whole-cell CHO currents are not leak subtracted? It would be good to state this specifically. It would also be good to add dashed lines to all traces to indicate the zero-current level. Finally, in the traces shown in Figure 6A, it appears you have lost voltage-clamp in the last few traces. Perhaps replace with another recording or remove those traces?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49188.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>No new experiments are requested, but revisions to the text and figures are important for making the complex arguments here more transparent to the readers, for improving the precision of the explanations, and for providing access to relevant previous studies that bear on the conclusions here.</p><p>The paper should include at least one and probably two additional display elements to help explain the proposed model.

The data suggest that equivalent residues (D342, the PAS loop N-terminus, and the PAS loop C-terminus) in Eag1 and hErg function in different voltage- dependent gating outcomes. In Eag1 these residues function in the Cole-Moore effect and in hErg these residues function in slow deactivation. In Eag1, mutation of D342 and the PAS loop N-terminus results in a right-shifted V<sub>0.5</sub> suggesting that these residues are important for channel activation. In hErg, mutation of D540 and the PAS loop N-terminus does not affect V<sub>0.5</sub> suggesting that these residues are not important for channel activation. Therefore, we propose that in Eag1, D342 and the PAS loop N-terminus interact during channel activation to promote pore opening and thus function in the Cole-Moore effect. Whereas in hErg, D540 and the PAS loop N-terminus interact after channel activation to prevent pore closing and thus function in slow deactivation. In both cases, we believe the interaction between the S4 Asp (342 in Eag1 and 540 in hErg) and the PAS loop N-terminus destabilizes the interaction between the PAS loop C- terminus, the S1 Tyr (213 in Eag1 and 403 in Eag1), and the CNBHD Tyr (639 in Eag1 and 827 in hErg) and thus the closed state of the channel. The paragraph was edited to convey these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose a hypothesis for why the Eag1 delta3-13/CaM structures (the new structures here) remain closed – the Eag1 channels are more biased to closing than the hErg channels [p 10 &quot;A hypothesis for why the pore remains closed in the Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM structure is that, compared to hErg, Eag1 may be more stable in a closed conformation.&quot;].

So the discrepancy cannot really be explained as a difference between family members – it is clearly a difference between the bilayer and the cryoEM conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The conditions of structure determination, such as detergent solubilization and cryogenic freezing temperatures, can affect a proteins structure. However, the open conformation structure of hErg was determined under similar Cryo-EM conditions with DDM instead of Digitonin as the detergent. In addition, the data presented in this manuscript and previous manuscripts suggest that Eag1 is more stable in a closed conformation than hErg. Therefore, we believe that the closed pore of Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM is likely the result of a combination of Eag1 being more stable in a closed conformation than hErg and the structure determination conditions. This is now reflected in the paper.</p><p>“Therefore, we propose that the Eag1 intracellular domains, when viewed from the extracellular side, rotate in a counterclockwise direction to promote the opening of the pore. However, due to the stability of Eag1 in a closed conformation and the conditions under which the Cryo-EM structure was determined we suspect that pore opening is transient and thus not observed in the Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM structure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, please consider alternatives to the proposed model, and explain why you think that your model is better. For instance, the proposed mechanism has the interaction between D342 and the PAS loop as promoting opening by destabilizing closed state interactions between Y213/Y639 and the PAS loop. Instead, or in addition, could the D342-PAS interaction directly stabilize the open state? Or the activated state of the voltage sensor?</p></disp-quote><p>The large right shift in voltage-dependence for the Eag1 TM mutant suggests that the intracellular domains help stabilize the open state of the channel. Therefore, it is possible that the interaction between D342 and the PAS loop N-terminus may promote channel opening by stabilizing the depolarized state of the VS as well as destabilizing the interaction between Y213, Y639, and the PAS loop C- terminus. A few sentences were added to the Results and Discussion sections to account for this possibility.</p><p>“How might an interaction between the PAS loop and Asp 342 promote channel opening? One hypothesis is that the interaction between the PAS loop and Asp 342 stabilizes the depolarized state of the voltage sensor. This hypothesis would explain why deletion of the intracellular domains (Eag1TM) and mutation of Asp 342 and Arg 7 and 8 disfavors channel opening as indicated by a right shift in the voltage-dependence of activation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also address the following questions in the revision, to help clarify the model and the interpretation of the data:</p><p>1) If the primary effect of the intracellular domains is to inhibit opening, as suggested in the Abstract (&quot;…provide evidence that VS movement destabilizes these interactions to promote channel opening&quot;) and other places in the paper, then why does deletion of intracellular domains, mutation of D342, mutations R7A/R8A, and Δ3-9, destabilize opening (shift the voltage-dependence to the right)?</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain that upon depolarization we propose that Asp 342 interacts with the PAS loop N-terminus to promote channel opening through the concomitant stabilization of the open state of the VS and destabilization of the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 (discussed in the previous comment). Therefore, we would expect deletions of the intracellular domains and mutations to Asp 342 or the PAS loop N-terminus (residues 3-9) to destabilize channel opening.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since there are no estimates of the energetics of the interactions in the structure or the energetic effects of the mutations, the paper should be more cautious about attributing the interactions proposed to the total effects of the intracellular domains.</p></disp-quote><p>To the point of the reviewers the description of the mechanism in the discussion was edited as shown:</p><p>“Based on the data, we proposed the following general mechanism of modulation of voltage-dependent gating by the intracellular domains. In the depolarized conformation of the VS, Asp 342 interacts with the PAS loop N-terminus to stabilize the depolarized state of the VS as well as destabilize the interaction between the PAS loop C-terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to promote channel opening (Figure 1C). In the hyperpolarized conformation of the VS, movement of the S4 disrupts the interaction between Asp 342 and the PAS loop N-terminus to allow for the interaction between the PAS loop C- terminus, Tyr 213, and Tyr 639 to form and promote channel closing (Figure 1B). The structure of Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a counterclockwise rotation of the intracellular domains and channel closing may occur through a clockwise rotation of the intracellular domains”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Abstract: &quot;The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant suggests that rotation of the intracellular domains promotes channel opening.&quot; This sentence is misleading. It should be indicated in the Abstract that the structure presented here is closed, like the original structure of Eag1. It is not clear how a closed structure tells us anything about promoting opening since Ca-CAM doesn't promote opening in Eag1Δ3-13 (does it?). Also, while it seems plausible that the counterclockwise rotation of the intracellular domains is helpful for opening, do we know that it is necessary (it is clearly not sufficient)?</p></disp-quote><p>In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM Eag1 Δ3-13 is constitutively open. Therefore, the combination of the structure of Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM, which shows a rotation of the intracellular domains compared with the original Eag1 structure, and the open hErg structure strongly suggest that a rotation of the intracellular domains is important for channel opening. However, the sentence in the Abstract may mislead readers into thinking that the structure of Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM is in an open pore conformation. To avoid misleading readers, we have edited the paper to state that the structure of Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM represents a pre-open conformation of the channel. The Abstract was edited as shown:</p><p>“The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains and calmodulin may prevent this rotation by stabilizing interactions between the VS and intracellular domains.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction section: &quot;Due to the non-domain swapped transmembrane architecture, the S4-S5 linker is not in the correct position and does not have the required structure to function as a mechanical lever, suggesting an alternative mechanism of voltage-dependent gating in Kvs 10-12.&quot; This sentence should be supported by citing previous split experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Both Eag1 split channel manuscripts (Lorinczi et al., 2016 and Tomczak et al., 2017) were cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Interactions between the voltage sensor and intracellular domains”: &quot;…we first investigated the S4-S5 linker.…by alanine scanning mutagenesis &quot; Wasn't alanine scanning and cysteine scanning mutagenesis previously done on the S4-S5 linker of hErg channels (Gianulis et al., 2013, and Wang et al., 1998 respectively)?

Are you suggesting that there is a down state of the VS that is further down than the normal resting state? Wouldn't any movement down prevent interactions of the N-terminal end of the PAS loop with D342?</p></disp-quote><p>The Cole-Moore effect was proposed to be due to the existence of multiple closed states that the VS transitions through in order to reach an active or depolarized conformation. At more negative potentials the VS transitions through more closed states to reach an active conformation, which results in slower activation times. So yes, we (and others before us) think that there are down states of the voltage sensor that are further down than the distribution of states associated with normal resting conditions. In Eag1 specifically, we propose that at more negative holding potentials the VS may have to transition through more closed states in order for the S4 and Asp 342 to interact with the PAS loop N-terminus, which will result in slower activation times. In the absence of a structure, we cannot accurately predict the position of the VS in a hyperpolarized conformation so the phrase “the S4 and Asp 342 will be driven further down and away from the PAS loop N-terminus” was removed from the manuscript. The explanation of the Cole-Moore effect in Eag1 was edited as follows:</p><p>“The Cole-Moore effect was proposed to be due to the existence of multiple closed states that the VS must transition through in order to reach an active or depolarized conformation (Cole and Moore, 1960). At more negative potentials the VS must transition through more closed states to reach an active conformation, which results in slower activation times. In Eag1, we propose that at more negative holding potentials the VS might have to transition through more closed states in order for the S4 and Asp 342 to interact with the PAS loop N-terminus, which will result in slower activation times.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Structure of constitutively open Eag1”: &quot;… this opening is transient and thus not observed in the Eag1 Δ 3-13/CaM structure.&quot; This is the first mention I found of the previous finding that PAS loop deletions in Eag cause inactivation. This should be mentioned earlier and properly cited.</p></disp-quote><p>This is cited in subsection “Implications for voltage-dependent gating” when discussing PAS loop deletions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Could the authors discuss why they think the new structures are not inactivated? Could they comment on the position of the S4 helix? Does it appear to be activated as suggested by the earlier CaM-inhibited structure?</p></disp-quote><p>The Eag1 Δ3-13 does not inactivate at 0 mV when bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (Figure 6A) so we would not expect the structure of Eag1 Δ3-13/CaM to be in an inactivated conformation.</p><p>The S4 helix is in depolarized conformation similar to the original structure of Eag1 bound to CaM. This was included in the manuscript:</p><p>“In both conformations, the S4 helices adopt a depolarized conformation and intracellular domains are rotated in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from the extracellular side of the membrane but in conformation 2 the extent of the rotation is larger (2.4° degrees for conformation 1 and 8.6° degrees for conformation 2) (Figure 6B,C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The IV plots in Figure 5D, 6A and 7D look rather odd because they reverse near -20 mV (the holding voltage) rather than at a voltage near EK<sup>+</sup>. Oocytes normally have internal K<sup>+</sup> set to 100K<sup>+</sup>, and according to the Materials and methods, these recording were obtained using an external solution with only 2.5 mM K<sup>+</sup>, which puts EK near to -100 mV. The simplest explanation I can think of is that these plots were obtained with much higher external K<sup>+</sup>, perhaps around 50-60 mM, but again the Materials and methods state it is 2.5 mM. Might the authors have plotted the difference between current measured at the holding voltage of -20 mV and each test potential, in some cases then normalized to that difference measured at +100 mV? But this is rather unconventional, and nothing is stated about how this was done. If -20 mV really is the Vrev for these constructs and external K- is 2.5 mM, then either these constructs are no longer K-selective, or the internal concentration of K is way off due to expressing these constructs. Please explain and fix as appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>A higher external K<sup>+</sup> concentration of 60mM was used for these experiments. This is now updated in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, are the oocytes currents being manipulated in any way?
