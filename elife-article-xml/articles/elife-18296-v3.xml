restriction. We used multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT)-based whole cell proteomics to perform a comprehensive time course analysis of &gt;6500 viral and cellular proteins during HIV infection. To enable specific functional predictions, we categorized cellular proteins regulated by HIV according to their patterns of temporal expression. We focussed on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and found the viral accessory protein Vif to be necessary and sufficient for CUL5-dependent proteasomal degradation of all members of the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E). Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of HIV-infected cells confirmed Vif-dependent hyperphosphorylation of &gt;200 cellular proteins, particularly substrates of the aurora kinases. The ability of Vif to target PPP2R5 subunits is found in primate and non-primate lentiviral lineages, and remodeling of the cellular phosphoproteome is therefore a second ancient and conserved Vif function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18296.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18296.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18296.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>About 100 years since it was first transmitted to humans, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infects almost 40 million people worldwide and causes more than a million AIDS-related deaths every year. It is therefore critical to understand how HIV has been able to multiply and spread, and why infection with HIV causes AIDS. In the evolutionary “arms race” between viruses like HIV and the cells they infect, viruses try to enhance their ability to multiply, and cells try to resist. These interactions emphasise the processes that are most important for cells and viruses, and suggest new ways to treat HIV and other viral infections.</p><p>Proteomics is the large-scale study of molecules known as proteins, the critical building blocks of both cells and viruses. Greenwood, Matheson et al. use proteomics to measure how the abundance of proteins in human cells change during HIV infection, and identify new interactions between the virus and its host. The experiments distinguish more than 6500 proteins, and reveal that an HIV protein called Vif destroys several key components of a cellular protein called PP2A. Previous studies have demonstrated that PP2A plays a critical role in regulating the activities of numerous other proteins and processes in cells. Greenwood, Matheson et al. further show that other HIV-related viruses that infect monkeys, apes and even sheep can also counteract PP2A, suggesting that this interaction has been important during host and virus evolution.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work are to find out why HIV attacks PP2A, and whether drugs that interfere with this interaction may help to treat HIV infection. A future challenge will be to investigate how HIV interacts with other cellular proteins highlighted by the proteomics approach.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18296.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18296.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Vif</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>lentivirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101835/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>093964/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matheson</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive whole cell proteomic map describing expression time courses of &gt;6,500 viral and cellular proteins during HIV infection identifies Vif-dependent antagonism of key cellular phosphatase PP2A.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses hijack host proteins and processes to optimize the cellular environment for viral replication and/or persistence. Manipulation by viruses signposts critical pathways in viral pathogenesis and cell biology, and evolutionary pressure has led to conflict between cellular restriction factors (limiting viral replication) and viral countermeasures (overcoming restriction in vivo). We previously used multiplex whole cell proteomic analysis of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected fibroblasts to define expression time courses of viral and cellular proteins and identify novel proteins involved in the host-HCMV interaction, a technique we termed Quantitative Temporal Viromics (QTV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we provide a comprehensive temporal proteomic analysis of HIV infection.</p><p>The HIV-1 'accessory proteins' Vif, Vpr, Nef and Vpu share a common ability to target cellular proteins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Simon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sugden et al., 2016</xref>). Whilst dispensible for viral replication in vitro, they are essential for pathogenesis in vivo. Nef and Vpu are multifunctional adaptors which co-opt endolysosomal and proteasomal machinery to downregulate numerous plasma membrane proteins, including their canonical substrates CD4, tetherin and MHC class I. In contrast, although Vif and Vpr are known to target cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins for proteasomal degradation, relatively few cellular substrates have been reported.</p><p>The only known Vif targets are members of the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases, which are otherwise incorporated into viral particles and act as dominant restriction factors causing hyper-mutation of the HIV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desimmie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Malim, 2009</xref>). Whilst Nef, Vpr and Vpu are found exclusively in primate lentiviruses, Vif is found in four of the five extant lentiviral lineages, infecting primate, feline, bovine and small ruminant hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gifford, 2012</xref>), and the ability to target cognate host APOBEC proteins is conserved across Vif variants from all these diverse lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Larue et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Cellular proteins regulated by HIV have generally been identified using non-systematic, candidate approaches. We recently used a different, unbiased plasma membrane proteomic approach to reveal &gt;100 previously unsuspected cell surface proteins depleted by HIV-1, including novel Nef (SERINC3/5) and Vpu (SNAT1) targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>). Whole cell proteomic studies of HIV-infected cells have been variably hampered by limited proteome coverage, asynchronous infections and confounding by the presence of bystander (uninfected) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Consequently, it has been difficult to attribute changes in protein levels to expression of specific viral genes, and intracellular proteins targeted by HIV accessory proteins have not been discovered in this fashion.</p><p>In this study, we extend our tandem mass tag (TMT)-based temporal proteomic approach to describe global changes in HIV-infected T cells, comprising expression time courses of &gt;6500 proteins. We cluster proteins according to their patterns of temporal expression, and identify &gt;100 cellular proteins regulated by HIV, including candidate resistance/restriction factors and HIV accessory protein targets. To test the utility of our approach, we focus on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and confirm the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E) to be novel Vif targets. We use large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to demonstrate Vif-dependent remodelling of the cellular phosphoproteome during HIV infection, and show that, along with APOBEC proteins, antagonism of PP2A-B56 is an ancient and conserved Vif function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systematic time course analysis of protein dynamics during HIV infection</title><p>To gain a comprehensive, unbiased overview of viral and cellular protein dynamics during HIV infection, we analysed total proteomes of CEM-T4 T cells infected with HIV.

As expected, the well characterised HIV cell surface targets downregulated in our plasma membrane proteomic analysis were also depleted in our whole cell proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The magnitude of effect was generally greater in the plasma membrane proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), suggesting that regulation of cell surface proteins by redistribution or sequestration is an important feature of this system.</p><p>We detected gene products from 7/9 HIV-1 open reading frames (ORFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). As previously reported, expression of regulatory proteins (Tat and Rev) from Rev-independent completely spliced mRNA transcripts occurred earlier in viral replication than expression of structural proteins from Rev-dependent unspliced (Gag and Gagpol) and partially spliced (Env) mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karn and Stoltzfus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pollard and Malim, 1998</xref>), with Rev expression lagging Tat in our experiment. Vif and Nef showed intermediate temporal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with progressively increasing Nef expression from 24–48 hr inversely correlating with downregulation of CD4 and HLA-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we saw an increase in plasma membrane VSVg levels immediately after infection (reflecting fusion of incoming virions), followed by a rapid decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Compared with numerous cell surface targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>), relatively few intracellular proteins depleted by HIV accessory proteins have been described. Nonetheless, we confirmed downregulation of the Vif target APOBEC3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Smith and Pathak, 2010</xref>) and the Vpr target UNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schrofelbauer et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The temporal pattern of UNG depletion was distinct from that of other accessory protein substrates, including APOBEC3C, with degradation seen as early as 6 hr post-infection, and preserved in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is likely to reflect the high abundance of Vpr packaged within incoming viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paxton et al., 1993</xref>), abrogating the need for de novo protein synthesis. As well as recruiting substrates for degradation, Vpu increases β-catenin levels by sequestering the ß-TrCP substrate-recognition unit of the SCF<sup>ß-TrCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besnard-Guerin et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, HIV infection causes cell cycle arrest at G2/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jowett et al., 1995</xref>), a point in the cell cycle associated with upregulation of cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Norbury and Nurse, 1992</xref>).

The Nef, Vpu and Vif accessory protein targets CD4, SNAT1, APOBEC3C are found in cluster #1, where progressive downregulation and rescue by reverse transcriptase inhibitors suggest dependence on de novo viral protein synthesis (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top left panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upregulation of proteins in cluster #3 is also likely to require de novo viral protein synthesis, and the indirect Vpu target β-catenin is found in this cluster (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, middle left panel). Conversely, reverse transcriptase inhibitor-independent regulation of proteins in clusters #2 and #4 implies a cellular response to HIV infection, or a direct effect of viral proteins in incoming virions, and the Vpr target UNG is found in cluster #2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top right panel). As well as mechanistic differences, analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) revealed that clusters #1–4 contained proteins associated with distinct biological functions and processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Whilst accumulation of some proteins in cluster #3 may be secondary to G2/M cell cycle arrest, other changes are unlikely to reflect the interferon (IFN) or unfolded protein responses, because we did not see accumulation of either the highly IFN-inducible protein ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) or proteins associated with ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Regulation of resistance/restriction factors and candidate accessory protein targets</title><p>Restriction factors are cellular proteins whose primary biological activity is antiviral, and which are induced by IFN or viral infection, antagonized by viral proteins, and show genetic evidence of positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duggal and Emerman, 2012</xref>). Proteins which reduce permissivity for viral infection, but fail to meet strict criteria for restriction factors, may be classified as resistance factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>). Restriction and resistance factors are characteristically increased (cellular response) or decreased (viral antagonism) during viral infection. Our temporal proteomic approach therefore identifies unsuspected viral regulation of known resistance/restriction factors, and provides a strategy for the discovery of novel host antiviral factors. Accordingly, we found the actin regulatory proteins gelsolin and CAPG (both cluster #4) to be strongly induced during HIV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Actin cytoskeletal remodeling is required for virological synapse formation and cell-cell transmission of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jolly et al., 2004</xref>), and gelsolin levels have been reported to control early HIV infection in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia-Exposito et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we discovered marked depletion of FMR1 (cluster #1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref><bold>, upper panel</bold>) and TFAP4 (cluster #2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref><bold>, lower panel</bold>) during HIV infection. Both these proteins reduce production of infectious HIV virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Imai and Okamoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pan et al., 2009</xref>), but their distinct patterns of temporal expression suggest different mechanisms of viral regulation. We predict that other regulated proteins in clusters #1–4, without known roles in HIV infection, will also represent novel cellular resistance/restriction factors.</p><p>To test the utility of our approach, we focussed on proteins in cluster #1 highlighted in our functional analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). First, three members of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) biosynthetic pathway were depleted during HIV infection: thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), which catalyses the methylation of deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to deoxythymidylate (dTMP); and two subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), RRM1 and RRM2, which catalyses the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref><bold>, left panels</bold>). HIV replication is tightly regulated by dNTP availability, and SAMHD1 (which tends to oppose the effects of RNR) is a well-described HIV restriction factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayinde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldauf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hrecka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Laguette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lahouassa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Second, and most strikingly, all detected members of the B56 family of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) regulatory subunits (PPP2R5A, C, D and E) were profoundly depleted by HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref><bold>, right panels</bold>). These subunits determine the specificity and localisation of PP2A holoenzymes (PP2A-B56), a ubiquitous family of heterotrimeric serine-threonine phosphatases with critical roles in many aspects of cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McCright et al., 1996</xref>). We confirmed downregulation of RRM2, PPP2R5A and PPP2R5D by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because cluster #1 also contained APOBEC3C, and intracellular proteins in this cluster (including PPP2R5 subunits) show near-identical patterns of temporal expression, we hypothesised that some or all of these proteins might be novel Vif targets.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18296.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cellular proteins progressively downregulated by HIV infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enlargement of cluster #1 from hierarchical cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

All HIV-1 variants tested were able to degrade HA-PPP2R5A, but the magnitude of effect was variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We therefore screened a diverse selection of Vif variants for degradation of different PPP2R5 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The ability to deplete PPP2R5 subunits was conserved across all PPP2R5A-E/Vif combinations, but most marked for PPP2R5B. We therefore tested our entire panel of Vif variants for depletion of PPP2R5B, and found strong and consistent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we focused specifically on the distantly related SRLV and NL4-3 (HIV-1) Vif variants.

Our data confirm known HIV targets, and identify many more proteins regulated by infection. Compared with other studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we achieve a step-change in depth of proteomic coverage, and by utilising multiplex TMT-based quantitation, we facilitate high-resolution time-based analysis. To generate a cell surface proteomic map of HIV infection, we previously employed selective aminooxy-biotinylation of sialylated glycoproteins (Plasma Membrane Profiling; PMP) to quantitate 804 plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>). Although 1030 proteins quantitated in our whole cell proteomic analysis also had Gene Ontology Cellular Component annotations suggesting localisation to the plasma membrane, there was limited overlap with our PMP dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref><bold>, upper panel</bold>). The techniques are therefore non-redundant, and this is likely to reflect differential enrichment of scarce or poorly soluble/aggregate-prone glycoproteins using PMP, and intrinsic transmembrane proteins lacking significant extracellular domains or glycosylation sites using whole cell proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref><bold>, lower panel</bold>).</p><p>In our earlier temporal proteomic study of HCMV infection, we utilised temporal classification of cellular protein expression to predict novel immunoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we develop and extend this methodology to predict cellular targets of specific HIV proteins. Whereas HCMV encodes &gt;150 canonical ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wilkinson et al., 2015</xref>), HIV-1 encodes only 9 genes and 15 proteins. Amongst these, the accessory proteins Vif, Vpr, Vpu and Nef have distinct patterns of temporal expression, and HIV-1 is therefore ideally suited to this approach. Vpu is translated from the same transcripts as Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schwartz et al., 1990</xref>), and therefore expressed late in the viral replication cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Accordingly, cell surface proteins targeted specifically by Vpu (tetherin and SNAT1) are depleted late in the time course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and intracellular proteins known to be targeted by Vif (APOBEC3C) and Vpr (UNG) show distinct temporal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Based on the similarity with the temporal profile of APOBEC3C, we predicted that other proteins in cluster #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would be candidate Vif targets. We validated this prediction by comparing changes in protein expression during WT and ΔVif virus infections, and demonstrated that as with APOBEC3C degradation, Vif was necessary for depletion of the PP2A regulatory subunits PPP2R5A-E. Conversely, like known Vpr-target UNG, proteins in cluster #2 are downregulated early in viral infection, in the absence of Vif, and in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Vpr is reported to antagonize DNA repair pathways and inhibit innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laguette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schrofelbauer et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, cluster #2 is markedly enriched for nucleic acid binding proteins, including proteins from families with known roles in DNA damage repair and nucleic acid sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Whilst this manuscript was in preparation, downregulation of a second protein in cluster #2, helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), was also attributed to Vpr in incoming viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hrecka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lahouassa et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, as for Vif targets APOBEC3C and PPP2R5A-E, temporal profiles of Vpr targets UNG and HLTF cluster very tightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Other proteins in cluster #2 with similar temporal profiles are therefore very strong candidates for novel Vpr targets, and downregulation of these proteins by Vpr may antagonize DNA repair pathways or inhibit viral nucleic acid sensing.</p><p>Reversible serine/threonine phosphorylation is the most commonly observed post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khoury et al., 2011</xref>), and PP1 and PP2A, are the major cellular serine/threonine phosphatases. The core PP2A enzyme consists of one catalytic subunit encoded by <italic>PPP2CA</italic> or <italic>PPP2CB</italic> and one structural subunit encoded by <italic>PPP2R1A</italic> or <italic>PPP2R1B</italic>. The specificity of the holoenzyme is determined by the binding of an additional regulatory subunit, encoded by a total of 15 genes, split into four families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yang and Phiel, 2010</xref>). We found Vif-dependent proteasomal degradation of all five members of the B56 family (PPP2R5A-E; also known as the B’, PR61 or PPP2R5 family). Since each PP2A holoenzyme contains a single regulatory subunit, it is unlikely that depletion of individual regulatory subunits destabilizes other B56 family members. Given the high sequence similarity between B56 subunits, and the ability of Vif to deplete individual subunits expressed non-stoichiometrically in 293T cells, it is much more likely that degradation is mediated by a conserved Vif interaction domain in all five family members.</p><p>PP2A makes up 0.2–1% of total eukaryotic cellular protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ruediger et al., 1991</xref>), and whilst in many cases the relevant regulatory subunits have not been characterized, published targets of PP2A-B56 holoenzymes are nonetheless implicated in a multitude of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yang and Phiel, 2010</xref>). In order to confirm functional PP2A-B56 antagonism and identify relevant PP2A-B56 substrates in HIV-infected cells, we therefore carried out a comprehensive, unbiased analysis of cellular protein phosphorylation during productive HIV infection, and provide a multiplex TMT-based replicated analysis of &gt;8500 cellular phosphopeptides. As expected, we found enhanced phosphorylation of proteins associated with Vpr-mediated activation of the DNA damage response and G2/M cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), reflecting increased activity of the mammalian checkpoint kinases ATR/ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nakai-Murakami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Roshal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vassena et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, PP2A-B56 antagonism by Vif resulted in hyperphosphorylation of a more limited subset of host phosphoproteins, mirroring previously reported changes seen with PP2A inhibition using okadaic acid.</p><p>Our unbiased analysis of Vif-dependent kinase pathways in HIV-infected cells identified a striking increase in the activity of the aurora kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Aurora kinase activity and abundance peak in late G2 and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bischoff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ly et al., 2014</xref>), and PP2A-B56 holoenzymes antagonize aurora kinase functions in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Espert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kruse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, aurora kinase activity is typically inhibited by the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensimon et al., 2011</xref>), and reduced activity would therefore be expected in HIV-infected cells. Instead, we propose that Vif-mediated antagonism of PP2A-B56 sustains aurora kinase activity in the presence of the DNA damage response. Interestingly, PLK1 is also inhibited by the DNA damage response in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensimon et al., 2011</xref>), but kinase-active PLK1 is recruited to the SLX4 complex by Vpr in HIV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laguette et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the results of this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Manipulation of mitotic kinases is therefore a shared feature of the HIV accessory proteins Vpr and Vif, and pharmacological inhibitors targeting these cellular kinases may represent a viable antiviral strategy.</p><p>Replication of WT and ΔVif viruses in vitro is equivalent in permissive cell lines lacking APOBEC3G expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sheehy et al., 2002</xref>). Aurora kinase activity controls Lck kinase location and phosphorylation at the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blas-Rus et al., 2016</xref>), and kinase-active Lck is also recruited to the virological synapse during cell-cell transmission of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vasiliver-Shamis et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore possible that Vif-mediated PP2A-B56 antagonism directly enhances cell-cell spread in vivo or in vitro in primary T cells or macrophages, but it is not currently practicable to compare replication of WT and ΔVif viruses on an APOBEC family-negative background in primary cells. Alternatively, PP2A-B56 antagonism may enhance HIV replication or persistence in vivo indirectly, by modulating T cell activation or macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blas-Rus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that in other cell types or systems, such as terminally differentiated (non-cycling) macrophages, signalling through alternative kinases may be differentially amplified by Vif-mediated PP2A-B56 depletion. Nonetheless, since PP2A-B56 antagonism spans lineages of lentiviruses which are primarily tropic for both lymphocytes (primate lentiviruses) and myeloid cells (non-primate lentiviruses), it is likely that modulation of key kinases is conserved across cell types.</p><p>The significance of host factors targeted by HIV is proven in vivo by evolutionary conservation of antagonism across a range of HIV and SIV viruses, and by the existence of similar mechanisms in other viruses. For example, MHC class I proteins are targeted by Nef variants of all primate lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Specht et al., 2008</xref>), and manipulation of MHC class I is a common attribute of many virus families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Randow and Lehner, 2009</xref>). Here, we show that the degradation of PP2A-B56 subunits is conserved across Vif variants from diverse HIV and SIV lentiviruses of primates, as well as a small ruminant lentivirus of sheep (SRLV). The lentiviral genus is ancient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gifford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katzourakis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Keckesova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Worobey et al., 2010</xref>), and species-specific lineages have developed through virus-host co-evolution. Accordingly, the most recent common ancestor of the primate and small ruminant lentiviruses is likely to have existed in the common ancestor of primates and ruminants, approximately 100 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedges et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore propose that degradation of PP2A-B56 subunits is a primordial feature of Vif, present in the common ancestor of primate lentiviral and SRLV Vif variants. Alternatively, Vif variants from these lineages may have independently acquired this ability. Either possibility strongly suggests a critical selective advantage for lentiviral replication or persistence in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General cell culture</title><p>CEM-T4 T cells (AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAD, NIH: Dr. JP Jacobs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foley et al., 1965</xref>) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2.

Briefly, cells were dissociated using PBS/EDTA and fixed and permeabilised using a commercial kit (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences, UK). Permeabilised cells were stained with a fluorescently-conjugated anti-HA antibody, washed, and acquired on a BD FACScalibur or BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). Where indicated, DMSO or bortezomib (10 nM) were added when the media was changed 24 hr post-transfection. For CUL5 WT/DN co-transfection, 100 ng of Vif expression vector was used, with 100 ng of CUL5 WT or DN expression vector. Where 293T cells expressing GFP-tagged PPP2R5B were used, pCMV-SPORT6-mCherry was substituted for pMAXGFP, and cells were analysed without permeabilisation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Regulation of endogenous PPP2R5D by HIV infection of T cells</title><p>CEM-T4 T cells or activated primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were analysed as described for HA-PPP2R5A-E, but cells were infected with NL4-3-dE-EGFP WT or ΔVif viruses, and stained with unconjugated anti-PPPR5D followed by an AF647-conjugated secondary antibody. For time course analyses in CEM-T4 T cells, bortezomib (20 nM) or cycloheximide (50 µg/ml) were added 24 hr post-infection, and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for GFP positive (infected) cells compared at four timepoints (0, 4, 8 and 12 hr).

As a control, mCherry was subcloned into pCMV-SPORT6. 293T cells were transfected in 24 well plates using Fugene 6. Each well received a transfection mix containing 135 ng NL4-3-dE-EGFP and 15 ng pMD.G. Shortly after, each well received a second transfection mix of 150 ng pCMV-SPORT6 mCherry, APOBEC3G, tetherin, TFAP4 or FMR1. The media was changed 24 hr post-infection, and 48 hr post-infection, cell supernatants were harvested. Contaminating 293T cells in the supernatants were removed by centrifugation, and a small proportion used to infect a fixed number of HeLa cells. After 48 hr, the HeLa cells were analysed by flow cytometry to determine the proportion that had become GFP positive (infected). The MOI in each well was calculated and normalized to the MOI resulting from the supernatants of 293T cells receiving mCherry.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Viviana Simon (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Dr. Barbara Blacklaws (University of Cambridge), and Prof. Michael Malim (King’s College London) for providing reagents, Dr. Jenny Ho (Thermo) for help with proteomics, Dr. Yagnesh Umrania (CIMR-IMS Proteomics Facility) for help with bioinformatics, Dr. Reiner Schulte and the CIMR Flow Cytometry Core Facility team, and the Lehner laboratory for critical discussion.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While all reviewers found your manuscript of interest, as you can see below, a number of issues were raised.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Greenwood and colleagues applies advanced proteomic methods to address the complex question of what cellular factors are modulated by HIV infection. To this end, the authors examined the abundance of more than 6500 cellular proteins over time in HIV-1 infected T cells using Tandem mass tagging and performed a validation of the data using conventional stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). Systematic analysis of cells infected with HIV-1 that are either Vif proficient or deficient reveals that the B56 family of regulatory proteins (PPPR5 A-E) of the PP2A phosphatase are depleted with kinetics similar to the known Vif target, APOBEC3C. Vif is found sufficient to deplete PPP5A-E subunits and requires all the known components of the Vif/E3 ligase complex, including CUL5, ELOB/C, CBF-β, as well as the proteasome. Through phosphoproteomic analysis of infected cells, the authors confirm that Vif induces the hyperphosphorylation of more than 200 cellular proteins, particularly substrates of the aurora kinases. Importantly, Vif-mediated depletion of PPP2R5A-E emerges as a function conserved across Vif variants from diverse HIV and SIV viruses, suggesting an important role in viral replication or persistence.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An aspect of the study design has implications for the Resource aspect of this paper. In the 6-plex TMT experiment, the authors do not collect their quantitative data with biological duplicates or triplicates, as is most often done in these types of experiments. As such, there could be uncertainty in the data, particularly for those proteins quantified on the basis of a single peptide (which reflects about 10% of the data based on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). On the positive side, the authors do a lot of follow-up based on the screen which fits a lot of the known biology and gives confidence in the bulk of conclusions made. This includes a conventional SILAC experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Of note, however, there are several proteins in each cluster that do not appear to behave as with the TMT data, suggesting a disconnect for a small number of proteins. Perhaps the use of a single replicate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could be viewed as a screen and as such the manuscript could be considered as a regular article rather than a resource.</p><p>2) While the reviewers do appreciate that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> firmly establishes PPP2R5 depletion in a 293T co-transfection system requires Cul5, ELOb/C, CBF-β and a functional proteasome, taken as a whole this single model system is not enough to prove that HIV-1 Vif acts specifically on PPP2R5 proteins to induce their degradation in natural infection. Minimally, the authors should provide evidence that HIV-1 Vif does interact with PPP2R5A-E subunits in HIV-infected T cells and forms a complex containing Cul5 components. Furthermore, direct evidence that Vif mediates the degradation of PP2A-B56 subunits in HIV-1 infected T cells should be demonstrated by using pulse-chase experiments or cycloheximide chase assay.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: The requirement for CBF-β function suggests that the canonical APOBEC-degrading Vif ligase is also responsible for degradation of the PPP2R5 proteins.

The non-primate lentiviral Vif proteins clearly function without CBF-β so reviewers strongly question the single MVV Vif data point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.

In this study, we utilised TMT-based multiplexing to compare both different timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and replicates at a single timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and validated our timecourse data using an independent quantitative technique (SILAC) rather than a simple TMT-based biological replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Data from all three experiments are summarised for proteins in clusters #1-4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>.

Of course, there is uncertainty associated with any quantitative approach (for example, protein identification false discovery rates) – which does not necessarily detract in practical terms from the usefulness of the dataset.</p><p>We would be happy for the manuscript to be reclassified as a research article.

In order to address this possibility and perform the experiments requested, we identified an anti-PPP2R5D antibody (ab88075, Abcam) which works for both intracellular flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation of endogenous PPP2R5D. We are therefore now able to show that:</p><p>A) Vif is required for PPP2R5D depletion in HIV-infected primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>);</p><p>B) Vif and PPP2R5D subunits co-immunoprecipitate in 293T cells and HIV-infected CEM-T4 T cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>);</p><p>C) PPP2R5D is degraded by Vif in HIV-infected CEM-T4 T cells on the basis of both cycloheximide (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>) and [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine/[<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine metabolic labelling/pulse-chase (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) analyses.</p><p>Since it is well established in the literature that Vif forms a complex with Cul5 components in T cells, we have not repeated these experiments in our study (Jager et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2012). Nonetheless, to extend the observations from our cycloheximide chase analysis, we confirmed that (as in 293T cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) degradation of PPP2R5D by Vif in HIV-infected CEM-T4 T cells is proteasome-dependent (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to providing the new figure supplements and updating the relevant methods and figure legends, we have described these experiments in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Results</p><p>“Vif-dependent degradation of PPP2R5 subunits was confirmed by immunoblot of HIV-infected CEM-T4 T cells (PPP2R5A and PPP2R5D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>,) and intracellular flow cytometry of HIV-infected CEM-T4 and primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (PPP2R5D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>).”</p><p>“Consistent with a protein-level interaction between Vif and PPP2R5 subunits, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged Vif with HA-tagged and endogenous PPP2R5D in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and co-immunoprecipitation of untagged Vif with endogenous PPP2R5D in CEM-T4 T cells infected with HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). […] Finally, we confirmed using cycloheximide chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine/[<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine metabolic labelling/pulse-chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) analyses that degradation of PPP2R5D was accelerated in the presence of Vif in HIV-infected CEM-T4 T cells.”</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: The requirement for CBF-β function suggests that the canonical APOBEC-degrading Vif ligase is also responsible for degradation of the PPP2R5 proteins. If this is the case, and based on many prior studies showing that Vif is intrinsically disordered, then this interaction should be primate specific and CBF-β requiring. The non-primate lentiviral Vif proteins clearly function without CBF-β so reviewers strongly question the single MVV Vif data point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. We strongly suggest removing these data from the paper and temper the claims of complete conservation. Alternatively, repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> with SRLV(MVV) plus/minus Vif to prove that the downregulation of PPP2R5 components is indeed Vif-dependent. The claim of conservation is very important and needs to be carefully investigated and justified.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important point, and that Vif variants from non-primate lentiviruses (including SRLV) neither interact with CBFβ (Ai et al., 2014; Kane et al., 2015; Yoshikawa et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014) nor require CBFβ to antagonise cognate APOBEC proteins (Ai et al., 2014; Kane et al., 2015). Nonetheless, our data clearly demonstrate that SRLV Vif is able to deplete all human PPP2R5 subunits at least as efficiently as NL4-3 Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We therefore hypothesised that, whereas CBFβ is required for PPP2R5 subunit depletion by NL4-3 Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), PPP2R5 subunit depletion by SRLV would be independent of CBFβ. This is indeed the case (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, as with NL4-3 Vif, SRLV Vif co-immunoprecipitates with PPP2R5D (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>These data strongly support a model in which primate Vif variants require CBFβ for substrate degradation (PPP2R5A-E and APOBEC proteins), whereas SRLV Vif does not (again, both PPP2R5A-E and APOBEC proteins).</p><p>We recognise that the ability of SRLV Vif to deplete PPP2R5 subunits does not guarantee that this ability is also present in Vif variants of all non-primate lentiviruses, and we are therefore careful not to make such a claim. Furthermore, we explicitly state in our discussion that, whilst the simplest hypothesis is that the ability to deplete PPP2R5 subunits was present in the common ancestor of primate and SRLV Vif variants, it is theoretically possible that this ability could have arisen independently (i.e. convergent evolution).</p><p>In addition to providing the new figure supplements and updating the relevant methods and figure legends, we have described the new experiments in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Results</p><p>“Finally, we focused specifically on the distantly related SRLV and NL4-3 (HIV-1) Vif variants. Vif-dependent antagonism of APOBEC proteins shows lineage-specificity, and SRLV Vif is unable to antagonize human APOBEC3G (Larue et al., 2010). […] As with APOBEC proteins, we found CBFβ but not EloB to be dispensable for degradation of HA-PPP2R5E by SRLV Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>).”</p><p>Furthermore, to ensure there is no ambiguity, we have tempered our abstract and discussion on this point as suggested by the reviewers:</p><p>Abstract</p><p>&quot;The ability of Vif to target PPP2R5 subunits is found in primate and non-primate lentiviral lineages, and remodeling of the cellular phosphoproteome is therefore a second ancient and conserved Vif function.&quot;</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“Here, we show that degradation of PP2A-B56 subunits is conserved across Vif variants from diverse HIV and SIV lentiviruses of primates, as well as a small ruminant lentivirus of sheep (SRLV). […] Alternatively, Vif variants from these lineages may have independently acquired this ability. Either possibility strongly suggests a critical selective advantage for lentiviral replication or persistence in vivo.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
