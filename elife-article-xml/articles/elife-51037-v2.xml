Using mouse brain and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we provide evidence that the TS mutation prevents a normal developmental switch in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 exon utilization, resulting in persistent expression of gain-of-function mutant channels during neuronal differentiation. In iPSC models, the TS mutation reduces the abundance of SATB2-expressing cortical projection neurons, leading to excess CTIP2+ neurons.

linked to neuropsychiatric disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have identified gain- and loss-of-function mutations in <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, the gene encoding the α1C subunit of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel (LTC) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ripke et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic variants in calcium signaling proteins and voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, including the pore-forming α and auxiliary β subunits of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2, have also been associated with disorders such as ASD, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013</xref>). Although these studies strongly implicate genetic changes in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in multiple psychiatric disorders, little is known about how Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 affects core cellular and molecular processes to contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p>Timothy syndrome (TS), a developmental disorder characterized by cardiac dysfunction, intellectual disability and ASD, is caused by a gain-of-function missense mutation in an alternatively spliced exon of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>). The TS mutation, in combination with the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TS patients, has been a powerful tool for investigating the importance of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 signaling in neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paşca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birey et al., 2017</xref>). The point mutation in classical TS, G406R, is located in exon 8A, which encodes transmembrane segment 6 (IS6) of channel domain 1. Transcripts containing the G406R mutation encode a channel that exhibits impaired voltage-dependent channel inactivation and, as a result, gives rise to prolonged activity-dependent elevations in intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paşca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Immature cells of the embryonic cortex possess a repertoire of ion channels and a chloride resting state that promotes depolarization by GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>). Disrupting GABA-induced excitation during this transitional state causes pronounced synaptic and behavioral defects associated with psychiatric disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang and Kriegstein, 2011</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> calcium imaging studies during normal development have suggested a role for GABA and glutamate depolarization, as well as synchronous calcium fluctuations, in the proliferation of radially clustered neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the developing mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LoTurco et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weissman et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, progressive temporally regulated hyperpolarization of cortical NPCs has been linked to the sequential emergence of distinct laminar fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vitali et al., 2018</xref>). The TS mutation in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 has been shown to alter later events in corticogenesis, including the elaboration of dendrites in immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2013</xref>) and the radial migration of upper layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamijo et al., 2018</xref>), but it remains unclear which channels mediate calcium signals in differentiating cells of the developing cortex and how their activity is controlled during differentiation. Moreover, the effects of these calcium signals on the transcription of downstream factors associated with neuronal specification, as well as their role in coupling electrical activity to extrinsic and intrinsic programs regulating NPC differentiation, are poorly understood.</p><p>Cortical development involves both temporal and spatial regulation of NPC differentiation. Upon exiting the cell cycle, newborn excitatory neurons sequentially migrate out of the ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ, SVZ) to their appropriate laminar destination within the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okano and Temple, 2009</xref>). During differentiation, these young neurons acquire a number of individual properties that collectively comprise their fate, including patterns of connectivity and electrical activity. The acquisition of neuronal subtype and laminar identity is regulated in part by subtype-specific genetic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fame et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Srinivasan et al., 2012</xref>). In layer V, for example, interhemispheric neurons that send projections through the corpus callosum to the contralateral hemisphere (callosal projection neurons, CPNs) are born concurrently with corticofugal neurons that send axons to subcortical structures and the spinal cord (subcerebral projection neurons, SCPNs). This divergent specification is mediated by mutually-repressive transcriptional programs. The specification of SCPNs requires the expression of the transcription factors FEZF2 and CTIP2, whereas persistent expression of the DNA-binding protein SATB2 is a hallmark of callosal projection neuron (CPN) identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcamo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arlotta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Britanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Using a human iPSC platform, our laboratory previously generated neurons from patients with TS. Patient cells displayed prolonged intracellular calcium elevations in response to depolarization and deficits in calcium signaling. The resulting changes in gene expression suggested a decrease in CPNs and proportional increase in SCPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paşca et al., 2011</xref>). Here, using both mouse brain and human iPSC-derived cortical cultures, we show that the differentiation of NPCs into post-mitotic neurons is accompanied by a shift in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 exon utilization from exon 8A to exon 8. iPSC-derived cells from individuals with TS fail to undergo this developmental shift to exon 8 utilization and continue to express gain-of-function channels containing the mutant exon 8A during neuronal differentiation. In a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in mice, we go on to show that persistent expression of TS gain-of-function channels is alone sufficient to phenocopy the differentiation defects observed in patient-derived neurons, altering the expression of fate determinants during neuronal differentiation in a calcium-dependent manner. Consistent with the idea that altering calcium levels in differentiating NPCs impacts the acquisition of neuronal identity, we also find that <italic>in utero</italic> Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 gain- and loss-of-function reciprocally regulate the generation of CPNs and SCPNs. Collectively, these data suggest that the TS mutation gives rise to developmental phenotypes in part by promoting continued expression of mutant channels that elevate calcium levels in differentiating cells to alter fate specification during corticogenesis. These findings represent the first demonstration of a potential role for electrically evoked signals from LTCs on the regulation of genetic programs specifying neuronal subtype identity in the developing cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 exon mutated in TS is enriched in undifferentiated progenitors and young neurons in mouse and human cortex</title><p>To determine the timing of TS mutant exon expression and the precise developmental window during which the TS mutation exerts its cellular phenotypes, we investigated the expression of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> exon 8A and its mutually exclusive alternate exon 8 during mouse and human corticogenesis.

To test whether the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels expressed in immature cells of the developing cortex contribute to intracellular calcium elevations in response to depolarization, we performed ratiometric calcium imaging using Fura-2 following application of GABA. For this analysis, we dissociated E12.5-E14.5 wild-type mouse cortices and grew cells on coverslips in the presence of bFGF and EGF (20 ng/ml) for 6–24 hr.

Recent work has described significant <italic>CACNA1C</italic> transcript diversity in the adult human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2020</xref>), and previous studies have suggested temporal regulation of the splicing of some exons of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in both the heart and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diebold et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the inclusion of exons 9* and 33 in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 transcripts, which confer distinct physiological channel properties, is inversely regulated during embryonic brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). In smooth muscle and heart, transcript scanning has also revealed tissue-specific splicing preferences, suggesting that precise utilization of exons is influenced by combinatorial and coordinated splicing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we found that exons 8 and 8A in the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene are dynamically regulated during mouse and human cortical development, consistent with a previous study in the mouse identifying an exon 8 splice repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). These exons are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion, and we show in this study that exon 8A is expressed at lower levels predominantly in undifferentiated cells early in development, whereas expression of exon 8 increases as neurons mature. How other exons may be coordinately regulated alongside exons 8 and 8A during neuronal differentiation remains unclear. Aside from combinatorial splicing of the pore-forming subunit, channel function can also be modulated by interactions with different auxiliary subunits and their splice isoforms. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of full-length Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 isoform expression in different classes of NPCs and neurons is an essential next step towards understanding the complex cell-type-specific regulation of calcium signaling during differentiation.</p><p>Previous studies investigating human Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 variants differing only in the inclusion of exon 8 or 8A report that exchanging these two exons yields channel isoforms with similar electrophysiological properties and only subtle changes in sensitivity to dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Welling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zühlke et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, the TS mutation causes a pronounced loss of voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) when introduced into either exon 8 or 8A. This results in persistent calcium influx through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels upon depolarization and accompanying deficits in calcium signaling and activity-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paşca et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that the TS mutation changes Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 splicing by inducing a shift that favors extended use of exon 8A in patient cells. The TS mutation thus not only increases calcium influx by impairing VDI, but also, by promoting continued expression of exon 8A, it ensures that gain-of-function channels containing the TS mutation continue to be expressed during differentiation. This change in splicing likely results from the fact that the TS mutation lies in the splice acceptor site of exon 8A, making it favored relative to the splice acceptor site of exon 8. Continued inclusion of exon 8A also prevents the change in <italic>CACNA1C</italic> splicing that would lead to expression of the wild-type channel at the appropriate time in development. Failure of this developmental splicing switch in TS alters the relative abundance of channels containing WT and mutant exons during development to contribute to cellular phenotypes caused by the mutation. While the full mechanistic impact of this alteration in splicing needs further investigation, the developmental difference in exon utilization reported here could explain the phenotypic differences observed between patients with the TS mutation in exon 8A and those in exon 8.</p><p>A significant mechanism underlying the gain-of-function effects of the TS mutation on differentiation appears to be due to alterations in exon use. As the TS mutation is known to prolong channel inactivation and thus intracellular calcium rises in response to depolarization, we reasoned that persistent expression of the TS mutation, owing to extended inclusion of exon 8A, would likely result in elevated activity-dependent calcium signaling as immature cells transition from NPC to post-mitotic neuron. We further hypothesized that these altered calcium dynamics could give rise to the differentiation defects observed in TS. It is becoming increasingly evident that neurons with distinct gene expression profiles, physiological properties, and projection patterns can be generated concomitantly during development and ultimately inhabit the same cortical layer. This observation is best exemplified in layer V, where a complex network of mutually repressive transcription factors sets the stage for the generation of SATB2-expressing CPNs and CTIP2-expressing SCPNs. It is not fully understood, however, how other intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact with these genetic programs to influence the specification of neuronal identity in the developing cortex. Here we show that introducing TS-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 calcium channels into mouse NPCs <italic>in utero</italic> reduces the fraction of SATB2-expressing cells, altering the ratio of early-born cortico-cortico CPNs relative to subcortically projecting SCPN neurons in the developing cortex without changing the abundance of progenitor subtypes that give rise to these cells. Our calcium imaging data, consistent with previous studies, confirms that the TS-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels we introduced <italic>in utero</italic> result in sustained calcium elevations as compared to channels that do not express the TS mutation. Collectively, the suppression of SATB2 identity resulting from expression of these TS-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels, together with the finding that channels that do not carry calcium do not affect the fraction of SATB2-expressing neurons, support the idea that intracellular calcium levels influence the expression of neuronal fate determinants in the developing cortex. Moreover, these data suggest that persistent elevations in calcium resulting from aberrant channel splicing and continued expression of mutant channels may underlie the defects in cortical differentiation seen in TS.</p><p>The idea that calcium may play an important role in the differentiation of cortical neurons is further supported by the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 gain- and loss-of-function studies in our study and is consistent with our previous work demonstrating that human iPSC-derived TS cortical neurons have reduced expression of SATB2 and increased expression of CTIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paşca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2013</xref>), in addition to deregulated calcium signaling. It should be noted here, however, that our expression and calcium imaging data suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 protein is expressed at relatively low levels in the ventricular zone and in only a fraction of NPCs. This is a striking contrast to neurons, in which Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 protein is more robustly expressed. We suspect, based on how long it would likely take to express functional channels at the cell membrane in our <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation experiments, that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 gain of function primarily occurs as NPCs exit the cell cycle and initiate differentiation. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that part of the gain of function phenotype resulting from electroporation of wild-type Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels is caused by expressing Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 at higher levels in cells that normally express it at relatively low levels, or, alternatively, not at all. Despite this possibility, our findings collectively reinforce the idea that elevated calcium is likely behind the changes we see in the relative abundance of CTIP2- and SATB2-expressing populations.</p><p>Precisely how calcium signaling may regulate the fate of developing cortical neurons remains a mystery. It is possible that CTIP2, SATB2, or other upstream regulators of projection neuron fate choice, such as the transcription factor FEZF2, are modulated via calcium. FEZF2 expression, for example, can be induced by brief neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>). In differentiating keratinocytes, CTIP2 degradation appears to be dependent on intracellular calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>), whereas in T cell fate commitment, MAPK signaling and sumoylation regulate CTIP2 activity in a coordinated fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>). Alternatively, calcium signaling may regulate the activity of subunits of neuronal chromatin remodeling complexes, including neuronal BAF (mSWI/SNF) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa, 2004</xref>), with which CTIP2 itself associates. Moving forward, it will be essential to establish the precise timing and influence of electrical activity and calcium signaling throughout the process of differentiation, and how electrical activity relates to mechanisms that underlie the effects of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 on cell fate decisions in normal and dysfunctional corticogenesis.</p><p>We propose that the changes in cortical excitatory neuron differentiation that we observe upon expression of TS channels significantly contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with TS. It is tempting to speculate that one way in which altered channel splicing and persistent expression of the G406R mutation cause ASD and intellectual disability in TS patients is by altering the ratio of cortico-cortico and subcerebral projection neurons in the cortex. This is unlikely to be the only mechanism by which the TS mutation contributes to ASD phenotypes, as other studies have demonstrated significant effects of the mutation on later developmental processes in the cortex like dendritic arborization and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamijo et al., 2018</xref>), which are also likely to affect circuits that control learning and social behavior in patients. Our <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments suggest that cells outside the developing cortex, such as striatal projection neurons, express exon 8A during embryonic development, as do immature cells in the germinal zones that give rise to cortical interneuron populations and nuclei of the basal ganglia. This observation indicates that the early development of other cell types is also likely to be influenced by the TS mutation. Indeed, using an iPSC spheroid platform, we have shown that cortical interneurons derived from TS patient cells display abnormal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birey et al., 2017</xref>). It would be interesting to interrogate how aberrant splicing induced by the TS mutation might contribute to this altered migration and to cellular phenotypes in other neuronal populations. Our study provides evidence that calcium influences the differentiation of excitatory neurons in the cortex and that the expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels containing the TS mutation in differentiating cells may underlie changes in neuronal circuitry that contribute to intellectual disability and ASD in TS patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Stanford University and UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and conducted in accordance with the Stanford University, UCSF and National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.

Primary cultures were loaded with 1 μM of the ratiometric dye Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C in Neurobasal media containing B27. Cells were then de-esterified in fresh media for 10 min, washed with Tyrode's solution and placed in a Warner Instruments perfusion chamber on an automated stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with an excitation filter wheel (TE2000U; Nikon). Solutions were perfused across cells using a manual injection setup. Cells were stimulated with application of 30 μM GABA in a low KCl Tyrode's solution (5 mM KCl, 129 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), in the presence or absence of 5 μM of the LTC inhibitor nimodipine, as delineated in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

Mutation of the glutamic acid residues at positions 1087, 2116, 3352 and 4255 into glutamine renders the channels calcium impermeable, as confirmed by ratiometric calcium imaging. All constructs were sequenced through, tested for expression following transfection into HEK293 cells (ATCC), and tested for function using ratiometric calcium imaging following transfection into Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells (ATCC). Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2-TS-IRES-EGFP, wild-type (WT) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2-IRES-EGFP, and pore mutant (4EQ) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2-IRES-EGFP constructs encoding Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels were co-transfected with encoding auxiliary β1β and α2δ1 subunits using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). Transfection of WT constructs induced a robust calcium rise, whereas pore mutant channels showed completely abrogated calcium rises in response to depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

The uterine horns were exposed by a ventral midline incision. Approximately 1 μl of DNA solution (1 μg/μl) was injected through the uterine wall directly into the lateral ventricles of each embryo using a sterile glass micropipette. Once the DNA was injected, two coiled platinum electrodes were placed outside of the uterus, on either side of fetus' head. Using a square pulse electroporator (BTX 830), five 50 msec pulses of 38-40V (at E13.5, 35V at E12.5; 950 msec interval between each pulse) were delivered. Following electroporation of all the embryos, the muscles of the abdominal wall of the pregnant female were sutured and the skin was stapled closed. Mice were closely monitored until fully awake and able to freely ambulate about the cage. Embryos were subsequently harvested for histological analysis at various time points after electroporation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Imaging and quantification</title><p>All images were captured on a Zeiss M1 Axioscope or Leica Dmi8 microscope. In order to quantify the proportion of electroporated cells that expressed CTIP2, SATB2, or Tbr1 at E16-E17, epifluorescence images were first acquired in the 20x field of view on a Zeiss M1 Axioscope microscope. To quantify the proportion of electroporated cells expressing PAX6 or TBR2 at E15, epifluorescence images were acquired in the 20x field of view on an inverted Leica Dmi8 microscope. Images were post-processed on ImageJ or Adobe Photoshop CS5. Whenever possible, analyses were conducted with the investigator blind to the construct injected. We manually counted the fraction of electroporated cells in the cortical plate (for CTIP2, SATB2, Tbr1) or the VZ/SVZ (for Pax6/Tbr2) that expressed each protein of interest in ImageJ within a counting window of 600 pixels width placed along the lateralmost region of the cerebral wall. Counts encompassed total cells from at least three to six sections per animal spanning caudal to rostral cortex (approximately 2.40 mm to 1.30 mm, according to E17.5 Paxinos developing mouse brain atlas), at least 100 cells per animal, from at least three animals per experimental group. At least two separate litters per experimental group were assessed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Anita Bhattacharyya as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Per Uhlén (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Panagiotakos et al., links calcium channel gene expression in cortical progenitors with sequential development of cortical layer neurons. The focus of the manuscript is Timothy syndrome (TS), an autism spectrum disorder affecting multiple organ systems that is caused by a mutation in the alternatively spliced exon (8A) of the calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2. The authors show that the TS mutation prevents a developmental switch in exon expression (8 to 8A) that normally occurs during cortical development. Through a series of expression studies, as well as gain and loss of function experiments, the authors show that the lack of exon switching causes altered differentiation of neuronal subtypes, specifically Layer V neurons. The reviewers agree that the authors compellingly show that the expression ratio of exon 8/8A affects neural cell fate during corticogenesis and that the inclusion of both mouse and human experiments is a strength of the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern raised by all reviewers is that the authors have not convincingly shown that altered calcium signaling, as the title states, drives altered differentiation although they have shown that disruption of calcium channel splicing patterns does. The authors rely on previous data and the use of calcium impermeable mutant channels to make the case that the developmental defects are dependent on calcium influx, but excessive calcium in neural progenitors that drives altered differentiation has not been directly shown. This concern can be addressed by modifying the title or by providing more explanation.</p><p>2) The authors rely heavily on their previous work but do not provide enough of a discussion of the work to enable the paper to stand alone. The characterization of the effects of the TS-channel mutation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics only becomes apparent only when reading the lab's previous work (Pasca et al., 2011). The manuscript would benefit from expanding the text on how TS-mutant channel effects Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, i.e. the increase in sustained phase, the inactivation dynamics etc. An explanation of what is driving the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in mutated cells is needed.</p><p>3) The authors should clarify discrepancies in the expression of mRNA and protein expression levels in the developing mouse brain. In contrast to mRNA expression, the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 protein seems to be expressed at rather low level (if any) in VZ/SVZ at E14 but high in IZ and remains in CP. The WB in Figure 2C also showed a dramatic increase of protein expression at E18 compared to E14, which seems due to the increased exon 8 inclusion (Figure 1A, the total mRNA of 8 + 8a doesn't seem to change that dramatic between E18 and E14). This raises the question if 8A mRNA is actively translated at early stages or the detection of protein at early stage is due to the expression (albeit at low level) of exon 8? Or despite the relatively homogeneous mRNA expression of 8A at E 14 in VZ/SVZ, only a few cells express Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 protein? If only a small number of progenitor cells express Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, in utero electroporation of wildtype Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 sequence may cause gain-of-function phenotype in stem/progenitor cells that do not normally express Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. This seems to be the case when comparing the number of GFP+ cells that express CTIP2 or SATB2 in Figure 2J and 3D. The mice that received Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2TS-EGFP and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2WT-EGFP have similar% of CTIP2 and SATB2 positive cells. The authors should add additional discussion to clarify these issues.</p><p>4) Reviewers had concerns about the cells' response to calcium in Figure 2. The authors may consider moving the Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in the supplementary figure to the main figure. In addition, the authors should address the following questions:</p><p>What percentage of cells displayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises, how many where blocked, and by how much?</p><p>Did cells exhibit spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, and if so, did it differ between genotypes?</p><p>Why did the authors use GABA to trigger a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-response?</p><p>Please provide details of how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> experiments where conducted (i.e. perfusion or bath-application of the drugs that is not described in the Materials and methods section).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51037.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern raised by all reviewers is that the authors have not convincingly shown that altered calcium signaling, as the title states, drives altered differentiation although they have shown that disruption of calcium channel splicing patterns does.

We have amended the title to emphasize the splicing change (“Aberrant calcium channel splicing drives cortical differentiation defects in a syndromic autism spectrum disorder”), and we have added additional text to more thoroughly explain the effects of the TS mutation on intracellular calcium elevations upon depolarization. Briefly, the splicing shift observed in patient cells prevents the switch to exon 8 expression and extends the developmental expression of exon 8A – this causes prolonged expression of the TS mutation during differentiation. As the TS mutation is known to prolong voltage-dependent inactivation and thus intracellular calcium rises in response to depolarization, we reasoned that continued expression of the mutation would result in increased calcium elevations during the transition from NPC to post-mitotic neuron. We can see how this may have been unclear in the initial submission, and we believe that the changes to the title and text may address this issue for readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors rely heavily on their previous work but do not provide enough of a discussion of the work to enable the paper to stand alone.

We have also moved the calcium imaging experiment from Figure 2—figure supplement 1 into main Figure 2 – this experiment, conducted by expressing Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels in a heterologous system, reinforces what we know about how the TS mutation alters intracellular calcium elevations. Consistent with previous work demonstrating that the TS mutation prolongs voltage-dependent channel inactivation, calcium elevations resulting from expression of a TS channel are more sustained as compared to channels not expressing the mutation. Pore-mutant channels, owing to four mutations in the pore-forming region of the channel (4EQ), do not pass calcium upon depolarization.</p><p>Reassuringly, the reduction in the relative abundance of SATB2+ cells that we observe with over-expression of channels containing the TS mutation is consistent with gene expression changes we previously reported in neurons generated from TS patients (Pasca et al., 2011). Introduction of wild-type and pore mutant channels further support the idea that changes in calcium elevations may underlie differentiation phenotypes in TS and, coupled with the loss-of-function studies, suggest that tight regulation of calcium levels in differentiating cells may be important for normal cell fate specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should clarify discrepancies in the expression of mRNA and protein expression levels in the developing mouse brain.

If only a small number of progenitor cells express Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2,<italic>in utero</italic>electroporation of wildtype Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 sequence may cause gain-of-function phenotype in stem/progenitor cells that do not normally express Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. This seems to be the case when comparing the number of GFP+ cells that express CTIP2 or SATB2 in Figure 2J and 3D. The mice that received Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2TS-EGFP and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2WT-EGFP have similar% of CTIP2 and SATB2 positive cells. The authors should add additional discussion to clarify these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this astute observation, as it is one that we have also considered extensively.

Previously published single cell RNA sequencing data in the embryonic mouse cortex demonstrates lower expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 transcripts in progenitor cells as compared to neurons between embryonic days E12 and E15 (Telley L, et al.

What this observation does reinforce, however, is the idea that excess calcium is likely behind the changes we see in the relative abundance of CTIP2 and SATB2 cells. We have amended the discussion to include consideration of this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewers had concerns about the cells' response to calcium in Figure 2.

As per the request of the reviewers, we have moved the calcium imaging data from Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to Figure 2. We have also added additional details in the Materials and methods section regarding how the calcium experiments were conducted.</p><p>As a point of clarification, the two sets of calcium imaging experiments presented in the manuscript had different goals. The data originally presented in Figure 2 (which have now been moved to Figure 2—figure supplement 1) were meant to complement the expression analysis of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 protein in Figure 2 panels A-C. Those experiments were not necessarily intended to comprehensively survey the complete repertoire of NPC calcium responses to depolarization, but rather to show that in immature cells that could be depolarized by GABA, functional L-type channels were expressed. We selected GABA to depolarize as it is a more specific manipulation that has previously been shown to depolarize NPCs in the embryonic cortex. However, most likely not all NPCs express GABA receptors, and of those that do, only a fraction express L-type calcium channels at the surface, as depicted in Figure 2B. Briefly, in this set of experiments, we dissociated primary cortical cultures from E12.5-E14.5 wild-type mice and grew those cells in growth factors for 6–24h. The fraction of cells that could be depolarized by GABA ranged between 20 and 55%. To the degree that we were able to detect, we did not observe spontaneous calcium elevations in this setting. This is likely because of the short time between when we extracted the cells and when we recorded their calcium elevations, as well as the fact that we dissociated the cells and did not maintain them as slices. Nevertheless, our findings were consistent with previous reports in rat cortical slices demonstrating that only a fraction of cells respond to GABA application with a calcium rise (Loturco J, et al. PMID: 8845153). Over the course of embryonic neurogenesis, gap junction coupling of NPCs gives way to a progressively increasing proportion of NPCs that can be depolarized by GABA (or glutamate). Of the responding cells, greater than 85% had their calcium rises nearly completely abrogated by application of nimodipine (by 50 seconds after application), suggesting that functional L-type channels are expressed at the membrane in at least a fraction of immature cells in the developing cortex. We have included additional individual imaging traces in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>In the second set of calcium experiments, we expressed the calcium channels that were electroporated <italic>in vivo</italic> in Neuro2a cells to confirm the effects of the TS mutation, as well as the pore mutations in the 4EQ constructs, on intracellular calcium elevations. Consistent with previous demonstrations that the TS mutation prolongs voltage-dependent channel inactivation, expression of TS channels resulted in more sustained calcium rises as compared to wild-type channels not expressing the mutation. Introducing pore mutations prevented any calcium influx upon depolarization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
