ethylene regulates a multitude of growth and developmental processes. How the numerous growth control pathways are coordinated by the ethylene transcriptional response remains elusive. We characterized the dynamic ethylene transcriptional response by identifying targets of the master regulator of the ethylene signaling pathway, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and transcript sequencing during a timecourse of ethylene treatment. Ethylene-induced transcription occurs in temporal waves regulated by EIN3, suggesting distinct layers of transcriptional control. EIN3 binding was found to modulate a multitude of downstream transcriptional cascades, including a major feedback regulatory circuitry of the ethylene signaling pathway, as well as integrating numerous connections between most of the hormone mediated growth response pathways. These findings provide direct evidence linking each of the major plant growth and development networks in novel ways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00675.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00675.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00675.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All multicellular organisms, including plants, produce hormones—chemical messengers that are released in one part of an organism but act in another. The binding of hormones to receptor proteins on the surface of target cells activates signal transduction cascades, leading ultimately to changes in the transcription and translation of genes.</p><p>Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone that acts at trace levels to stimulate or regulate a variety of processes, including the regulation of plant growth, the ripening of fruit and the shedding of leaves. Plants also produce ethylene in response to wounding, pathogen attack or exposure to environmental stresses, such as extreme temperatures or drought. Although the effects of ethylene on plants are well documented, much less is known about how its functions are controlled and coordinated at the molecular level.</p><p>Here, Chang et al. reveal how ethylene alters the transcription of DNA into messenger DNA (mRNA) in the plant model organism, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Ethylene is known to exert some of its effects via a protein called EIN3, which is a transcription factor that acts as the master regulator of the ethylene signaling pathway. To identify the targets of EIN3, Chang et al. exposed plants to ethylene and then used a technique called ChIP-Seq to identify those regions of the DNA that EIN3 binds to. At the same time, they used genome-wide mRNA sequencing to determine which genes showed altered transcription.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hr, ethylene induced four distinct waves of transcription, suggesting that discrete layers of transcriptional control are present. EIN3 binding also controlled a multitude of downstream transcriptional cascades, including a major negative feedback loop. Surprisingly, many of the genes that showed altered expression in response to EIN3 binding were also influenced by hormones other than ethylene.</p><p>In addition to extending our knowledge of the role of EIN3 in coordinating the effects of ethylene, the work of Chang et al. reveals the extensive connectivity between pathways regulated by distinct hormones in plants. The results may also make it easier to identify key players involved in hormone signaling pathways in other plant species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00675.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00675.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>temporal modulation</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>ethylene</kwd><kwd>hormone</kwd><kwd><italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG03-00ER15113, DE-FG02-04ER15517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-0924871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-111007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weirauch</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation, Plant Systems Biology IGERT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-0504645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Katherine Noelani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant GBMF3034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gates Millenium Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Katherine Noelani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RO1 GM085022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name><name><surname>Bar-Joseph</surname><given-names>Ziv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health, NRSA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32- HG004830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmitz</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1024999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The plant hormone ethylene regulates the expression of multiple genes in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including those that respond to other hormones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the importance of the plant hormone ethylene, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how its linear signaling pathway mediates many different morphological responses. The dynamic ethylene physiological response, a rapid growth inhibition independent of the master transcriptional regulator ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), followed by an EIN3-dependent sustained growth inhibition, calls for a temporal study of ethylene transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binder et al., 2004a</xref>). EIN3 has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the ethylene response and accumulates upon a duration of exogenous ethylene gas treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo and Ecker, 2003</xref>). Although hundreds of ethylene response genes have been identified, because some of the targets of EIN3 are transcription factors (<italic>e.g. ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1</italic> [<italic>ERF1</italic>]), it is challenging to distinguish immediate early targets from those further downstream. To understand the dynamics of the EIN3-mediated ethylene transcriptional response, we performed a genome-wide study of the ethylene-induced EIN3 protein-DNA interactions using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and simultaneously determined the repertoire of target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by ethylene (mRNA-Seq). Tracing the transcriptional cascade, we asked if EIN3-mediated genes contribute to a component of the ethylene transcriptional response. For a select number of EIN3 targets that are putative transcriptional regulators, DNA-binding motifs were identified using protein binding microarrays (PBM) and the enrichment for these motifs in the promoters of ethylene response genes was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We performed ChIP-Seq using a native antibody that recognizes EIN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo and Ecker, 2003</xref>) as well as mRNA-Seq in three-day-old dark grown seedlings during a timecourse of ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

EIN3 candidate targets that are not transcriptionally activated may require cofactors to induce a change in expression for a specific environmental response or developmental program. Quantitatively, the changes in EIN3 binding and steady-state transcription upon ethylene treatment do not correlate because the temporal transcription patterns are very diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, relatively high levels of EIN3 occupancy in etiolated seedlings treated with ethylene indeed correspond to increases in steady-state levels of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In fact, we were able to differentiate the characteristics of EIN3 candidate targets that exhibited a transcriptional response to ethylene from those that do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These waves display distinct temporal transcription behaviors (Hypergeometric p&lt;0.001), and the reduction of transcriptional noise occurs in successive temporal waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Genes that were enriched in specific biological functions within these four transcriptional waves include RNA binding/translation (Wave 1, Wave 3), cell wall maintenance (Wave 2), and response to endogenous stimulus (Wave 4). The second wave is also enriched for genes involved in cell wall maintenance, and the expression of these genes steadily increases following 1 hr of ethylene treatment, consistent with kinetics of EIN3-dependent growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binder et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vandenbussche et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The four waves of the ethylene transcriptional response each contain a unique subset of EIN3 candidate targets. The first wave is highly variable, lower in steady-state levels of transcription, and it also contains the lowest percentage of EIN3 candidate targets and hormone-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Previous ethylene growth rate inhibition studies have shown that low amounts of ethylene can result in adaptation and desensitization to subsequent ethylene stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binder et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2004b</xref>) . This first wave may serve as the immediate ethylene response, activating initial ethylene response genes as well as those that serve to desensitize the plant to subsequent ethylene stimulation, but this has yet to be shown. The next three waves of transcription are successively less variable and contain higher percentages of EIN3 candidate targets and hormone-related genes. The four waves of ethylene-induced transcription account for 50% of the transcriptionally ethylene-regulated EIN3 targets (EIN3-R), and the remaining EIN3 candidate targets are distributed among other patterns of transcription that do not contain significant numbers of EIN3 candidate targets in each transcriptional trajectory (Pathway hypergeometric p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The expression kinetics and reduction of transcriptional noise we observe in the ethylene-induced waves may be tied to distinct mechanisms of transcriptional control, or they may reflect heterogeneity of the ethylene response in different tissues, which can be resolved using single cell analysis. From the temporal ethylene transcriptional response patterns, it appears that the initial early ethylene transcriptional response is noisy and less focused functionally. During sustained exogenous ethylene application, EIN3 accumulates, and the established ethylene transcriptional response is hormone-focused and less noisy, but feed-forward and feed-back mechanisms mentioned below may serve to establish this functional specificity.</p><p>A recurring theme throughout this study is that the key players in the ethylene transcriptional response regulated by EIN3 are involved in plant hormone response pathways, and we anticipate a dense network of interconnections between the coregulated hormone pathways because hormones operate in concert, synergistically/antagonistically regulating growth and development. Although hormone pathway interconnections have been previously described by many groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaufmann et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), here we show that these interconnections exist at many regulatory levels and that the targets of EIN3 may regulate genes in these responses. Among the EIN3 candidate targets, we observed the enrichment of hormone-related targets among many different categorical sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, inset). These EIN3 targets include downstream effectors of the ethylene response, key ethylene signaling players, and genes involved in other hormone pathways/responses. Many of the EIN3-modulated downstream effectors are members of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, and as expected, these transcriptional initiators are up-regulated by ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, inset, green font).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00675.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Functional classification of EIN3 candidate targets reveals genes involved in hormone responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Feedback (ethylene signaling components, above) of the ethylene response and feedforward (downstream effectors, below).

Analysis of the ethylene-regulated EIN3 targets reveals a number of sites of ethylene signaling modulation of which the majority are negative regulators, supporting the idea that EIN3 is at the end of a signal transduction pathway, and that this regulatory logic dictates a negative feedback loop for homeostatic adaptable systems. More specifically, several negative regulators of the ethylene signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kendrick and Chang, 2008</xref>) were targets of EIN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), including three ethylene receptors (ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 [ETR2], ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1/2 [ERS1/2]), as well as REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY1 (RTE1), CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), and the previously mentioned EBF1/2. The induction of ETR2, ERS1/2 by ethylene was previously reported and has been suggested to restore ethylene receptor activity, resensitizing the plant to ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vandenbussche et al., 2012</xref>). The negative regulation of ethylene signaling by EIN3 through induction of CTR1 and ETR2 is further supported by the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that these proteins exhibit an increase in stabilization upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The EIN3 candidate targets account for more than twice the proportion of hormone genes than in the genome (46%, Hypergeometric p=10<sup>−96</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, inset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nemhauser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2008</xref>). Many of the genes were involved in more than one hormone response, highlighting the extensive hormone co-regulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hormone co-regulation is evident in the protein-protein as well as the transcriptional regulator interactions and this network reveals interconnectivity suggestive of robust regulatory co-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Many detailed examples of hormone co-regulation exist in the literature, but often the mechanism(s) of co-regulation is unknown. Previous ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq studies from plants have also revealed cross-regulation within pathways involved in flowering and in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iyer-Pascuzzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Winter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Immink et al., 2012</xref>) . The findings presented in our study suggest that (1) hormone co-regulation can occur through the binding of EIN3, (2) EIN3 targets hormone pathways at multiple levels, and (3) some of these events are transcriptionally regulated by ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Ethylene and jasmonate co-regulation occurs at the transcriptional level, sharing a complement of genes responsive to both hormones, for example <italic>RAP2.6L</italic>, <italic>ERF1</italic>. EIN3 also targets four JAZ repressors, two of which are transcriptionally regulated by ethylene (JAZ1, JAZ6). In general, ethylene and jasmonate are known to function synergistically and in the presence of jasmonate, JAZ1 proteins bound to EIN3 are degraded, relieving the EIN3 transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Here, the presence of an exogenous ethylene stimulus primes cells for a jasmonate response, by loading the promoters of jasmonate/ethylene response genes with EIN3 and JAZ proteins, poising the plant for a jasmonate-ethylene driven transcriptional program, as required for plant pathogen response. Reports of anticipatory binding in other organisms have been forth coming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macquarrie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lickwar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ethylene and gibberellin co-regulation through EIN3 occurs at signal reception (GID1B, GID1C) and transcription (PIF3). The regulatory logic of EIN3 binding results in an up-regulation of the gibberellin response; GID receptors target DELLA repressors for degradation, which releases PIF3 from repression, resulting in the activation of the gibberellin transcriptional response. Additional support for feed-forward transcription is provided by over-representation of the PIF3 motif in the promoter sequences of the ethylene transcriptional response genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hormone co-regulation may also occur bidirectionally as a recent study reported negative regulation of ethylene by FUSCA3 (FUS3), known to regulate and be regulated by gibberellin and abscisic acid in embryonic and vegetative timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lumba et al., 2012</xref>). FUS3 negatively regulates genes upstream and downstream of EIN3 (EIN2 and ERF1) in leaf aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lumba et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ethylene and auxin co-regulation occurs at both the level of transport and transcriptional response, as EIN3 modulates a regulator of auxin efflux (PID) and its upstream activator (PBP1), and at least seven auxin response proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). EIN3 also targets the auxin transporter (AUX1) and an auxin signaling gene (IAA29), but these candidate targets are not responsive to ethylene in etiolated seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Ethylene has been reported to stimulate auxin transport through AUX1 away from the root apex, to decrease lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is likely these binding events have functional outcomes in specific tissue types or developmental programs not addressed in this study.</p><p>The establishment of a transcriptional program tailored to result in a specific growth and development process requires multiple levels of transcriptional modulation. EIN3 was previously suggested to initiate a transcriptional cascade because it activates AP2/ERF transcription factors ERF1/EDF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Solano et al., 1998</xref>). To determine additional candidate downstream effectors that may modulate the ethylene transcriptional response cascade, we used in vitro protein binding microarrays to generate DNA-binding motifs for 12 transcription factors that were ethylene-regulated targets of EIN3 (see ‘Materials and methods’). We then used the in vitro DNA-binding motifs to scan the promoter sequences of all ethylene transcriptional response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam et al., 2011</xref>). EIN3 targets that may regulate a secondary transcriptional ethylene response include AP2/ERFs AT-ERF1, ERF5, and WRKY14/47, PIF3, NAC6, and RAP2.2, and the DNA-binding motifs of the aforementioned transcription factors are over-represented in the promoter regions of genes that are regulated by ethylene (Hypergeometric p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future in vivo analyses of the targets of these transcription factors may help elucidate their contribution to the transcriptional cascade of the ethylene response.</p><p>The extensive hormone co-regulation that occurs in waves of transcription leads to certain testable predictions regarding the key regulatory hubs and transcriptional cascades at a genome-wide level. Using a global approach, we are able to determine not only if one gene is a candidate target of EIN3, but whether its homologs are targets as well. Transcription factor targeting of genes that are homologous, with overlapping and unique functions, can add diversity to the outputs of transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macquarrie et al., 2011</xref>). One of the most striking and surprising example we found was the direct regulation of the three homologs by EIN3, <italic>HOOKLESS1</italic> (<italic>HLS1</italic>) and <italic>HLS1-LIKE HOMOLOG2</italic> (<italic>HLH2</italic>), and to a lesser extent <italic>HLH1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>HLH1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To understand this hormone co-regulation, we generated quadruple mutants for the <italic>HLS1</italic> gene family and also further characterized their role as regulatory hub signal integrators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The pleiotropic phenotypes we observed support the role of the <italic>HLS1</italic> gene family in auxin regulated plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). We observed severe defects in the embryonic patterning, etiolated seedlings, adult plant morphology, and floral morphology. The adult quadruple mutants display a dwarf phenotype, similar to the auxin mutant <italic>axr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leyser et al., 1993</xref>), and floral morphology of the quadruple mutants display two stigmas atop a gynoecium, similar to the <italic>arf3/ettin</italic> mutant floral phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sessions and Zambryski, 1995</xref>). Although <italic>HLS1</italic> is known to be involved in the differential growth of the apical hook and is necessary for the accumulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2) DNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohto et al., 2006</xref>), the biochemical function of these putative N-acetyltransferases remains to be determined. Using a genome-wide approach, we found that not only HLS1, but other gene family members are targets of EIN3 and that the requirement of the HLS proteins for hormone responses extends beyond apical hook development to many other processes from embryo patterning to flowering, linking the regulation of growth and development by ethylene to many new biological processes in novel ways.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, few temporal transcription factor binding studies have been undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiroi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>). Temporal protein–DNA interactions are often difficult to reconcile with gene expression profiles and the complexity of regulation that occurs transcriptionally is very challenging to characterize and interpret biologically. Here, by jointly analyzing the temporal expression and genome-wide binding data of one key transcription factor in response to hormone stimulus, we were able to reveal several important properties of the hormone responsive transcriptional program and identify new components in the signaling pathway. We found that upon a timecourse of ethylene treatment, EIN3 binding was induced, resulting in various transcriptional patterns and that the ethylene transcriptional response occurred in waves of transcription that were temporally distinct and could be attributed to different biological functions, variable in the amount of noise, and significantly regulated by EIN3. EIN3 modulated genes were over-represented in hormone co-regulation, and the specific targets in the other hormone pathways, as reported in this study, suggest these ‘cross-talk’ events may involve multiple levels of regulation. Interestingly, feedback regulation of the ethylene response by EIN3 enabled the identification of the majority of known ethylene signaling pathway components. Moreover, the temporal resolution of steady-state levels of transcription confirmed the role of these genes in the ethylene transcriptional response. Other signaling networks utilize feedback regulation for overall system control/homeostasis, and this type of study may be used to identify novel components in signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yosef and Regev, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The implication that EIN3 regulates the coordination of other hormone pathways is extensive because the transcriptional control by EIN3 is likely conserved in plants.

Two of the methods, BEEML-PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao and Stormo, 2011</xref>), and FeatureREDUCE (PWM modification of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foat et al., 2006</xref>]) are based on biophysical models of TF-DNA interactions. The third algorithm (PWM_align) is an in-house method that aligns all 8mers with E-scores &gt; 0.45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2008</xref>) using ClustalW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chenna, 2003</xref>), and trims the resulting alignment by restricting to positions present in at least half of the sequences in the alignment.</p><p>The presence of these motifs in the promoter region (−1000bp) of genes that were transcriptionally induced/repressed by ethylene was evaluated to find candidate transcription factors that may be involved in regulating the secondary ethylene transcriptional response. The matrix screening software Patser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hertz and Stormo, 1999</xref>) was used to scan the promoter region of all genes that were transcriptionally regulated by ethylene, with the PBM motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>mRNA-seq analysis</title><p>The SOLiD Bioscope v.1.3 software was used to align the reads to the Col-0 reference genome TAIR10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/">ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>). Two perfect matches per location were allowed. Exonic expression was determined (RPKM) using mRNA-Seq reads mapping in exons in the direction of transcription. Genes were denoted as expressed if they contained RPKM values greater than one for at least one biological replicate in one timepoint. Differentially expressed genes were then called (<italic>t</italic>-test p=0.05, 50% difference from prior timepoint of ethylene gas treatment), and log2 normalized with respect to the 0 hr ethylene gas treatment control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overlap of up- and down-regulated genes was ∼1%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Correlation of EIN3 binding and changes in mRNA steady-state levels</title><p>EIN3 ChIP candidate targets were classified as ethylene regulated (EIN3-R), non-ethylene-regulated (EIN3-NR), and transcription not detected in etiolated seedlings (EIN3-ND). The heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) revealed that there is a singular binding pattern but various transcription profiles, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Although the majority of EIN3 candidate targets were up-regulated by ethylene, consistent with the previously determined role of EIN3 as an activator, a subset of EIN3 candidate targets was repressed upon ethylene treatment; one instance of EIN3 as a repressor has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The correlation of EIN3 binding and ethylene-regulated transcription was calculated at from 4 hr of ethylene treatment (0 hr ethylene as a control), for all EIN3 and EIN3-R (ethylene-induced) targets. The R<sup>2</sup> values were much less than 0.50, suggesting a lack of correlation of EIN3 binding levels and ethylene-regulated steady-state transcription.</p><p>The kinetics of transcription was determined for all genes that were transcriptionally regulated by ethylene, and EIN3-R, and reflects the previous growth inhibition study kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ethylene transcriptional response was further analyzed in context of the dynamic EIN3 binding data. To reconstruct the dynamic regulatory networks that were activated following ethylene treatment, we used the Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ernst et al., 2007</xref>). DREM integrates time-series gene expression data with static transcription factor (TF)—gene interaction data to reconstruct these dynamic networks. DREM searches for bifurcation events; places in the time series data where the expression of one set of genes diverges from the expression of another set, and annotates these events with the TFs that can explain them. This allows us to assign a time of activation to static TF-gene interactions data. To obtain the static interaction data we extracted 11,355 TF-gene interactions from the AtRegNet AGRIS database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yilmaz et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, for this work we have extended DREM so that it can utilize temporal EIN3 binding profiles as well as allowing us to identify functional binding events (those with direct impact on expression). This is done by changing the set of targets for EIN3 so that different binding values are used at each time point. For each EIN3 candidate target gene, the average RPKM values from two input control samples at 0 and 4 hr were used as a cutoff to determine whether it was bound by EIN3 or not at each time point. We ran the modified DREM algorithm using the mRNA-Seq data allowing for 3-way splits. We filtered out genes that did not change at least twofold (up or down) at any time point, and we used the default values for all other parameters.</p><p>Four temporally distinct (Hypergeometric p&lt;0.001) EIN3-modulated waves of transcription (Pathway hypergeometric p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>) were observed. There was a variable amount of noise and percentage of hormone-related genes in each wave of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The comprehensive DREM analysis results are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), including all observed patterns of ethylene transcriptional regulation. The over path significance was used to determine whether these waves were regulated by EIN3. A stringent threshold (10<sup>−10</sup>) was used to identify groups of genes with a significant percentage (&gt;15%) of EIN3 candidate targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Generation of hormone co-regulation network</title><p>The most current protein-protein interaction network for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium, 2011</xref>) containing high throughput yeast two hybrid and literature curated data was used as the foundation for the hormone co-regulation network.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by Detlef Weigel (<italic>eLife</italic> Deputy Editor) and an outside peer reviewer. Both discussed their comments and the following reflects their combined assessment of your work.</p><p>The manuscript by Chang et al. greatly advances our understanding of how the effects of the plant hormone ethylene are mediated at the molecular level. The authors present a coordinated analysis of transcriptional changes and genome-wide binding of the key transcription factor EIN3 (which accumulates upon ethylene treatment and which is both necessary and sufficient for most ethylene responses) during a time course after addition of ethylene. There are very few reports in the literature tracking genome-wide transcription factor binding after a stimulus, and the integration with gene expression measurements greatly increases the inferences that can be drawn from the genome-wide DNA binding studies. This tour de force will set a new bar for the analysis of transcription factor networks.</p><p>Using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, the authors analyzed young Arabidopsis seedlings for EIN3 binding and transcriptional modulation after addition of ethylene. Important findings are that there are several discrete waves of transcriptional responses; that a negative feedback loop represses ethylene receptor expression; and that much of the previously known cross-talk between hormone pathways involves EIN3 binding to genes regulated by several hormones. The interaction with other hormone pathways is nicely demonstrated with the knockout of a small family of closely related EIN3 targets, which reproduces aspects of phenotypes seen in mutants deficient in the response to another hormone, auxin.</p><p>The authors also introduce a clever shortcut for understanding the regulatory logic of the later waves of ethylene triggered gene expression. They first nominate candidates for transcription factors that themselves are transcriptionally responsive to EIN3 and that mediate these later responses. The authors then use microarrays to identify sequences that 12 such candidate factors can bind to in vitro. These motifs are then confirmed to be overrepresented in the promoters of the late EIN3 targets.</p><p>The only major criticism is that the authors should think a bit harder about their nomenclature. It seems that “targets” refer to any genomic sequence that is bound by EIN3 (or any gene that is within a certain distance from an EIN3 binding site). More commonly, “target” is reserved for bona fide repressed or activated genes. For example, the sentence “many EIN3 targets were not transcriptionally ethylene-regulated (EIN3-NR) (67%), while a subset of the EIN3 targets was transcriptionally ethylene-regulated” should be rephrased as “only about 30% of EIN3 binding sites were associated with transcriptional changes; at least two third were not”.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The first wave of transcriptional regulation does not look very much like a set of coordinated genes.

The nine others occur in other waves of transcription. Note that the two genes that are repressed by ethylene do not contain over-representation of DNA binding motifs in the promoters of ethylene response genes. It is unknown why the DNA binding motif of At3g24120 is not over-represented in ethylene response genes. Further experimentation (ChIP-Seq with antibodies generated to these transcriptions factors) is required to understand these results.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>AtID</th><th>Gene Name</th><th>p-value</th><th>Wave of EIN3 enrichment</th><th>Ethylene Induced (+) or Repressed(-)</th><th>Average log2 RPKM at 4hrs vs. 0hrs ethylene</th><th>Average log2 EIN3 RPKM at 4hrs vs. 0hrs ethylene</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AT1G30650</td><td>WRKY14</td><td>2.76E-44</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.14</td><td>3.14</td></tr><tr><td>AT1G09530</td><td>PIF3</td><td>1.29E-41</td><td>Wave 4</td><td>+</td><td>0.70</td><td>2.01</td></tr><tr><td>AT5G39610</td><td>NAC6</td><td>1.07E-34</td><td>Wave 3</td><td>+</td><td>1.66</td><td>2.68</td></tr><tr><td>AT4G01720</td><td>WRKY47</td><td>3.16E-18</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.26</td><td>1.71</td></tr><tr><td>AT4G17500</td><td>AT-ERF1</td><td>6.58E-12</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.65</td><td>1.54</td></tr><tr><td>AT5G47230</td><td>ERF5</td><td>4.55E-11</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.53</td><td>2.42</td></tr><tr><td>AT3G14230</td><td>RAP2.2</td><td>3.33E-06</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.79</td><td>2.29</td></tr><tr><td>AT1G43160</td><td>RAP2.6</td><td>1.32E-03</td><td>Wave 3</td><td>+</td><td>1.48</td><td>2.68</td></tr><tr><td>AT3G60530</td><td>GATA4</td><td>2.86E-03</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.66</td><td>1.64</td></tr><tr><td>AT1G10480</td><td>ZFP5</td><td>1.00E+00</td><td>N/A</td><td>-</td><td>-0.76</td><td>2.79</td></tr><tr><td>AT3G24120</td><td/><td>1.00E+00</td><td>N/A</td><td>+</td><td>0.50</td><td>1.84</td></tr><tr><td>AT3G60390</td><td>HAT3</td><td>1.00E+00</td><td>N/A</td><td>-</td><td>-0.64</td><td>1.61</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p><italic>3) Results: is the binding of EIN3 to promoters of HLS paralogs associated with overall sequence conservation of the promoters</italic>?</p><p>Using ClustalW, we aligned the promoters of HLS1, HLH1, HLH2, HLH3 (3000bp upstream) as well as the EIN3 binding sites in these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>).

We observed an increased number of rosette leaves in the quadruple mutant (n=21), in comparison to wild-type plants (n=12). This phenotype suggests an enhanced not impaired axillary bud emergence, which is expected because auxin inhibits axillary bud emergence in wildtype plants. Concurrent mutations in HLS1 and its homologs resulted in various floral phenotypes. Mutants flowered earlier (2 weeks long day/3 weeks short day) in comparison to the wild type (4 weeks long day/8 weeks short day). Additionally, the quadruple mutant plants lacked apical dominance, producing numerous inflorescences that were sterile. The increased number of rosette leaves and the early flowering phenotype indicate that the quadruple mutants have an accelerated development rate than that of wild type. Interestingly, we found that ARF2 protein accumulates in the quadruple mutant. <italic>arf2</italic> mutants were reported to have increased leaf longevity (Lim et al. 2010, J Exp Botany), and as mentioned previously, it appears the quadruple mutant exhibits the converse phenotype, accelerated development. However, the regulatory logic of ARF2 as a repressor of the auxin response is not simple, if it were, the HLS/HLH quadruple mutant resulting in an increase of ARF2 would therefore result in enhanced repression of the auxin response. However, using Biomaps, genes up-regulated in the quadruple mutant were significantly enriched for “response to auxin” function (unpublished observation). Finally, it is currently not possible to apply exogenous auxin with the expectation of proper delivery of the hormone and complementation of the many phenotypes observed. Regarding ethylene, the quadruple mutant is partially insensitive to ethylene and thus cannot be rescued by the hormone.</p></body></sub-article></article>
