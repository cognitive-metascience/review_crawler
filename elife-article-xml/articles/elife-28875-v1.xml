pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28875.001</object-id><p>The cutaneous wound-healing program is a product of a complex interplay among diverse cell types within the skin. One fundamental process that is mediated by these reciprocal interactions is the mobilization of local stem cell pools to promote tissue regeneration and repair. Using the ablation of epidermal caspase-8 as a model of wound healing in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, we analyzed the signaling components responsible for epithelial stem cell proliferation. We found that IL-1α and IL-7 secreted from keratinocytes work in tandem to expand the activated population of resident epidermal γδT-cells. A downstream effect of activated γδT-cells is the preferential proliferation of hair follicle stem cells. By contrast, IL-1α-dependent stimulation of dermal fibroblasts optimally stimulates epidermal stem cell proliferation. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation and function of epidermal cell–immune cell interactions and into how components that are classically associated with inflammation can differentially influence distinct stem cell niches within a tissue.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28875.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin is a physical barrier that protects the body from the outside world. If the skin is injured, the body mounts a “wound healing” response to rapidly mend and restore this protective barrier. Wound healing is a complex process and relies on the different types of cells in the skin communicating with each other.</p><p>Stem cells provide tissues, like the skin, with new cells. Normally, stem cells are in a resting or inactive state. Yet, during wound healing, stem cells near the injured area are awakened and start producing more cells to repair the wound. Understanding how stem cells become activated in a wound has proved challenging because only a small number of cells near a damaged site will respond, and it is difficult to distinguish their response from that of other cells slightly further away.</p><p>Now, Lee et al. overcome this hurdle by analyzing a genetically engineered mouse in which the entire skin displays a wound healing response, even without any injury or trauma. In these mice, most of the stem cells in the skin are awakened from their normal resting state and behave as if there is a wound to heal.</p><p>It turns out that a protein called interleukin-1, which is released from damaged skin cells known as keratinocytes, can activate two different groups of stem cells in the skin to help repair the injured tissue. One group lives in the hair follicle and is normally responsible for replacing the hair that falls from the body. Lee et al. found that when the skin is wounded interleukin-1 activates certain immune cells (called γδT-cells). These immune cells then awaken the resting stem cells in the hair follicle to multiply and travel to the wound site to repair the injury. The other group of stem cells resides in the outermost layer of the skin. Interleukin-1 can also activate so-called fibroblast cells, which then stimulate this second group of stem cells to divide and cover the open wound.</p><p>Quickly healing wounds has many health benefits such as preventing infection and shortening the time to recover from an injury. These new findings may help to repair injured skin in diseases such as diabetes, where wounds can take months to heal and often leads to permanent tissue damage. The next challenge is to identify the cues that instruct the stem cells to travel to the wound site and turn into the specific cells that are required to replace the damaged cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>interleukin</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>stem

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the main functions of the skin is to provide the body with a barrier against external assaults while preventing excessive loss of moisture. As a result, the skin is constantly regenerating itself, but once this barrier has been breached through injury, a wound-healing response is rapidly mobilized to restore this barrier. The wound-healing response is a complex process that relies on the careful orchestration of signals coming from various cell types. Following injury, three sequential but overlapping phases are initiated, commencing with inflammation, followed by proliferation of stem cells and concluding with tissue remodeling. Despite their temporal differences, there is significant interdependence among these phases that enables the restoration of tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurtner et al., 2008</xref>). One such interdependency is the interaction between the inflammation and proliferation phases, which can be mediated by members of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinarello, 2009</xref>). However, the mechanism(s) by which IL-1 proteins mediate proliferation of different cell types within the repairing organ remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Epidermal keratinocytes are a rich source of IL-1α, which is released upon tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). Unlike IL-1β, which must be proteolytically processed into its active form, IL-1α is active as a zymogen and, upon secretion from epidermal keratinocytes, can play key roles in the early inflammatory phase of the wound-healing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi, 2007</xref>). In addition, IL-1α plays an important role in mediating the reciprocal crosstalk between cells within the epidermis and dermis that stimulates the secretion of stem cell proliferation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Szabowski et al., 2000</xref>). The proliferative phase of the healing program rests on the ability of various epithelial stem cell pools, such as interfollicular epidermal (IFE) stem cells and hair follicle stem cells (HfSC), to contribute progenitor cells to seal the breached epidermis rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2009</xref>). As a model, we used the epidermal caspase-8 knockout, which has a uniform wound-healing phenotype throughout the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), to investigate the mechanisms by which IL-1 signaling mobilizes different epithelial stem cell pools to mount an effective wound-healing response. An understanding of the regulation of stem cell proliferation within the context of an organ will advance the goal of enhancing the regenerative process or tempering diseases that have features of a chronic wound-healing response (i.e. diseases with a ‘wound signature’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schäfer and Werner, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of IL-1 signaling on the proliferative phase of the wound-healing response</title><p>As we previously observed, IL-1-dependent signaling is crucial for a normal wound-healing response as mice deficient in the interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R KO) displayed a 2-day delay in wound closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Werner and Smola, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, a closer analysis of the delay in wound-closure kinetics reveals a defect that manifests itself significantly at day 3 post-wounding, suggesting a role for IL-1 signaling in the proliferative phase of the wound-healing response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous findings that IL-1 mediates a double paracrine signaling loop wherein keratinocyte–fibroblast crosstalk generates growth factors that stimulate epidermal stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Werner and Smola, 2001</xref>). Extending upon this concept, we observed that the interfollicular stem cell proliferation induced by a wound is significantly impaired in the absence of IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In light of these observations, we investigated whether other epithelial stem cell pools that are mobilized upon wounding were likewise dependent upon IL-1 signaling. In particular, we focused on the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) residing in their niche within the hair follicle known as the bulge. These bulge stem cells are responsible for the cyclical regeneration of the hair under homeostatic conditions, but are stimulated to proliferate and migrate into the epidermis following a cutaneous wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2005</xref>). We found that CD34+ HFSCs were highly proliferative (as noted by Ki67+/CD34+ cells) in hair follicles proximal to the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but were relatively quiescent in follicles distal to the wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, this increase in HFSC proliferation was also significantly dependent upon IL-1 signaling. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, there was a substantial decrease in the number of CD34<sup>+</sup> HFSCs that were expressing the proliferating antigen Ki67 3 days post-wounding. Upon tracking the status of HFSC proliferation over the course of the wound-healing program, we observed that there was a quantitative decrease in proliferating HFSCs as early as one day post-wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This decrease in HFSC proliferation perdured throughout the proliferative phase of the wound-healing program. Given the contribution of epithelial stem cell proliferation to the repair of the epidermis, we examined whether the impairment of both IFE stem cell and HFSC proliferation in the IL-1R KO background would manifest as a hindrance to the expansion of the epidermis upon wounding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), the epidermal region proximal to the wound is hyperplastic, but this response is diminished in the absence of IL-1 signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28875.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impact of IL-1 signaling on epidermal stem cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of proliferating cells in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) of the skin from WT or IL1R-KO 8-week-old mice 3 days post-wound.

The heterogeneous response of cells up to 200 μm from the wound site makes it difficult to identify the extracellular cytokines and intracellular signaling pathways that orchestrate the wound-healing response in this physiological system. We addressed this constraint by employing a genetic wound-healing model based on the epidermal ablation of caspase-8 (Casp8 cKO) that converts the entire skin to a wound-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to the observations made with excisional wounds, the Casp8 cKO mouse model of wound healing displayed a thicker epidermis compared to the skin of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, desensitization of the cells to IL-1 signaling (via the removal of the IL-1 receptor) significantly reduced this epidermal thickening. These results confirm our previous finding that one mechanism through which epidermal stem cell proliferation is achieved is through IL-1α-mediated induction of keratinocyte proliferation factors from dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). The thickened epidermal phenotype was partly due to enhanced proliferation of Keratin-5<sup>+</sup> IFE cells, which is elevated in the Casp8 cKO skin and reduced in the absence of IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine whether HFSCs were also contributing to the epidermal thickening in the Casp8 cKO, the proliferation of these cells was measured. The Casp8 cKO skin had more than a two-fold increase in proliferating HFSC when compared to WT skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In the absence of IL-1 signaling, the number of proliferating HFSCs in the Casp8 cKO skin decreased by ~30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These findings were further corroborated upon detecting HFSCs with an antibody recognizing Sox9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). There was a substantial increase in Sox9 +HFSCs in the wounded skin and this increase was substantially reduced in the absence of the IL-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Despite the significant contributions of IL-1 signaling to the development of the epidermal thickening in the Casp8 cKO line, removing IL-1 signaling was not sufficient to reduce the epidermal thickness to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is probably due to the contribution of other factors, such as leukocyte-derived signals that are capable of promoting stem cell proliferation, in a wound microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eming et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>An important contributor to wound-closure kinetics during the proliferative phase of wound healing is cell migration. Moreover, it has previously been reported that IL-1α can stimulate epidermal keratinocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1995</xref>). We therefore explored whether IL-1α can similarly serve as a chemoattractant to stimulate HFSC emigration from the bulge to the wound site. To separate the effect of IL-1α on HFSC migration from proliferation unambiguously, we reconstituted the migration in a transwell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). When treated with conditioned media (CM) from the Casp8 cKO epidermis, primary mouse HFSCs showed a &gt;3 fold increase in chemotaxis relative to cells exposed to CM from wild-type epidermis. Interestingly, HFSCs lacking the IL-1R remained responsive to the chemotactic cue in the Casp8 cKO CM. This finding is consistent with the observation that recombinant IL-1 was incapable of inducing the transwell migration of HFSCs. Altogether, this provides evidence that IL-1α is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce HFSC migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of γδT-cells phenocopies the deficiency of IL-1 signaling in the epithelial compartment of the wound-like skin</title><p>As IL-1 signaling is classically associated with the establishment of localized inflammation, we interrogated the inflammatory response in the wound lacking the IL-1R. Among the earliest inflammatory cells that respond to injury are macrophages and granulocytes, which are known to enhance the proliferation of epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin, 1997</xref>). In the Casp8 cKO skin, the numbers of macrophages and granulocytes were increased and a marked reduction in the numbers of these cells was observed in the absence of IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, other well-established contributors to the wound-healing program are epidermal resident γδT-cells, also known as dendritic epidermal T-cells (DETCs). Following a stress signal such as wounding, γδT-cells become activated and promote epidermal stem cell proliferation by secreting keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, also known as FGF7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jameson and Havran, 2007</xref>). Wound healing is impaired in γδT-cell deficient mice, which underscores the important role of these immune cells in the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jameson et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, γδT-cells play an important role in the recruitment of other immune cells such as macrophages during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jameson et al., 2005</xref>). In the Casp8 cKO/Tcrd<sup>−/−</sup> (γδT-cell KO) mouse, the number of granulocytes and macrophages were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, γδT-cell numbers are increased in the Casp8 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), but in the absence of IL-1 signaling, there is a dramatic reduction of the numbers of these cells in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given the ability of γδT-cells to stimulate epidermal stem cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the removal of these cells would reduce the epidermal hyperplasia in the Casp8 cKO mouse as does the loss of IL-1 signaling. We found that the epidermal thickness in the Casp8 cKO/Tcrd<sup>−/−</sup> mouse was significantly reduced in comparison to that in the Casp8 cKO mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We then assessed the status of HFSCs in the Casp8 cKO background and its dependence on the activity of γδT-cells. Proliferating HFSCs were marked by a pulse of EdU, which is incorporated into the replicating DNA of dividing cells. Owing to antibody incompatibility, we visualized the arrector pili muscle (APM) with α-smooth muscle actin as a landmark for the HFSC niche (the bulge), which resides at the terminus of the APM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poblet et al., 2002</xref>). In the wild-type skin, there is a minimal amount of EdU, whereas the Casp8 cKO skin exhibits robust EdU signal in the bulge region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, this elevated proliferation is markedly reduced in the Casp8 cKO skin lacking functional γδT-cells. Interestingly, the impact of γδT-cell activity is more pronounced upon HFSC proliferation than in IFE cells in the Casp8 cKO skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This same reliance on γδT-cells activity for optimized stem cell proliferation was also observed when the stimulus was an excisional wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Likewise, the impairment of epithelial stem cell proliferation in the skin resulting from compromised γδT-cells drastically reduces the epidermal hyperplasia that accompanies the wound-healing program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We also tested the possibility that IL-1 signaling exerts its effect separately from γδT-cells. We thus examined whether the expression of IL-1α is affected in the absence of γδT-cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, the amount of extracellular IL-1α was comparable in Casp8 cKO skin and Casp8 cKO/Tcrd<sup>−/−</sup> skin. This was verified by quantitation of IL-1 secretion in wounded samples from wild-type and Tcrd<sup>−/−</sup> skin, wherein the IL-1α levels were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>). These data point to the fact that, despite normal levels of IL-1α in the wound, active γδT-cells are necessary to elicit the early stimulation of HFSC proliferation. Altogether, these observations suggest that IL-1 signaling converges upon γδT-cells to mediate epithelial stem cell proliferation in the skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Activation of γδT-cells by IL-1</title><p>As IL-1 signaling elicits many of the same effects as activated γδT-cells, we then focused on interrogating whether there is a direct relationship between IL-1 signaling and γδT-cell function. The remarkable ability of γδT-cells to perform a variety of effector functions depends on their ability to recognize stress signals coming from keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jameson and Havran, 2007</xref>). Unlike αβ T-cells, which recognize protein fragments processed by antigen presenting cells, the effector function of γδT-cells depends on a combination of a yet unknown antigen recognized by the γδ-TCR and a variety of co-stimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witherden et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, keratinocytes that are stressed during wound healing increase the expression of the coxsakie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), which acts as a co-stimulatory ligand that is recognized by the junctional adhesion molecule-like protein (JAML) on the surface of γδT-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witherden et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Witherden and Havran, 2011</xref>). Upon activation by a wound, γδT-cells undergo a variety of changes that are hallmarks of an activated cell, including the loss of dendritic extensions, increased proliferation and secretion of cytokines and growth factors that are essential for wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jameson and Havran, 2007</xref>). Among the functional consequences of γδT-cell activation is enhanced proliferation of epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jameson et al., 2002</xref>) and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, a stronger effect on HFSC proliferation. As epithelial stem cell proliferation was decreased in the caspase-8/IL1R dKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), we hypothesized that IL-1 signaling is required for optimal activation of γδT-cell, which, in turn, promotes the proliferation of cutaneous epithelial stem cells.</p><p>Using the Casp8 cKO and caspase-8/IL1R dKO mice, we investigated whether a parameter of γδT-cell activation, namely proliferation, is dependent upon IL-1 signaling. We assayed γδT-cell proliferation and found that the number of proliferating γδT-cells was increased three-fold in the Casp8 cKO skin compared to WT controls, whereas a significant decrease was observed in the absence of IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, in excisional wounds, elevated γδT-cell proliferation is dependent on IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that γδT-cells in the caspase-8/IL1R dKO still displayed increased proliferation compared to wild-type cells, which may reflect the redundancy in this system. We also observed increased γδT-cell activation in the caspase-8/IL1R dKO mice, as observed by TNFα expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The frequency of these activated γδT-cells was markedly reduced in the absence of IL-1 signaling. In the newborn thymus, IL-1 signaling has been shown to have a synergistic effect with IL-7 in enhancing the proliferation of γδT-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lynch and Shevach, 1992</xref>). Epidermal keratinocytes constitutively express IL-7 and this expression is required for γδT-cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jameson and Havran, 2007</xref>). In the Casp8 cKO, IL-7 expression is upregulated and this is not affected by the absence of IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, IL-7 expression is not affected in Casp8 cKO skin or excisional wounds that lack γδT-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). On the basis of this observation, we hypothesized that IL-1α released from the keratinocytes in the Casp8 cKO mouse can act synergistically with IL-7 to enhance γδT-cell proliferation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28875.019</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>IL-1 signaling contributes to γδT-cell proliferation in the caspase-8 cKO skin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of γδT-cell proliferation.

The use of this in vitro approach allowed us to reconstitute the different components required to stimulate γδT-cell proliferation. We collected conditioned media (CM) from WT and Casp8 cKO keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), applied them to WT or IL1R<sup>–/–</sup> γδT-cells and monitored the proliferation rates of these cells. γδT-cells were cultured in activating conditions using anti-CD3 and anti-JAML as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witherden et al., 2010</xref>), and then incubated for 2 days in the presence of CM, recombinant human IL-1α (rhIL-1α), recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7), or an IL-7 inhibitory antibody. The number of γδT-cells increased 2.5-fold when they were treated with Casp8 cKO CM rather than WT CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Conversely, removing IL-1 signaling by treating IL1R<sup>−/− </sup>γδ T-cells with Casp8 cKO CM resulted in significantly reduced proliferation. Similarly, blocking IL-7 signaling in the Casp8 cKO CM with an anti-IL-7 inhibitory antibody blocked γδT-cell proliferation. This effect was enhanced when both IL-1 and IL-7 signaling were perturbed in tandem. As epidermal keratinocytes constitutively secrete IL-7, we predicted that adding recombinant human IL-1α (rhIL1α) to WT CM would be sufficient to cause an increase in γδT-cell proliferation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of rhIL-1α to WT CM elicited an increase in γδT-cell proliferation comparable to the effect seen with Casp8 cKO CM. In fact, simply adding recombinant IL-1 and IL-7 to normal growth media is sufficient to reconstitute the γδT-cell proliferation observed in the Casp8 cKO CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Altogether, these results support the model in which IL-1 and IL-7 signaling, in conjunction with γδT-cell activation, amplifies the proliferation of these cells in response to stresses that alter epidermal homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Contributions of keratinocyte–fibroblast and keratinocyte–γδT-cell interactions to stem cell proliferation</title><p>We have demonstrated that stem cells residing in distinct niches of the skin (i.e. the interfollicular epidemis and the hair follicle bulge region) are modulated by IL-1 signaling in a wound-like environment. The data presented to date and reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that the effect of IL-1 signaling on different stem cell pools is mediated through the dichotomous activation of dermal fibroblasts and γδT-cells. However, in the skin, where multiple cellular interactions are occurring simultaneously in an intricate manner, it is difficult to resolve the direct effects of IL-1 signaling on each subset of stem cells. As IL-1 signaling can stimulate different pools of epithelial stem cells in the skin, we sought to interrogate whether activated fibroblasts and γδT-cells can induce proliferation within distinct epithelial stem cell niches. Owing to a lack of definitive markers to distinguish IFE cells from HFSCs, assaying the proliferation of these cells within the skin is a challenge. On the other hand, in vitro cultures of IFE cells or HFSC are well established, and grafting experiments have shown that these cells maintain their progenitor properties even after several passages in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpain et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghazizadeh and Taichman, 2005</xref>). In order to delineate the contributions of keratinocytes–fibroblast interactions to epithelial stem cell proliferation, we activated dermal fibroblasts (df) with Casp8 cKO CM or rhIL-1α, as evidenced by their expression of FGF7 and GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). CM was collected from these activated df and applied to IFE cells or HFSC to test their effect on the proliferation of these two different epithelial stem cells. Treatment with CM from activated df caused a dramatic increase in the proliferation of IFE cells and a modest increase in HFSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the absence of IL-1 signaling, however, the proliferation of both IFE cells and HFSCs was reduced to that of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Moreover, abrogating IL-1 or IL-7 signaling was able to reduce FGF7 and TNFα expression, whereas rhIL-1α or rhIL-7 was sufficient to induce maximal FGF7 expression. Exposure of HFSCs to CM from activated γδT-cells caused a significant increase in the proliferation of the HfSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Although activated γδT-cells can also stimulate IFE cell proliferation, the numbers of these cells were 40% smaller than those of HFSCs. Similarly, CM from rhIL-1α- or rhIL-7-treated γδT-cells was sufficient to recapitulate the increased proliferation of the HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>As the CM from df and γδT-cells can enhance the proliferation of the different stem cell pools, we sought to investigate whether the effects on epithelial stem cell proliferation would be additive. Indeed, treatment of both IFE cells and HFSCs with a combination of CM from activated df and γδT-cells substantially increased their proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). One probable reason for the differential proliferation of the IFE cells and HFSCs is the difference in components present in the cytokine cocktail secreted from either df or γδT-cells. For instance, even though both activated df and γδT-cells can secrete the mitogenic factor FGF7, only γδT-cells secrete IL1F8 or IL-36β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>), which were recently shown to cause proliferation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). IL1F8 signals through the IL-36 receptor and it is possible that HFSCs are more susceptible to the mitogenic effects of this cytokine. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that IL-1-mediated activation of γδT-cells preferentially promotes HFSC proliferation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>One of the goals of regenerative medicine is to restore the functional state of the tissue swiftly following trauma and/or disease. A major obstacle to manipulating this process in mammalian tissues is the large number of cells that carry out a synchronized effort in the regenerative/repair process. Therefore, understanding the coordinated interactions between the multiple cell types that orchestrate a successful repair program is a high priority. The efficient repair of damaged tissue depends upon the interactions between the inflammatory, proliferative and remodeling phases of the wound-healing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurtner et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we employed a genetic mouse model of wound healing, namely the conditional knockout of epidermal caspase-8. Our previous work has demonstrated that the downregulation of epidermal caspase-8 is a normal phenomenon upon wounding of the mouse skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrated that the conditional ablation of epidermal caspase-8 was able to recapitulate many of the cardinal features of a cutaneous wound-healing response. This genetic mouse model is particularly useful in efforts to unravel the signaling network of the wound-healing program, given that the entire skin essentially behaves as a wound. By contrast, cellular responses to an excisional wound to the skin are limited to the cells immediately proximal to the trauma. As a consequence, there is poor signal to noise ratio given the low number of cells that are responding to the wound surrounded by a large number of cells that are in their normal homeostatic mode. This is particularly relevant to studies of hair follicle stem cell activation during wound healing. Only a handful of hair follicles exhibit activated stem cells upon trauma to the skin, whereas the caspase-8 conditional knockout animals exhibit stem cell activation in the vast majority of the hair follicles within the knockout skin.</p><p>The focus of this study was to understand how one of these signaling nodes that is an important mediator of inflammation (IL-1 signaling) manages to enhance the proliferation of different stem-cell pools within the skin. IL1α is released immediately upon wounding, downstream of reduction of caspase-8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), and mediates the activation of dermal fibroblasts which then stimulate epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-1 signaling can partner with IL-7 (which is constitutively secreted from epidermal keratinocytes) to expand the population of active γδT-cells. These activated γδT-cells can then stimulate the proliferation of stem cells within the bulge of the hair follicle and can mobilize them for epidermal wound repair. As the wound-healing response progresses, given the redundancy of the system, it is likely that other infiltrating cells can contribute to (or take over the duties of) stimulating epithelial stem cell proliferation. One illustrative case of this redundancy is in the activation of HFSCs by multiple routes. We hypothesize that the IL-1 +IL-7/γδTcell/HFSC proliferation module described herein is the rapid mechanism that stimulates HFSC proliferation using cells already residing in the tissue. Interestingly, wounded keratinocytes can also produce CCL2 to attract macrophages to a wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osaka et al., 2007</xref>). These activated macrophages in turn secrete IL-1β (a more potent relative of IL-1α) to induce hair regrowth, and it is tempting to postulate that this mechanism maintains and potentiates the effects of IL-1 +IL-7/γδTcells on HFSC proliferation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28875.029</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of epidermal stem cell proliferation in the caspase-8 conditional knockout model of wound healing.</title><p>Upon wounding, caspase 8 levels are downregulated causing the release of IL-1α, which can stimulate the proliferation of interfollicular epidermal stem cells (IFE) through its interactions with dermal fibroblasts.

IL-1α and IL-7 cooperate to enhance the proliferation of activated γδT-cells, which preferentially influences HFSC proliferation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28875-fig5-v1"/></fig><p>IL-1 signaling has been studied in depth and found to play critical roles in a variety of cellular processes from immune responses to the proliferation of epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinarello, 2009</xref>). Despite the pleiotropic effects of IL-1 signaling in various cell types and its important function during wound healing, blocking IL-1Receptor-1-dependent signaling does not completely impair the repair process. This can be attributed in part to compensatory mechanisms involving other IL-1 family members. IL-1 family members such as IL-1F6, IL-1F8 and IL-1F9 are largely found in epithelial tissues. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing IL-1F6 in the basal layer of the epidermis develop severe cutaneous inflammation, hyperkeratosis and acanthosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blumberg et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, work by Yang et al. showed that activated γδT-cells released IL-1F8, which had the ability to promote the proliferation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blumberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). As IL-1F6 and IL-1F8 signal through the IL-36 receptor and are able to induce the production of mitogenic factors, it is likely that abrogating IL-1R1 signaling alone may not be sufficient to block the epidermal hyperproliferation observed in the Casp8 cKO skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Towne et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, in a system as complex as the wound-healing program, removal of an individual component such as IL-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kovalenko et al., 2009</xref>) will impede the kinetics of the process rather than completely inhibit it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is worth noting that γδT-cells have been found to stimulate hair neogenesis in wounds via Fgf9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gay et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, it is the dermal γδT-cells that secrete Fgf9 whereas the epidermal pool of γδT-cells (DETCs) secrete IL-1F8, which does not possess hair-neogenesis-promoting properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, it appears that there is heterogeneity among cutaneous γδT-cells that can secrete unique repertoires of cytokines with differential effects on the hair follicle.</p><p>Consistent with our observations in the skin, IL-1 and IL-7 can also work together to increase γδT-cell proliferation in the newborn thymus, where these cells compete with γδT-cells for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lynch and Shevach, 1992</xref>). In the case of injury, this synergistic interaction is most probably a response to seal the wound quickly. Our findings suggest that in the presence of a wound-like state, the potentiation of γδT-cellproliferation may be a means to increase the pools of cutaneous epithelial stem cells. Our results are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keyes et al., 2016</xref>, which showed that optimal activation of γδT-cells is required for proliferation in hair follicle progenitors and efficient sealing of wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keyes et al., 2016</xref>). Our results provide a mechanistic basis for their observation and it is interesting to note that the age-related decline that they found in wounding correlates with the documented changes in the IL-1 family of cytokines that occur with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ye et al., 2002</xref>). Owing to the fact that HFSCs are highly activated in the Casp8 cKO skin, it is tempting to speculate that the hair regeneration cycle would be faster in this genetic background relative to the wild-type controls. Unfortunately, the truncated lifespan of the Casp8 cKO mouse (up to ~20 days) and the chronic inflammatory phenotype prevent an investigation of this possibility.</p><p>Given the inherent differences between IFE cells and HFSCs, it is perhaps not too surprising to find that they respond differently to signals from activated dermal fibroblasts and γδT-cells, respectively. Furthermore, the location of the proliferating inducing cell may impact which stem-cell pool it affects. For instance, in the backskin of WT mice, γδT-cells are found in close association with the HFSC niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, dermal fibroblasts are in close apposition to the IFE cells in the basal layer of the epidermis, which would be subjected to the highest concentration of pro-proliferation factors secreted by the activated fibroblasts.</p><p>There is an emerging paradigm that signals classically associated with immune cells are involved in regulating stem-cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The results of our experiments shed new insight into the complex nature of the repair process, which is a recurring theme in some pathological conditions such as cancer. We showed that the increased proliferation observed in the Casp8 cKO can be attained through reciprocal keratinocyte–fibroblast or keratinocyte–γδT-cell interactions. The keratinocyte–fibroblast-mediated proliferation is akin to the interaction between the tumor cell and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McAllister and Weinberg, 2010</xref>). With regards to the keratinocytes–γδT-cell interaction, it has recently been shown that the activation of γδT-cells promotes tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arwert et al., 2010</xref>). Thus an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferation of stem cells in a wound microenvironment holds the promise of shedding light on the complex signaling pathways that mediate tumor initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Casp8 fl/fl mice (Casp8 cKO)</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No. 027002</td><td>Animals were originally purchased from Jackson <break/>Laboratory but were bred for &gt;5 generations at UCSD and <break/>later bred in the NCBS animal facility <break/>for &gt;5 generations</td></tr><tr><td>IL1R KO mice</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No. 028398</td><td>Animals were originally purchased from Jackson <break/>Laboratory (Stock No. 000664) but were bred for &gt; 5 <break/>generations in the NCBS animal facility</td></tr><tr><td>Tcrd<sup>–/–</sup> mice (γδTCR KO)</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No. 003448</td><td>Animals were originally purchased from Jackson <break/>Laboratory (Stock No. 000664) but were bred for &gt; 5 <break/>generations in the NCBS animal facility</td></tr><tr><td>Krt14-Cre</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No. 018964</td><td>Animals were originally purchased from Jackson <break/>Laboratory (Stock No. 000664) but were bred for &gt; 5 <break/>generations in the NCBS animal facility</td></tr><tr><td>C57Bl6/JNcbs</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No. 000664</td><td>Animals were originally purchased from Jackson <break/>Laboratory (Stock No. 000664) but were bred for &gt; 10 <break/>generations in the NCBS animal facility</td></tr><tr><td>anti-CD34</td><td>Ebioscience</td><td valign="bottom">11-0341-82</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-Ki67</td><td>abcam</td><td valign="bottom">ab16667</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)</td><td>Abcam</td><td valign="bottom">ab5694</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-gamma delta TCR</td><td>BD Bioscience</td><td>GL3</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-CD3</td><td>e-biosciences</td><td valign="bottom">14-0032-85</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-JAML</td><td>eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">clone eBio4E10</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-IL-7 inhibitory antibody (Clone M25)</td><td>BioXCell</td><td>BE0048</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-IL-1 alpha</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td valign="bottom">14-7011-81</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-Keratin 5</td><td>Jamora Lab generated</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-Loricrin</td><td>Jamora Lab generated</td><td/><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-Sox9</td><td>Abcam</td><td valign="bottom">ab185230</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-Mac1</td><td>Thermo-fisher scientific</td><td>MA1-10080</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-Gr1</td><td>R&amp;D Systems</td><td>MAB1037-500</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>anti-TNFalpha</td><td>eBiosciences</td><td valign="bottom">14–7321</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Alexa 488- or 555- secondaries</td><td>Molecular Probes</td><td/><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>DAPI</td><td>Molecular Probes</td><td/><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>rhIL-1 alpha</td><td>R&amp;D Systems</td><td>200-LA-010</td><td/></tr><tr><td>ELISA kit for IL-1 alpha</td><td>eBiosciences</td><td>88501986</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Click-iT EdU Imaging Kit</td><td>Thermo-fischer scientific</td><td valign="bottom">C10340</td><td/></tr><tr><td>GraphPad</td><td>Prism</td><td/><td>For statistical analysis</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of caspase-8 conditional knockout mice (Casp8 cKO)</title><p>Epidermis-specific knockouts were obtained by crossing mice carrying the floxed caspase-8 allele (Casp8 fl/fl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beisner et al., 2005</xref>) to Krt14-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>).

Skins were collected 4 hr afterwards, embedded and frozen in OCT. 10 µm thick sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, blocked in donkey serum for 1 hr and stained overnight with primary antibodies, followed by 30 min incubation with secondary antibodies. Proliferating HFSCs are recognized by co-staining CD34 and Ki67. However, CD34 is not expressed in skin at P6. Therefore, the location of HFSCs in the bulge region in P6 skin is marked by smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive arrector pilli muscle, which joins the hair follicle at the bulge region where HFSCs reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poblet et al., 2002</xref>). γδT-cells were detected with anti-γδTCR (GL3, BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>γδT-cell proliferation assays</title><p>Short-term cultures of WT and IL1R<sup>–/–</sup> γδT-cells were established and 30,000 cells were plated in 96-well plates coated with 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 10 μg/ml anti-JAML (eBioscience, clone eBio4E10) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witherden et al., 2010</xref>).

The present work is of interest because it provides more experimental information about those interactions. While γδT cells have been shown previously to be involved in wound-induced hair neogenesis, the present paper shows activation of γδT cells in a different wound setting. Their results lead the authors to propose a new model whereby inflammation can differentially affect different lineages of epidermal stem cells during wound-induced regeneration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been noticed that IL-1 plays an important role in stimulating regeneration following wounding. The authors try to demonstrate that this is via activation of γδT cells. To eliminate the possibility IL-1 exerts its effect without γδT cells the authors should inject IL-1α and IL-7 into γδT cells KO mice to see if these two cytokines can rescue the delayed wound healing process in the absence of γδT cells.</p><p>2) The hair follicle status in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is quite different. The authors use telogen hair follicles as a model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> but anagen hair follicles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It is known that the hair cycle involves changes in epidermal cell proliferation. Please clarify the age or status of hair regeneration cycle of the transgenic mice used in all experiments. If the cycling status of hair follicle is not the same in different experiments, the results are uninterpretable.</p><p>3) Both the caspase mutation and tissue culture studies are fairly contrived environments and so the authors should make the effort to examine wounds in wildtype mice and directly test whether they have uncovered real in vivo mechanisms.</p><p>4) The acute in vivo wound healing response is more about cell migration than cell proliferation and at points in the paper cell migration should be investigated; however, the authors focus entirely on proliferation. This is something that could be addressed in culture.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) Previous work has shown that wounded skin can produce CCL2 through ASK-1 to attract macrophages, activated by IL-1β, to induce hair regrowth (Osaka et al., 2007). Here, the authors showed that γδT cells play major roles in wound induced hair stem cell activation upon the stimulation of IL-1α.

The suggested experiment to inject IL-1α and IL-7 into the γδT cellKO mouse is ideal, however we found that the administration of a bolus of IL-1α into the skin caused a massive inflammatory response that led to considerable tissue damage in a relatively short time period. We likewise found a similar effect upon multiple administrations of lower doses of IL-1α that preclude any investigation on rescuing the delayed wound healing process in the absence of γδT-cells. In retrospect, this was not surprising given an earlier report that transgenic overexpression of IL-1α in epidermal keratinocytes caused a spontaneous and robust inflammatory response that led to “hair loss, scaling, and focal inflammatory skin lesions” (Groves et al., 1995). Likewise, previous reports of the intradermal injection of IL-1α showed a very rapid and substantial proinflammatory phenotype (Ramparts and William, 1988; Camp et al., 1988). Importantly, it has also been reported that IL-1 levels naturally fluctuate during the wound-healing program (Kondo and Ohshima, 1996). For instance, the IL-1 α levels reached a peak at 6 hours post wounding, then decreases until there is another spike in IL-1 levels at 72 hours. Consequently, injection studies of IL-1α would not recapitulate the dynamic physiological variations in cytokine levels that are characteristic of a normal wound healing response in vivo and would probably be a model more relevant to a pathological condition.</p><p>In order to address the reviewers’ concern, we have included a number of new experiments in the revised manuscript to further support the model that IL-1α’s effect on hair follicle stem cell proliferation is primarily through γδT-cells. In the original version of the manuscript, we demonstrated that the absence of γδT-cells abrogated the effect of wound-stimulated hair follicle stem cell proliferation. We now provide evidence that the IL-1α and IL-7 levels remain the same as in the wild type wounded skin despite lacking functional γδT-cells. This substantiates our conclusion that despite the physiological levels of these cytokines being present, the impairment of HFSCs proliferation is still manifested in the absence of γδT-cells.</p><p>These are shown in the following:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>: Immunofluorescence of unpermeabilized skin sections to detect extracellular IL-1α in wild type, caspase-8 cKO, and caspase8cKO/γδT-cell KO;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>: ELISA measurement of conditioned media from unwounded, wounded, and γδT-cell KO wounded skins;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>: Immunofluorescence of unpermeabilized skin sections to detect extracellular IL-1α in unwounded, wounded, and γδT-cell KO wounded skins;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>: Assay of the levels of IL-7 via qPCR in wild type wounded, and γδT-cell KO wounded skins;</p><p>Altogether these point to the fact that despite the normal levels of IL-1α and IL-7 in the wound, active γδT-cells are necessary to elicit the early stimulation of hair follicle stem cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The hair follicle status in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is quite different. The authors use telogen hair follicles as a model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> but anagen hair follicles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It is known that the hair cycle involves changes in epidermal cell proliferation. Please clarify the age or status of hair regeneration cycle of the transgenic mice used in all experiments. If the cycling status of hair follicle is not the same in different experiments, the results are uninterpretable.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by not clearly delineating the age of the mice and the status of the hair cycle in the different models of wound healing. As suggested, we have detailed this information for the mice used in all experiments. Briefly, due to the strong phenotype of the genetic model of wound healing (epidermal caspase-8 conditional knockout) the animal rarely survives pass postnatal day 20. As we previously reported (Lee et al., 2009), the wound healing like phenotypes start manifesting at postnatal day 6 when the hair follicle is in anagen. For this reason, the hair follicles are in the anagen phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the excisional wounds are done on adult (8 week old) mice as standard protocol. As the reviewer keenly observed, these hair follicles are in telogen. Of particular note is the fact that the effect of the IL-1α/γδTcell signaling module on hair follicle stem cell proliferation is independent of the hair phase. Nevertheless, to address the reviewer’s concern, we have performed excisional wounds on adult animals in which the hair follicle was in anagen phase and the results are exactly the same as we reported in the original submission. Due to space issues (and the fact that all the experiments that were performed on adult mice with anagen follicles are confirmatory of data presented in the manuscript) we have noted these results as “data not shown” in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both the caspase mutation and tissue culture studies are fairly contrived environments and so the authors should make the effort to examine wounds in wildtype mice and directly test whether they have uncovered real in vivo mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a cogent point and we have repeated all of the caspase-8 conditional knockout experiments with excisional wounds. We were pleased to observe that all of the signaling pathways that we have elucidated using this genetic model of wound healing is indeed a recapitulation of the signaling pathways that are operational following an excisional wound on the mouse skin. The following experiments have been replicated in the excisional wound model (that were shown in the caspase-8 cKO genetic wound healing model in the original submission).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The acute in vivo wound healing response is more about cell migration than cell proliferation and at points in the paper cell migration should be investigated; however, the authors focus entirely on proliferation. This is something that could be addressed in culture.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct in highlighting the importance of cell migration in the wound healing response and we thank him/her for bringing this point to the fore. Given that in vivo hair follicle stem cell migration experiments in a live animal is beyond our technical capabilities, we have recapitulated this process in vitro. The reconstitution of migration in vitro also facilitates the unambiguous separation of the effect of proliferation from migration on the number of hair follicle stem cells that are outside the bulge region of the follicle. The sum of these experiments is a clear demonstration that cell migration is <underline>independent</underline> of IL-1 signaling and its downstream targets. Briefly, as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, we are able to induce hair follicle stem cell chemotaxis in the classic transwell assay using conditioned media from the epidermis of the genetic model of wound healing (caspase-8 conditional KO). Likewise, conditioned media from the caspase-8cKO/ γδT-cells KO was also able to induce stem cell migration, thereby showing the dispensability of γδT-cells in migration. However, using recombinant IL-1α as a chemoattractant in a transwell assay was not sufficient to induce directed migration of hair follicle stem cells. Importantly, the conditioned media from the caspase-8 cKO epidermis was still able to induce migration of hair follicle stem cells lacking the IL-1 receptor. Altogether this provides evidence that IL-1α is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce hair follicle stem cell migration. We are actively searching for the component(s) in the caspase-8 conditioned media that is responsible for the migration, but this falls beyond the purview of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1) Previous work has shown that wounded skin can produce CCL2 through ASK-1 to attract macrophages, activated by IL-1β, to induce hair regrowth (Osaka et al., 2007).

Also, can authors clarify which cells are at higher hierarchical role in this process?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer highlights an interesting point, which we now address in the Discussion section of the manuscript. In brief, there is cumulative contribution from both γδTcells and macrophages, as pointed out in Osaka et al. 2007. The model that emerges is that IL-1α is immediately released from their reservoirs upon keratinocyte injury and activates γδTcells (along with IL-7). This early response may be subsequently maintained (and amplified) by macrophages that are later recruited through the production of CCL-2 from stressed keratinocytes. These macrophages can then secrete IL-1β, which is a more potent cytokine than IL-1α, and thereby accentuate and maintain the elevated proliferative capacity of the hair follicle stem cells. As such, the hierarchical model that emerges is a temporal one: IL-1α is an early and <underline>local</underline> player in wound healing that leads to the activation of γδT-cells to stimulate HFSC proliferation, which is subsequently promoted by the infiltration of IL-1β secreting macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A previous study demonstrated that γδT cells can secrete FGF-9 to stimulate hair regeneration or activate hair follicle stem cells in wounds (Gay et al., 2013). In this study, the authors propose that IL1F8 or IL-36β released from γδT cells are the major signals involved in stem cell activation. Can the authors reconcile the different observations?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important issue, which we now address in the Discussion section of the manuscript. Based on our data, the model that arises is that the γδTcells associated with the epidermis and hair follicle (the so-called dendritic epidermal T-cells [DETCs]) secrete IL1F8 or IL-36β based on the literature (Blumberg et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2010). The Gay et al., manuscript demonstrates that it is the <italic>dermal</italic> γδT-cells that are the prime source of <italic>FGF9</italic> in wounded skin. Moreover, they also report that DETCs do not make <italic>FGF9</italic>. Thus the differential source of cytokines may explain the different types of cytokines that are released.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to appropriate statistical evaluation of their results throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>All the results are now presented with appropriate statistical evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) This was not a particularly easy paper to read because of the long chunks of text without breaks.
