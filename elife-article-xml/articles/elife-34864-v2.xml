pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34864.001</object-id><p>The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) potently represses macrophage-elicited inflammation, however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Our genome-wide analysis in mouse macrophages reveals that pro-inflammatory paused genes, activated via global negative elongation factor (NELF) dissociation and RNA Polymerase (Pol)2 release from early elongation arrest, and non-paused genes, induced by de novo Pol2 recruitment, are equally susceptible to acute glucocorticoid repression. Moreover, in both cases the dominant mechanism involves rapid GR tethering to p65 at NF-kB-binding sites. Yet, specifically at paused genes, GR activation triggers widespread promoter accumulation of NELF, with myeloid cell-specific NELF deletion conferring glucocorticoid resistance. Conversely, at non-paused genes, GR attenuates the recruitment of p300 and histone acetylation, leading to a failure to assemble BRD4 and Mediator at promoters and enhancers, ultimately blocking Pol2 initiation. Thus, GR displays no preference for a specific pro-inflammatory gene class; however, it effects repression by targeting distinct temporal events and components of transcriptional machinery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34864.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation is one of the bodyâs responses to fight infection and heal tissue damage. The response is controlled by hundreds of genes, which fall into two classes. In the first class, an injury or infection triggers the enzyme RNA Polymerase to bind to and transcribe the gene into long RNA strands, which are then translated into the proteins that play a role in the inflammation response. The second class has a more quick-fire response. RNA Polymerase binds to these genes even without an injury or infection to serve as a trigger. But most of the time the enzyme only transcribes the beginning of these genes. This is because it is inhibited by a so-called negative elongation factor, which acts like a brake. For this second class of genes, an infection or injury triggers the release of the negative elongation factor from the enzyme, and allows RNA Polymerase to transcribe the full RNA strand.</p><p>In excess, inflammation can be dangerous. The bodyâs way of limiting or controlling inflammation is via steroid hormones called glucocorticoids. These bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, which acts to switch off the inflammatory genes. But exactly how the receptor does this has not been fully understood.</p><p>Sacta et al. investigated how the glucocorticoid receptor turns off these gene complexes. Experiments looking at white blood cells in mice found that the receptor can switch off both groups of inflammatory genes, but by a different mechanism for each class. Sacta et al. discovered that in the first gene class, the receptor blocks proteins that open up the DNA for RNA Polymerase, so it could not bind to the gene. In the second class, the receptor stops the release of the brake-like negative elongation factor from RNA Polymerase. As a result, the enzyme stalls at the beginning of the gene and fails to make a full-length transcript required to make the necessary protein.</p><p>Glucocorticoids are often used as drugs to treat chronic inflammation, but they can have debilitating side effects. Understanding how the glucocorticoid receptor switches off inflammatory genes could help to design drugs with fewer side effects to treat chronic inflammation, and diseases caused by specific inflammatory genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>transcriptional

immune response to tissue injury or infection. It relies on macrophages, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and other âdangerâ signals via their toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glass and Saijo, 2010</xref>). This initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation and DNA binding of the effector transcription factors NF-kB and AP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>) which recruit coregulators, and, ultimately, the basal transcription machinery that together alter the chromatin state in the vicinity of many pro-inflammatory genes and enable their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smale and Natoli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glass and Natoli, 2015</xref>). Acute transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes is, therefore, critical for overriding the homeostatic set-point and producing a robust immune response that helps to resolve infection or tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although the magnitude and dynamics of inflammation is affected at multiple levels, the temporal coordination of cytokine gene transcription by RNA Polymerase (Pol) 2 is a key mechanism that defines acute inflammatory response. The Pol 2 transcription cycle has been divided into three phases: initiation, elongation and termination. Initiation involves the recruitment of Pol 2 to the promoter, histone modifications and changes in histone occupancy. In addition, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol 2, which contains multiple heptad repeats (YS2PTS5PS), is phosphorylated at S5, and Pol 2 synthesizes short (20â60 nt) RNA transcripts. During the elongation step, Pol 2 is further phosphorylated at S2 by the cyclin T1/CDK9 positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) and synthesizes the full length RNA transcript, which is followed by the termination step and RNA transcript dissociation from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nechaev and Adelman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although Pol 2 recruitment and initiation has been historically considered the rate-limiting step in signal-dependent transcription, numerous recent studies revealed that transcriptionally engaged Pol 2 often remains paused near promoters in the absence of activating signal and that entry into productive elongation is rate-limiting for activation of up to 40% of inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2012</xref>). The paused Pol 2 is in a complex with the 4-subunit negative elongation factor (NELF); NELF phosphorylation by P-TEFb leads to its release and Pol 2 entry into productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nechaev and Adelman, 2011</xref>). A subset of cytokine genes in macrophages is controlled at the level of Pol 2 pausing. Indeed, while for genes such as Il1a and Il1b, signal-dependent Pol 2 recruitment to their transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription initiation are rate-limiting, other genes, exemplified by Tnf, are occupied by Pol 2 even under resting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupte et al., 2013</xref>). At Tnf, Pol 2 is S5-phosphorylated, bound by NELF and pausedÂ ~50 bp downstream of the TSS. Pause release following S2 and NELF phosphorylation by P-TEFb occurs in response to inflammatory signal.</p><p>Aside from Pol 2 occupancy, the chromatin state plays an integral part in the regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smale et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, histone code âwritersâ such as acetyltransferases (HATs) GCN5 and p300 have been implicated in modifying H3K9/14 and H4K5/8/12 at inflammatory genes in macrophages following treatment with TLR4 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escoubet-Lozach et al., 2011</xref>). Both HATs are recruited by the NF-kB subunit p65 to regulatory regions in a stimulus-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghisletti et al., 2010</xref>). Histone modifications are then bound by âreadersâ such as BRD4, a protein containing two conserved N-terminal bromodomains (BD1 and BD2), which associates with most active promoters and some active enhancers, and has been proposed to couple the acetylation state at enhancers and promoters with Pol 2 elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LovÃ©n et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>). BRD4 occupancy correlates with acetylation marks at H4K5/8/12, H3K9/27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LovÃ©n et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagarajan et al., 2014</xref>) and with gene activation, whereas chemical inhibition of BRD4 binding abrogates the induction of a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, BRD4 has been shown to associate with P-TEFb, affecting Pol 2 CTD phosphorylation, and hence, transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itzen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>These events coalesce ensuring a rapid remodeling of the inflammatory transcriptome, with hundreds of genes undergoing a dramatic upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escoubet-Lozach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chinenov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uhlenhaut et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tong et al., 2016</xref>). Although essential for host defense, unabated inflammation imposes a threat to the host and can result in tissue damage and autoimmunity. One systemic mechanism that controls acute inflammatory response is a feedback loop whereby inflammatory cytokines trigger the production of steroid hormones known as glucocorticoids (GCs) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sacta et al., 2016</xref>]). Lipophilic GCs diffuse through the cell membrane and bind the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor (TF), which then translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. The transcriptional outcomes of GR activation are context-specific and are determined by the genomic GC response elements (GRE) to which the receptor binds. GR can bind directly to specific, usually pseudopalindromic, DNA sequences either as a homodimer or complexed with other TFs such as AP1 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biddie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langlais et al., 2012</xref>). In this context, GR recruits various coregulators such as members of the p160 family, HATs, the Mediator complex and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weikum et al., 2017b</xref>), ultimately leading to the activation of numerous genes including the anti-inflammatory genes, such as <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Tsc22d3</italic> (GILZ). At other sites, known as âtetheringâ GREs, GR does not directly bind DNA but interacts with other DNA-bound TFs such as pro-inflammatory AP1 and NF-kB and usually represses their activity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chinenov et al., 2013</xref>]) â a property fundamental to the ability of GCs to dramatically attenuate inflammation. In contrast to GR-mediated activation, the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by GR remain poorly understood. Strikingly, however, in a few cases analyzed, genes activated through Pol 2 recruitment and those induced by signal-dependent Pol 2 pause release were both susceptible to GR-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupte et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use a combination of cell-based and genome-wide approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which GR represses pro-inflammatory genes in primary macrophages challenged acutely with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and GCs. We present evidence of âtetheringâ as a prevalent mechanism of repression among p65/GR co-regulated genes. We further demonstrate a widespread yet gene class-specific role of NELF in glucocorticoid-mediated repression of early elongation. Conversely, at other genes, GR precludes the ordered assembly of HATs, Brd4 and the Mediator complex which ultimately blocks Pol 2 recruitment and transcription initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genomic binding of GR and p65 upon inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimulation</title><p>To understand the mechanisms by which GR elicits its repressive effects, we first assessed by RNA-seq the global transcriptional changes upon acute activation of primary mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with LPS or LPS together with a synthetic GC dexamethasone (Dex) for 1 hr.

Therefore, we determined the distribution of p65 and GR genomic binding sites in BMDM pulsed with LPS, Dex or LPSÂ +Â Dex for 45 min (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for quality metrics and comparison of replicates).

Importantly, the GR and p65 cistromes shared 4589 peaks, which corresponds to nearly half of all GR- and 2/3 of all p65-binding peaks.

In Dex-treated BMDM, GR-binding sites formed 3377 peaks.

We did not detect NF-kB/Rela motif enrichment in these two subsets of GR-binding peaks.

Several representative examples of GR and p65 co-binding near GR-sensitive genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: at each gene, GR binding occurred at sites matching those of p65, but only in LPS + Dex and not LPS- or Dex-alone treated BMDM. Importantly, LPS-dependent p65 binding fully persisted in the presence of Dex.

In each case, ~2/3 of the LPS-induced p65 peaks persisted in LPS + Dex-treated BMDM. Moreover, among p65 LPS + Dex peaks functionally constrained to Dex-repressed genes, 80% (up from 68% genome-wide) overlapped LPS-induced peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).

Among the LPS-induced Dex-sensitive genes with PIÂ &gt;1 (approximately 24% of 300 Dex-repressed transcripts), 86.3% displayed promoter-associated NELF-E peaks, compared to only 31.7% in genes with PIÂ &lt;0.8 (which comprised approximately 66% of 300 transcripts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). Importantly, similar relative numbers of paused and non-paused genes (23% and 70%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) were found among LPS-induced Dex-insensitive genes from RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this group, NELF-E occupancy in untreated BMDM was again much more prevalent in paused genes (81.1%) than in non-paused ones (44.2%). Thus, GR does not preferentially repress genes in one class vs. the other, and high levels of TSS-associated NELF in a basal state is a common feature of paused genes irrespective of their sensitivity to GC.</p><p>Given that NELF and Pol 2 co-localize at the TSS of the paused genes in unstimulated BMDM, that activation of such genes by LPS coincides with NELF dismissal, and that Pol 2 remains near the promoters of these genes under repressing conditions consistent with their early elongation arrest, we questioned whether GR-mediated repression was globally mediated by NELF. We first evaluated NELF-E occupancy in BMDM co-treated with LPSÂ +Â Dex by ChIP-seq and found the relative distribution of peaks among paused (PIÂ &gt;1) and non-paused (PIÂ &lt;0.8) repressed genes to be indistinguishable from NELF-E distribution in resting BMDM (83.6% and 33.2%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right â compare to left). We then evaluated NELF-E distribution across several of our target genes in the presence of LPSÂ +Â Dex and detected striking promoter-proximal NELF peaks in paused <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Errfi1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, but not in non-paused <italic>Il1b</italic> or <italic>Lif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To address directly whether NELF is necessary for GR-mediated repression, we used a new mouse strain conditionally lacking the NELF-B subunit and, hence, the functional NELF complex in myeloid cells (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). BMDM from NELF-B LysM-Cre mice (NELF-B KO) show a dramatic reduction in NELF-B mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, top). Importantly, as the NELF complex requires all four subunits for stability and the loss of a single subunit leads to the proteolytic degradation of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilchrist et al., 2008</xref>), immunoblot also reveals a near complete loss of the NELF-E protein in the BMDM of the NELF-B KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, top). Using WT and NELF-B KO BMDM, we then compared GR-mediated repression of our candidate GC-sensitive genes. Consistent with the lack of overt phenotype in these mice, RNA-seq of resting BMDM of the two genotypes revealed no significant differences in the expression levels of LPS-induced Dex-repressed genes at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, at the time-frame examined, LPS challenge led to a similar induction of <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Errfi1</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Lif</italic> transcripts irrespective of the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom left).

Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that NELF-mediated block in productive elongation is an integral part of GR-mediated repression of paused genes.</p><p>To extend these observations to a whole-genome level, we analyzed transcriptomes from the WT and NELF-B KO BMDM treated with LPS + Dex for 1 hr by RNA-seq which identified 393 differentially expressed genes (fold change = 1.5, FDR p&lt;0.05). Out of 201 genes that were repressed by Dex in the WT BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), 23 were expressed at higher level in the LPS + Dex-treated NELF-B KO BMDM; notably, 21 of them had PI &gt;0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Conversely, out of 396 LPS-induced Dex-insensitive genes, only nine were upregulated in the LPS + Dex-treated NELF-B KO BMDM, 7 of which had PI &gt;0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, left).

In particular, BRD4, the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) histone binding protein, affects inflammatory cytokine transcription both in vitro and in vivo through direct binding to acetylated H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). The changes in H4PanAc including H4K5/K12Ac in several GC-sensitive genes, suggested a possible role for BRD4 in transcriptional repression by GR. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed activation of pro-inflammatory genes by LPS in the presence of increasing concentrations of I-BET, an inhibitor of BRD4 binding. The induction of <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il1a</italic> transcripts was significantly attenuated by I-BET in a dose-dependent manner, whereas <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> induction persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In agreement with gene expression results, ChIP-qPCR experiments revealed that BRD4 was recruited to promoters of non-paused genes <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il1a</italic> upon LPS treatment and, interestingly, this recruitment was attenuated by Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, at the paused genes, <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, BRD4 was readily detectable at the TSS in unstimulated BMDM and this association did not significantly change after either LPS or LPSÂ +Â Dex treatment. Thus, BRD4 occupancy patterns at the promoters of these genes resembled signal-responsive H4Ac profiles suggesting that loss of BRD4 in response to Dex may underlie GR-mediated repression of, specifically, the non-paused genes.</p><p>We then assessed genome-wide distribution of BRD4 by ChIP-seq. Not surprisingly, we observed frequent BRD4 binding across the genome in untreated BMDM (~3700 peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel). There was a 1.8-fold increase in the number of BRD4 peaks in response to LPS relative to that in untreated BMDM (4345 new peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel). The increase in the total peak number was even more apparent when limited to LPS-induced genes: 2.9-fold for Dex-insensitive or -repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, middle and right panel, respectively). Furthermore, BRD4 loading density specifically at our Dex-sensitive genes increased dramatically in response to LPS which, interestingly, was nearly abrogated by Dex - a trend very apparent at promoters, but also significant at BRD4:p65 shared binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). BRD4 read distribution at individual non-paused genes of interest reflected this dynamics. For example, the <italic>Il1b</italic> TSS and â2.3 Kb and â10 Kb p65 enhancers acquired strong BRD4 binding in response to LPS which was significantly attenuated by Dex, concomitantly with GR loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left top, purple arrows). <italic>Il1a</italic> also displayed increased LPS-induced BRD4 loading at kB-associated upstream enhancers (â10 Kb and â20 Kb) with a dramatic reduction in occupancy upon Dex co-treatment corresponding to GR binding at both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left bottom, purple arrows). Consistent with our ChIP-PCR data, paused genes, <italic>Ccl2</italic> (â12.5 kB enhancer) and especially <italic>Tnf</italic> (TSS) exhibited modest yet detectable BRD4 occupancy in untreated BMDM that was potentiated by LPS but only minimally affected by Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right). Moreover, our analysis of BRD4 occupancy at Dex-sensitive genes of the two classes revealed that in paused genes, 45% of the BRD4-binding sites seen in LPS-treated BMDM were already pre-bound in untreated cells and 55% were LPS-induced; in non-paused genes, however, only 38% of the sites were pre-occupied in untreated BMDM, whereas 62% were LPS-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, our functional studies together with occupancy data suggest that the activation of non-paused genes is more dependent on BRD4 recruitment, and therefore, its dismissal may have a greater impact on genes of this class.</p><p>Initial BRD4 characterization revealed its interaction with the Mediator complex subunits MED1 and MED12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LovÃ©n et al., 2013</xref>). Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved multi-protein co-activator complex that facilitates transcriptional activation of many genes in part by linking physically and functionally effector TFs and Pol 2. In the context of LPS-induced activation of pro-inflammatory genes, MED1 is reportedly recruited to both the TSS and p65 enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>), occupying similar sites across the genome as BRD4, and the two appear to stabilize each otherâs occupancy at enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LovÃ©n et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore assessed MED1 and MED12 occupancy at the promoters and p65 enhancers of GR-sensitive genes and found that both were recruited to TSS and p65 sites in response to LPS treatment and their recruitment was attenuated by Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, by inhibiting BRD4 binding to the TSS and certain enhancer regions at non-paused genes, GR destabilizes MED1 and MED12 occupancy ultimately affecting Pol 2 recruitment. Of note, MED1 and MED12 loss in response to Dex occurred at paused genes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that GR may antagonize the Mediator complex binding irrespective of its effects on BRD4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>GR attenuates histone acetylation, cofactor assembly and Pol 2 recruitment to non-paused genes by blocking the recruitment of p300</title><p>GR activation disrupted histone acetylation and subsequent BRD4 and Mediator complex assembly at our analyzed non-paused genes, suggesting a central role for LPS-induced histone acetylation as a potential target for GR. Various HATs, including GCN5 and p300, have been implicated in altering modifications at the histone H3 and H4 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smale et al., 2014</xref>) Furthermore, p300 has been shown to also interact with and acetylate p65, which contributes to the activation of NF-kB-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagarajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roe et al., 2015</xref>).

Given fundamental differences in the rate-limiting events for inflammatory gene activation, we sought to dissect the mechanisms by which GR elicits repression in such distinct gene classes and use genome-wide approaches to assess the generality of our findings.</p><p>Numerous studies in cell culture and cell-free systems implicated physical interactions between GR, NF-kB and AP1 family members in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene transcription (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sacta et al., 2016</xref>]) and indeed, we observe extensive co-localization of GR and the NF-kB subunit, p65, genome-wide and especially nearby Dex-repressed genes following short-term LPS + Dex co-treatment â conditions under which we observe rapid glucocorticoid repression. GCs did not cause global displacement of p65; in fact, the number on p65-binding sites in the presence of LPS vs. LPS + Dex is comparable. Moreover, 80% of p65 peaks associated with our Dex-repressed genes overlap in LPS- and LPS + Dex-treated BMDM. Interaction with p65 is further corroborated by the persistence of p65 peaks near our candidate Dex-repressed genes of both classes. With respect to GR binding, both globally and restricted to Dex-repressed genes, several observations point to a tethering mechanism. First, the predominant motifs enriched in GR peaks present uniquely under LPS + Dex conditions are those of NF-kB and AP1 and not the NR3C motif overrepresented in Dex-treated BMDM or peaks shared between the two cistromes. Second, when compared between an entire genome and restricted to Dex-repressed genes, the fraction of LPS + Dex unique GR-binding sites is increasing substantially from 68% to 81%. Third, the majority of the 201 Dex-sensitive genes are only repressed in LPS-activated macrophages, pointing to a requirement for NF-kB activation for GR recruitment. Indeed, the analysis of GR occupancy nearby our candidate Dex-sensitive genes of both classes reveals co-localized GR and p65 peaks associated with NF-kB enhancers under repressing LPS + Dex conditions and no GR binding in Dex-only - treated macrophages. Thus, although this is certainly not the only mechanism by which GR affects inflammatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uhlenhaut et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weikum et al., 2017a</xref>), tethering to p65 is a widespread regulatory mechanism that GR relies upon to elicit acute repression of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages.</p><p>How GR enacts repression appears to depend on the state of the target promoters prior to activation. At paused genes, Pol 2 is pre-loaded, bound by NELF and âstalledâ nearby the TSS, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2012</xref>). These genes have elevated levels of histone acetylation at the TSS, suggestive of an open chromatin state, which would favor constitutive Pol 2 loading and transcription initiation. Conversely, non-paused genes show little Pol 2 occupancy in unstimulated BMDM. Among our Dex-repressed genes, both classes were well represented: in a set of transcripts filtered for Pol 2 occupancy and used to calculate PI, 61 were paused and 82 were not; in a total pool of transcripts corresponding to LPS-induced Dex-repressed 198 genes, approximately 24% were paused (PIÂ &gt;Â 1) and 66% non-paused (PIÂ &lt;Â 0.8). This distribution matched closely that of genes that were LPS-induced but insensitive to Dex (23% and 70%, respectively), suggesting that GR does not display a preference for a specific gene type for repression.</p><p>Given a critical role of NELF in establishing Pol 2 pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilchrist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2012</xref>), we evaluated the genomic distribution of NELF at our LPS-induced Dex-repressed genes in basal, activated and repressed state. This analysis revealed a striking correlation between Pol 2 promoter-proximal pausing and NELF occupancy. Indeed 81% of the paused genes had TSS-associated NELF peaks compared to only 44% on non-paused genes. As expected, NELF dissociated from Pol 2 after LPS treatment, presumably due to P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation, enabling productive elongation. Although the rate of NELF dismissal varies depending on culture conditions and in our experience takes 30â60 min, this loss is consistently transient as NELF âre-loadsâ onto the TSS of these genes despite continuous presence of LPS. We previously reported a highly dynamic occupancy of NELF at the <italic>Tnf</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2009</xref>), but a global synchronous reloading of NELF onto promoters of activated pro-inflammatory genes was unexpected. We envision that NELF re-loading may provide a tonic control of the inflammatory response by limiting further entry of Pol 2 into productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida et al., 2006</xref>), yet maintain genes poised for induction by preserving a nucleosome-depleted environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilchrist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2012</xref>). A distinct mechanism of âtonic controlâ of inflammatory gene expression was recently described for a transcriptional repressor Hes1 which limits the recruitment of P-TEFb and hence, NELF release and Pol 2 elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shang et al., 2016</xref>). In that regard, it would be informative to examine the dynamics of P-TEFb and phosphorylation of the Pol 2 CTD at the promoters of these genes over the time frame of NELF recycling. Interestingly, paused genes were originally proposed to be fast and transient responders to inducing signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rogatsky and Adelman, 2014</xref>); NELF reloading despite prolonged LPS exposure could potentially contribute to cessation of activation and establishing a âtolerantâ LPS-unresponsive state. More generally, our finding illustrates that the transcriptional landscape of macrophages during a sustained exposure to a signal, even in a course of a few hours, undergoes a significant remodeling and a secondary stimulus is likely to elicit variable responses depending on the exact timing of stimulation. Furthermore, given intrinsic macrophage plasticity, whereby a 12 hr treatment with a relevant signal (e.g. LPS or Dex) is sufficient to âpolarizeâ them to a distinct myeloid cell population â caution needs to be taken in interpreting results of âsequentialâ treatments, which may document a response of a reprogrammed macrophage to a new signal rather that simple transcriptional antagonism or synergy.</p><p>Under conditions of GC repression, we observed a broad failure of paused genes to release NELF concomitantly with inhibition of Pol 2 entry into productive elongation. Moreover, genetic disruption of NELF resulted in GC resistance of genes in this class establishing a causal relationship between NELF accumulation and GR-mediated repression. Interestingly, NELF was previously shown to participate in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha-mediated gene expression. ERa primarily affects Pol 2 post-initiation steps, whereby pausing is alleviated via hormone-induced recruitment of CDK9 to Pol 2 and NELF and their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kininis et al., 2009</xref>). Given that NRs can dynamically affect P-TEFb occupancy and that P-TEFb recruitment to GC-sensitive genes is attenuated after GC treatment in this and earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luecke and Yamamoto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupte et al., 2013</xref>), GR may block elongation by preventing P-TEFb recruitment, possibly through direct steric hindrance. Interestingly, in addition to phosphorylation, NELF has recently been shown to undergo ADP-ribosylation which also facilitates its release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>). It would be informative to assess whether, similar to P-TEFb, ADP-ribosyl transferases that modify NELF are susceptible to regulation by GCs. Finally, a physical interaction between ERa and NELF has been documented at promoters of certain estrogen-activated genes, where NELF recruitment limits the response to hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aiyar et al., 2004</xref>). Conceivably, NELF could also serve as a non-conventional âco-repressorâ recruited by GR to the promoter-proximal regions of pro-inflammatory genes in a gene-specific manner. Once recruited, NELF may no longer require GR and assume its known function in Pol 2 pausing. Whether GR-mediated repression involves either of these mechanisms remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Interestingly, non-paused genes, such as Il1a and Il1b, exhibit low CpG content, stable nucleosome assembly at promoters, low levels of H3K9/14Ac in the basal state and low TBP occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that histone acetylation marks are required for chromatin remodeling which may pose a major barrier to the recruitment of Pol 2 at these genes. We show that an increase in H4Ac at promoters and kB sites in response to LPS correlated with Pol 2 recruitment, and GC attenuated these effects, suggesting that GR may repress these genes by acting upon factors that âwriteâ and âreadâ histone marks. Among many HATs that modify H3 and H4, p300 is recruited by p65 to the TSS and NF-kB sites and has been shown to acetylate histones that are then bound by BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagarajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roe et al., 2015</xref>). Conceivably, GR attenuates p300 loading by competing for a tethering site on p65 as has been previously documented for IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogawa et al., 2005</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that additional HATs, thatÂ is, GCN5, contribute to writing H3/H4Ac at our GC-sensitive pro-inflammatory genes.</p><p>Given its role as a histone binding protein that reportedly contributes to recruiting P-TEFb and couples the acetylation state at promoters and enhancers with Pol 2 elongation, a clear bias for LPS-induced novel sites of BRD4 recruitment and their sensitivity to Dex specifically at non-paused genes was unexpected. BRD4 binding at promoters broadly correlates with gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LovÃ©n et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanno et al., 2014</xref>). We now show that similar to I-BETs, GR inhibits, albeit indirectly, loading of BRD4 particularly at non-paused genes and, by exploiting their dependency on histone acetylation, disrupts interactions with Mediator, ultimately antagonizing Pol 2 recruitment and transcription initiation. Because this effect is far from uniform, and some p65/BRD4-bound LPS-induced enhancers are more sensitive to the effects of Dex than others, we speculate that a subset of p65-binding sites has greater functional consequences for gene activity. Identifying a subpopulation of âdominantâ enhancers whose BRD4 occupancy is a definitive predictor of transcriptional state, and correlating those with sites of GR recruitment would likely sharpen the differences in BRD4 behavior between the two gene classes.</p><p>Finally, although the two classes of genes are activated and repressed through distinct mechanisms, the consequences of GR activation share commonalities including a failure to recruit P-TEFb and the Mediator complex. P-TEFb is required for gene activation post Pol 2 loading, so at non-paused genes failing to recruit Pol 2, P-TEFb loss would have little functional consequences. Conversely, a block in Mediator recruitment at both the TSS and kB sites could potentially contribute to repression of both classes of genes. Mediator is a multi-subunit complex that interacts with numerous activators and components of basal transcription machinery including Pol 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>). With respect to non-paused genes, Mediator interacts directly with both BRD4 and p300, with Mediator and BRD4 stabilizing each otherâs occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Mediator and p300 can act cooperatively to alter the chromatin landscape and facilitate PIC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>). Although the contribution of Mediator to activation of pro-inflammatory paused genes needs further study, it has been suggested that Mediator may help recruit P-TEFb indirectly promoting pause release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, because kB sites are typically distant from promoters, and pro-inflammatory genes were proposed to be activated through DNA looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tong et al., 2016</xref>), Mediator (perhaps together with Brd4) may contribute to bridging promoters with NF-kB enhancers. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that by hindering Mediator assembly, GR globally disrupts promoter-enhancer communication thereby attenuating pro-inflammatory gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>BMDM were prepared from 8-to-10 week old mice as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupte et al.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: IvÃ¡n D'Orso (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The main findings were thought to be of general interest, but after considerable discussion among the Senior Editor, Reviewing Editor and reviewers, it was concluded that the essential revisions needed to substantiate the major conclusions would require significantly more than a two month time frame. The decision is therefore to reject the manuscript, but to include the distilled 'Essential revisions' resulting from editorial discussion in addition to the full individual reviews. The reviewers indicated willingness to consider a revised manuscript that adequately addresses these main concerns should you wish to pursue that option.</p><p>Sacta et al. investigates the mechanisms of GC mediated repression on inflammatory genes. Using genome-wide approaches they identify the inflammatory gene set that is repressed by GCs. Based on PolII pausing index they identify inflammatory genes that are paused and become activated by the inflammatory stimulus by a mechanism involving the release of NELF. Genes that are not paused recruit PolII de novo, but both paused and not paused inflammatory gene groups are susceptible to GC mediated repression. GR seems to repress paused genes by depositing NELF, while at non-paused genes it inhibits the recruitment of p300, which will ultimately lead to a defect in BRD4 and Mediator assembly, diminishing transcription. Many prior studies have investigated GR repression, and there is substantial overlap in phenomenology reported here and the existing literature. The novelty relates to dividing GR repressed genes into those that are regulated at a pause-release step and those that are not. These findings are interesting, but there are a number of concerns about the strength of the main conclusions. These relate to reproducibility of genome-wide analysis, evidence for the tethering mechanism, relationship of GR binding to NELF occupancy, and interpretation of p300 over expression studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There do not appear to be replicates for ChIP-seq experiments. The authors use a cross correlation analysis method to estimate the quality of their ChIP-seq data, but this is not the same as evaluating reproducibility across experiments. The findings are probably sound with respect to peak locations, but the lack of replicates could be problematic when attempting to make quantitative comparisons and using arbitrary thresholds to divide features into one category or another. All three reviewers were of the opinion that replicates are required to make genome-wide conclusions, which are an essential aspect of this manuscript. The authors should provide a table indicating characteristics of each of the high throughput samples, including number replicates, number of uniquely mapped reads and for ChIP-seq experiments the fraction of reads in peaks. For replicates, the similarities of samples should be indicated e.g., by a Pearson correlation.</p><p>2) The authors identified 201 liganded GR-repressed inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). They suggest that the dominant mechanism of GR-mediated repression is rapid tethering of GR to LPS-activated p65. However, they did not show whether these GR-repressed inflammatory genes are sensitive or insensitive to receptor activation in Dex treated macrophages without inflammatory stimuli. Sensitivity to Dex in the absence of LPS stimulation would suggest a mechanism independent of tethering by NF-ÎºB.</p><p>3) The tethering mechanism itself needs to be further substantiated. At this point, the evidence is based on poor enrichment of GRE sequences at sites associated with binding of p65. There is substantial prior evidence that GR can interact with NF-ÎºB. An important question is whether GR is interacting at negatively regulated sites by tethering or by binding to unconventional GREs, which have also been suggested as a basis for negative regulation. This question may be difficult to address in the BMDMs in a reasonable time frame, but could be addressed by generating by using CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to introduce DNA binding mutants in the endogenous GR locus in the RAW system and performing ChIP-seq experiments under each experimental condition. (An alternative would be to study GR in BMDMs in the GRdim mice, if available). These experiments would clearly establish which binding events were dependent on the DNA binding domain and which were mediated by tethering.</p><p>4) The findings regarding the requirement of NELF for GR repression of paused genes are interesting, but more information is needed for interpretation. Does GR treatment prevent dismissal of NELF from paused promoters? Is there a consistent relationship between GR occupancy at the promoters of paused genes and the importance of NELF? How does NELF affect basal gene expression at paused inflammatory genes and intergenic enhancers? If NELF keeps these genes under pausing, in the absence of NELF at least in theory gene expression should increase. It would be helpful to provide the absolute levels of expression of these genes rather than fold change to enable a more complete assessment of the consequences of NELF deletion.</p><p>5) Further related to the pause-release mechanism, a study by Zhu et al. (Biochemistry 2011) showed that the master regulator of Pol II pause release (the Cdk9/P-TEFb kinase) is a competitive decelerator of GR transactivation activity and does not interfere with the inhibitory activity of NELF. What is the role of CDK9 on NF-ÎºB and GR binding in the repression of inflammatory genes? Along the same line, one key relevant article (PMID 15879558) was not discussed in the context of the discoveries of this manuscript. In that paper, Luecke and Yamamoto published that GR blocks recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase by NF-ÎºB to effect promoter-specific transcriptional repression. Is there any relationship between these previous discoveries and the mechanisms of LPS+Dex stimulation/repression discussed in this manuscript?</p><p>6) An old model for nuclear receptor-dependent repression of inflammatory response genes posited re-distribution of coactivators upon nuclear receptor activation. Here, most GR sites are not at NF-ÎºB peaks and could potentially compete for the binding of p300 for gene activation. This mechanism would also result in loss of p300 at p65 peaks and be overcome by overexpression of wild type p300 but not mutant p300. Therefore, the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> do not clearly demonstrate that local tethering of GR is the cause of reduced p300 and histone acetylation at these sites. Examination of p300 and histone acetylation, etc., in a cell engineered to express a DNA binding mutant that cannot bind to specific DNA sites (and thus recruit p300 to these sites) but can still tether to NF-ÎºB sites, as requested in point 3, above, would be needed to address this concern.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript from Sacta and colleagues reports on the analysis of dexamethasone (dex) mediated repression of genes upregulated upon LPS stimulus either by release of the paused RNA polymerase II or de-novo recruitment thereof. They find that both, control of RNAP II elongation or de-novo recruitment are equally susceptible to GR repression. The authors present evidence of GR-binding to p65 sites upon LPS treatment and reduced dex-induced repression of paused genes upon NELF depletion, a factor pivotal for Pol II pausing. In addition, they provide evidence for the opposition of p300, BRD4 and GR. The findings regarding two distinct mechanisms for GR repression are of general interest, but some of the main conclusions are not yet sufficiently established.</p><p>The findings regarding the requirement of NELF for GR repression of paused genes are interesting, but more information is needed for interpretation. Does GR treatment prevent dismissal of NELF from paused promoters? Is there a consistent relationship between GR occupancy at the promoters of paused genes and the importance of NELF? What happens to the basal expression of these genes? Are they still induced by LPS or do they become constitutively activated? It would be helpful to provide the absolute levels of expression of these genes rather than fold change to enable a more complete assessment of the consequences of NELF deletion.</p><p>For the RNAseq, a rational for the relatively relaxed conditions of an FDR to 0.1 and using a 1.5-fold change should be presented. How far did the additionally obtained genes improve the findings compared to the more commonly utilized i.e. FDR 0.05 and &gt;2 fold? A more detailed description of the rationale and used parameters would benefit the methods.</p><p>The authors do not relate the present findings to their earlier studies indicating a requirement for GRIP1 in repression of LPS-dependent gene expression.

In the absence of replicates, the key findings from ChIP-seq need to be confirmed at informative loci for representative genes.</p><p>The manuscript would benefit from a discussion of previous findings including the physical interaction of NF-ÎºB and GR upon GR translocation (Ray laboratory and others, i.e. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.2.752). Treatment with alternative ligands such as RU486 which facilitates GR translocation but negligible activity to inhibit NF-ÎºB transactivation would strengthen the claim of GR tethering at the described sites. The novelty of the finding is at this point not entirely clear and could benefit from a more thorough discussion of previous publications, particularly those from the Simons lab (doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.683722 and most notably 10.1074/jbc.M115.683722), in which Brd4, NELF etc. are implicated in GR activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Sacta et al. investigates the mechanisms of GC mediated repression on inflammatory genes.

In the absence of this the enthusiasm of this reviewer is rather low, because the issue of GR mediated transcriptional repression has been addressed by many papers and this represents only an incremental advance. In addition the reviewer feels that the first part of the Results section is way too lengthy/complicated and contains more figures (motif enrichment analysis) that are not necessarily helping the main finding of the paper. Also the reviewer did not find any information about the number of replicates for the ChIP-seq experiments and there is no accession number provided to access sequencing datasets. The authors should provide a summary table containing all the next generation sequencing datasets.</p><p>1) The authors identified 201 liganded GR-repressed inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). They suggest that the dominant mechanism of GR-mediated repression is to rapid tethering of GR to LPS-activated p65. However, they did not show whether these GR-repressed inflammatory genes are sensitive or insensitive to receptor activation in Dex treated macrophages without inflammatory stimuli.</p><p>2) The authors suggested that 111 new GR peaks appeared in association with GR-repressed inflammatory genes in LPS+Dex treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, they presented some representative examples of these peak set on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. However, Dex treated sample is missing on this figure.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> suggests that in the proximity of Dex repressed genes, GR peaks enrich the motif of the receptor conflicting with the proposed tethering mechanism. The authors should clarify this and provide experimental evidence if the repression predominantly takes place via tethering.</p><p>4) The read distribution plot-based visualization of different GR peak sets (on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and E</xref>) is also necessary in untreated, LPS, Dex and LPS+Dex-treated macrophages.</p><p>5) The authors should be more careful with the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. &quot;GR represses LPS-induced genes via p65-assisted tethering&quot;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> neither does establish p65 as the main factor implicated in this, nor does provide evidence for the tethering mechanism (just by looking at motif enrichments one cannot claim that tethering is the main mechanism because of the absence of the GR motif). How do the authors know the relative contribution of p65 or other inflammatory transcription factors (AP1) to this &quot;tethering&quot;? Also if this is tethering, due to the fact that GR indirectly binds to these regions, I would expect to see smaller read enrichments (peaks) compared to regular, directly DNA bound GR sites.</p><p>6) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. it seems that the vast majority of the GR binding sites are formed also in the absence of LPS, suggesting that GR independently of LPS can act at these sites. How does Dex pre-treatment followed by LPS stimulation affect gene expression at these loci? How does Dex treatment alone affect inflammatory gene expression at the basal state?</p><p>7) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, are these GR peak categories overlap with p65 binding? The authors should make a schematic representation about the annotation process for easy understanding.</p><p>8) The authors claim that p65 binding is not affected by Dex, however there is no genome-wide analysis to back this claim. If the authors determined the RPKM values for p65 peaks on the regions identified on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (Dex-repressed distal intergenic regions or other regions in this group) under the conditions presented would clarify if p65 binding indeed did not change.</p><p>9) The authors showed that the promoter regions of &quot;paused&quot; inflammatory genes were associated NELFE binding in absence of inflammatory stimuli. They described, that NELFE binding was decreased at these promoters after 1 hour LPS treatment. They suggest, that this factor also plays central role in GR-mediated repression. However, they did not show the deep comparison of NELFE binding between the unstimulated, LPS, Dex and LPS+Dex-stimulated macrophages at the promoter regions of all &quot;paused&quot; inflammatory genes (using read distribution plot-based visualization) or at the selected genes.</p><p>10) The authors described that 4 selected LPS-induced genes were repressed in a NelfB-dependent manner by Dex. How many genes do show similar NelfB dependency from the identified 201 liganded GR-repressed inflammatory genes?</p><p>11) Is the p65 binding regulated at the &quot;paused&quot; and &quot;non-paused&quot; inflammatory genes-associated enhancers/promoters by Dex?</p><p>12) Are the histone acetylation and p300 binding are regulated at the &quot;non-paused&quot; inflammatory genes-associated promoters/enhancers in the absence of inflammatory stimuli by GR activation?</p><p>13) How does NELF affect basal gene expression at paused inflammatory genes and intergenic enhancers? If NELF keeps these genes under pausing, in the absence of NELF at least in theory gene expression should increase.</p><p>14) How the absence of NELF affects the recruitment of p65 and GR at paused genes? Is it possible that pause release can negatively affect the recruitment of p65 or GR upon co-stimulation?</p><p>15) How Dex treatment affects NELF occupancy? Is it possible that GR activation deposits more NELF to inflammatory genes/enhancers and quenches future LPS response?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Sacta et al. have utilized genome-wide and cell-based approaches to define mechanisms of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated repression of inflammatory genes in response to Dex treatment. GR potently represses the synthesis of inflammatory genes but the underlying mechanisms remained poorly understood. The authors used mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages treated ex vivo with LPS (to trigger the inflammatory program) and LPS+Dex co-treatment (to induce GR-mediated repression) as a system to tackle this scientific problem. They first classified GR target genes as paused and non-paused using an RNA Pol II pausing index criteria. While paused genes are activated by promoting Pol II pause release through eviction of the negative elongation factor NELF, non-paused genes are regulated by de novo Pol II recruitment to target promoters. The data suggests that GR does not preferentially repress genes in one-class vs the other. In addition, given that most of the GR regulated genes contain statistically enriched NF-ÎºB (p65 subunit) binding motifs (as inferred from ChIP-seq data), the authors proposed a model in which the dominant repressive mechanism for both cases involves rapid GR 'tethering' to NF-ÎºB. However, although the genomics data is convincing there is no evidence for the proposed recruitment mechanism and then the manuscript moves away from this central point to further define the molecular bases of the mechanism of activation and repression at both classes of genes (role of NELF on GR repression, role of histone acetylation, BRD4/Mediator recruitment to promoters, and p300 recruitment/activity). Striking differences between paused and non-paused genes were observed. While paused genes contain high-level of acetylation, non-paused genes do not but show a significant increase after LPS treatment, effect that was attenuated by Dex. They then analyzed the genome-wide distribution of BRD4 by ChIP-seq, but this section is confusing, not very well elaborated or integrated with other sections in the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, using a pharmacological approach, the authors proposed a function for p300 in the LPS-mediated activation of non-paused genes but not of paused genes, and that GR represses non-paused genes by precluding p300 recruitment, histone acetylation, BRD4 recruitment and Pol II loading. The study seems an extension of several others that have examined the transactivation and trans-repression roles of GR. Nevertheless, it has several interesting findings on how GR mediates its repressive effects and provides further insight into the potential cross talk between NF-ÎºB and GR in the regulation of transcription. However, the implications of these findings in the context of inflammation/innate immunity, and key genetic evidence for the 'tethering' mechanism, are lacking. While the manuscript has novel and interesting observations, several points require further clarification and experimental support as indicated below.</p><p>1) It would be critical (especially for the reader not familiar with the system used in this manuscript) to explain why the authors used co-treatment (LPS+Dex) rather than pre-treatment with Dex to exert transcriptional repression prior to the LPS shock. There has to be a biological explanation that is not apparent in the text.</p><p>2) The conclusion that Dex repression of all 'paused' genes is attenuated upon loss of NELF is expected if GR functions through NELF, but there is no direct evidence supporting the model.</p><p>3) The final conclusion of section 1 arguing that NF-ÎºB is a critical component of repression complexes is interesting but the model has not been tested. This is inexplicable. Previous studies have shown that GR interacts directly with the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB. Thus, do GR and NF-ÎºB associate in order for GR to elicit its repressive effects? If so, it is unclear in the manuscript and must be highlighted. Then the manuscript transitions to an interesting topic (the role of NELF in GR repressive effects) but unrelated to the initial observations. This rough transition makes to think that the two parts were forced.</p><p>4) A study by Zhu et al. (Biochemistry 2011) showed that the master regulator of Pol II pause release (the Cdk9/P-TEFb kinase) is a competitive decelerator of GR transactivation activity and does not interfere with the inhibitory activity of NELF. What is the role of CDK9 on NF-ÎºB and GR binding in the repression of inflammatory genes? Along the same line, one key relevant article (PMID 15879558) was not discussed in the context of the discoveries of this manuscript. In that paper, Luecke and Yamamoto published that GR blocks recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase by NF-ÎºB to effect promoter-specific transcriptional repression. Is there any relationship between these previous discoveries and the mechanisms of LPS+Dex stimulation/repression discussed in this manuscript?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34864.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There do not appear to be replicates for ChIP-seq experiments.

A typical single 4-condition ChIP experiment requires bone marrow isolated from 4-6 mice. To then obtain enough sonicated ChIP material in 150-250 nt DNA fragment range for a sequencing experiment, we have to pool 3 to 8 (for particularly difficult cofactors or tethered GR) individual ChIPs (biological replicates), all of which are quality-controlled and have confirmed enrichments in expected locations by qPCR. This means, we need macrophages derived from 15 to 40 mice for a single 3-4-condition sequencing run. If we face a misfortune of the working antibody being discontinued (or Santa Cruz Biotech de facto going out of business), we have to start optimizations from scratch. This is what we have been doing over the past 5 months.</p><p>Our original manuscript contained replicate ChIP-seq runs for Pol 2. The revision contains 2 new 4-condition replicates for GR, a new 3-condition replicate for p65, and a new 3-condition replicate for Brd4.

So we would have to re-optimize our ChIP protocol to yet another new antibody and perform <underline>both new ChIP-seq repeats</underline> (~8 individual 4-condition ChIPs). While this is doable, it would require at least 2 more months and, given how many additional experiments and at what cost we have completed (combined with the fact that thus far, the repeats have not challenged any of the original conclusions), we hope our reviewers will accept the NELF-E runs (composed of 2-3 experiments each) as they are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors identified 201 liganded GR-repressed inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These experiments would clearly establish which binding events were dependent on the DNA binding domain and which were mediated by tethering.</p></disp-quote><p>These two points are related, therefore, we address them below together.</p><p>We agree that indeed, binding to NF-ÎºB sites in the absence of LPS stimulation (and hence NF-ÎºB binding) would imply an alternative mechanism for GR recruitment. It should be noted, that a number of inflammatory genes are co-regulated by NF-ÎºB and AP1, and certain level of basal/uninduced cJun binding seen in most cell types can potentially provide tethering surface to GR in the absence of additional stimulation. Importantly, inflammatory signaling is known to antagonize GR DNA binding and gene regulation due to both transcriptional and signaling mechanisms (see, for example, Rogatsky et al., PNAS 1998; Chinenov et al., BMC Genomics 2014). Thus, if GR represses our genes through direct DNA binding, it is expected to do it MUCH better in a Dex-alone condition.</p><p>RNA-seq experiments reported here did not include Dex-alone condition, however, our published BMDM RNA-seq analysis (Chinenov et al., PNAS 2012; Chinenov et al., BMC Genomics 2014) did include untreated and 1-h Dex-alone condition. We analyzed the data for our 201 genes and found that only 56 were repressed (1.3-fold threshold), and only 16 were repressed â¥2-fold. These data strongly argue for the necessity of inflammatory signal and LPS-induced p65 activation for recruiting GR, and certainly, against competitive binding. An additional column specifying the ability of GR to repress our 201 genes in the presence of Dex alone has been added to the revised <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Next, we re-analyzed motif enrichment given new datasets incorporated into the study. As detailed in Results, the striking part of the analysis is that within a new class of GR binding sites gained specifically in response to LPS (LPS+Dex â unique sites), relative to Dex â unique or Dex: LPS+Dex â overlapping, is the NF-ÎºB motifs, whereas GREs are not enriched. In contrast, the GR Dex â unique or Dex: LPS+Dex â overlapping peaks reveal the GREs and lack NF-ÎºB enrichment (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We now also added Dex-alone GR ChIP-seq read density distributions in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>(Tnf, Il1b, Il12b, Cd83): new tracks demonstrate that GR binding peaks appear ONLY in LPS+Dex condition and perfectly overlap p65 peaks; no GR binding is seen in Dex-alone-treated BMDM. We see a similar LPS+Dex â specific GR binding by regular ChIP in both BMDM and human macrophage-like THP1 cells (Rollins et al., Nature Commun 2017 â Figure 6D-E https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-01701569-2). Additional sites of GR and p65 co-binding at NF-ÎºB enhancers in LPS+Dex-cotreated BMDM are shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Thus, binding data are consistent with the failure of the majority of these genes to be repressed by GR in the absence of inflammatory stimulation and NF-ÎºB binding.</p><p>Of course, using âuncouplingâ mutants has been attempted many times over 25 years since tethering has been first described, but turned out to be less straightforward than one would wish. The X-ray structures of GR bound to NF-ÎºB are not as yet available, but GR DBD is well documented to be required for this interaction (see, for example, Nissen and Yamamoto, Genes and Dev. 2000); many mutations that affect GR DNA binding also affect these protein:protein interactions as well as GR DNA binding specificity. Using the infamous GR Dim mutant (and Dim-expressing BMDM), for example, is not a viable strategy as the mutant has been historically misrepresented as âDNA binding-deficientâ and even âactivation-deficientâ, when later work revealed that it is a complex gain-of-function transcription factor with altered DNA binding specificity, perfectly able to still bind to and regulate a subset of WT GR targets as well as NEW genes not regulated by the WT GR (Schiller et al., Genome Biology 2014). In addition, RAW cells brought up in reviews are extremely genetically unstable; every lab utilizes their favorite âstrainâ of RAW cells which bear little resemblance to gene expression patterns of the primary macrophages and rapidly evolve in culture over as little as a few passages precluding a âstable line selectionâ approach.</p><p>Upon consulting with the editors, we decided to introduce tagged versions of WT vs. DNA-binding-deficient GR of choice into immortalized (i) BMDM and to examine their recruitment to a few induced vs. repressed genes by ChIP. It was agreed that we would not be able to analyze activities of these mutants given the presence of endogenous GR in iBMDM, but occupancy should be sufficient in light of extensive evidence for tethering described above.</p><p>We created HA-tagged versions of WT hGR and two DNA-binding domain mutants C421G and K442E (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3191531">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3191531</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16239257">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16239257</ext-link>) in which the 1st Zn finger and the 1st helix of the DNA recognition motif, respectively, were disrupted. We packaged these GR derivatives into lenti-viruses using HEK293T cell-packaging line and transduced iBMDM to select for expressors by FACS based on the dsRed2 fluorescent protein-encoding gene in the vector (EF.CMV.RFP <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12788657">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12788657</ext-link> â Addgene). We discovered through multiple attempts, however, that iBMDM shut down ectopic GR expression while retaining dsRed2 fluorescence. As an alternative strategy then, we switched to GR-negative U2OS cells that would at least enable us to assess both activity and binding of GR proteins in the same context. We recognize that this experiment in non-immune, human cells with transiently transfected GR is quite a departure from the primary BMDM work which remains the central goal of our study, and therefore present as supporting âproof-of-principleâ data for the reviewers in this rebuttal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34864.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>GR DNA-binding mutants are competent for repression at NF-ÎºB GR-tethering sites.</title><p>U2OS cells were transfected with hGR (WT, C421G or K442E)-expressing or empty EF.CMV.RFP vector (a, left) using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) and treated the next day with vehicle (Veh), 100 nM Dex, 5 ng/ml TNF or TNF+Dex, as indicated.

In contrast, the NF-ÎºB target genes TNF and IL8 that are activated by TNF (TNF, a physiological inducer of NF-ÎºB activity, is used instead of LPS because U2OS cells are not very LPS-responsive due to poor expression of TLR4) were repressed similarly by the WT GR and its DNA-binding mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>, right). Upon scaling up transfection experiments for ChIP, we were able to detect WT GR, but not DNA-binding mutants, at the two GREs of IGFBP1 and at GILZ after 2-h Dex exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, left). In contrast, all three GR derivatives occupied NF-ÎºB sites of TNF and IL8 upon 1-h TNF+Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, right), further corroborating a tethering model in which p65 is a critical component of GR repression complexes, even in this heterologous experimental system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The findings regarding the requirement of NELF for GR repression of paused genes are interesting, but more information is needed for interpretation. Does GR treatment prevent dismissal of NELF from paused promoters? Is there a consistent relationship between GR occupancy at the promoters of paused genes and the importance of NELF? How does NELF affect basal gene expression at paused inflammatory genes and intergenic enhancers? If NELF keeps these genes under pausing, in the absence of NELF at least in theory gene expression should increase. It would be helpful to provide the absolute levels of expression of these genes rather than fold change to enable a more complete assessment of the consequences of NELF deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if we did not make this clear. Indeed, failure to dismiss NELF is a key component of GR repression of genes in the paused class. Genome-wide NELF occupancy in LPS+Dex (repressed) BMDM is indistinguishable from that seen in resting macrophages, so âpausedâ configuration (which is rapidly disrupted when NELF is released in response to LPS) instead persists in the presence of LPS+Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>We agree that a priori, one may expect that the loss of NELF (NELF-B KO) would release paused Pol II leading to âleakyâ expression; however, an equally plausible scenario is that NELF âconcentratesâ initiated transcriptionally engaged Pol II at the TSS, in which case its loss leads to the loss of Pol II and the baselines would be unaffected or even drop in NELF-B KO. In our system, we see no broad effect of NELF deletion on our genes of interest in resting BMDM (which is consistent with NELF-B KO mice lacking any appreciable phenotype in the absence of challenge). For the 6 genes we analyze quantitatively by RT-qPCR, we now include their baselines in WT vs. NELF-B KO BMDM from RNA-seq (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C; n</xref>=2 each; also see datasets at GSE110279). With respect to their regulation, we now provide for clarity the induction levels for each (which are also unaffected by NELF deletion at the time point of the assay) next to their repression by Dex (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We note, however, that the effects of NELF on the <underline>induction</underline> of inflammatory transcriptome is a separate line of investigation pursued by many laboratories including ours: these are complex, dynamic and gene-specific and lie outside of the scope of this study. Here, we have chosen the time point of analysis at which our genes of interest are induced equally in both genotypes which enables us to specifically assess the effect of NELF on repression.</p><p>Furthermore, we now performed RNA-seq in WT and NELF-B KO BMDM exposed to 1-h LPS+Dex (n=3 each genotype; GSE110279). New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows that a number of LPS-induced Dex-repressed genes are expressed at higher levels (<italic>derepressed</italic>) in NELF-B KO and nearly all of them <italic>belong in the paused class</italic>. This is a striking result given that RNA-seq generates a different kind of data and quantifies all RNA not just nascent unprocessed transcripts as we usually evaluate by RT-qPCR; yet this gene class-specific trend held up to genome-wide analysis. As control, we do not observe such differential expression for LPS-induced Dex-insensitive genes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Further related to the pause-release mechanism, a study by Zhu et al. (Biochemistry 2011) showed that the master regulator of Pol II pause release (the Cdk9/P-TEFb kinase) is a competitive decelerator of GR transactivation activity and does not interfere with the inhibitory activity of NELF. What is the role of CDK9 on NF-ÎºB and GR binding in the repression of inflammatory genes? Along the same line, one key relevant article (PMID 15879558) was not discussed in the context of the discoveries of this manuscript. In that paper, Luecke and Yamamoto published that GR blocks recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase by NF-ÎºB to effect promoter-specific transcriptional repression. Is there any relationship between these previous discoveries and the mechanisms of LPS+Dex stimulation/repression discussed in this manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out; we did mention the connection to CDK9 in Discussion, but it is a good idea to make it stronger. We are happy to cite the Luecke and Yamamoto (2005) work along with our Gupte et al. (2013) paper. Our main observation is that CDK9 recruitment to LPS-induced genes is greatly inhibited in the presence of Dex, however, this occurs irrespective of the gene class. We include a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>that evaluates CDK9 occupancy at the same genes whose expression we assess in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Given that NELF rather than CDK9 was a critical distinction between paused and non-paused gene regulation, we focused our efforts on the former. That said, we are open to the possibility that multiple mechanisms contribute to NELF retention: failure to be phosphorylated by CDK9 is a valid mechanism as well as physical interactions between NELF and other components of the GR repression complex. We added requested information to revised Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) An old model for nuclear receptor-dependent repression of inflammatory response genes posited re-distribution of coactivators upon nuclear receptor activation. Here, most GR sites are not at NF-ÎºB peaks and could potentially compete for the binding of p300 for gene activation. This mechanism would also result in loss of p300 at p65 peaks and be overcome by overexpression of wild type p300 but not mutant p300. Therefore, the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> do not clearly demonstrate that local tethering of GR is the cause of reduced p300 and histone acetylation at these sites. Examination of p300 and histone acetylation, etc., in a cell engineered to express a DNA binding mutant that cannot bind to specific DNA sites (and thus recruit p300 to these sites) but can still tether to NF-ÎºB sites, as requested in point 3, above, would be needed to address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we are familiar with the heavily debated âcompetition for CBP/p300â model and the subsequent studies arriving at very different conclusions. We appreciate the suggestion of using GR mutants however, this will create a new, stoichiometrically and biochemically intractable experimental system; in addition, it is unknown whether GR even needs to be DNA-bound to recruit p300 and evaluating the ability of any mutants to interact with p300 would constitute a project way out of scope of this study. Instead, we proposed another solution â as agreed upon by the Editor â which addresses the same concern within the same primary unmanipulated BMDM in a cleaner way. Indeed, if GR activation simply creates a âcofactor sinkâ, then p300 will be broadly evicted from most/all LPS-induced p65 targets. Hence, we analyzed the recruitment of p300 to the p65 binding sites of LPS-induced genes that were resistant to the effects of Dex. We now show that LPS-induced Dex-insensitive genes retain p300 at their p65 binding sites. Their expression (from our original RNA-seq), p65 ChIP-seq read density distribution and p300 ChIP-qPCR data (in the 3 experimental conditions each) are shown as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
