activation is essential for the execution of motor actions; however, the molecular mechanisms that give rise to specific patterns of MN activity are largely unknown. Phrenic MNs integrate multiple inputs to mediate inspiratory activity during breathing and are constrained to fire in a pattern that drives efficient diaphragm contraction. We show that Hox5 transcription factors shape phrenic MN output by connecting phrenic MNs to inhibitory premotor neurons. <italic>Hox5</italic> genes establish phrenic MN organization and dendritic topography through the regulation of phrenic-specific cell adhesion programs. In the absence of <italic>Hox5</italic> genes, phrenic MN firing becomes asynchronous and erratic due to loss of phrenic MN inhibition. Strikingly, mice lacking <italic>Hox5</italic> genes in MNs exhibit abnormal respiratory behavior throughout their lifetime. Our findings support a model where MN-intrinsic transcriptional programs shape the pattern of motor output by orchestrating distinct aspects of MN connectivity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In mammals, air is moved in and out of the lungs by a sheet of muscle called the diaphragm. When this muscle contracts air gets drawn into the lungs and as the muscle relaxes this pushes air back out. Movement of the diaphragm is controlled by a group of nerve cells called motor neurons which are part of the phrenic motor column (or PMC for short) that sits within the spinal cord. The neurons within this column work together with nerve cells in the brain to coordinate the speed and duration of each breath.</p><p>For the lungs to develop normally, the neurons that control how the diaphragm contracts need to start working before birth. During development, motor neurons in the PMC cluster together and connect with other nerve cells involved in breathing. But, despite their essential role, it is not yet clear how neurons in the PMC develop and join up with other nerve cells.</p><p>Now, Vagnozzi et al. show that a set of genes which make the transcription factor Hox5 control the position and organization of motor neurons in the PMC. Transcription factors work as genetic switches, turning sets of genes on and off. Vagnozzi et al. showed that removing the Hox5 transcription factors from motor neurons in the PMC changed their activity and disordered their connections with other breathing-related nerve cells. Hox5 transcription factors regulate the production of proteins called cadherins which join together neighboring cells. Therefore, motor neurons lacking Hox5 were unable to make enough cadherins to securely stick together and connect with other nerve cells.</p><p>Further experiments showed that removing the genes that code for Hox5 caused mice to have breathing difficulties in the first two weeks after birth.

In mammals, specialized circuits have evolved to support robust and efficient breathing to cope with changing metabolic demands. While respiratory rhythmogenesis occurs within a small neuronal kernel in the pre-Bötzinger complex, a large contingent of respiratory circuitry is dedicated to transforming this rhythm into precisely patterned motor output for efficient muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>). Phrenic Motor Column (PMC) neurons are a critical node in these circuits, as they integrate multiple descending and local inputs to mediate rhythmic contraction of the diaphragm muscle, which is essential for driving airflow into the lungs during inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greer, 2012</xref>). The establishment of phrenic motor neuron (MN) identity relies on the intersection of transcription factor-based programs acting along the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal axes of the spinal cord during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaimowicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edmond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Philippidou et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is not known whether these MN-intrinsic transcriptional programs are required for the generation of patterned respiratory motor output.</p><p>While most neural circuits undergo significant maturation at postnatal stages, the circuits that underlie breathing not only need to be functional at birth, but are also critically required in utero. Fetal contractions of the diaphragm muscle are essential for lung and diaphragm development and defects in these contractions result in lung hypoplasia and central sleep apneas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harding, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, inputs that drive the activation of phrenic MNs must be established prior to birth, indicating that hardwired transcriptional programs likely control major aspects of this connectivity. Because inspiratory drive is relatively weak during embryonic stages, coupling of phrenic MNs through gap junctions is critical to maintain early diaphragm contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greer and Funk, 2005</xref>). Therefore, tight clustering of PMC neurons is essential for proper development of the respiratory system, but the molecular mechanisms that control phrenic MN clustering and topography are largely unknown.</p><p>In addition to establishing robust embryonic diaphragm contractions, PMC clustering may also be important for the selective establishment of presynaptic inputs. Interestingly, unlike the majority of MNs in the spinal cord, phrenic MNs appear to lack monosynaptic sensory input from Ia proprioceptive afferents and extensive inputs from spinal cord interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, the majority of their monosynaptic inputs (~70%) are derived from the rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG), a group of mostly glutamatergic neurons in the brainstem that transmit the excitatory drive to activate MNs in a rhythmic pattern generated in the pre-Bötzinger complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition also contributes to shaping phrenic motor output. Inspiratory-phase inhibitory inputs onto phrenic MNs rapidly modulate MN excitability to act as a gain control for motor output and control motor neuron synchronization within respiratory bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parkis et al., 1999</xref>). Synchronous inspiratory MN firing on a short time scale is thought to enhance inspiratory muscle activation, thus ensuring robust and efficient breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bou-Flores and Berger, 2001</xref>). Importantly, firing of phrenic MNs in an unpatterned manner increases the risk of phrenic MN adaptation, diaphragm muscle fatigue, and respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Caraballo et al., 2000</xref>). Despite the critical role of inhibition in patterning phrenic MN activity, the molecular determinants that underlie the establishment of inhibitory inputs onto phrenic MNs have not been identified.</p><p>Here, we show that Hox5 transcription factors are required for robust and efficient breathing. <italic>Hox5</italic> loss renders mice particularly vulnerable to respiratory dysfunction in the first two weeks of life, suggesting that <italic>Hox5</italic> mutations may contribute to early life respiratory conditions. We also show that Hox5 proteins establish phrenic MN clustering and topography through the regulation of a network of cell adhesion molecules. We find that a subset of cadherins are specifically expressed in phrenic MNs and that loss of cadherin function through conditional disruption of downstream β/γ-catenin signaling leads to phrenic MN cell body disorganization and dendrite displacement. MN-specific deletion of <italic>Hox5</italic> genes results in a selective loss of inhibitory inputs to PMC neurons and a dramatic change in the activation pattern of phrenic MNs. Our results demonstrate that Hox5 transcription factors determine phrenic MN topography and connectivity to generate robust breathing behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hox5</italic> genes are required for proper respiratory behavior</title><p>We previously showed that two <italic>Hox5</italic> paralogs, <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Hoxc5</italic> (collectively referred to as <italic>Hox5</italic> genes) are required for the early development and survival of phrenic MNs and the innervation of the diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Landry-Truchon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Philippidou et al., 2012</xref>). Mice lacking both <italic>Hox5</italic> genes in MNs (<italic>Hoxa5 flox/flox; Hoxc5-/-; Olig2::Cre</italic>, referred to as <italic>Hox5<sup>MNΔ</sup></italic> mice) die at birth due to respiratory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Philippidou et al., 2012</xref>). While the neonatal lethality of <italic>Hox5<sup>MNΔ</sup></italic> mice underscores the critical requirement for <italic>Hox5</italic> genes in respiration, it had prevented us from examining the role of Hox5 proteins in respiratory behaviors and functional connectivity at postnatal stages. To examine the role of <italic>Hox5</italic> genes in breathing behaviors and phrenic MN output over time we utilized an alternative mouse model. We generated mice in which a single <italic>Hox5</italic> gene, <italic>Hoxa5</italic> was selectively deleted from MNs by crossing a conditional <italic>Hoxa5</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tabariès et al., 2007</xref>) to <italic>Olig2::Cre</italic> mice (<italic>Hoxa5<sup>MN∆</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup></italic> mice were viable, and we therefore introduced the <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup></italic> mutant allele into a <italic>Hoxc5</italic> heterozygous background.

We found that adult (P80) <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic> mice show a 40% decrease in tidal volume (the amount of air inhaled during a normal breath), accompanied by a compensatory increase in respiratory frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>).

While the reduction in diaphragm innervation likely contributes to tidal volume changes, we wanted to identify additional fundamental properties of phrenic MNs that could contribute to respiratory circuit formation and function that are altered in <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic> mice. Phrenic MNs form a tightly-packed neuronal cluster at cervical levels of the spinal cord (C3-C5). This clustering is critical for the proper development of the respiratory system because it facilitates recruitment of motor units through electrical coupling in the embryo to compensate for weak inspiratory drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greer and Funk, 2005</xref>).

However, respiratory efficiency also relies on MN activity on a shorter time scale (i.e. 10–100 ms), and the precise temporal pattern of phrenic MN firing during inspiratory bursts is necessary for forceful diaphragm contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Lunteren and Sankey, 2000</xref>). We found that MN bursts from control (<italic>Hoxa5 flox/flox; Hoxc5+/-</italic>) mice exhibited a highly reproducible firing pattern, with inspiratory bursts comprised of periods of activity interspersed with periods with no unit activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). These silent periods progressively lengthen throughout the burst. In addition, periods of activity are dominated by large amplitude rhythmic oscillations that occur at approximately 30 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), generated by the summations of multiple phrenic MN units firing in the same temporal pattern. Interestingly, these 30 Hz oscillations are matched to the fusion frequency of the diaphragm muscle, which is the frequency of firing at which the diaphragm is tonically and maximally contracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Caraballo et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, patterned firing of phrenic MNs close to the fusion frequency promotes highly efficient diaphragm contraction.</p><p>Remarkably, this pattern in inspiratory bursts is abolished in <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

In addition, the large amplitude rhythmic 30 Hz activity was eliminated, suggesting that the firing of phrenic MNs in <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic> mice is no longer constrained to occur at specific times but is instead distributed throughout the burst, thus reducing the compound action potentials seen in control mice. Power spectrum analysis to resolve the recording into its component frequencies indicated a decrease in 30 Hz activity with a concomitant broad spectrum increase in higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f–g</xref>). Importantly, firing of phrenic MNs in an unpatterned manner that does not correlate with the diaphragm fusion frequency provides no additional contractile benefit, and in fact may increase the risk of phrenic MN adaptation, diaphragm muscle fatigue, and respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Caraballo et al., 2000</xref>).

Despite their critical function, the molecular mechanisms that control their selective targeting by premotor populations and shape their output are largely unknown. In this study, we find that Hox5 transcription factors control phrenic MN topography by establishing a PMC-specific cadherin code. MN-specific <italic>Hox5</italic> deletion impacts the formation of inhibitory inputs onto PMC neurons, alters phrenic MN output, and leads to respiratory dysfunction throughout life. We discuss these findings in the context of respiratory circuit assembly and breathing behaviors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Hox5</italic> genes control PMC clustering and topography through a phrenic-specific cell adhesion code</title><p>The establishment of clustered neuronal nuclei is a conserved and prominent organizational feature of the CNS and is thought to be critical for neural circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessell et al., 2011</xref>). Phrenic MN clustering serves an additional function. The generation of fetal breathing movements is required for lung and diaphragm maturation; however, descending inspiratory drive is relatively weak during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greer, 2012</xref>). Electrical coupling between tightly clustered phrenic MNs facilitates the recruitment of multiple motor units to compensate for weak inputs and generate adequate synchronous motor drive to the diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greer and Funk, 2005</xref>). While electrical coupling is not observed in mature phrenic MNs, when maximum motor unit recruitment becomes inefficient and is no longer desirable, it is especially beneficial during the development of the respiratory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greer et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, phrenic MN clustering likely serves a dual function during development, enabling both electrical coupling and premotor targeting. Our results indicate that Hox5 transcription factors regulate a molecular program that defines PMC position and clustering.</p><p>Our RNA-seq analysis revealed a number of cell adhesion molecules that are downregulated in the absence of <italic>Hox5</italic> genes. CAM expression also appears to distinguish phrenic MNs from other MN populations, alluding to MN subtype-specific CAM functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Machado et al., 2014</xref>). Comprehensive analysis of cadherin expression identified a combinatorial PMC cadherin code (cdh2, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 22). Since our strategy of inactivating <italic>β/γ-catenin</italic> in MNs eliminated all cadherin signaling, we cannot definitively establish whether the full complement of PMC-specific cadherins is necessary for efficient phrenic MN clustering. Expression of single or a small subset of cadherins may be insufficient to endow PMC neurons with a unique identity for self-recognition, and multiple cadherin expression might be necessary for their segregation from limb-innervating and axial MNs found at the same levels. PMC cadherins belong to all three specificity groups identified recently on the basis of their heterophilic interactions, further restricting the likelihood that PMC neurons will interact with other MN populations through heterophilic interactions between cadherins of the same subgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasch et al., 2018</xref>). While the function of the type I cadherin, N-cadherin is required for clustering of all MN populations, additional type II cadherin divergent expression among MN populations may be required for specific MN subtype clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dewitz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrate that <italic>Hox5</italic> genes are required for the correct orientation of PMC dendrites. Phrenic MN dendrites form tightly fasciculated bundles that adopt a distinct ventromedial and dorsolateral orientation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan and Greer, 1997</xref>). By late embryonic stages (e18.5), phrenic dendrites are restricted to the ipsilateral side and rarely cross the midline. Loss of <italic>Hox5</italic> genes leads to a loss of stereotypical dendritic organization and an increased crossing to the contralateral site. Loss of cadherin function leads to similar dendritic reorganization and loss of dorsolateral dendrites, arguing that cadherins are key effectors of Hox5 action. However, cadherin loss does not increase the number of dendrites that cross the midline, pointing to additional mechanisms acting downstream of Hox5 proteins. Notably, while cadherin signaling is critical for dendritic growth and orientation, <italic>β/γ-catenin</italic> inactivation does not impair phrenic MN axon growth or diaphragm innervation, suggesting that <italic>Hox5</italic> genes control two independent molecular programs that regulate axonal and dendritic growth respectively, to coordinate the wiring specificity of phrenic MNs. The requirement for cadherins in establishing both cell body and dendritic topography suggests a prominent cadherin role in PMC presynaptic connectivity. Interestingly, a subpopulation of neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex also expresses cdh9, which could indicate a broad role for cadherins is establishing synaptic connectivity throughout respiratory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MN identity and the logic of selective presynaptic connectivity</title><p>How are phrenic MNs specifically targeted by respiratory premotor populations while eschewing inputs from other descending neurons, locomotor-related interneurons, and sensory afferents directed to other nearby MN populations?

Despite eradicating phrenic MN identity through <italic>Hox5</italic> deletion, which led to loss of PMC topography and downregulation of PMC-specific CAMs, descending excitatory inputs to PMC neurons appear to be largely unperturbed, as we still observe regular phrenic MN bursting in isolated brainstem-spinal preparations. The persistence of excitatory inputs could indicate that Hox5-dependent precise PMC topography is not necessary for these populations to synapse on phrenic MNs or that multiple redundant mechanisms have evolved to maintain this connection that is extremely critical for life. Loss of <italic>Hox5</italic> genes appears to selectively impact the establishment of inhibitory inputs onto phrenic MNs, suggesting distinct requirements for PMC targeting by individual premotor populations.</p><p>How do <italic>Hox5</italic> genes influence PMC connectivity? In sensory-motor circuits, the correct positioning of MNs appears to be critical for their targeting by sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sürmeli et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it has recently been reported that spatial features of the MN dendritic tree, such as the angle of interaction with approaching axons, can also act as a determinant of their connectivity with sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaskas et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Hox5</italic> genes determine PMC cell body and dendritic topography through the induction of cadherin expression. Do cadherins solely function to position phrenic MNs and dendrites at the right place during development or do they have additional roles as molecular recognition cues in presynaptic targeting? In the retina, cadherins control the topography of axonal and dendritic arbors of synaptic partners to place them in close proximity and enable synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). In the hippocampus however, cadherins influence synaptic fidelity and potentiation without overtly affecting cell morphology, pointing to position-independent roles in synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, mutations in transcription factors that alter molecular identity but not cell body position dramatically reconfigure MN inputs, indicating that MN position is unlikely to be the only critical parameter for MN connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinckley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of inhibitory inputs onto PMC neurons likely results from both positional and molecular changes resulting from MN-specific <italic>Hox5</italic> deletion. Defining the explicit contribution of topography to phrenic MN connectivity will require decoupling PMC position from Hox5-mediated transcriptional programs that also control the molecular determinants of phrenic identity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phrenic MN inhibition and respiratory output</title><p>The major function of phrenic MNs is to efficiently contract the diaphragm muscle, and as such, MNs could potentially function to merely execute complex computations occurring in upstream brainstem respiratory circuits. Consistent with this idea, recent monosynaptic viral-based retrograde tracing of phrenic MN inputs revealed that the major PMC projection arises from excitatory rVRG neurons that propagate the respiratory rhythm generated by the pre-Bötzinger complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). However, in addition to this excitation, phrenic MNs receive multiple modulatory inputs, including serotonergic and cholinergic inputs, indicating at least some degree of computation transforms rhythmic signals into appropriate motor patterns at the MN level. Phrenic MNs also receive substantial descending inhibitory inputs and we observed an abundance of inhibitory synapses on phrenic MN cell bodies. While we did not observe a complete loss of inhibitory synapses in <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic> mice, it is likely that only a subset of phrenic MN inhibition is dedicated to patterning motor neuron activity within inspiratory bursts. Alternatively, while we still observe synaptic puncta on phrenic cell bodies, a number of these synapses may be non-functional, as cadherins are also required for synaptic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamagata et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>What is the source of this inhibition and how does it contribute to shaping phrenic MN output?

Differences in tidal volume are somewhat mitigated with age, reflecting the decrease in motor unit recruitment during quiet breathing with the maturation of the respiratory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greer et al., 1999</xref>). At birth, the vast majority of phrenic MNs are recruited at rest, making the impact of phrenic MN loss on tidal volume more pronounced.

For experiments with membrane staining (diI tracing), the number of retrogradely-traced neurons that were in contact with at least one other labelled neuron was counted and divided by the total number of traced neurons to calculate a clustering index. A clustering index of 1 indicates that all retrogradely-traced MNs were clustered. For experiments with nuclear protein staining, we connected all PMC nuclei (Scip+Isl1/2+) to their nearest neighbor to form a perimeter of the PMC.

Paired-end, 150 bp sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and generated a total of 58–94 million reads in each direction per sample after filtering.

Mice were cryoanesthetized and rapid dissection was carried out in 22–25°C oxygenated Ringer’s solution. The solution was composed of 128 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 21 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 30 mM D-glucose and was equilibrated by bubbling in 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The hindbrain and spinal cord were exposed by ventral laminectomy, and phrenic nerves exposed and dissected free of connective tissue. A transection at the pontomedullary boundary rostral to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery was used to initiate fictive inspiration. Electrophysiology was performed under continuous perfusion of oxygenated Ringer’s solution in a rostral to caudal direction to prevent drug diffusion to the brainstem during local injection. Suction electrodes were attached to phrenic nerves just proximal to their arrival at the diaphragm. For local injections, we used the following drugs: picrotoxin (PTX) (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, 1.25 mM, Tocris Bioscience, #1128) and strychnine hydrochloride (Strych) (glycine receptor antagonist, 1.25 mM, Sigma, #S8753) dissolved in Ringer’s solution with trypan blue for visualization. The signal was band-pass filtered from 10 Hz to 3 kHz using Grass amplifiers, amplified 5,000-fold, and sampled at a rate of 50 kHz with a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Data were recorded using AxoScope software (Molecular Devices) and analyzed in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). Burst duration, percent of burst time with no activity, and power spectra were computed from five bursts per mouse, while burst frequency was determined from 5 min of recording time per mouse. Traces analyzed for percent of burst time with no activity and power spectral analysis were of similar amplitude. In injection experiments, bursts were analyzed 8–10 min after injection. For power spectra, relative power is defined as the absolute power for that frequency bin divided by the sum of the absolute power over all frequency bins from 10 Hz – 400 Hz.

The chamber was filled with normal air (79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen), and flow was maintained at 0.75 L/min per chamber for all gas mixtures. Mice were acclimated for 1 hr in normal air, and then a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> mixture (74% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) was introduced to the chamber for 15 min, after which the mice were removed. Experiments were performed in pairs, with each pair consisting of one littermate control and one experimental mouse of the same sex and approximate weight. Thirty seconds of resting breaths were analyzed using iox2 software (emka) near the end of the acclimation period in normal air, and another thirty seconds of resting breaths were analyzed 10 to 15 min after the introduction of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Mice were directly observed to identify resting breaths. Each mouse was recorded on three consecutive days and the values were averaged together to reduce variability. Data are presented as fold control, where the control is the matched littermate in normal air. For neonatal plethysmography, we modified syringes to use as chambers, as smaller chambers increase signal detection. Littermate pups were recorded in normal air every 3–4 days from P3 to P17, and 30–50 breaths were analyzed.

Specificity of in situ probes for PMC cadherins. To ascertain the specificity for the designed in situ probes to its intended target (given the degree of similarity between members of the cadherin family), we ran each full length probe through BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) against the refseq_rna database for <italic>M. musculus</italic> and checked for cross-reactivity with other cadherins. BLAST outputs a ‘max alignment score’ parameter, which awards points for base matches while penalizing base mismatches, gaps, etc. While all on target alignment scores are high (&gt;1400, dependent on probe length), off target scores are low (&lt;35% of the max alignment score of the intended target).</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application"

authors address the function of the Hox family of transcription factors in assembly of the motor neuron circuits required for breathing. They perform a detailed characterization in mouse of the perturbed connectivity and neuronal firing that arises from partial loss of Hox function, and they identify cell adhesion molecules as targets of Hox regulation that underlie the development of the proper wiring pattern. This study is particularly significant for the fact that it links molecular mechanisms of development with the function of a physiologically important neuronal circuit.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phrenic-specific transcriptional programs shape respiratory motor output&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard S Mann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors perform a compound motor neuron knockout of the transcription factor Hoxa5 with a Hoxc5 HET to address the function of Hox TFs in assembly of the motor neuron circuits required for breathing. Leaving one copy of Hoxc5 intact in MNs is compatible with survival. This allows them to study the consequences of Hox5 knockout in MNs on the connectivity, gene expression, and function of these neurons. The authors provide data in four main areas. First, they show evidence of breathing abnormalities and susceptibility to perinatal hypoxia. Second, they examine the morphology of the phrenic motor neurons and show that in addition to impaired innervation of the diaphragm, the cell bodies are less clustered and the dendrites are abnormally distributed. Third the authors do RNAseq on purified motor neurons, reveal downregulation of a large set of cell adhesion molecules and show that disruption of cadherin signaling partially phenocopies the loss of Hox5. Finally, the authors record from the motor neurons and demonstrate altered patterns of firing that they suggest arises from reduced inhibitory input.</p><p>The reviewers felt the work was especially significant for its ability to link development with the function of a physiologically important neural circuit. They had only two significant concerns they felt needed to be dealt with in the revision.</p><p>The first of these are some methodological details and controls regarding the cadherin experiments that need to be added.</p><p>The second concern regards tightening the links between the cellular mechanisms revealed (dendritic patterning, cadherin expression) and the circuit physiology shown. For example all three reviewers raised concerns about the catenin knockout experiments and the degree to which they actually reveal mechanisms of the Hox5 defects. That being said, all three reviewers also felt that the more complex genetic experiments that would directly address this concern (some of which are outlined below) might well be too involved to fit within the scope of the current manuscript. We agreed these experiments were not required to support the major points of the paper even though they would further strengthen the argument. As a result, we decided to spell out these concerns to you and leave it to you to decide what way (e.g. with experiments, with support from the literature) you see best to respond.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Methodological details (required):</p><p>In Figure 4, the authors demonstrated a unique combination of Type 2 Cadherins (Cdhs) enriched in these MNs. The significant validation was primarily carried out using in situ hybridization. There are three issues that I would like to see improvements. First, the entire set of Cdh in situ experiments showed very high background and low signals – these might be the accurate representations of the weak signals or some choice of anti-sense sequences against each and different Cdhs. The authors should include all anti-sense sequences that they chose for the study, especially this figure. I couldn't locate such information from the current PDF unless they were deposited at other locations. Generally, I would recommend sequences different from Allen Institute's short sequences (~400bp) for Cdhs – full length, or at least the complete ECC sequences should be covered. Second, for selected and enriched candidates, the authors may consider double-color fluorescent in situ or in situ in conjunction with immunohistochemistry to show the full overlapping and quantify the coverage. Third, some of the candidates identified here, including Cdh9/10 Negr1, etc. was also independently reported by Machado et al., 2014 from wildtype embryonic tissues, while this current manuscript offered much more insights genetically and functionally, leading to future function explorations of the downstream candidates. The authors should cite this manuscript and discuss their findings in the general context.</p><p>Linking cellular mechanism to physiological circuit function (optional):</p><p>1) The data in the Bax KO mice provide an important source of evidence that it is changes in the wiring and/or function of the phrenic MNs that is key for the physiology and morphological phenotypes and not just a decrease in the number of phrenic MNs. However the authors did not show the breathing phenotypes in the Bax mice, which would have been the most useful for tying the cellular and circuit studies together.</p><p>2) Although the catenin knockout phenotypes are also interesting in the context of studying phrenic MN development, I was unsure exactly how well these data supported the Hox findings. The text states that the catenin MN knockouts die prenatally, which suggests they have more severe functional disruption than the Hox mice, but the phrenic MN phenotypes shown look less severe. This led me to question exactly how the cellular data align with the breathing phenotypes.</p><p>3) By necessity, the authors analyze the respiratory phenotypes using a hypomorphic genetic background (Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup>), but most of the cellular phenotypes and transcriptome comparisons are done using the complete null (Hox5<sup>MNΔ</sup>). It would strengthen the paper if they could better connect the dots between these two genetic states, e.g. analyze cadherin expression in the hypomorph or carry out genetic interaction experiments to show that some of the phenotypes seen in Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup> mice get significantly worse in a catenin mutant background (het or MNΔ).</p><p>4) Along the same lines, to circumvent the complicated cell adhesion code the authors depend on double catenin mutant MNs to connect their cadherin expression observations to phrenic MN defects. But, as they point out in the Discussion, the catenin mutants presumably kill the function of all cadherins. It is both not surprising that a mutant phenotype is observed in the catenin mutants, and also doesn't help to link the specific cadherins found in their transcriptome analysis to the phenotype. Perhaps a genetic interaction experiment, or knockdown of some cadherins, would address this question.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52859.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Methodological details (required):</p><p>In Figure 4, the authors demonstrated a unique combination of Type 2 Cadherins (Cdhs) enriched in these MNs.

Due to our breeding scheme (Bax KO mice have to be bred as hets because male KO are sterile and the females are unhealthy) and the ~50% perinatal lethality we observe for these mice (similar to <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic>mice), the probability of generating viable mice of the correct genotype is very low (1/32), making this experiment impractical. Since <italic>Bax</italic> deletion does not rescue perinatal lethality, diaphragm innervation (Philippidou et al.,2012), PMC organization, gene expression or MN output (this manuscript), we think it is unlikely that it would rescue breathing behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the catenin knockout phenotypes are also interesting in the context of studying phrenic MN development, I was unsure exactly how well these data supported the Hox findings.

We also see similar disruptions in cell body organization (compare Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-D to Figure 5B-C) and dendritic orientation (compare Figure 2C-E to Figure 5D-E) in <italic>Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup></italic> and <italic>βγ-cat<sup>MNΔ</sup> </italic>mice, indicating that <italic>βγ-cat<sup>MNΔ</sup> </italic>mice are also likely to exhibit changes in phrenic MN output. Unfortunately, the early embryonic lethality of <italic>βγ-cat<sup>MNΔ</sup> </italic>mice precludes behavioral and electrophysiological analysis and we are currently developing additional mouse models (single and compound cadherin mutants) to further assess the role of cadherin signaling in phrenic MN connectivity and output. The fact that <italic>βγ-cat<sup>MNΔ</sup> </italic>mice show normal diaphragm innervation suggests that the functional disruption and perinatal lethality in <italic>βγ-cat<sup>MNΔ</sup> </italic>mice are a result of disrupted connectivity at the level of the cell bodies/dendrites and not at the axon/NMJ. Because Hox5 mutations affect both cell body/dendritic topography and diaphragm innervation, it is likely that both contribute to perinatal lethality and breathing phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) By necessity, the authors analyze the respiratory phenotypes using a hypomorphic genetic background (Hoxa5<sup>MNΔ</sup>; c5<sup>het</sup>), but most of the cellular phenotypes and transcriptome comparisons are done using the complete null (Hox5<sup>MNΔ</sup>).

This is an important and novel finding as, despite the importance of these two key phrenic MN properties, the molecular pathways that underlie PMC organization were unknown. Furthermore, while PMC neurons specifically express a number of other CAMs (as shown in Figure 4), we have established that cadherins are playing a predominant role in PMC clustering. The implication of cadherins in PMC development shown in this manuscript is an important first step in further dissecting these molecular pathways. We are currently generating and analyzing single and compound cadherin mutants to determine the contribution of distinct cadherin family members to phrenic MN organization and we will continue to pursue this direction for future studies. However, given the significant time investment required for these experiments, we believe they are outside the scope of the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
