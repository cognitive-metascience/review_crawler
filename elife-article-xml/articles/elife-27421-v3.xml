These include organ positioning, the specification of different cell types and organ morphogenesis. Spatial cues specifying these processes are usually provided by a molecular pre-pattern present in precursor tissues, or from inductive signals emanating from neighboring regions. Unlike animals however, plant organs such as leaves arise continuously in regular patterns around the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Nevertheless, certain features of leaves are relatively constant including the restriction of their formation to the meristem periphery and their flattened, dorsoventral (top-bottom) orientation with respect to the shoot apex. How are these fundamental features specified?</p><p>Since the 1950s wounding experiments involving the isolation of leaf primordia from the meristem have suggested the presence of an inductive signal from the meristem that promotes dorsal identity within leaf primordia at the time of organ initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinhardt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sussex, 1951</xref>). A variant on this theme is the proposal that transient auxin depletion in the adaxial (adjacent to the shoot axis) tissues of leaf primordia promotes dorsal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, other studies suggest that dorsoventral patterning is pre-established, being directly derived from central-peripheral patterning of the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Husbands et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerstetter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koch and Meinhardt, 1994</xref>). Supporting this proposal is the observation that transcription factors involved in both dorsal and ventral cell fate in the leaf are expressed in the SAM in a central and peripheral manner respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emery et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerstetter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McConnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yadav et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the manner in which leaf dorsoventrality is first established in leaves remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuhlemeier and Timmermans, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To explain how leaf dorsoventrality regulates morphogenesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waites and Hudson, 1995</xref> took a cue from wing development in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>) and proposed that tissues located along the boundary between dorsal and ventral leaf tissues, i.e. along the leaf margin, act as organizers by producing mobile signals that pattern lamina growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waites and Hudson, 1995</xref>). So far, several genes have been identified that are expressed along this boundary including KLUH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiou et al., 2007</xref>) and the WOX family transcription WOX1, WOX2 and PRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haecker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto and Okada, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>). The WOX genes in particular are required for proper lamina growth but are expressed only at the boundary region suggesting they may promote long-range patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>). However although their ectopic expression can cause filamentous outgrowths at the leaf base, overall lamina growth is fairly normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting that additional factors must direct patterning. The WOX genes are also known to regulate the expression of both dorsal and ventrally expressed transcription factors and miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) indicating that the WOX genes promote lamina growth at least in part by maintaining the integrity of dorsal and ventral expression domains. Overall, this leaves the question of how dorsoventral boundaries actually regulate morphogenesis still unanswered.</p><p>Besides influencing leaf differentiation and shape, genes involved in leaf dorsoventrality influence leaf position. For instance, Arabidopsis plants mutant for the KANADI (KAN) genes develop leaves ectopically from the hypocotyl and leaf tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izhaki and Bowman, 2007</xref>) while plants mutant for the Class III HD-ZIP (HD-ZIPIII) genes develop leaves from the center of the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emery et al., 2003</xref>). These observations indicate that the developmental mechanisms that specify leaf dorsoventrality may also be involved in organ positioning although how these processes relate is unclear.</p><p>In this study we investigate the origin of dorsoventral patterning in detail. We show that new organs are centered on a pre-patterned boundary region located between the expression domains of HD-ZIPIII and KAN genes and that both KAN and HD-ZIPIII genes act to repress organogenesis where they are expressed. This leads to a model in which dorsoventral genes control leaf morphogenesis and positioning by localizing auxin transcriptional response, which then polarizes cells non-cell autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>). However, we also show that dynamic auxin levels play a central role in determining boundary position by spatially organizing HD-ZIPIII and KAN1 expression in the meristem periphery. By demonstrating that the regulation of these genes by auxin also governs their response to wounds, our results also provide a parsimonious explanation for the influence of wounds on leaf dorsoventrality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genes involved in leaf dorsoventrality pre-pattern organ formation in the shoot</title><p>To better understand how leaf dorsoventrality is first established we used confocal microscopy to monitor the expression of genes involved in leaf dorsoventrality in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in combination with the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) using functional fluorescent protein reporters. In general, we found proteins involved in leaf dorsoventrality to be localized in non-overlapping concentric patterns with the dorsal Class III HD-ZIP protein REVOLUTA (REV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otsuga et al., 2001</xref>) being detected centrally, as marked by the expression of REVp::REV-2 × YPet (REV-2 × YPet), and the ventral protein KANADI1 (KAN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerstetter et al., 2001</xref>) expressed peripherally, as marked by the expression of KAN1p::KAN1−2 × GFP (KAN1−2 × GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, A to E). These concentric domains not only encircled the meristem but also extended contiguously around initiating leaves and floral bracts. Imaging PIN1p::PIN1-CFP (PIN1-CFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon et al., 2007a</xref>) together with these reporters revealed regions of high PIN1-CFP expression, marking positions of organ inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>), to be centered on a narrow region or ‘gap’ located between the dorsal and ventral domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–K</xref>). As found previously, REV expression extended out into the PIN1-marked primordia over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>), reducing the ‘gap’ between the REV and KAN domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F,M–P</xref>). Nevertheless, at later stages a more substantial ‘gap’ reappeared between the REV and KAN1 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> insets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–L and Q–R</xref>) indicating that the distance between the REV and KAN1 domains can change dynamically. Time-lapse imaging revealed that few cells alter their KAN1 expression during these early stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>) suggesting that the boundary of KAN1 expression in the SAM marks cells destined to form the future dorsoventral boundary of the organ.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27421.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Organ initiation is centered on a boundary between the expression domains of genes involved in leaf dorsoventrality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Confocal projections showing REV-2 ×YPet (red), PIN1-CFP (blue) and KAN1−2 × GFP (green) expression in a vegetative shoot apical meristem at 3 days (<bold>A</bold>), 4 days (<bold>C</bold>) and 5 days (<bold>D</bold>) after stratification (DAS), respectively.

Confocal imaging of seedlings five days after stratification (DAS) on dexamethasone (DEX) induction medium revealed that new organs, marked by high levels of PIN1-CFP expression, formed ectopically at the perimeter of an enlarged and irregular central domain of induced KAN1−2 × GFP expression, in which REV-2 × YPet expression had been repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>).

We investigated DR5 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2015</xref>) in the vegetative meristem by examining its expression both in the wild type and after 1-N-Naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatment at 3 DAS. In mock-treated seedlings we found DR5 to be expressed at the locations of incipient primordia and at the distal tip of existing leaf primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). In contrast, NPA-treated seedlings expressed DR5 in a ring encircling the SAM prior to organ emergence and in the middle domain or dorsoventral boundary region of developing leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Similar experiments with seedlings expressing the ratiometric R2D2 intracellular auxin reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2015</xref>) revealed a generally broader distribution of auxin compared to the DR5 transcriptional response, especially after NPA treatment, where signal was not restricted to the meristem periphery or leaf tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>).

Indeed, auxin promotes the expression of several HD-ZIPIII genes in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itoh et al., 2008</xref>) and in Arabidopsis, REV expression typically extends towards PIN1 polarity convergence patterns in the meristem periphery and disappears in axil regions where auxin is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). To further investigate any potential regulation of REV and KAN expression by auxin we treated inflorescence meristems with synthetic auxin NAA(1-Naphthylacetic acid)as well as auxin transport inhibitor NPA (N-1-Naphthylthalamic acid) to prevent rapid auxin redistribution and examined the response of both REV and KAN1. We found that the region in between the REV and KAN1 domains narrowed due to a significant expansion of REV expression within 15 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>). REV also became expressed in cells between the primordia and meristem where REV had presumably reduced its expression previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D</xref>). This was confirmed by following cells over time where we found that although KAN expression appeared static, more cells expressed REV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–H</xref>). A more subtle response was observed as early as 6 hr upon combined NAA and NPA application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Local application of IAA to <italic>pin1-4</italic> meristems also resulted in a local response by REV within 16 hr of auxin application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, exogenous auxin had little effect on a pCLV3:GFP-ER marker for central zone identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>). Apart from changes in REV we noticed that over the course of 48 hr, KAN1 expression did not appear as expected in between the meristem and floral bracts of stages i1 and i2 (but not P1) at the time of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I and J</xref>), compared to mock treated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10K and H</xref>), where KAN expression appeared adjacent to the primordia within 24 hr. In vegetative meristems this was more obvious where contiguous REV expression often appeared between the meristem and developing leaves where KAN1 expression would normally be expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

While high levels of auxin act to both trigger and maintain HD-ZIPIII expression, this only occurs in cells not already expressing KAN1. Such high levels of auxin also prevent the acropetal expansion of KAN1 expression, not only in cells within primordia but also in regions between the primordia and meristem. As our auxin treatments only prevented KAN1 expression from establishing around primordia at stages, i1 and i2 and not around P1, which corresponds to a stage when auxin depletion has already occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>), our data also suggest that once cells are exposed to low auxin levels, their fate becomes determined, i.e subsequent auxin exposure cannot reverse their trajectory towards ventral or peripheral cell identity. Outside the meristem periphery, both in the meristem central zone and within more established organs, REV and KAN expression appears comparatively auxin insensitive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Wounding induces KAN and represses REV expression in an auxin depletion-dependent manner</title><p>Since auxin is required to maintain REV at the expense of KAN expression in the meristem periphery and wounding causes repolarization of PIN1 away from wound sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>) resulting in auxin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landrein et al., 2015</xref>), we investigated whether wounding results in ectopic KAN1 and reductions in REV expression. Firstly, using a pulsed IR laser to ablate cells adjacent to young organ primordia we confirmed that auxin levels decrease in the vicinity of wounds by monitoring the expression of the R2D2 ratiometric marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A and B</xref>). Next, we monitored REV, KAN and PIN1 expression in response to such wounds. We found that KAN1 became expressed in cells adjacent to the wound on either side, regardless of wound orientation with respect to the SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). Such a response argues against the possibility that ectopic KAN is the result of interruption of a signal emanating from the meristem that promotes dorsal and represses ventral identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sussex, 1955</xref>). Instead, it supports the proposal that KAN1 expression is promoted in the vicinity of wounds in general, possibly due to low auxin levels. To test this hypothesis, we repeated these experiments while treating the wounded meristems with combinations of NAA and NPA over a 48 hr period and found that the induction of KAN1 expression around wounds could be completely eliminated if NAA and NPA were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Although a similar response to wounding was found to occur in vegetative meristems, the wound response typically involved a more substantial reorganization of meristem structure, possibly due to the small size of the vegetative meristem relative to the wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1M–O</xref>). When new leaves subsequently formed, they were properly oriented with respect to the new meristem organization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27421.024</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Wounding induces KANADI1 expression in response to low auxin.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Confocal projections of IMs showing predicted auxin distribution (magenta) based on R2D2 expression 12 hr (<bold>A</bold>) and 36 hr (<bold>B</bold>) after wounding.

The early work of Sussex, based on histological analysis and wounding experiments, suggested that initiating leaf primordia require an inductive signal from meristem tissues to specify dorsal cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sussex, 1955</xref>). This proposal has been further supported by a more recent study in tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinhardt et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, other workers in the field have claimed that dorsoventrality arises directly from radial patterning of the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Husbands et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerstetter et al., 2001</xref>), with some authors also linking the organogenic capacity of the SAM peripheral zone to the meristematic nature of leaf margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</xref>) and dorsoventral boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koch and Meinhardt, 1994</xref>). Our results support elements of these latter proposals by revealing that organs are pre-patterned by domains of KAN and HD-ZIPIII expression not only in terms of their differentiation but also their position and morphology. The effect of ectopic KAN1 expression at the centre of the shoot on subsequent leaf positioning and growth is particularly striking and indicates that the spatial arrangement of HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression present within organ founder cells is incorporated into organs as they initiate and directs patterns of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P–S</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). However, the exact configuration of this pre-pattern, including its propagation into developing organs, is dynamic and depends on changing auxin levels, although this regulation is unlikely to be direct. While high auxin levels promote HD-ZIPIII and represses KAN1 this is only true for cells not already expressing KAN1. Hence, at sites of incipient organ formation, where auxin is concentrated in between the two expression domains, HD-ZIPIII expression is promoted and can expand peripherally, but only in cells adaxial to where KAN is expressed. At the same time, this high level of auxin prevents KAN expression from expanding acropetally into HD-ZIPIII expressing cells, causing the boundary to remain relatively static with respect to the underlying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). However if auxin levels drop, for instance when PIN1 reverses polarity away from cells between the meristem and primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2014</xref>), HD-ZIPIII expression decreases and KAN expression takes its place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B and C</xref>). Hence high levels of auxin ‘lock-in’ the spatial arrangement of HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression within organ founder cells at organ inception until a later stage when the pattern becomes auxin independent. In between primordia, where auxin levels are lower, cells continuously transition from expressing REV in the central zone (where HD-ZIPIII expression appears auxin insensitive) to expressing KAN1 as they are displaced peripherally, as also indicated by the expression patterns of these genes in <italic>pin1</italic> meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2A,E and I</xref>).</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27421.026</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Conceptual Model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During organ inception, PIN1 polarities (white arrows) and the alignment of microtubule arrays converge to create an auxin maximum and promote growth oriented towards the epidermal boundary between HD-ZIPIII and KANADI (KAN) expression domains. As auxin accumulates, it promotes the expression of HD-ZIPIII thereby resulting in its extension towards the PIN1 convergence site. At the same time, auxin also prevents the acropetal expansion of KAN. Thus the boundary becomes fixed to the underlying cells. (<bold>B</bold>) As the primordium grows, PIN1 polarity in cells adaxial to the primordium reverse towards the meristem center and adjacent incipient primordia, thereby creating an auxin depletion zone leading to a reduction in HD-ZIPIII expression. (<bold>C</bold>) The reduction in auxin results in the re-establishment of KAN expression between the meristem and organ. (<bold>D</bold>) Auxin in the vicinity of the boundary in adjacent tissues leads to a localized transcriptional response that orients the polarity of surrounding cells into a convergence pattern, most likely via mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27421-fig14-v3"/></fig><p>Overall these results imply that the dorsoventral patterning of organs results from a four-step process: (i) signals during embryonic development establish concentric patterns of Class III HD-ZIP and KAN gene expression; (ii) the boundary between these domains helps to define sites for auxin-dependent organogenesis i.e. the meristem peripheral zone; (iii) As organs form, dynamic auxin levels modulate the patterns of HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression, thereby helping to position new organs and establish their dorsoventrality; (iv) patterns of HD-ZIPIII and KAN gene expression within organs are stabilized and dictate future patterns of morphogenesis.</p><p>The regulation of HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression by auxin is not only relevant to understanding wild type organ development but also for understanding the reorganization of tissue types in response to wounds. Wounds in the meristem outer cell layer specifically alter cell polarities such that PIN1 becomes polarized away from wounds in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>), leading to auxin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landrein et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, we observe KAN1 to be upregulated and REV to be repressed around wounds. Furthermore, such changes can be completely blocked by auxin application. Altogether then, our results strongly indicate that wounds re-pattern peripheral cell identities due to the depletion of auxin in their vicinity. Specifically, we propose that auxin depletion triggers a local commitment to peripheral cell fate (which includes expressing KAN1), thereby providing a parsimonious explanation for the wound-associated disruptions to leaf polarity observed by Sussex and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sussex, 1955</xref>). However further experiments using the vegetative meristems of plants with larger meristems will be needed to confirm this proposal since we were not successful in altering the dorsoventrality of Arabidopsis leaves by wounding and therefore could not test whether auxin treatment could prevent such alterations.</p><p>Our conclusion that auxin promotes dorsal cell fate while inhibiting ventral cell fate contrasts with those of another study reporting that transient high levels of auxin inhibit establishment or maintenance of dorsal fate and/or promote establishment or maintenance of ventral cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). These findings were based on auxin application experiments in tomato that resulted in the ventralization of leaves as well as the observation that Arabidopsis <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid rev</italic> double mutants produce trumpet or rod-shaped shaped leaves. Although our results cannot easily explain the tomato data, since we find that high auxin levels are required to maintain REV expression during organ establishment, we would expect that in <italic>pin</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> mutants, lower auxin levels may well result in lower expression levels of REV and possibly other Class III HD-ZIPs, leading to leaf ventralization as reported in these mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). Further auxin application experiments in tomato that include an analysis of gene expression and auxin level changes may clarify the relationship between auxin and dorsoventral patterning in tomato compared to Arabidopsis.</p><p>How do DV boundaries control organ position and shape? Both our data as well as data from previous studies suggest this is through the regulation of auxin perception. For instance, organ initiation requires high auxin levels but auxin can only trigger organogenesis in the peripheral zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reinhardt et al., 2000</xref>) where the HD-ZIPIII/KAN boundary occurs. A similar relationship holds for leaves where auxin application results in growth but only from the leaf margins, again corresponding to a DV boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koenig et al., 2009</xref>). We further show that the localization of auxin response to DV boundaries applies generally, i.e. DR5 expression appears higher at such boundaries compared to the broader predicted auxin distribution, as marked by R2D2. How is this restriction achieved? Imaging data reveals that the locations of PIN1 polarity convergences correspond to a region of cells in between the expression domains of HD-ZIPIII and KAN where their expression is low or absent. Given our results as well as genetic and molecular data indicating that both the HD-ZIPIII and KAN genes repress auxin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merelo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), we propose that this localized absence of expression results in a local de-repression of auxin-induced transcription. Such localized auxin activity has recently been shown to orient cell polarity, including microtubule orientations, in a non-cell autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, we suggest that the proposed ability of dorsoventral boundaries to act as organizers analogous to those of the Drosophila wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waites and Hudson, 1995</xref>) rests in-part on their ability to orient cell polarity non-cell autonomously by localizing auxin activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14D</xref>). The resulting growth may occur either in a periodic fashion along the boundary typical of phyllotaxis and complex leaves, or in a more continuous manner typical of simple leaves, depending on the strength of auxin transport or other modifications to the cell polarity feedback system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koenig et al., 2009</xref>). Investigating the dynamic consequences of directly juxtaposing REV and KAN expression should enable the testing of these hypotheses as well as lead to a better understanding of how auxin-responsive boundary domains are first established.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p>Plants were grown on soil at 22°C in continuous light-conditions and cultivated either on soil or on GM medium (1% sucrose, 1 × Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture, 0.05% MES 2-(MN-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid, 0.8% Bacto Agar, 1 % MS vitamins, pH 5.7 with 1 M potassium hydroxide solution).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Construction of transgenes</title><p>Multiply transgenic lines were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into stable transgenic lines or by genetic crossing.

The model introduces a dependence on KANADI and REVOLUTA into previous models describing PIN1 and auxin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heisler and Jönsson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sahlin et al., 2009</xref>). In the model, auxin resides in cell compartments and is able to move between cells either via active transport mediated by PIN1 proteins or passively via a diffusion-like process. PIN1 proteins cycle between cytosol and membrane compartments and a quasi-equilibrium model is used for determining its membrane localization at any time point. Auxin generates a signal able to polarize PIN1 in neighboring cells, i.e. a high auxin concentration increases the amount of PIN1 proteins in the neighboring cell membrane facing that cell. The molecule X in our model acts as a mediator of the signalling between auxin and PIN1, and the signal has previously been interpreted as a molecular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>), or mechanical stress signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>).

Cotyledons, hypocotyl, and roots were removed under dissecting scope, and only shoot meristem and the first pair of leaves were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Each biological replicate, represents tissue from 10 to 15 individual seedlings. Five biological replicates were collected for both mock and NAA treatment. RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) was used according to manufacturer’s instruction for RNA extraction. 1 microgram of RNA was used for cDNA preparation using Super script III reverse transcriptase for Q-PCR analysis. Q-PCRs were performed in a StepOne Plus Real Time PCR system thermo cycler (The applied bio systems) using 20 μl of PCR reaction containing 10 μL of SYBR Green mix (Roche), 1 μl of primer mix (10 μm), 2 μl of 1:10 diluted cDNA and 7 μl of water. Transcript levels were normalized to ACTIN2 transcript levels. Data was analyzed using the 2<bold>−ΔΔ</bold>CT method. A freely available online tool was used for analysis using an unpaired t-test of the RT-PCR results: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://graphpad.com/data-analysis-resource-center/.">http://graphpad.com/data-analysis-resource-center/.</ext-link> For p-value calculation, data entry format with mean, SD and N was used.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Cell type boundaries organize plant development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers and editors all agreed that this work focused on a long–standing issue of organ formation in plants and that the manuscript, using beautiful imaging and side–specific markers, presented convincing and high quality evidence for the presence of the boundary within the SAM and the influence of the location and form of this boundary on the position of leaf initiation, leaf polarity and the resulting leaf form. While this was appreciated, there was also a strong feeling from several reviewers that much of this, beautiful as it is, was largely confirmatory. In addition, there were concerns that some manipulations had technical issues (notably the long treatment with cocktails of auxin drugs) or use of multiple types of meristems that made the results somewhat ambiguous.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Caggiano et al., address a long–standing issue of organ formation in plants. How do leaves acquire their characteristic arrangement around the shoot meristem and their flattened shape with different ad/abaxial domains? Is there a signal from the meristem, or are organs pre–patterned based on information in the meristem? Using detailed live–cell imaging and a number of genetic and experimental manipulations, the authors argue for pre–patterning in the meristem of ad/ab genes (primarily HD–ZIPs and Kanadi's) and for in instructive role of auxin in defining cell identity, potentially by influencing the expression domains of REV and KAN.</p><p>Overall, this work was interesting, the imaging of gene expression patterns was impressive and the overall view of pattern formation seems reasonable. I particularly like the extension of models from their previous SAM work to accommodate the new data provided here. Also, the phenotypes and diagrams explaining their potential origin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are quite cool! The authors point out alternative conclusions about D/V pattern that come from recently published work in tomato. I am afraid I don't have the background to evaluate the difference between these studies.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Organ polarity is influenced by the organ placement relative to the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Several hypotheses have been proposed with respect to the nature of the positional information that directs organ polarity specification. One model suggests that pre–patterning in the SAM peripheral zone specifies the dorsal and ventral (abaxial and adaxial) sides of the leaf. In the current manuscript, using beautiful imaging and side–specific markers, the authors clearly show the existence of polarity within the peripheral zone of the SAM. They further show that the site of organ initiation is determined by the location of this dorsal–ventral boundary within the SAM. Alteration of this boundary by manipulation of the expression domain of KANADI, which promotes ventral identity, influences the initiation site. They further analyze the effect of auxin treatment and wounding on the placement of the boundary.</p><p>The manuscripts presents convincing and high quality evidence for the presence of the boundary within the SAM and the influence of the location and form of this boundary on the position of leaf initiation, leaf polarity and the resulting leaf form. The question is whether these findings are mainly confirmatory or bring new biological insights. The dependence of organ initiation and blade outgrowth on dorsal–ventral polarity has been shown before. It also has been shown that there is preexisting polarity within the peripheral zone of the SAM, but this manuscript shows it more clearly, including the pre–existing polar expression of ventral and dorsal determinants. The causal effect of auxin on this boundary is less convincing, as it is hard to tell how a combined NPA and auxin treatment or a treatment of a combination of 3 auxin biosynthesis and response inhibitors affects the different aspects of the process. The effect of these treatments is shown after a relatively long time, and these effects on the localization of the examined markers could result from an effect on the domain patterning within the SAM rather than an effect on REV expression.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Caggiano et al., address the question, how the dorso–ventral (DV) pattern of leaves is established. Using fluorescent protein reporters they show that DV patterning of leaves correlates with central–peripheral patterning of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The experimental data related to this paragraph are shown in 5 figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), of which many details are not addressed in the text. The novelty of this part is limited, because similar data have been published earlier (e.g. McConnell et al., 2001; reviewed by Barton et al., 2009).</p><p>Subsequently, the authors provide evidence that HD–ZIPIII and KAN genes repress leaf primordium initiation in the vegetative SAM. However, the question whether this is a direct influence on organ initiation or an indirect influence on SAM maintenance was not answered, because SAM organization in the arrested plants was not analyzed. Similar results were obtained by Kerstetter et al., 2001.</p><p>In the next paragraph, the consequences of ectopic KAN expression in the central domain of the SAM are studied. Most seedlings initiate several abnormal organs before their growth is arrested. The distinct organ phenotypes observed can be explained by the orientation of boundaries within organ founder cells.</p><p>Furthermore, the manuscript focuses on the interplay between auxin, HD–ZIPIII–expression and KAN–expression. Experiments using either NAA and NPA or a combination of auxinole, yuccasin and kyn led to the conclusion that high levels of auxin promote REV expression, whereas depletion of auxin promotes KAN expression. In this context, the treatment with a combination of three different drugs, which is necessary to see the described extension of KAN expression, may also have a different effect on gene expression than the one mediated through the observed depletion of auxin. The interplay of auxin, HD–ZIPIII expression and KAN–expression has also been addressed in previous studies (e.g. Izhaki and Bowman, 2007; Ilegems et al., 2010) with similar results.</p><p>In the last paragraph, the authors show that wounding in inflorescence meristems (IMs) leads to a depletion of auxin around the wound followed by an accumulation of KAN, which could be eliminated by an NAA + NPA treatment. Again, part of these findings were already known (Heisler et al., 2010; Landrein et al., 2015). In addition, IMs may react different from vegetative meristems.</p><p>Taken together, the manuscript presents a nice set of experiments supporting the view that DV organization of leaves is pre–patterned by the expression domains of REV and KAN in the SAM. However, previous studies revealed many similar results. Therefore, the study by Caggiano et al., presents only an incremental advance in our understanding.</p><p>Aiming for an explanation of the origin of DV patterning of leaves, it seems problematic to mix results from experiments using vegetative meristems and using inflorescence meristems, because a flower primordium is not a structure showing a DV pattern like a leaf primordium.</p><p>The wounding experiments offer an alternative explanation for the observations made by I. Sussex, but we think they do not rule out the existence of a signal from the main meristem to the developing leaf primordium.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cell type boundaries organize plant development&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior editor) and three reviewers (mix of new and previous), one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>There was, as in the first version, considerable appreciation of the imaging quality and evidence for a prepattern mechanism. There was also concern that the role of auxin in the process was not strongly supported by the provided data. Specifically, there was continued concern about the length of auxin treatments and the potential for KAN and REV responses to be secondary. Additionally, because the highest levels of auxin–signaling activity are found in the boundary region, but REV is precisely not expressed there, it was unclear what REV induction there by NPA+NAA treatment means. Moreover, how would this observation relate to a potential auxin–mediated maintenance of REV expression in the central region of the meristem, where there appears to be very little auxin–signaling activity?</p><p>After considerable deliberation, we have decided to consider a revised manuscript, IF it can address this critical concern about the proposed mechanism of auxin–mediated pre–patterning via REV activation and KAN repression. The misexpression of boundary genes (reviewer 1) could be one way to add more evidence, but alternative experiments would also be acceptable.</p><p>A revised version should also take care to tone down the discussion related to the &quot;Sussex signal&quot; because those experiments were done in floral meristems where the D/V polarity is limited. Ideally the issue would be addressed experimentally (e.g. using tomato apices), but the authors could also consider simply rewriting this section.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this revision, the authors have addressed my concerns about data presentation and have clarified many of the confusing passages of the previous version.</p><p>In this current version, I see that they have generated a very high resolution description of organ boundary gene expression and have a plausible model for auxin (though like most auxin models, there are enough feedbacks that it’s hard to find a way to experimentally disprove it). To my mind a manipulation in which they misexpress boundary genes in such a way that polarity becomes locally reoriented (something like making fly wing clones that create artificial boundaries) would be the real test of their models. It seems to me that reagents to do these experiments should be available, and I would be very supportive of this manuscript if such data could be added.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, Caggiano et al., address some of the concerns raised by the reviewers and explain and clarify the new findings presented in this paper. As before, the imaging is impressive and convincing with respect to the pre–patterning of in the polarity in the SAM and the causative role of the boundary in organ initiation.</p><p>The authors better clarify the reason for the use of multiple drugs to assess the role of auxin in the patterning. However, I still think that the presented data on the effect of auxin does not support the interpretation on the role of auxin in specifying the spatial patterning in the SAM periphery. The time from application to effect is still long, and the effect on KAN and REV may be secondary to other effects. Combined with the relatively broad application, the results in my opinion do not support the proposed mechanism of auxin–mediated pre–patterning via REV activation and KAN repression.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>This manuscript addresses a long–standing question in plant biology, the acquisition of dorso–ventral (DV; or adaxial/abaxial) polarity in plant leaves. The authors use fluorescence live imaging combined with transgenic manipulation of gene–expression domains and pharmacological treatments to characterize the role of the boundary region between dorsal and ventral gene–expression domains in the meristem in leaf–polarity acquisition. They confirm and provide further detail on the pre–pattern in the shoot meristem involving centrally expressed HD–ZIPIII and peripherally expressed KANADI1 genes, and show that the boundary between the two domains, where neither gene is expressed strongly, is the site of auxin convergence driven by PIN1 and the highest auxin–signaling activity. Overexpressing either REV or KAN1 throughout the meristem epidermis abolishes organ initiation, consistent with their documented role in suppressing auxin activity. Together this suggests that the auxin maxima can only form in the boundary domain to trigger organ outgrowth there. Forcing KAN1 expression in the meristem centre and thus creating a new DV boundary there can lead to leaf radialization or even polarity reversal, indicating that the pre–pattern in the meristem can have an instructive function for leaf DV polarity. Having demonstrated that the pattern of REV and KAN1 expression determines the pattern of auxin responsiveness in the meristem, the authors then ask whether auxin in turn influences the expression pattern of these genes. Treating meristems with NAA and NPA causes an increase in the REV expression domain into the boundary region and can prevent the re–establishment of KAN1 expression in the periphery separating an outgrowing primordium from the meristem; conversely, inhibiting auxin signaling leads to an encroachment of KAN1 expression towards the meristem centre. Lastly, the authors show that the previously demonstrated auxin depletion around wound sites leads to an upregulation of KAN1 expression around the wound. This latter observation is offered as an explanation for the leaf radialization seen after separating a leaf primordium from the meristem in Sussex' classical experiments.</p><p>How DV polarity in leaves is determined is a question of fundamental importance and broad interest in plant development. As the ongoing interest in the quest for the proposed Sussex signal indicates, the work presented is clearly highly timely. The manuscript provides a mix of rather confirmatory and novel results. Important novel aspects are the demonstration that disturbing the DV expression pre–pattern in the meristem can lead to leaf–polarity defects; the finding that auxin in turn can modulate this DV expression pre–pattern; and the observation that peripheral/abaxial identity is induced surrounding wounds in the meristem.</p><p>I have the following comments:</p><p>1) The finding of a likely causal role of the pre–pattern on leaf polarity is an important advance. Also, the observation that auxin can modulate the DV expression pattern is interesting, yet its biological significance appears somewhat unclear. As the authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and in their model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the highest levels of auxin–signaling activity are found in the boundary region. However, it is precisely there that REV is not expressed. Thus, what does it mean that REV can be induced there by NPA+NAA treatment? And how does this observation relate to a potential auxin–mediated maintenance of REV expression in the central region of the meristem, where there appears to be very little auxin–signaling activity? Have the authors attempted to incorporate the auxin effect on REV expression into their model? Does this provide any information about the possible significance of this interaction?</p><p>2) The alternative explanation offered for the effects of wounds separating a primordium from the meristem is novel, interesting and potentially of broad significance. However, its impact appears limited, as the KAN1 upregulation around the entire wound is currently only shown clearly for Arabidopsis inflorescence meristems (while the seedling meristems undergo more dramatic re–organization, making their behavior more difficult to interpret), where the action of a Sussex signal is hard to demonstrate due to the limited DV polarity of floral meristems. This means that the alternative explanation is not backed up by functional experiments. Ideally, the authors would directly test in a different system, such as the tomato apex, whether NAA+NPA treatment after appropriate wounding could prevent organ abaxialization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27421.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Organ polarity is influenced by the organ placement relative to the shoot apical meristem (SAM).

For instance, an extensive review published just recently on this exact topic by Cris Kuhlemeier and Marja Timmermans in Development pushes the Sussex signal idea. In this review they “postulate possible candidates for the ‘Sussex signal’ – the elusive meristem–derived factor that first ignited interest in this important developmental problem.” (Kuhlemeier and Timmermans, 2016).</p><p>Regarding other novel findings, our results on the role of auxin on REV and KAN expression are entirely new and provide great clarity for understanding exactly how dorsoventrality is established. We show that although there is a pre–pattern of dorsoventral gene activity in the SAM, this pattern is highly dynamic, being dependent on changing auxin levels and only becomes anchored to the cells when high auxin levels are present at organ inception. This finding reveals that auxin not only acts to trigger organ growth but also, that it plays a key role in establishing patterns of organ differentiation and the continuance of the dorsoventral boundary itself. We now provide extra data to back these conclusions (see below) and highlight it more clearly in the text and with our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>. Our unique high resolution data also enables us to propose the first explicit model based on known molecular players to explain how these boundaries actually work. We have added text to the intro and discussion as well as a diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) to highlight this point.</p><p>These points are reiterated in more detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The dependence of organ initiation and blade outgrowth on dorsal–ventral polarity has been shown before. It also has been shown that there is preexisting polarity within the peripheral zone of the SAM, but this manuscript shows it more clearly, including the pre–existing polar expression of ventral and dorsal determinants.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the previously published work on organ initiation / blade outgrowth and DV polarity, the very fact that the pre–pattern issue has not been settled confirms to us that the clues gained from these studies haven’t provided the clarity we need in order to know what’s really going on. For instance, one of the main figures from the recent Kuhlemeier and Timmermans review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) shows the rough expression domains of HD–ZIPIII and KAN in the SAM but the rest is simply a model they propose (Kuhlemeier and Timmermans, 2016). There are several errors including the proposal that KAN1 is excluded from the primordium initially. Many other reviews indicate no pre–pattern at all (e.g. (Kalve et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Nakata et al., 2012). Even when PIN1 and REV were examined at high resolution together in our previous paper (Heisler et al., 2005), we could only suggest that the DV boundary may be positioned by PIN1. Only now, by looking at KAN1 and testing the role of the boundary directly are we able to demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. the boundary influences where PIN1 localizes auxin.</p><p>In terms of functional data, Izhaki et al., (2007) shows through genetics that both KAN and HD–ZIPIII activities are required for repressing ectopic organogenesis (Izhaki and Bowman, 2007). However, the explanation given does not mention dorsoventral boundaries. Rather, the authors propose that the KAN genes control PIN1 expression and therefore auxin flow and that the HD–ZIPIIIs are seen as necessary for SAM formation. Ectopic organs therefore form because of aberrant auxin transport patterns and a missing SAM. This paper was published after the polar expression domains of KAN1 and REV in embryos were reported and yet no link was made between the positioning of organs and DV boundaries because the exact spatial relationship between these factors and PIN1 was not examined.</p><p>In contrast, our paper not only reports how all relevant factors relate spatially, but also, that the boundaries of the SAM are contiguous with that of the leaf and that, just as ectopic expression of REV and KAN blocks leaf blade growth, these factors also block leaf initiation. This has not been reported previously. We think this in itself is a major finding because now we can start to think of these seemingly distinct development processes as being not so different and controlled by one master patterning mechanism.</p><p>Besides concretely linking the activity of DV boundaries to organ formation, the high–resolution data we provide also forms the basis of a new hypothesis for how these boundaries actually work. By being able to see that PIN1 initiates organs specifically in a small gap between the REV and KAN domains and linking this with our other novel finding that HD–ZIPIII activity blocks organ initiation, we were able to present the first explicit model based on known molecular players to account for DV boundary activity. We feel this is a major step forward since we now have a testable hypothesis to help understand boundary function.</p><p>Additional major findings not reported previously include:</p><p>1) A new relationship between auxin and cell differentiation. In our revised version, we have further highlighted this discovery by adding additional data showing that the changes to REVKAN patterning in the inflorescence meristem caused by high auxin levels are even more dramatic in the vegetative meristem, where the reestablishment of KAN1 expression between the meristem and leaf can be completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–E</xref>).</p><p>2) Understanding how meristems reorganize themselves in response to wounds is a major question in plant development. So far, we know that factors such as WUS re–pattern themselves in response to wounds and we have models for how this occurs. However more recently it’s been discovered that wounding alters cell polarity and as a consequence, auxin becomes depleted around wounds. What has been missing then is an understanding of the functional consequence of this depletion. Our paper now reveals that such changes in auxin play a key role in enabling the meristem to re–pattern DV gene expression. This work also enables us to provide a novel, straightforward and parsimonious explanation for the observations that originally prompted Sussex’s inductive signaling hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, we feel strongly that the imaging data we provide does more than simply add detail to what is already published, it also reveals key features that lead to major new insights and discoveries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The causal effect of auxin on this boundary is less convincing, as it is hard to tell how a combined NPA and auxin treatment or a treatment of a combination of 3 auxin biosynthesis and response inhibitors affects the different aspects of the process. The effect of these treatments is shown after a relatively long time, and these effects on the localization of the examined markers could result from an effect on the domain patterning within the SAM rather than an effect on REV expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we note that there was an error in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> that stated that the combined drug treatment on the inflorescence meristem was over 48hrs. Instead, the period was 18 hours as we now make clearer in the text.</p><p>Secondly, we want to clarify that we do not try to make the case that auxin acts directly on REV. Rather, our aim is to show that auxin directly or indirectly promotes HD–ZIPIII expression and prevents KAN expression in cells not already expressing KAN. To build on this proposal we have now added additional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing that in the inflorescence meristem the response of REV and KAN1 to 2,4–D is identical to combined NAA and NPA treatment but over a shorter period of 24hrs. We have also tracked cells showing that while auxin promotes REV expression it does this only in cells not already expressing KAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–H</xref>). This leads to a firmer conclusion as to how polarity is established in organs and how this contrasts with what happens in between organs where auxin levels are low (see Discussion section).</p><p>Regarding the influence of the three drugs, we have added additional data to our paper showing that auxinole treatment alone causes a very mild version of the phenotype we see when adding all three drugs simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A and B</xref>). Importantly, as auxinole competes for the auxin binding pocket in TIR1, we think it makes perfect sense to add the auxin synthesis inhibitors as well to obtain a more extreme loss of auxin activity. We also note that the phenotype we obtain is exactly what you would might expect, i.e. low auxin levels and a “pin” apex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Caggiano et al., address the question, how the dorso–ventral (DV) pattern of leaves is established. Using fluorescent protein reporters they show that DV patterning of leaves correlates with central–peripheral patterning of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The experimental data related to this paragraph are shown in 5 figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), of which many details are not addressed in the text. The novelty of this part is limited, because similar data have been published earlier (e.g. McConnell et al., 2001; reviewed by Barton et al., 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>Although other studies have shown that the HD–ZIPIIIs are expressed centrally and that KAN1 and miR165/166 reporters are expressed peripherally, our aim here was to examine the precise spatio–temporal relationship between the patterning of these genes and organ initiation. In other words, where and when does organ initiation occur with respect to these patterns? None of the studies mentioned address this.</p><p>We find that organ initiation is centered precisely between the REV and KAN domains, which is a novel finding and suggests a pre–pattern that may function to control one aspect of organ positioning.</p><p>A similar effort to address the question of whether there is a pre–pattern or not for leaf dorsoventrality is the study by Tameshige et al., 2013 which addressed whether FIL is initially polarized with respect to leaf primordia or not. They concluded that FIL is initially not polar leading to the proposal that leaf primordia are not polarized to begin with (Tameshige et al., 2013). Our findings confirm their result for FIL but also show that FIL is the odd one out in this respect. We mention this just as an example to help illustrate that our findings with respect to leaf pre–patterning are novel. Further evidence is provided in or response to reviewer 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsequently, the authors provide evidence that HD–ZIPIII and KAN genes repress leaf primordium initiation in the vegetative SAM. However, the question whether this is a direct influence on organ initiation or an indirect influence on SAM maintenance was not answered, because SAM organization in the arrested plants was not analyzed. Similar results were obtained by Kerstetter et al., 2001.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we did not examine the expression of SAM markers, the central zone expresses HD–ZIPIII genes normally during its development. It is difficult to explain then how peripheral REV in the epidermis might shut down meristem growth. In fact, inflorescence apices ectopically expressing REV continue to grow vertically without a change in size as evidenced by the elongated “pin–like” phenotype. This also indicates that the SAM remains intact and functioning.</p><p>As for ectopic KAN1, we note in the paper that meristem arrest does occur. However, since we see the formation of a “pin” meristem when we activate KAN1 post–embryonically, this implies that organ formation stops prior to arrest of the meristem since stem tissue must have been produced while organs were not. We disagree with the reviewer that our results are similar to Kerstetter et al., (2001). Kerstetter et al., 2001 found that ectopic KAN1 gave rise to seedlings completely lacking a SAM (Kerstetter et al., 2001). This contrasts with our “pin” phenotype. However, this is not surprising given the contrasting methods to induce KAN1, i.e. our study does it post–embryonically and only in the epidermis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the next paragraph, the consequences of ectopic KAN expression in the central domain of the SAM are studied. Most seedlings initiate several abnormal organs before their growth is arrested. The distinct organ phenotypes observed can be explained by the orientation of boundaries within organ founder cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure how to respond to this as this comment corresponds to our stated conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the manuscript focuses on the interplay between auxin, HD–ZIPIII–expression and KAN–expression. Experiments using either NAA and NPA or a combination of auxinole, yuccasin and kyn led to the conclusion that high levels of auxin promote REV expression, whereas depletion of auxin promotes KAN expression. In this context, the treatment with a combination of three different drugs, which is necessary to see the described extension of KAN expression, may also have a different effect on gene expression than the one mediated through the observed depletion of auxin.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to reviewer 2 with regards to the auxin and drug treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interplay of auxin, HD–ZIPIII expression and KAN–expression has also been addressed in previous studies (e.g. Izhaki and Bowman, 2007; Ilegems et al., 2010) with similar results.</p></disp-quote><p>Neither of these papers examined the response of REV and KAN1 to auxin. Nor did they examine the response of auxin to ectopic REV. Rather, they examined the ectopic production of organs in HD–ZIPIII and KAN mutants (Izhaki and Bowman, 2007) as well as the response of vascular tissues to loss and gain of KAN expression (Ilegems et al., 2010). Regarding the Izhaki paper, please see our response to reviewer 2 above where we discuss this paper in detail. For the second paper, there is no overlap in experiments or major conclusions since this study focused on vascular formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the last paragraph, the authors show that wounding in inflorescence meristems (IMs) leads to a depletion of auxin around the wound followed by an accumulation of KAN, which could be eliminated by an NAA + NPA treatment. Again, part of these findings were already known (Heisler et al., 2010; Landrein et al., 2015). In addition, IMs may react different from vegetative meristems.</p></disp-quote><p>The major point of our ablations is not to demonstrate auxin depletion. It is to demonstrate a link between wound–induced auxin depletion and changes in REV and KAN1 expression. We start by citing those exact papers (Heisler et al., 2010; Landrein et al., 2015) as support for our hypothesis. We then repeat the experiment to monitor auxin depletion simply as a control to make sure the wounds are having the effect we expect in our particular context (i.e. without prior NPA treatment). Our major findings on the influence of wounds on REV and KAN expression and the role of auxin in this are completely novel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Taken together, the manuscript presents a nice set of experiments supporting the view that DV organization of leaves is pre–patterned by the expression domains of REV and KAN in the SAM. However, previous studies revealed many similar results. Therefore, the study by Caggiano et al., presents only an incremental advance in our understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to reviewer 2. The fact that the issue of a Sussex signal is still a major controversy after 70 years demonstrates that our study is highly relevant. We argue that our results are also conclusive in terms of the pre–pattern and further provide an explanation for the original observed wounding responses. Our paper also contains many other major new findings as described in more detail above and now better highlighted in the new version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aiming for an explanation of the origin of DV patterning of leaves, it seems problematic to mix results from experiments using vegetative meristems and using inflorescence meristems, because a flower primordium is not a structure showing a DV pattern like a leaf primordium.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We should have used the term “floral bract” rather than primordium and we have now done so. All our results so far indicate that the establishment of polarity for the cryptic bract is almost identical to that of leaves consistent with published data indicating that the initial structure is indeed leaf–like rather than a floral meristem. The floral meristem develops some time later, after polarity for the bract has already been established and therefore we do not think it relevant. In any case, most of our results are presented for both the inflorescence and vegetative meristem contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The wounding experiments offer an alternative explanation for the observations made by I. Sussex, but we think they do not rule out the existence of a signal from the main meristem to the developing leaf primordium.</p></disp-quote><p>At least for wounds, since KAN1 expression surrounds the wound regardless of its orientation with respect to the meristem, we maintain this is strong evidence against a meristem–oriented signal, as originally proposed by Sussex. The added evidence demonstrating the involvement of auxin provides a different and more parsimonious interpretation of Sussex’s experimental results. However, we agree that there are still important questions to be answered and write in our discussion that further experiments are required in tomato and other species.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re–review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this revision, the authors have addressed my concerns about data presentation and have clarified many of the confusing passages of the previous version.</p><p>In this current version, I see that they have generated a very high resolution description of organ boundary gene expression and have a plausible model for auxin (though like most auxin models, there are enough feedbacks that it’s hard to find a way to experimentally disprove it). To my mind a manipulation in which they misexpress boundary genes in such a way that polarity becomes locally reoriented (something like making fly wing clones that create artificial boundaries) would be the real test of their models. It seems to me that reagents to do these experiments should be available, and I would be very supportive of this manuscript if such data could be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for their positive comments. With regards to testing the model we propose using mosaics, we feel this is a major technical undertaking and would deserve to be presented in its own separate study. It is something we are working on for the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, Caggiano et al., address some of the concerns raised by the reviewers and explain and clarify the new findings presented in this paper. As before, the imaging is impressive and convincing with respect to the pre–patterning of in the polarity in the SAM and the causative role of the boundary in organ initiation.</p><p>The authors better clarify the reason for the use of multiple drugs to assess the role of auxin in the patterning. However, I still think that the presented data on the effect of auxin does not support the interpretation on the role of auxin in specifying the spatial patterning in the SAM periphery. The time from application to effect is still long, and the effect on KAN and REV may be secondary to other effects. Combined with the relatively broad application, the results in my opinion do not support the proposed mechanism of auxin–mediated pre–patterning via REV activation and KAN repression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now directly addressed these concerns with additional experiments. Firstly, we found that when auxin was applied to meristems on intact plants rather than plants in which the apices had been detached, the response of REV to exogenous auxin was much faster, starting within 6hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>) but becoming more obvious in less than 18hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Importantly, this exactly matches the wild type timing of events during regular development since REV expression visibly extends from the central zone into developing primordia a plastochron later than when PIN1 and DR5 mark these primordia (Heisler et al., 2005), i.e. around a 12hr delay.</p><p>As with the previous version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> we also show that auxin treatment inhibits the reestablishment of KAN1 in between primordia and the meristem (yellow and white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10, I and J</xref> compared to control K and L).</p><p>Regarding the timing for KAN1, during regular development, KAN1 expression is well established by stage P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), around 1 plastochron (approx. 12hrs) after auxin is depleted in boundary regions at stage P1 (the primordia are staged according to Heisler et al., 2005 based on the time of PIN1 polarity reversal). Hence it is to be expected that any induction of KAN1 in response to low auxin levels will take a similar length of time, which is entirely consistent with the results of our auxin depletion experiments (i.e. 18hrs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>Our data also suggest that once auxin depletion has occurred, cells are committed to expressing KAN1 even if auxin levels subsequently increase. This is indicated by the finding that exogenous auxin treatment cannot prevent the onset of KAN1 expression if auxin is applied at the P1 stage (when auxin has already been depleted in the surrounding cells – blue arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I and J</xref>). This is in contrast to applying auxin at the i1 and i2 stages when PIN1 reversal and auxin depletion have not occurred yet (white and yellow arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10 I and J</xref> compared to controls K and L).</p><p>To further show that auxin acts locally to influence the expression domains of both REV and KAN1 in the periphery we applied auxin locally to pin1 mutant meristems and found that the response of REV and KAN1 is also local (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we now also present data showing that neither auxin addition nor depletion obviously influence meristem patterning overall as evidenced by the central zone marker CLV3, indicating a more direct influence on primordium patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s3">Figure 12—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Again, we want to emphasize that the conclusions of our paper do not depend on REV and KAN being direct auxin targets and therefore that they must respond extremely rapidly (e.g. 30mins) to auxin. Accordingly, given the timing, we have now explicitly stated in our discussion that the regulation of these genes by auxin is likely to be indirect (Discussion section). At the same time however, our data do show that auxin modulates their expression patterns locally in the periphery and reasonably rapidly, and that this regulation is relevant to wound response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>This manuscript addresses a long–standing question in plant biology, the acquisition of dorso–ventral (DV; or adaxial/abaxial) polarity in plant leaves. The authors use fluorescence live imaging combined with transgenic manipulation of gene–expression domains and pharmacological treatments to characterize the role of the boundary region between dorsal and ventral gene–expression domains in the meristem in leaf–polarity acquisition. They confirm and provide further detail on the pre–pattern in the shoot meristem involving centrally expressed HD–ZIPIII and peripherally expressed KANADI1 genes, and show that the boundary between the two domains, where neither gene is expressed strongly, is the site of auxin convergence driven by PIN1 and the highest auxin–signaling activity. Overexpressing either REV or KAN1 throughout the meristem epidermis abolishes organ initiation, consistent with their documented role in suppressing auxin activity. Together this suggests that the auxin maxima can only form in the boundary domain to trigger organ outgrowth there. Forcing KAN1 expression in the meristem centre and thus creating a new DV boundary there can lead to leaf radialization or even polarity reversal, indicating that the pre–pattern in the meristem can have an instructive function for leaf DV polarity. Having demonstrated that the pattern of REV and KAN1 expression determines the pattern of auxin responsiveness in the meristem, the authors then ask whether auxin in turn influences the expression pattern of these genes. Treating meristems with NAA and NPA causes an increase in the REV expression domain into the boundary region and can prevent the re–establishment of KAN1 expression in the periphery separating an outgrowing primordium from the meristem; conversely, inhibiting auxin signaling leads to an encroachment of KAN1 expression towards the meristem centre. Lastly, the authors show that the previously demonstrated auxin depletion around wound sites leads to an upregulation of KAN1 expression around the wound. This latter observation is offered as an explanation for the leaf radialization seen after separating a leaf primordium from the meristem in Sussex' classical experiments.</p><p>How DV polarity in leaves is determined is a question of fundamental importance and broad interest in plant development. As the ongoing interest in the quest for the proposed Sussex signal indicates, the work presented is clearly highly timely. The manuscript provides a mix of rather confirmatory and novel results. Important novel aspects are the demonstration that disturbing the DV expression pre–pattern in the meristem can lead to leaf–polarity defects; the finding that auxin in turn can modulate this DV expression pre–pattern; and the observation that peripheral/abaxial identity is induced surrounding wounds in the meristem.</p><p>I have the following comments:</p><p>1) The finding of a likely causal role of the pre–pattern on leaf polarity is an important advance. Also, the observation that auxin can modulate the DV expression pattern is interesting, yet its biological significance appears somewhat unclear. As the authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and in their model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the highest levels of auxin–signaling activity are found in the boundary region. However, it is precisely there that REV is not expressed. Thus, what does it mean that REV can be induced there by NPA+NAA treatment? And how does this observation relate to a potential auxin–mediated maintenance of REV expression in the central region of the meristem, where there appears to be very little auxin–signaling activity? Have the authors attempted to incorporate the auxin effect on REV expression into their model? Does this provide any information about the possible significance of this interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 4 for their positive comments.</p><p>Regarding the location of auxin signalling and REV expression, we note that during normal development REV expression extends into the boundary region that normally separates REV and KAN1 a plastochron after PIN1 upregulation. We apologize as this was not properly described in association with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> previously and so we have now added more text and a sup figure to fully detail this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement. 1). As can be seen from the new supplementary figure, the size of the gap shrinks initially as REV expression increases and extends but then becomes more apparent at later stages. Hence our treatments with NPA+NAA recapitulate the initial extension and increase in REV expression observed during the early stages of primordium development.</p><p>What does this regulation by auxin mean? The first point of significance is that we show that auxin acts to establish as well as maintain proper DV cell type patterning in new primordia. This is a new role for auxin that is distinct to its well–known function in organ initiation. This role is difficult to uncover because if you take auxin away you don’t get a primordium. Only by depleting auxin after organs have initiated and observing with time–lapse are we able to come to this conclusion. The second point of significance is in relation to the next section where we link the regulation of REV/KAN by auxin to wounding.</p><p>Regarding the central zone, an important point is that while REV/KAN expression depends on auxin in the meristem periphery, our experiments show that in the central zone, this is not the case. REV is maintained in the central zone no matter how much we deplete auxin. Thus, we conclude that the regulation of REV/KAN in the meristem central zone occurs via a distinct, auxin independent pathway. Hence only once cells move out of the central zone into the periphery, do high auxin levels become important for maintaining REV and repressing KAN. We have tried to make this conclusion clearer in the relevant Results section and Discussion section.</p><p>Regarding incorporating auxin regulation of REV/KAN in the modelling, this has begun. However, the modelling is still inconclusive at this point since it lacks certain features we feel are necessary to fully test our ideas, such as localized cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The alternative explanation offered for the effects of wounds separating a primordium from the meristem is novel, interesting and potentially of broad significance. However, its impact appears limited, as the KAN1 upregulation around the entire wound is currently only shown clearly for Arabidopsis inflorescence meristems (while the seedling meristems undergo more dramatic re–organization, making their behavior more difficult to interpret), where the action of a Sussex signal is hard to demonstrate due to the limited DV polarity of floral meristems. This means that the alternative explanation is not backed up by functional experiments. Ideally, the authors would directly test in a different system, such as the tomato apex, whether NAA+NPA treatment after appropriate wounding could prevent organ abaxialization.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that further experiments in other species would increase the impact of the current work, we also feel that this would represent a major long–term project in itself. Therefore, at this stage, we have rewritten our discussion of these results to further highlight these concerns (Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
