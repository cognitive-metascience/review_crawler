Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to a WCV were characterised by applying longitudinally-sampled sera, available from 35 adult placebo-controlled phase I trial participants, to a panproteome microarray. Despite individuals maintaining distinctive antibody ‘fingerprints’, responses were consistent across vaccinated cohorts. Seventy-two functionally distinct proteins were associated with WCV-induced increases in IgG binding. These shared characteristics with naturally immunogenic proteins, being enriched for transporters and cell wall metabolism enzymes, likely unusually exposed on the unencapsulated WCV’s surface. Vaccine-induced responses were specific to variants of the diverse PclA, PspC and ZmpB proteins, whereas PspA- and ZmpA-induced antibodies recognised a broader set of alleles. Temporal variation in IgG levels suggested a mixture of anamnestic and novel responses. These reproducible increases in IgG binding to a limited, but functionally diverse, set of conserved proteins indicate WCV could provide species-wide immunity.</p><p>Clinical trial registration: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier NCT01537185; the results are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01537185">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01537185</ext-link>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a bug that causes pneumonia and meningitis, killing around a million people each year.

The earliest recorded pneumococcal vaccinations consisted of two doses of heat-killed pneumococci cultured from the sputum of pneumonia patients, which resulted in limited protection against pneumococcal infections for a few months after inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maynard, 1915</xref>). Later pneumococcal vaccines used purified capsule polysaccharides, of which there are almost 100 immunologically distinguishable variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2006</xref>), termed ‘serotypes’. These formulations expanded from a bivalent formulation in the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekwurzel et al., 1938</xref>) to include 23 capsular polysaccharides by the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mufson et al., 1985</xref>). Such formulations afford little protection to infants, however, as polysaccharides are T-cell-independent antigens that are not efficiently recognised by the immature adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein, 1992</xref>). Therefore, the most commonly used pneumococcal vaccines at present are protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCVs), currently containing up to 13 different polysaccharides, each attached to a carrier protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nunes and Madhi, 2011</xref>). These vaccines elicit protective immune responses, even in young children, which prevent nasopharyngeal carriage as well as disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The intrinsic disadvantage of PCVs is the limited number of serotypes against which they provide protection, resulting in serotype replacement disease that reduces their impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weinberger et al., 2011</xref>). The further expansion of their valency is limited by the complexity of their manufacture, which also makes them costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ray, 2002</xref>). Therefore, efforts have continued to develop alternative vaccines that are cheaper, generate T-cell-dependent responses to non-capsular antigens, and afford protection against all pneumococci. Whole cell-based vaccines (WCVs) present a possible solution, as they can be relatively inexpensively manufactured and present an almost full complement of antigens to the recipient’s immune system. Rather than the historical precedent of killed clinical isolates, the WCV used in this study is a specifically engineered version of the unencapsulated strain <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> RM200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2010b</xref>).</p><p>A randomised double-blind phase I safety and immunogenicity trial of this WCV in 42 healthy U.S. adults was designed to compare four cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One received placebo saline injections, while the other three received 100 μg, 300 μg or 600 μg doses of the pneumococcal WCV adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Each individual was given three injections 28 days apart, and serum samples were taken pre-vaccination and at 28, 56 and 84 days subsequent to the first injection to assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses. To quantify the potential multiplicity of immune responses, a set of available samples were analysed with a panproteome microarray including over 2100 probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>), most of which corresponded to full-length proteins, with others representing fragments of larger polypeptides. This provides information on responses to proteins encoded by the core and accessory genome, as well as multiple variants of diverse core loci (DCL), corresponding to genes that can be identified in almost all isolates based on their location in the chromosome and the domain structure of the translated protein, but which exhibit little detectable sequence similarity across the species. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, four such loci encode pneumococcal surface proteins A (PspA) and C (PspC), and the zinc metalloproteases A (ZmpA) and B (ZmpB). This study therefore aimed to identify the range and types of antigens to which IgG responses were mounted following WCV administration, and how these might vary between individuals. The availability of longitudinal samples from multiple trial participants also offered the opportunity to study differences between individuals’ antibody repertoires. Finally, the trial structure allowed the kinetics of responses to successive doses of different concentrations to be to quantified. These analyses should provide information on whether the WCV is likely to consistently induce antibodies capable of recognising antigens conserved across <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow chart describing the analysed samples.</title><p>Forty-two healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to either a placebo control group, or one of three cohorts receiving different doses of the WCV, in a double-blind phase I trial.

Twenty recombinations distinguishing the pair were identified, one of which represented reversible inversion at a phase variable locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croucher et al., 2014</xref>). The generation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> SIII-N, an intermediate genotype expressing the mucoid serotype three capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ravin, 1959</xref>), likely accounts for eighteen of these recombinations, which span a total of 101 kb in the RM200 genome and include a recombination importing the serotype three capsule polysaccharide synthesis (<italic>cps</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). RM200 was derived from Rx1, a spontaneous mutant of SIII-N that no longer expressed a capsule. Correspondingly, the <italic>cps</italic> locus contains two candidate mutations potentially responsible for this phenotype. An Arg<sub>320</sub>Cys substitution in the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase protein replaces a catalytically-important arginine, which binds a pyrophosphate moiety, with a cysteine, which could interfere with the active site thiol group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, the phosphoglucomutase protein has an Asn<sub>146</sub>Thr substitution that disrupts a Ser-His-Asn motif involved in divalent cation coordination, which is conserved across many orthologues (NCBI conserved domain cd05799).</p><p>A subsequently-introduced recombination represents further engineering to replace the <italic>lytA</italic> gene with the Janus cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sung et al., 2001</xref>), to reduce virulence and improve the yield of cells from culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2010b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alteration of the pneumolysin toxin gene was not associated with an inferred recombination, as only three bases were substituted, in order to remove the protein’s cytolytic and complement-activating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2010b</xref>). This change also resulted in insertion of the pDP28 shuttle vector (accession code KJ395591) at the adjacent site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Other than these known alterations, there were no large structural changes to the RM200 genome. The cryptic pDP1 plasmid of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 was retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oggioni et al., 1999</xref>), and the large adhesin PclA was still present, but the glycoprotein PsrP, both known pneumococcal pili, and degradative zinc metalloprotease ZmpC were absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>). None of the DCL were affected by the recombinations, and consequently they were all similar to the alleles in D39. However, there was a nonsense mutation in the <italic>pspC</italic> gene which removed six of the eight choline-binding domains (CBDs), which may reduce the proportion of this protein attached to the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stable antibody ‘fingerprints’ of vaccinated individuals</title><p>Overall, 130 samples were studied from 35 of the 42 trial participants: all four timepoints were analysed for 27 individuals, at least the initial and final samples were available for a further two people, and at least one timepoint was analysed for a further six people (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Of these, 35 samples were from the placebo group, 32 from cohort 1 (100 μg dose), 29 from cohort 2 (300 μg dose), and 34 from cohort 3 (600 μg dose). Each sample was treated as a biological replicate. No technical replicates were included, as analysis of pilot data obtained using a smaller version of the array found reproducible differences between individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested results were consistent between array assays of samples from the same individual, and that the study should span the maximal number of trial participants, as between-individual variation might be an important factor in understanding the response to the WCV. To visualise the relative importance of these differences between trial participants, the IgG binding across all probes for each sample was projected in two dimensions using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which clusters together similar sets of multidimensional data. This revealed individuals had a distinctive antibody ‘fingerprint’ that was generally preserved over the course of the trial, independent of vaccination dose. A similar pattern was observed when the DCL were excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), or when only probes from core proteins conserved across related streptococcal species were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, these fingerprints do not appear to reflect individuals’ distinctive histories of exposure to variable proteins, but instead unique patterns of IgG responses to common antigens. These were sufficiently robust not to be disrupted by WCV administration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Variation in the immune profiles of trial participants.</title><p>The IgG-binding data for each sample were projected across two dimensions using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding.

These two independent experiments provided an estimate of the variation between technical replicates, although the differences in the array designs means there is substantial systematic variation between them. The Pearson correlation (R<sup>2</sup>) was calculated between all pairwise comparisons from the two sets of replicates, and the overall distribution for different types of comparison shown as violin plots for (<bold>A</bold>) all probes and (<bold>B</bold>) the 1165 immunoreactive probes (a maximum IgG binding of at least one across the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 probes from the panproteome dataset).

Restricting this analysis to the antibody-binding targets (ABTs), defined as those proteins associated with high IgG binding in the pre-vaccination sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>), also failed to detect overall heterogeneity in the distribution of individuals’ median Δ<sub>0→84</sub> between the groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>N</italic> = 29, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.63, df = 3, p = 0.20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>However, an ANOVA test of the fits of linear mixed effects models of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> across probes (considered fixed effects) and individuals (considered random effects) found a significant improvement when cohort was also included as a fixed effect (χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.96, df = 3, p = 0.030; see Materials and methods). To test whether this reflected biologically uninformative changes in the responses to poorly immunogenic proteins, this analysis was repeated using only the 1,584 ‘immunoreactive’ probes, to which an IgG binding of at least one (i.e. twice the background level) was detected across the dataset.

Hence the WCV did have a detectable effect on vaccinated cohorts when considering per-probe, rather than per-individual, data. Combined with the observation that unique antibody fingerprints were maintained throughout the trial, this suggests the WCV either elevated responses to only a subset of proteins, or uniformly boosted multiple anamnestic responses in only a subset of individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>WCV elicits elevated IgG to a specific minority of proteins</title><p>Comparing the within-cohort medians of pre-vaccine IgG binding and Δ<sub>0→84</sub> across all probes provided a simple approach to judging the relative contributions of these alternative explanations. If there were a broad response in only some individuals, the median Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values would not be expected to vary much across probes, except for a general rise with higher pre-vaccine antibody binding, if this correlated with the strength of immunological memory. Alternatively, a strong response to only a subset of probes across individuals should result in much greater variation in within-cohort median Δ<sub>0→84</sub>. The plots revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between pre-vaccine-binding strength and post-vaccine rise for the three vaccinated groups (Pearson correlation coefficient, p &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup> for each), as expected for a uniform rise in IgG binding if many anamnestic responses were upregulated. By contrast, a negative correlation was evident in the placebo recipients, possibly representing regression to the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Yet these general increasing trends for the vaccinated cohorts were small compared to the large increases in IgG binding to a particular subset of antigens.

These tests consistently showed ABTs were disproportionately associated with increased IgG binding post-vaccination, although the absolute numbers indicate many ABTs did not trigger a substantial response. The distinction between those proteins to which there was little reaction, and those eliciting large increases in IgG binding post-WCV, was generally consistent both within cohorts and between vaccinated cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>), suggesting these specific reactions to ABTs were not stochastic, nor driven by variation between individuals’ pre-existing antibody profiles.</p><p>These results may represent WCV-induced responses being limited to those components of the panproteome that are similar to proteins expressed by RM200. To test this hypothesis, an amino acid sequence identity threshold of at least 90% between array and RM200 proteins was empirically determined from the distribution of pairwise sequence identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Excluding all DCL variants, 1602 proteins (corresponding to 1647 probes) could be matched to RM200 proteins with a similarity above the 90% threshold, while 455 proteins (corresponding to 476 probes) lacked a close orthologue in RM200. Using these two categories to represent epitopes present and absent from the WCV respectively, a comparison of the median Δ<sub>0→84</sub> using a Wilcoxon rank sum test found no significant difference in the post-WCV changes in IgG binding in cohort three between these sets of probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel; Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>N</italic> = 2,123, <italic>W</italic> = 403523, p = 0.33). However, an analogous test restricted to ABTs found significantly stronger antibody rises (Δ<sub>0→84</sub>) associated with the 70 ABTs with a close orthologue in RM200 (corresponding to 87 probes) relative to the 25 ABTs absent from the strain (corresponding to 40 probes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel; Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>N</italic> = 127, <italic>W</italic> = 970, p = 6.5×10<sup>−5</sup>).

This may mean these proteins’ greater Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values could be the result of the array being more sensitive to IgG adapted to recognising comparatively invariant antigens. However, a comparison of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> and sequence divergence between the WCV and proteins on the array failed to find evidence of a general correlation between Δ<sub>0→84</sub> and lower sequence divergence between the array proteins and RM200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Immune responses to more conserved proteins could also result from encounters with the related commensal streptococci <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae</italic>. However, the overall distribution of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> for ABTs conserved in these other species was not significantly higher than to those ABTs exhibiting greater interspecies divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). There was also no significant difference in the pre-vaccination IgG binding to ABTs in the WCV (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>W</italic> = 1455, p = 0.20), nor to those conserved in <italic>S. mitis</italic> and <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae</italic> (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>W</italic> = 937, p = 0.62; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting recent immune priming through asymptomatic carriage of naturally unencapsulated streptococci is unlikely to play a major role in determining the immunity induced by WCV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Consistent identification of antigens by complementary statistical analyses</title><p>Rather than relying on a threshold value of Δ<sub>0→84</sub>, two approaches commonly used in the analysis of transcriptome data were employed to identify which proteins elicited statistically significant IgG responses. Only the 1584 immunoreactive probes were included in each, to avoid analysis of changes unlikely to have biological relevance. Firstly, an empirical Bayes (eBayes) analysis, which calculates probabilities relative to a prior distribution estimated from the dataset itself, was applied to pairwise contrasts of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> across immunoreactive proteins in each of the vaccinated cohorts against the same metric in the placebo group. By only using two timepoints, data from 29 individuals could be included. A Benjamini-Hochberg correction adjusting for 1584 tests, with an expected false discovery rate of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), identified 88 probes as having significant Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values in the comparison of the placebo group with cohort 3, who received the highest dose of the WCV. The magnitudes of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> in this cohort are compared with the statistical significance of this change relative to the placebo group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. After the correction for multiple testing, no probes were associated with significant changes in IgG binding in the comparisons of the placebo group with cohorts 1 or 2.</p><p>Secondly, a linear mixed effects model (LMM) was used to interpret the IgG binding at each timepoint as a noisy linear response to random effects, corresponding to the different trial participants, and two sets of fixed effects, corresponding to the dose of vaccine and number of injections received. This maximised the information extracted from the complete longitudinal time series, but was limited to the 20 individual trial participants in the three vaccinated cohorts for whom these data were available. Likelihood ratio tests were then used to identify proteins that elicited IgG responses that significantly increased with dose or with number of immunisations. After a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing, none of the proteins showed a significant dose-response. This is likely due to the anomalous behaviour of cohort 2, in which the overall changes in IgG were smaller than those for cohort 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). By contrast, 127 probes showed a significant change in IgG binding with repeated immunisations, with all but one of these probes exhibiting increased IgG binding over the course of the trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Of these, 77 were also significant in the eBayes analysis of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, this combination of using all individuals for whom initial and final paired samples were available, as well as the full longitudinal data for vaccinated individuals, identified a total of 138 probes to which IgG binding changed significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These were highly consistent with the 129 probes identified by applying the empirically-derived threshold to Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values from cohort three in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Sixty of the 138 probes represented DCL variants; to test whether the inclusion of this allelic variation affected the model fitting or multiple correction testing, the eBayes and LMM analyses were repeated using the 1384 immunoreactive non-DCL probes. This found 74 of the 78 non-DCL probes were still associated with significant rises in IgG binding if the DCL were excluded from the analyses, with no extra hits being detected, indicating these results were generally robust to changes in the set of probes assayed on the array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Accounting for those probes that represented different regions of large proteins, the 138 probes came from 112 distinct protein sequences, of which 59.8% were identified by both eBayes and LMM approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Hence the statistical analyses provide a consistent view of the most immunogenic proteins in the WCV.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.028</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Description of WCV antigenic proteins, represented by probes associated with significantly increased IgG binding following WCV administration by either the empirical Bayes or linear mixed effects analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</title><p>Each protein is listed (either by common name, or COG assignation), alongside a functional annotation and the coding sequence for the orthologue in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39, where it could be identified.

putative antigens were from the 208 ABTs previously defined using the pre-vaccination timepoint (63.4%; a 6.16-fold enrichment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>). This represented a significant enrichment of ABTs relative to the other immunoreactive proteins (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>N</italic> = 1,443, p &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>). When limited to the 1062 immunoreactive proteins exhibiting at least 90% similarity between the WCV and the array, ABTs accounted for 39 of 71 significant increases in IgG binding (54.9%; a 16.01-fold enrichment), and 34 of the 991 proteins not associated with such an increase (3.43%; Fisher’s exact test, <italic>N</italic> = 1,062, p &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>). Hence this highlights not just the importance of ABTs in the immune response to the WCV, but also the failure of some ABTs to trigger significantly elevated IgG binding, despite the array being appropriately constructed to detect such a response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Therefore, the subset of proteins exhibiting significant and reproducible increases in binding following WCV administration were functionally characterised to identify the properties associated with immunogenic proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Diverse functional characteristics of proteins eliciting IgG responses</title><p>The most statistically significant increase in IgG binding identified by the eBayes analysis was the only probe that did not correspond to a particular protein, but instead was an oligomer of choline-binding domains (CBDs). This common motif, by which multiple pneumococcal proteins adhere to the cell surface via the cell wall polysaccharide, was found to be a protein domain common in ABTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Previous data suggested such domains could be immunogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giefing et al., 2008</xref>), but the consistent rise in IgG binding observed in this trial corresponded to a small increase on a low baseline.</p><p>Excluding the CBD oligomer and grouping together orthologous variants, the 112 WCV antigens identified by the eBayes and LMM analyses were found to correspond to 72 functionally distinct proteins, of which all but four could be attributed to sequences in the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> RM200 genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 and 2</xref>). A multivariable analysis of the functional characteristics distinguishing the immunogenic proteins from those in the WCV not provoking an elevated IgG response was used to test whether these antigens were enriched for particular functional or structural characteristics. This did not identify CBDs as a marker of antigenicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting CBD-binding IgG did not elevate the overall antibody response to all proteins containing this motif. Nevertheless, such antibodies could potentially explain one inconsistency, in which the LMM identified elevated IgG binding to the lytic amidase LytA, despite only a 15 aa N-terminal fragment remaining in the RM200 strain used for immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could be attributed to the multiple CBDs of LytA on the array being the epitope recognised by vaccine-induced antibodies. Another protein associated with an elevated IgG response, pneumolysin (CLS01670), seems to have caused a measureable response despite small modifications to remove its cytolytic activity in the WCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2010b</xref>).</p><p>The multivariable analysis of protein characteristics found a significant association between increased IgG binding and signal peptides, which direct proteins for export across the cell membrane (odds ratio = 6.76, p = 1.38×10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This corresponded with the strong immune responses to many surface-associated proteins. Excepting the transcriptional regulator, FrlR (CLS00137), the greatest Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values were measured for three conserved surface-exposed proteins: a pre-protein translocase YajC (CLS01753), a protease regulator HflC (CLS01867), and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PpiA (CLS00702), the only one of these four proteins to register as an ABT in the pre-vaccination sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Another ABT involved in maintaining surface proteins’ conformation, the foldase PpmA (CLS00885), was identified as eliciting an IgG response by the LMM analysis.</p><p>Other protein motifs showing similarly strong associations in the multivariable analysis included the Transpeptidase domain, associated with peptidoglycan remodelling, and the SBP_bac_3 domain, associated with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter solute-binding proteins (SBPs), which bind exogenous substrates and deliver them to cognate permeases for import into the cell. Accordingly, a broad functional categorisation found cell wall metabolism proteins and SBPs were similarly represented in the WCV antigens as in pre-vaccination ABTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>), whereas relatively few vaccine-induced responses were observed to adhesins and surface-associated degradative enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>WCV-induced responses to transporter proteins</title><p>Of the 27 SBPs in the RM200 genome, 25 were among the 1062 proteins that were immunoreactive and highly similar between the WCV strain and the panproteome array. Eleven of the 25 (44.0%) provoked a substantial increase in IgG binding, relative to 60 of the 1037 non-SBPs, an 7.60-fold enrichment representing their significant contribution to the WCV response (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>N</italic> = 1,062, p = 1.16×10<sup>−7</sup>). SBPs were enriched in the subset of ABTs triggering significant further IgG rises, accounting for eleven of the 71 ABTs (15.5%; a 3.54-fold enrichment) identified as immunogenic by the eBayes or LMM analyses, but only six of the 137 ABTs (4.38%) not associated with a significant increase (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>N</italic> = 208, p = 0.014). Two of the ABT SBPs triggering a post-WCV rise in IgG binding were the siderophore transporters PiaA and PiuA, which have been considered as potential protein vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jomaa et al., 2006</xref>). Seven other immunogenic SBPs bound amino acids or peptides for import by ABC transporters. These included a large increase in IgG recognising TcyA (CLS00206; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and rises to the glutamine-binding proteins GlnH (CLS01210), GlnPH4 (CLS01088) and GlnPH1 (CLS00459), only the former two of which were classified as ABTs in the pre-vaccination data. Nevertheless, other SBPs strongly recognised by natural immunity showed no sign of increased IgG binding following vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Other transporter proteins eliciting a significant elevation in IgG binding were FruA (CLS00796), the substrate-recognising IIC subunit of a fructose-specific phosphotransferase system importer, and protein CLS02831 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), a bacteriocin exporter present in RM200 but only found in 29% of the pneumococcal population of Massachusetts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croucher et al., 2013a</xref>). Another bacteriocin protein to induce elevated IgG binding was the secreted CibA competence-induced bacteriocin, suggesting at least some of the pneumococci were in the ‘X state’ when killed prior to inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claverys and Håvarstein, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>WCV-induced responses to cell wall metabolism proteins</title><p>Sixteen of the 25 previously-defined ABTs (64.0%) involved in cell wall metabolism were among the 71 ABTs provoking a significant increase in IgG binding by at least one of the statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>), corresponding to a 3.43-fold enrichment (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>N</italic> = 208, p = 0.0014). Additionally, four functionally similar proteins that were not classified as ABTs on the basis of pre-vaccination immune responses elicited significantly elevated IgG binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As well as Pbp1B (CLS01817), these included variants of the Pbp1A protein, which, along with Pbp2B and Pbp2X, have diverged under selection for resistance to β-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croucher et al., 2013a</xref>). The penicillin-binding protein sequences in RM200 are most similar to the ancestral, β-lactam sensitive variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). While there were subtle differences in the immune response to different variants of all three of these proteins, both the dose response and maximum increase in IgG binding were similar for each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">Figure 4—figure supplement 11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Specificity of WCV antibody responses to polymorphic proteins</title><p>Loci exhibiting higher levels of divergence correspondingly provided greater evidence of variant-specific immune responses. Two of the adhesins to which elevated IgG binding was detected were variants of the PclA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paterson et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s12">Figure 4—figure supplement 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These were the most similar functional variants to the PclA sequence in the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> RM200 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s13">Figure 4—figure supplement 13</xref>), with a truncated version (CLS99466) and two divergent full-length proteins (CLS03178 and CLS03616) not showing similar increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s14">Figure 4—figure supplement 14</xref>). No increased IgG binding to pilus subunits or serine-rich glycoproteins was observed, in keeping with their absence from the RM200 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s14">Figure 4—figure supplement 14</xref>). These data are consistent with both allelic divergence, and absence of antigens encoded by genomic islands, being an effective means of pneumococcal strains evading adaptive immune responses induced by colonisation with genetically-distinct strains.</p><p>The proteins represented by the greatest number of variants on the array were pneumococcal surface proteins A and C, encoded by the DCL <italic>pspA</italic> and <italic>pspC</italic>. The array contained no variant highly similar to RM200’s PspA or PspC sequences. Nevertheless, a subset of the variants of each showed a significant increase in IgG binding that was most pronounced in cohort 3, and absent from the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). These changes are unlikely to be non-specific responses caused by IgG recognising the CBDs of these proteins, as the variants identified as immunogenic contained a lower mean number of CBDs (5.58 for PspA, 6.00 for PspC) than the average number of such domains across all variants on the array (6.97 for PspA, 6.17 for PspC). However, this induced response was also not simply related to sequence divergence across the rest of the protein. For PspA, IgG binding rose against multiple variants, consistent with previous data suggesting broadly protective anti-PspA immunity can be induced by immunisation with a single variant, despite the diversity of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nabors et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tart et al., 1996</xref>). By contrast, the response to PspC was only strongly evident to variant 42, which had an intermediate level of sequence similarity to the PspC of RM200 compared to other variants on the array. This observation could not be attributed to cross-reactivity with PspA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks-Walter et al., 1999</xref>), as this PspC allele is not closely related to the WCV PspA. Hence this may represent a relatively poor immune response to PspC, owing to its weakened association with the cell surface following the loss of some of its CBDs, that triggers recognition of a specific epitope unique to variant 42.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.029</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Changes in IgG binding to diverse core loci.</title><p>Each heatmap has a row for each of the 29 trial participants with samples at the start and end of the trial, ordered by cohort.

These were associated with comparatively low pre-WCV antibody responses. The pre-vaccination IgG binding to these probes, and to the 112 probes to which a substantial rise was detected after the first dose, was compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. This found these late-responding probes to have a significantly lower level of pre-vaccination IgG binding (median 1.43; <italic>N</italic> = 139, <italic>W</italic> = 2116.5, p = 0.0013). These kinetics probably represent the slower development of a primary immune response to proteins not eliciting antibodies prior to WCV administration. Such reactivity was typically associated with the set of proteins with diverse functional annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), not falling into the main functional categories associated with natural immunity. The largest changes were for the pre-protein translocase subunit YajC and the intracellular transcriptional regulator FrlR, neither of which showed high levels of IgG binding in the pre-vaccination samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), as well as the surface-exposed peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PpiA. Hence multiple doses of the WCV can elicit antibody responses to proteins not commonly recognised by pre-existing immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This panproteome-wide analysis of the changes in IgG binding following administration of a WCV provides a comprehensive view of the antibodies generated in response to systemic inoculation with an unencapsulated pneumococcus. The phase I clinical trial of WCV was primarily designed to measure safety outcomes, thus statistical power to assess immunogenicity at the proteome scale may have been limited. Nevertheless, complementary statistical analyses of changes in antibody response found significantly elevated IgG binding to 137 probes, corresponding to 112 protein sequences. Accounting for identification of orthologous variants, these responses spanned 72 functionally-distinct proteins, including multiple conserved antigens. These changes in immunity appear to represent a combination of boosting anamnestic responses to previously-recognised antigens, as well as the induction of novel antibodies to previously-unrecognised antigens. This complexity likely at least partially reflects the participants in this trial being healthy adults, with mature pre-existing immunity to pneumococci that is likely to limit the WCV-induced IgG response. Administration of WCV to more immunologically-naïve infants, the intended recipients of the vaccine, would likely result in a much higher proportion of novel antibody responses.</p><p>The distinctive antibody fingerprints of the adults in the trial suggest humans’ mature antibody repertoire is shaped by multiple encounters with diverse pneumococci, as the overall modifications caused by three WCV inoculations were relatively small. However, these alterations were remarkably consistent between individuals, despite the pre-existing differences in their adaptive immune responses. Only a subset of proteins, enriched for naturally immunogenic ABTs, provoked a strong post-WCV response. The reasons for this heterogeneity are unclear. These differences in Δ<sub>0→84</sub> measurements were evident even between proteins with similar functional and structural characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>), or of similar immunogenicities, based on the pre-WCV samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This pattern is unlikely to represent a lack of sensitivity due to saturation of the system, occurring at IgG-binding levels above six in this study, which were not frequently reached in these data. Nor is it likely attributable to sequence divergence between RM200 and protein representatives on the array, given probes’ high sequence similarity to some ABTs encoded in the RM200 genome that failed to elicit a substantial IgG response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>This suggests relatively subtle differences in protein characteristics, or antibody response kinetics, could affect which proteins are recognised most strongly when presented in the WCV. Alternatively, it may relate to differences in protein concentrations between the WCV and live pneumococci encountered by the host. However, it would seem unlikely that chemical killing, and subsequent processing, of the RM200 cells would retain a subset of each of the immunogenic SBPs, attached to the membrane through a lipid moiety, as well as surface proteins PspA and PspC, attached to cell wall polysaccharide through choline-binding domains, and ZmpA, covalently attached to the cell wall via sortase activity. It is more conceivable that many ABTs may not have been expressed by the RM200 cells during culture, although the strong and apparently novel response to some predominantly intracellular proteins, such as FlrR, suggests expression of surface-associated proteins would have to be very low for lack of exposure to explain the absence of an immune response.</p><p>The surface-associated proteins enriched among WCV antigens may be important components of a protective IgG response, as recognition of these structures enables intact <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells to be agglutinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitsi et al., 2017</xref>) or targeted for opsonophagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyams et al., 2010</xref>). However, the high-throughput nature of the array measurements of antibody binding cannot currently substitute for functional assays in determining whether these IgG responses are sufficient for protection. It is not clear whether a threshold correlate of protection, as determined for anti-capsular antibodies induced by PCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2014</xref>), could be applicable to a broad range of distinct protein antigens. One potentially confounding factor would be the accessibility of the different surface antigens on encapsulated strains, which suggests another explanation for the pattern of immune responses. Antibody binding of SBPs and components of the cell wall synthesis machinery is impeded by the capsule of most <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gor et al., 2005</xref>). These proteins accounted for much of the increased IgG binding following administration of the WCV. By contrast, adhesins and surface-associated degradative enzymes must extend beyond the capsule to function, and were comparatively absent from the antigens triggering post-WCV increases in IgG binding. Hence the observed enrichment of the former functional categories in the immune response to the vaccine could represent IgG recognition of the latter, larger surface proteins already being maximal in healthy adults, a situation that would be less likely in children receiving the same vaccine.</p><p>The opportunity for the adaptive immune system to strengthen responses to SBPs and the cell wall machinery may be particularly valuable, as many of these antigens are conserved across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>). Other subcapsular, conserved surface ABTs, such as the PpmA and PpiA foldases, were also associated with strong IgG responses. This is consistent with previous work with sera from animals inoculated with the RM200 WCV showing antibody-binding pneumococci of different serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, these antibodies could afford broad protection against a diverse set of strains, as long as these antibodies can penetrate the capsular envelope to bind their cognate proteins. They would likely be more effective against transparent phase variants, in which lower levels of capsule are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiser et al., 1994</xref>). These are more commonly associated with colonising isolates adhering to the nasopharyngeal epithelium, rather than those causing disease.</p><p>The few strong responses that were observed to adhesins, such as PclA and PspA, and degradative enzymes, such as ZmpA, may reflect exposure to new variants of diverse proteins that an individual has not encountered previously. In each of these cases, there was evidence of some variant-specificity in the response, although this was not simply related to sequence similarity between the proteins in the WCV and the variants on the array, suggesting these proteins contain multiple epitopes with a complex distribution across orthologues. For ZmpA, ZmpB and PclA, heterogeneity in the pattern of IgG binding suggests the evident sequence divergence is enough to at least weaken, if not completely evade, IgG binding induced by other variants, consistent with adaptive immunity being an important driver of the divergence of these antigenic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>). The contrasting binding of multiple PspA variants by WCV-induced antibodies could be an artefact of the absence of a variant on the array that was closely-related to the PspA of RM200, such that the measured responses are all similarly high because all representatives on the array are relatively distant from the variant that stimulated the response. Some previous work has found antibodies induced by individual PspA or PspC representatives to be broadly protective against a wide spectrum of variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks-Walter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nabors et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tart et al., 1996</xref>), consistent with induction of genuinely cross-reactive IgG, although other studies have found evidence for greater specificity in anti-PspC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Georgieva et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, inducing antibodies capable of recognising multiple variants of DCL could contribute to the protection induced by this WCV formulation being effective across the species.</p><p>Although this study focuses on the humoral response to WCV, cellular responses mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and interleukin 17A are important in the vaccine’s role in inhibiting nasopharyngeal colonisation in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2010a</xref>). Nevertheless, in the same animal model, WCV-induced protection against invasive disease was more dependent on protective antibodies than cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2010a</xref>). In humans, individuals with agammaglobulinemia, who have low levels of circulating antibodies, are highly susceptible to pneumococcal disease, atesting to the importance of protective antibody-mediated humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conley et al., 2000</xref>). While anticapsular antibodies are important in protecting against pneumococcal colonisation and disease, there is evidence that antibodies recognising proteins may be effective in these roles as well, based on their diversification that indicates immune selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>), the effects of protein vaccines in various animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jomaa et al., 2005</xref>), and the clinical effectiveness of protein-binding antibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations used to treat pneumococcal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These data provide new information on how this critically important pneumococcal antibody repertoire develops, both specifically relating to systemic immunisation with WCV, but likely also serving as a model of how humoral immunity responds to natural exposure to pneumococci. Such routine contacts with the bacterium are common and likely to have been somewhat confounding in this study, as the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggest some individuals in the placebo group may have encountered a naturally-circulating pneumococcus with different DCL alleles, and thus mounted a different pattern of IgG responses to the panel of variants. Despite such strain-specificity, there are many strong responses to the WCV that are consistent across individuals, congruent with the generally similar patterns of pre-vaccination immunity in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>) and the comparable profiles evident in pooled immunoglobulins collected from different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests the development of adaptive immunity is similar between individuals, and therefore these data are not just informative about the mechanism by which WCV may provide protection against pneumococcal disease, but also help build a more general understanding of the development of the natural immune repertoire, and what consequences this has for pneumococcal biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> strain</td><td><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <break/>RM200</td><td>PMID:20427625</td><td>ENA:SAMEA104558347</td><td>Dr. Rick Malley <break/>(Boston Children’s Hospital)</td></tr><tr><td> commercial assay</td><td><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <break/>Pan-Genome Microarray</td><td>Antigen Discovery Inc.</td><td/><td>Dr. Joseph Campo <break/>(Antigen Discovery Inc.)</td></tr><tr><td> software</td><td>R</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Information on the samples has been provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, and the standardized IgG-binding values from the panproteome array have been provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genomic analyses</title><p>A draft genome of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> RM200 was generated through a combined assembly of 454 and Illumina sequencing data using Celera Assembler v6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers et al., 2000</xref>).

Participants were healthy adults aged 18 to 40 years at the time of consent, and had no evidence of chronic health issues, nor any history of invasive pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal vaccination. Forty-two participants were enrolled and either received a WCV dose or a saline placebo, with sequential subject assignment performed by data management using an electronic randomization block design.

(ADI, Irvine, CA, USA), was designed and assayed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the microarray included 4504 full-length or fragmented proteins from the TIGR4 reference genome (2106 genes) and representatives of 2190 proteins identified in the Massachusetts pneumococcal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croucher et al., 2013b</xref>). These correspond to 2055 clusters of orthologous genes (COGs), 36 PspA variants, 57 PspC variants, 18 ZmpA variants, 16 ZmpB variants, and individual sequences for LytA, a phage amidase, ZmpE, PblB, PsrP and a choline-binding domain oligomer. Proteome microarrays were fabricated using a library of partial or complete CDSs cloned into the T7 expression vector pXI. Proteins were expressed using an <italic>E. coli in vitro</italic> transcription and translation (IVTT) system (Rapid Translation System, 5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and printed onto nitrocellulose-coated glass AVID slides (Grace Bio-Labs, Inc., Bend, OR, USA) using an Omni Grid Accent robotic microarray printer (Digilabs, Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA). Microarrays were probed with sera and antibody binding detected by incubation with biotin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA), followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated SureLight P-3 (Columbia Biosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Slides were scanned on a GenePix 4300A High-Resolution Microarray Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and raw spot and local background fluorescence intensities, spot annotations and sample phenotypes were imported and merged in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">R Core Team, 2017</xref>), in which all subsequent procedures were performed. Foreground spot intensities were adjusted by local background by subtraction, and negative values were converted to one. All foreground values were transformed using the base two logarithm. The dataset was normalised to remove systematic effects by subtracting the median signal intensity of the IVTT controls for each sample. With the normalised data, a value of 0.0 means that the intensity is no different than the background, and a value of 1.0 indicates a doubling with respect to background. Values below −2 in the normalised data, corresponding to less than 0.25 of the IVTT control probe signals, were adjusted to −2. This affected 152 of the 304,590 binding values included in the study, of which a further five were missing. Immunoreactivity was defined as achieving an IgG-binding level of one or greater in the study population at any timepoint being analysed.

The first six columns describe the functional annotation and classification of the corresponding protein, as well as whether it was categorised as an antibody-binding target (ABT) on the basis of high IgG binding in the pre-vaccination sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croucher et al., 2017</xref>). The next six columns contain statistics from the empirical Bayes analysis, in cases where there was a significant difference in Δ<sub>0→84</sub> between cohort three and the placebo group; otherwise, the cells contain ‘NA’. These numbers describe the comparison of Δ<sub>0→84</sub> values between cohort three and the placebo group. The t statistic and B value, representing the log odds that the IgG binding differs between cohort three and the placebo group, are shown, along with the <italic>p</italic> values following individual tests, and after a Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The next four columns show the empirical Bayes statistics for an identical analysis in which all probes corresponding to the DCL were excluded. The next four columns show the output of the linear mixed effects model test for probes exhibiting a significantly increasing trend in IgG binding over the duration of the trial; otherwise, the cells contain ‘NA’. The time coefficient describes the change in IgG binding over the trial in the vaccinated cohorts; only one probe has a negative coefficient, indicating vaccine doses reduced IgG binding over time. The table also shows calculation of a χ<sup>2</sup> statistic as part of a likelihood ratio test conducted against a linear mixed effects model with no time-dependent term, the resulting raw likelihood ratio, and the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected <italic>p</italic> value. The final two columns show the likelihood and adjusted <italic>p</italic> values for the same statistical test conducted with all DCL probes excluded; only the latter value differs between the two analyses.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-37015-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.034</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Protein features associated with elevated IgG responses following the administration of WCV.</title><p>This multivariable logistic binary regression analysis fitted a model combining the explanatory variables of different protein characteristics to the binary dependent variable of whether or not a protein provoked an elevated IgG response, based on the probes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Panproteome-wide analysis of antibody responses to whole cell pneumococcal vaccination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jeremy Brown (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this submission, Croucher and colleagues describe a pan-proteome based analysis of antibodies generated in response to the whole cell pneumococcal vaccine (WCV) for <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. The authors first describe genetic differences between the WCV (derived from RM200) and the parental D39 strain using comparative genomics and describe various recombination and mutational events. Further analysis of SNPs between these strains provided useful information to describe the ontogeny of the current WCV. Next, the authors study antibody fingerprints in vaccinated individuals and report individual antibody fingerprints in their study participants but no distinct differences in the level of heterogeneity between cohorts of patients. Assessing specific antibody binding targets (ABTs), the authors demonstrate that vaccination with WCV resulted in an increase in IgG binding to targets that were enriched in individuals who had high levels of the targets prior to WCV vaccination. To further explore this, the authors interrogate the WCV strain for the presence of targets with orthologs in the progenitor RM200 strain. Next, the authors study antibody binding to specific antigens over different time points and at the beginning and end of the observation period. This analysis revealed 138 targets where IgG binging increased, these were derived from 112 protein sequences, which corresponded to 72 functionally distinct proteins. Thereafter, the authors describe responses to specific protein antigens and describe effects that seem to relate to the initial dose of the WCV. This is an interesting study, with potentially important implications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers of the manuscript expressed concern that whilst the study is important and of high impact, it is presented a way that is not consistent with the broad readership base of <italic>eLife</italic>. There is extensive use of very technical terminology that will be difficult for the average reader to follow. Some text required repeated reading to understand the message. Figures could also be presented in a clearer and logical manner. Hence, the authors are requested to revise the manuscript to make it more accessible for <italic>eLife</italic> readers. Some specific comments are:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs a participant disposition flow chart, or a schedule of events that describes the patients and the time points. This should be the first figure in order for the reader to understand what samples are being analysed and which cohorts patients belonged to.</p><p>2) Clearly define the aims of the study in the Introduction. These are implicit in the Results and Discussion sections but it would help to have these explicitly defined in the Introduction.</p><p>3) Data presentation could be simplified to make it more readily accessible. Some specific points are:</p><p>A) The data (especially the box and whisker component) of Figure 5E and F are difficult to follow. Consider revising the presentation.</p><p>B) In Figure 5A to D; the compressed vertical access makes the figure harder to assess; this is partially true of many of the figures with multiple lines involved (Supplementary Figure 7 for example).</p><p>C) Supplementary file 2 is the crux of the data and the one that provides the specific data that the field will be interested in regards which antigens have increased antibody responses. Unfortunately, it is complex and full of statistical data, which makes it difficult to use. There is a strong case for inclusion of a simpler table (in the main text) listing the antigens to which there are increased antibody responses (and just a single line for the multiple allelic variants for the CBDs etc. as after all, there is only one version of each of these in the WCV), the strength of the increase in the antibody response, what proportion of subjects wherein this boost occurs, the D39 Spn gene number (for ease of interpreting what the corresponding gene is), what the pre-existing antibody level pre-vaccination was, and perhaps one or two highly relevant other parameters.</p><p>D) Some numbers that should be explicitly stated are: what proportion of ABTs have increased antibody responses to after vaccination with WCV; what proportion of non-ABTs have increased antibody responses to after vaccination with WCV; what proportion of SBPs have increased antibody responses to after vaccination with WCV.</p><p>E) There is a problem with the multiple allelic variants of ZmpA PspA etc. being included in the volcano plot. They actually represent boosting of responses by the single allelic variant in the WCV, hence having 8 or so dots representing the improved responses to multiple allelic variants is not a true representation of what is actually happening as an overview of the response to WCV. This perhaps might apply to some of the other figures leading to a skewing of some of the data, and this should be considered by the authors.</p><p>F) Figure 4—figure supplement Figure 14 did not seem to be very useful given most of these proteins are not in the WCV?</p><p>Other issues that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The assay for antibody binding measures an increase in fluorescence from a tagged antibody binding assay. As such, it does not exactly measure the level or functional capacity of the induced antibody responses. This does not need to be addressed by further experiments, as this is beyond the scope of the present study, but the authors need to discuss their interpretation of the increases in responses they observe and how this might translate into potential protective effects.</p><p>2) Some of the important implications are a little under-discussed. For example, the data shows which proteins stimulate a boost in antibody levels but this does not describe which of these responses are protective, which is a critical question. And why are some proteins boosting responses and other similar proteins do not? Is this to do with expression/quantity in the WCV? If there were data available on the latter that would be helpful to include. Identifying protective responses is not easy – correlations between individual antibody responses and functional assays of phagocytosis would be helpful but these data are probably not available and really would make a separate paper. Some mention in the Discussion would be useful.</p><p>3) The majority of the vaccine-induced responses were to solute binding and cell wall metabolism proteins. Antibody accessibility to such antigens may be limited by capsule, reducing any effect of antibody on systemic pneumococcal infection as was seen for anti-PsaA or PpmA in the study of Gor et al., 2005. However, numerous other studies have found that vaccination using PsaA is protective against nasopharyngeal carriage – this might reflect binding to the relatively less encapsulated transparent phase variants that bind more effectively to the nasopharyngeal epithelium. The authors should discuss the accessibility or otherwise of potentially protective antibodies in relation to capsule phase variation and nasopharyngeal carriage.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Panproteome-wide analysis of antibody responses to whole cell pneumococcal vaccination&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. We consulted another BRE at <italic>eLife</italic>, with statistical expertise, and following concerns emerged:</p><p>1) The previous decision letter communicated that the manuscript was not written in an accessible manner and that it needed to be simplified in order for readers to be able to follow what has been done. While the authors do seem to have addressed the specific recommendations, this had been done by adding to the text rather than reorganising the presentation of the manuscript. Please give this further attention, readability to a broad audience is important for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>2) Related to the point above, some aspects are difficult to follow. The Abstract suggests this is a phase 1 vaccine clinical trial but it is really a descriptive analysis of antibody responses in the longitudinal measurements of the trial participants. (This is acknowledged in the subsection “Study design and participant”.) The Abstract states that 72 functionally distinct proteins were associated with increases but this result is difficult to isolate in the main manuscript. The Abstract needs to communicate that this is a descriptive analysis.</p><p>3) The trial was designed for Phase 1 safety outcomes so this study is making use of existing samples and will be under-powered for many questions that the researchers may wish to address. Consider this point and address it in your manuscript.</p><p>4) Very few statistical analyses are presented though hypothesis tests and statistical significance has clearly been used to interpret results. Further elaboration on tests would assist in understanding the data.</p><p>5) Further statistical analysis concerns:</p><p>A) Subsection “Stable antibody “fingerprints” of vaccinated individuals”, last paragraph. A Kruskall Wallis (non-parametric) test has been used on a sample size of 67,947 for the per probe rather than per individual analysis. With a sample size so large a parametric analysis could have been used. Large sample sizes such as these will be able to detect very small differences that may not be biologically important. A parametric analysis would yield mean values per group to aid understanding. This analysis seems to be entirely inappropriate as all correlations have been ignored. A mixed effects linear model would have correctly taken account of the correlations.</p><p>B) Subsection “WCV elicits elevated IgG to a specific minority of proteins”, second paragraph. It also seems odd to use Fisher's exact test when the sample size is so large. It also seems inappropriate to assume independence here.</p><p>C) Subsection “Identification of specific antigens”, second paragraph. A BH correction for multiple testing has been adopted but it is not clear how this was done. How many tests were performed and what level was the FDR controlling for? Wherever corrected p-values are presented the full procedure needs to be documented.</p><p>6) Figure 7 needs to show the number on each graph, and identify what the colours represent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37015.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers of the manuscript expressed concern that whilst the study is important and of high impact, it is presented a way that is not consistent with the broad readership base of eLife.

We have also ensured terms such as probes, solute binding proteins and diverse core loci are now explicitly defined, and have provided a brief description of the t-SNE, empirical Bayes and linear mixed effects model methodologies at the relevant points in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The manuscript needs a participant disposition flow chart, or a schedule of events that describes the patients and the time points. This should be the first figure in order for the reader to understand what samples are being analysed and which cohorts patients belonged to.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very helpful suggestion. We have now added such a flowchart as a new Figure 1. This details the design of the trial, the scheduling of the vaccine doses and serum collection, and the samples available for analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clearly define the aims of the study in the Introduction. These are implicit in the Results and Discussion sections but it would help to have these explicitly defined in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that the Introduction ended somewhat abruptly, without defining the aims of the study, in the previous version of the manuscript. Therefore we have now appended a section outlining the planned analyses to the end of the Introduction: “This study therefore aimed to identify the range and types of antigens to which IgG responses were mounted following WCV administration, and how these might vary between individuals. […] These analyses should provide information on whether the WCV is likely to consistently induce antibodies capable of recognising antigens conserved across <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolates.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data presentation could be simplified to make it more readily accessible. Some specific points are:</p><p>A) The data (especially the box and whisker component) of Figure 5E and F are difficult to follow. Consider revising the presentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this presentation was not ideal in the submitted version of the manuscript. Hence we have now moved these plots from Figure 5, to allow for the expansion of panels A-D, and created a new Figure 6. Panels A and B of Figure 6 reproduce the previous scatterplots, but with the box and whisker plots removed. Instead, the distributions of initial IgG binding values for those probes showing an increase between the relevant timepoints are represented as histograms in the new panels C and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) In Figure 5A to D; the compressed vertical access makes the figure harder to assess; this is partially true of many of the figures with multiple lines involved (Supplementary Figure 7 for example).</p></disp-quote><p>This was certainly a deficiency of the original graphs, and we have now adjusted the vertical axis range of Figure 5 panels A-D to display the data more clearly, as well as removing two panels from Figure 5 to create a separate Figure 6, to allow panels A-D to be expanded. We have also split Supplementary Figure 7 into four separate figures (Figure 4—figure supplements 8, 9, 12 and 15), to make these plots easier for the reader to view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Supplementary file 2 is the crux of the data and the one that provides the specific data that the field will be interested in regards which antigens have increased antibody responses. Unfortunately, it is complex and full of statistical data, which makes it difficult to use. There is a strong case for inclusion of a simpler table (in the main text) listing the antigens to which there are increased antibody responses (and just a single line for the multiple allelic variants for the CBDs etc. as after all, there is only one version of each of these in the WCV), the strength of the increase in the antibody response, what proportion of subjects wherein this boost occurs, the D39 Spn gene number (for ease of interpreting what the corresponding gene is), what the pre-existing antibody level pre-vaccination was, and perhaps one or two highly relevant other parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion, and accordingly we have now generated Table 1 to summarise the increases in IgG binding associated with the WCV antigens. This links each of the proteins to which a significant increase in IgG binding was detected to the relevant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 coding sequence, where possible, and aggregates data across variants for each of the DCL. The table also provides the median IgG binding at the start of the trial, as well the median change by the end of the trial in each cohort; all of these values are associated with interquartile ranges, to assess the variation in the data within cohorts. These ranges are in place of a proportion of individuals in whom an increase above a specific threshold was observed, as the numbers within each cohort are relatively small, and therefore variation in the proportion exhibiting a rise above a given value could be difficult to interpret. This format is intended to provide all the information requested by the reviewers in as accessible a form as is possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Some numbers that should be explicitly stated are: what proportion of ABTs have increased antibody responses to after vaccination with WCV; what proportion of non-ABTs have increased antibody responses to after vaccination with WCV; what proportion of SBPs have increased antibody responses to after vaccination with WCV.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are absolutely right that these numbers should have been more clearly stated in the text. We have now added the results of the suggested analysis. Where a cutoff was used to identify probes associated with significantly elevated IgG binding (Figure 2), we now provide the per-probe statistics: the 325 probes from ABTs accounted for 23 of 47 (48.9%), 17 of 43 (39.5%), and 60 of 129 (46.5%) probes associated with significant increases in cohorts one to three, respectively. All of these were significant by Fisher’s exact tests.</p><p>For the 112 proteins found to be significantly associated with IgG rises by the empirical Bayes and linear mixed effects model tests, 71 were ABT proteins (63.4%); hence 137 of the 208 did not show such an increase. Of the 1,235 immunoreactive non-ABTs, 41 were identified as eliciting a significant increase in IgG binding (3.32%), and 1,194 were not. Therefore, there is a significant enrichment of ABTs in the antigens eliciting a response to the WCV (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 15.0, 95% confidence interval 9.68-23.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>). When considering only the 1,062 immunoreactive proteins represented on the array and exhibiting at least 90% similarity with a protein expressed by the WCV, ABTs accounted for 39 of the 71 proteins associated with a significant increase in IgG binding (54.9%). Thirty-four of the ABTs conserved in the WCV were not associated with a significant increase, compared with 957 non-ABTs. Hence ABTs represented only 3.43% of the conserved proteins not exhibiting a significant post-WCV rise in IgG binding. This again corresponds to a significant enrichment (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 33.9, 95% confidence interval = 18.4-63.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>).</p><p>Regardless of IgG binding, using the Pfam domains now described in the Methods, we identified 26 SBPs in the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> RM200 genome; manual annotation added AliA to bring the total to 27. Of these, 25 were immunoreactive and represented on the proteome array; correspondingly, there are 1,922 non-SBPs encoded by the RM200 genome, of which 1,037 were represented on the array and immunoreactive. Eleven SBPs (44.0% of the immunoreactive SBPs on the array), and 60 non-SBPs (5.79% of the non-SBPs that were immunoreactive and represented on the array), were associated with significant increases in IgG binding post-WCV. Hence SBPs were strongly enriched in those proteins triggering an immune response (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 12.7, 95% confidence interval = 5.00 – 31.6, <italic>p</italic> = 9.9x10<sup>-8</sup>).</p><p>These SBPs therefore accounted for 11 of the 71 ABTs associated with a significant increase in IgG binding (15.5%). Of the other 137 ABTs not showing such an increase, only six were SBPs (4.38%). Hence there was a significant enrichment for SBPs within the ABTs provoking a further IgG response (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 3.97, 95% confidence interval 1.28-13.7, <italic>p =</italic> 0.014).</p><p>For completeness, we have also added the same statistics for the cell wall synthesis and processing machinery. As this set of proteins do not share a common structural motif that allows them to be consistently identified from the genome, the enrichment of these proteins relative to other ABTs was tested. Overall, 16 of the 25 cell wall machinery ABTs were among the 71 proteins triggering a significant immune response by eBayes or LMM (64.0%). This corresponded to a 3.43-fold enrichment in the ABTs associated with elevated IgG binding (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 4.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.60-11.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0014).</p><p>We have now provided all of these statistics in the main Results section, and the transparent reporting form. We have chosen to omit the odds ratios, and associated confidence intervals, because these imply uncertainty associated with sampling, rather than a comparison of probe populations for which we have almost complete data. Instead, we report the proportions, fold enrichments and <italic>p</italic> values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) There is a problem with the multiple allelic variants of ZmpA PspA etc. being included in the volcano plot. They actually represent boosting of responses by the single allelic variant in the WCV, hence having 8 or so dots representing the improved responses to multiple allelic variants is not a true representation of what is actually happening as an overview of the response to WCV. This perhaps might apply to some of the other figures leading to a skewing of some of the data, and this should be considered by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are right that this is a difficult aspect of the data to address. In terms of the volcano plot, these are the responses to proteins on the array that are detected and used in normalisation procedures, and therefore from a technical perspective it would be misleading to omit them. Also, from a biological perspective, we feel it is interesting that the response to a single variant of these diverse proteins triggers antibodies capable of recognising multiple other variants, even though these correspond to distinct representatives of the overall diversity at these loci. Hence a volcano plot including these points is the more accurate representation of the immune response to the WCV.</p><p>However, we appreciate the reviewers’ concerns about how this over-representation of DCL sequences may affect the statistical analyses. These probes were excluded from some analyses in the manuscript where it was clearly appropriate, such as that comparing ABTs present in the WCV with those absent from it, and we have made this clearer in the text. To ascertain their impact on the identification of immunogenic proteins within the WCV, we have repeated the empirical Bayes and linear mixed effects model analyses with the probes corresponding to PspA, PspC, ZmpA and ZmpB excluded. This resulted in four of the 78 non-DCL loci probes no longer being significant in either test, corresponding to proteins Pbp1B, RexA, YneF, and a PclA allele. Given the small number of changes, and the distribution of the discrepancies between multiple functional categories, we feel this demonstrates the conclusions of the paper are generally robust to the inclusion of the DCL. However, it is important to note the dependency of the output on the inclusion of the DCL alleles in the text, and we have also added the outputs of the tests excluding the DCL to Supplementary file 2. The accompanying volcano plot, omitting the DCL, is now also included as a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) Figure 4—figure supplement 14 did not seem to be very useful given most of these proteins are not in the WCV?</p></disp-quote><p>We think Figure 4—figure supplement 14 is helpful in demonstrating the specificity of the immune response and proteome array, particularly with regard to the different alleles of PclA. Furthermore, not only do these immunogenic proteins absent from the WCV effectively serve as a negative control, confirming the responses to ABTs are generally specific to those in the WCV, they also represent candidate vaccine antigens likely to be included in multiprotein or conjugate formulations. Therefore it is likely that responses to these antigens will be of interest in future studies, and so it may be helpful to explicitly plot these data for comparison with cases where individuals are exposed to these proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The assay for antibody binding measures an increase in fluorescence from a tagged antibody binding assay. As such, it does not exactly measure the level or functional capacity of the induced antibody responses. This does not need to be addressed by further experiments, as this is beyond the scope of the present study, but the authors need to discuss their interpretation of the increases in responses they observe and how this might translate into potential protective effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is certainly an important point to convey to allow the reader to fully interpret the results. We have therefore added a section to the Discussion, explicitly making the point raised by the reviewers: “The surface-associated proteins enriched among WCV antigens may be important components of a protective IgG response, as recognition of these structures enables intact S<italic>. pneumoniae</italic> cells to be agglutinated (Mitsi et al., 2017) or targeted for opsonophagocytosis (Hyams et al., 2010). […] It is not clear whether a threshold correlate of protection, as determined for anti-capsular antibodies induced by PCVs (Andrews et al., 2014), could be applicable to a broad range of distinct protein antigens.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some of the important implications are a little under-discussed. For example, the data shows which proteins stimulate a boost in antibody levels but this does not describe which of these responses are protective, which is a critical question. And why are some proteins boosting responses and other similar proteins do not? Is this to do with expression/quantity in the WCV? If there were data available on the latter that would be helpful to include. Identifying protective responses is not easy – correlations between individual antibody responses and functional assays of phagocytosis would be helpful but these data are probably not available and really would make a separate paper. Some mention in the Discussion would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise multiple interesting points. Ultimately, we do not know exactly why some proteins trigger IgG responses, but others do not, despite being similar in their structural and functional characteristics, or pre-vaccine levels of IgG binding. There appears to be some pattern regarding those proteins that are typically subcapsular eliciting increases in antibody binding, whereas the adhesins and degradative proteins, which usually extend beyond the capsule, do not contribute much to the overall response. The suggestion that this could relate to differences in the levels at which proteins are present in the WCV, relative to live colonising <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, is an excellent one, to which we now refer in the relevant section we have added to the Discussion: “The reasons for this heterogeneity are unclear. […] It is more conceivable that many ABTs may not have been expressed by the RM200 cells during culture, although the strong and apparently novel response to some predominantly intracellular proteins, such as FlrR, suggests expression of surface-associated proteins would have to be very low for lack of exposure to explain the absence of an immune response.”.</p><p>We also retain our previous discussion of alternative possible explanations, including saturation of the measurements from the array. We do not have information on whether these antibodies responses are functionally protective, and we hope the text added in response to the previous point is sufficient to make this clear to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The majority of the vaccine-induced responses were to solute binding and cell wall metabolism proteins. Antibody accessibility to such antigens may be limited by capsule, reducing any effect of antibody on systemic pneumococcal infection as was seen for anti-PsaA or PpmA in the study of Gor et al., 2005. However, numerous other studies have found that vaccination using PsaA is protective against nasopharyngeal carriage – this might reflect binding to the relatively less encapsulated transparent phase variants that bind more effectively to the nasopharyngeal epithelium. The authors should discuss the accessibility or otherwise of potentially protective antibodies in relation to capsule phase variation and nasopharyngeal carriage.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and therefore we have added a short section addressing this point in the Discussion: “Therefore, these antibodies could afford broad protection against a diverse set of strains, as long as these antibodies can penetrate the capsular envelope to bind their cognate proteins. […] These are more commonly associated with colonising isolates adhering to the nasopharyngeal epithelium, rather than those causing disease.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. We consulted another BRE at eLife, with statistical expertise, and following concerns emerged:</p><p>1) The previous decision letter communicated that the manuscript was not written in an accessible manner and that it needed to be simplified in order for readers to be able to follow what has been done. While the authors do seem to have addressed the specific recommendations, this had been done by adding to the text rather than reorganising the presentation of the manuscript. Please give this further attention, readability to a broad audience is important for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the importance of making the manuscript accessible to a broad audience, and have sought to improve on the edits already made in response to the suggestions of the original set of reviewers. Having re-read the text, we have now reorganised the Results section into a larger number of smaller sections, with headers added to guide the reader through the main conclusions. We have also comprehensively reworded some parts we identified as being dense with technical language, including clarifying the selection and design of some of the statistical tests, as detailed below. We hope this suitably improves the accessibility of the material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the point above, some aspects are difficult to follow. The Abstract suggests this is a phase 1 vaccine clinical trial but it is really a descriptive analysis of antibody responses in the longitudinal measurements of the trial participants. (This is acknowledged in the subsection “Study design and participant”.) The Abstract states that 72 functionally distinct proteins were associated with increases but this result is difficult to isolate in the main manuscript. The Abstract needs to communicate that this is a descriptive analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is helpful to make it clear that these data are not the primary output of the trial, although still feel it is important to specify the samples originate from placebo-controlled trial, rather than an alternative type of clinical study (e.g. case control or observational study). As all phase 1 trial outcomes are inherently descriptive, this distinction is not necessarily clear-cut. We have therefore changed the relevant sentence in the Abstract from:</p><p>“Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to a WCV were quantified by applying longitudinally-sampled sera from 35 adults in a placebo-controlled phase I trial to a panproteome microarray…” to: “Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to a WCV were characterised by applying longitudinally-sampled sera, available from 35 adult placebo-controlled phase I trial participants, to a panproteome microarray”.</p><p>We have also made the sub-sampling from the trial clear in the Results section by editing the text to read, “Overall, 130 samples were studied from 35 of the 42 trial participants”.</p><p>The identification of 72 functionally-distinct proteins requires the combination of multiple analyses (assessing the most useful statistical tests; identifying immunogenicity using these tests, then functionally annotating the immunogenic probes). Therefore this result is only presented once these preceding analyses have been introduced in a stepwise manner, to allow readers to understand how we arrived at this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The trial was designed for Phase 1 safety outcomes so this study is making use of existing samples and will be under-powered for many questions that the researchers may wish to address. Consider this point and address it in your manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true there are inherent limitations to samples from a small trial, which we now acknowledge in the Discussion (“The phase I clinical trial of WCV was primarily designed to measure safety outcomes, thus statistical power to assess immunogenicity at the proteome scale may have been limited.”). There is no particular immunological endpoint for which we are necessarily underpowered due to only using a subset of trial participants, as no specific power analysis was conducted prior to the trial (see Materials and methods), and the panproteome array technology was not included in the original design of the trial. In general, as we were able to identify many immunogenic proteins, it appears we were appropriately powered to detect the most biologically-significant immune responses. Those proteins found to be non-immunogenic appear to genuinely fail to trigger a detectable response (e.g. Figure 4—figure supplements 8, 9, 12 and 15), rather than a smaller response we were underpowered to identify as significant, suggesting the sample size was not necessarily restrictive.</p><p>We do not think it would be helpful to speculate on additional hypotheses we could test with larger trials. Indeed, the greater limitation on data interpretation is the use of adults, rather than infants, as already mentioned in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Very few statistical analyses are presented though hypothesis tests and statistical significance has clearly been used to interpret results. Further elaboration on tests would assist in understanding the data.</p></disp-quote><p>After reviewing the presentation of the statistical tests in the manuscript, we agree with the reviewer that some tests could be more thoroughly explained. Therefore we have added text to improve the description of the hypotheses being tested, and statistical approach employed, in three sections:</p><p>- We have clarified the hypothesis being tested with Fisher’s exact tests of association between antibody-binding targets and vaccine antigens.</p><p>- We have explicitly stated the motivation for the multivariable analysis of protein characteristics.</p><p>- We have more thoroughly explained the comparison of pre-vaccination IgG binding to antigens associated with early, or late, vaccine-induced antibody responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Further statistical analysis concerns:</p><p>A) Subsection “Stable antibody “fingerprints” of vaccinated individuals”, last paragraph. A Kruskall Wallis (non-parametric) test has been used on a sample size of 67,947 for the per probe rather than per individual analysis. With a sample size so large a parametric analysis could have been used. Large sample sizes such as these will be able to detect very small differences that may not be biologically important. A parametric analysis would yield mean values per group to aid understanding. This analysis seems to be entirely inappropriate as all correlations have been ignored. A mixed effects linear model would have correctly taken account of the correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that a linear mixed effects model better accounts for within-individual correlations, and therefore we have replaced this Kruskal-Wallis test with such an analysis. Linear mixed effects models were fitted with trial participant as a random effect, and either cohort and probe, or just probe, as fixed effects. An ANOVA analysis comparing these two fits found the inclusion of cohort significantly improved the model fit (χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.96, df = 3, p = 0.030). When this model fitting was repeated using just the immunoreactive probes (exhibiting a maximal IgG binding at least double that of the background level), excluding probes associated with IgG binding levels unlikely to be biologically significant, this comparison found a more statistically significant improvement when cohort was included (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.8, df = 3, p = 0.00807). This indicates there is significant variation between cohorts at the level of individual probes, consistent with the previous Kruskal-Wallis test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Subsection “WCV elicits elevated IgG to a specific minority of proteins”, second paragraph. It also seems odd to use Fisher's exact test when the sample size is so large. It also seems inappropriate to assume independence here.</p></disp-quote><p>Fisher’s exact test for association between variables using a contingency table is applicable to any sample size in principle, but is sometimes limited in practice due to computational feasibility. These values were easily calculated, and therefore there was no need to employ a less accurate test, such as the Chi squared test; analysis with this alternative test gave very similar p values, which were typically marginally less conservative than those of the Fisher’s exact tests. Therefore we have retained the precise and conservative outputs of the Fisher’s exact test in the manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the two variables being tested (whether or not the probe represented an antibody-binding target, and whether or not the probe increased IgG binding by more than a threshold value) are not completely independent. However, the lack of independence is conservative with respect to the conclusion of the test. Antibody-binding targets have high initial antibody binding levels (Croucher et al., 2017), and in the absence of vaccination, regression to the mean results in a negative correlation between pre-vaccination IgG binding and the post-vaccination change in IgG binding (Figure 3A). Additionally, detection of post-vaccination increases in IgG binding would more likely be limited by saturation for probes starting at high IgG binding pre-vaccination; however, the observed levels of IgG binding in this experiment means there was little, if any, effect of saturation. As both of these effects result in a tendency to associate non-ABTs with greater increases in IgG binding than ABTs, whereas we concluded the opposite, we consider this result robust, and the methodology appropriate. This concurs with the consistency of the threshold-based analysis with the eBayes and LMM analyses later in the manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Subsection “Identification of specific antigens”, second paragraph. A BH correction for multiple testing has been adopted but it is not clear how this was done. How many tests were performed and what level was the FDR controlling for? Wherever corrected p-values are presented the full procedure needs to be documented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now specified the p values for the 1,584 immunoreactive probes (reduced to 1,384 probes when the diverse core loci were excluded) were subject to a standard Benjamini-Hochberg correction, using either the base R function p.adjust, or the topTable function from limma. Results were considered significant if they were below the false discovery rate threshold of 0.05. All this information has now been added to the Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 7 needs to show the number on each graph, and identify what the colours represent.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying these deficiencies in the legend of Figure 7. We have now annotated the total number of scatterpoints (n = 414), explaining the in the legend that this corresponds to one per immunogenic probe (n = 138) in each of the three vaccinated cohorts. The colours associate datapoints with cohorts, consistent with the previous figures, as now explained in the legend and an added key. The numbers of datapoints represented by the histograms in panels C and D are also now marked on the revised figure, and included in the legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
