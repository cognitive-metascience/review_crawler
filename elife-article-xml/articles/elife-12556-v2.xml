recognition of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infected cells. Currently, little data exist pertaining to peptides that are presented after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Herein we purify HLA-A*02:01 complexes from <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected cells and characterize the peptide ligands using LCMS. We identify 195 <italic>T. gondii</italic> encoded ligands originating from both secreted and cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands are significantly longer than uninfected host ligands, and these longer pathogen-derived peptides maintain a canonical N-terminal binding core yet exhibit a C-terminal extension of 1–30 amino acids. Structural analysis demonstrates that binding of extended peptides opens the HLA class I F’ pocket, allowing the C-terminal extension to protrude through one end of the binding groove. In summary, we demonstrate that unrealized structural flexibility makes MHC class I receptive to parasite-derived ligands that exhibit unique C-terminal peptide extensions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12556.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12556.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12556.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a parasite that can infect most warm-blooded animals and cause a disease called toxoplasmosis. In humans, toxoplasmosis generally does not cause any noticeable symptoms, but it can cause serious problems in pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems.</p><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> is one of many parasites that hide within human cells in an attempt to avoid detection by the immune system. However, proteins called Human Leukocyte Antigens, or HLAs, can reveal hidden parasites by carrying small sections of them from the inside the infected cell to the cell’s surface. The immune system can then recognize the fragments as foreign and attack the parasite.</p><p>HLAs typically pick up parasite fragments of a certain length, which enables the immune system to recognize that what is being displayed is a piece of parasite. By purifying HLAs from cells that have been infected by <italic>T. gondii</italic>, McMurtrey et al. have now learned more about which fragments of the parasite are displayed to the immune system. This analysis revealed that the parasite somehow manipulates the HLAs to carry parasite fragments that are considerably longer than can be explained with our current knowledge of how HLAs work. By using a technique called X-ray crystallography, McMurtrey et al. also show that the structure of the HLA assumes a previously unseen configuration when interacting with fragments of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to understand how infected cells give rise to unusual structural configurations of HLAs and to unravel how these structures affect the immune system’s ability to fight infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12556.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12556.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>T. gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>HLA</kwd><kwd>peptide ligands</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 AI77887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLeod</surname><given-names>Rima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHSN272201200010C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sette</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AI062629-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blader</surname><given-names>Ira J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hildebrand</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>T. gondii</italic> infection alters how peptide ligands are presented to the immune system by inducing a previously unreported structural change in Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD8 T-cells mediate immunity to <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki and Remington, 1988</xref>) through recognition of peptide antigens presented by the MHC class I (MHC I) molecules of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and McLeod, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deckert-Schlüter et al., 1994</xref>). The majority of peptide ligands identified to date are derived from parasite surface proteins, proteins localized to dense granules, or the rhoptry proteins which are specialized secretory granules whose contents are released either into the host cell cytoplasm or the parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cong et al., 2011</xref>). These secreted proteins are thought to be optimal candidates for MHC I presentation because they have the best access to conventional antigen processing and presentation machinery in the host cell. However, this is a large pathogen, and the full array of parasite proteins that might be sampled and presented remains unknown.</p><p>Recent advances in immunology and proteomics highlight that non-canonical ligands are presented to T cells by MHC I molecules. While a majority of peptides are 8–11 amino acids in length, MHC I molecules present a considerable number of peptides &gt;11 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schittenhelm et al., 2014</xref>) that elicit T-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burrows et al., 2006</xref>). Structural characterizations suggest that these long ligands interact with the MHC I molecule much like canonical peptides: The MHC I alpha chain forms a 10 x 25 angstrom groove in which peptide ligands are anchored by their second (P2) and C-terminal (PΩ) residues. In this mode of binding, the middle portion of any oversized peptides can bulge out of the MHC I groove and interact with the receptors of T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tynan et al., 2005</xref>). Crystallographic studies have confirmed this bulging model, although there exists a structural example of a 10mer interacting with MHC I molecule HLA-A2 via P2 and P9 with an amino acid extension at P10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, both peptide extension and peptide bulging have been observed for MHC I ligands, and, as longer ligands become increasingly evident, the interaction of these ligands with MHC I will need to be clarified.</p><p>The goal of this study was to have the MHC I of infected cells inform the number, breadth, and nature of <italic>T. gondii</italic> peptide ligands. HLA-A*02:01 was purified from cells infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> and peptide ligands eluted from the HLA class I (human MHC I) complex were analyzed by two-dimensional LCMS. The resulting data demonstrate that nearly 200 ligands originating from close to 100 different <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins are sampled for MHC I presentation. As envisioned, a number of ligands originating from dense granule proteins was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cong et al., 2011</xref>), yet MHC I ligands were also derived from a large number parasite cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands were significantly longer than existing structural models can accommodate, and a series of peptide analogs demonstrated that these longer peptides are not anchored to MHC I via their C-termini. Crystallographic studies reveal an unreported structural re-arrangement of residues in the MHC I binding groove that accommodate C-terminal peptide extensions, and this structural flexibility is discussed in the context of infection by intracellular pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> HLA-A*02:01 ligands</title><p>The first objective of this study was to identify pathogen-encoded ligands made available by MHC I.

A subsequent search revealed nested core sequences of 8–11 amino acids within the longer peptides that were not predicted to bind, and these cores were predicted to bind to HLA-A*02:01. Strikingly, a considerable number (52/78) of the predicted non-binders contained nested core sequences of 8–11 amino acids that were predicted to bind with high affinity (percentile rank score &lt;=2%).

This occurred significantly more than randomly scrambled versions of the peptides (1/13) (p = 3.1 x 10<sup>-5</sup>, comparison of proportions). There was no significant increase in proportions of ligands with an N-terminal extension (1/52) or an extension on both sides (15/52) compared to scrambled ligand sequences (0/13 and 12/13 respectively). Noteworthy was that 10/15 of the peptides with predicted extensions on both sides of a central core had an alternate binding core at the N-terminal side with a predicted affinity slightly weaker than the central binding core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). So, most peptides could bind either at the N-terminal end or in the center, and many of the ligands with central cores possessed an alternate N-terminal core.

In order to assess the contribution of the putative core for peptide binding, HLA-A*02:01 binding assays were completed using the full length peptide, the binding core only, and a series of full length peptide variants containing non-permissive amino acid substitutions at the putative C-terminal anchor of the binding core. For FVLELEPEWT<underline>V</underline>K, the affinity of all 'mutant' peptides was significantly worse (t-test, p&lt;0.05) than either the binding core or the native full-length peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

As YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR harbors a Leu at P9 and at P10, it could be that either Leu can serve as an F’ pocket anchor for HLA-A*02:01 and when the P10 was changed to an acidic residue like L10E, the P9 Leu was used as the F-pocket anchor. In summary, the binding core’s F-pocket residue is critical for long-peptide binding to HLA-A*02:01 such that C-terminal amino acid extensions of these longer ligands somehow protrude out of the groove in the vicinity of the F-pocket.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Thermostability of extended ligand complexes</title><p>Extended ligands YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR-RPL7A<sup>15-30</sup> and FVLELEPEWTVK-UFP<sup>16-27</sup> bound at high affinity to HLA-A*02:01, and we next assessed their relative stability when in complex with MHC I.

It was somewhat surprising that these extended ligands had Tm representative of canonical ligands, and more remarkable was that the thermostability of the binding cores was at least 10°C higher (YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR, ΔTm = 10°C, FVLELEPEWTVK ΔTm = 12°C) than their extended counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Indeed, the secreted dense granule proteins are the best-characterized source of peptides for presentation by MHC I, and our study confirms these proteins provide a number of MHC I ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cong et al., 2011</xref>). However, many of the ligands we observe originate from non-secreted proteins, including parasite cytoplasmic proteins. Enrichment in these proteins is unexpected given that most <italic>T. gondii</italic> cytoplasmic proteins are not secreted and their cellular location should sequester them from the MHC I peptide processing machinery. Further, we identified many hypothetical proteins sampled by MHC I. Proteomic data had previously been reported for all but one of these hypothetical proteins, and our data substantiates that these proteins are expressed by the tachyzoites within the infected host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gajria et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Treeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xia et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, a little less than half (10/22) of the hypothetical proteins contain a predicted secretion signal sequence. These data represent a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of <italic>T. gondii</italic> gene/protein expression and demonstrate that secreted as well as non-secreted tachyzoite-expressed proteins are accessible to host antigen presentation processes.</p><p>A previous study of MHC I and <italic>T. gondii</italic> indicated that ligands derived from the C-termini of <italic>T. gondii</italic> source proteins are immunodominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feliu et al., 2013</xref>), and it was suggested that a proteolytic insufficiency within infected murine cells meant that only peptides derived from the C-termini of <italic>T. gondii</italic> source proteins would provide ligands of optimal length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feliu et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, we found a dramatic C-terminal bias in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> derived ligands. However, it was completely unexpected that host-derived ligands in the infected cell would also display a C-terminal bias. Gene ontology annotation analysis indicated no bias in the cellular location of the source proteins for these C-terminal ligands (data not shown), so it does not appear to be a protein’s location within the cell that results in a C-terminal processing bias. How <italic>T. gondii</italic> is mediating this intracellular alteration in antigen processing and presentation is therefore an unsettled question, and it will be interesting to see if protein ligand sampling is also biased in the closely related parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>.</p><p>One of the most striking observations in this study is that infection leads to the MHC I presentation of <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands that are longer than baseline host ligands. Most ligands of considerable length are thought to be anchored to the B’ and F’ pockets of the MHC I groove via the peptide’s P2 and PΩ side chains, respectively. In such models the long peptide ligands exhibit a central bulge in order for the MHC I groove to accommodate the length of the extra residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tynan et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this model, several long <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands identified follow this P2/PΩ-anchor means of binding to MHC I. Rather unexpectedly, a group of long ligands did not follow this model but instead were predicted to bind via a canonical N-terminal binding core preceding the aforementioned C-terminal extension. A review of published ligand elution data confirms that C-terminally extended peptides are presented by membrane-bound HLA-A*02:01(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scull et al., 2012</xref>), yet the considerable number of extended ligands observed in this in vitro model of <italic>T. gondii</italic> antigen processing and presentation merits future confirmation in vivo. That notwithstanding, structural support for the binding of extended peptide ligands in HLA-A*02:01 can also be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 1994</xref>). In this example the nonamer binding core of a calreticulin peptide is extended by a single C-terminal amino acid that fits within the MHC I groove, yet this model was not consistent with <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands that had as many as 30 C-terminally appended amino acids. In order to resolve this enigma, an HLA-A*02:01 crystal was solved with F<underline>V</underline>LELEPEWT<underline>V</underline>K and with a version of this ligand minus the C-terminal K. This led to the unprecedented observation that the C-terminal lysine at P12 displaced the Tyr84 residue at the end of the HLA-A*02:01 binding groove. As such, Tyr84 emerged as a “swinging gate” whereby a longer <italic>T. gondii</italic> peptide extended straight out the end of the HLA molecule at its C-terminus when Tyr84 assumed an alternate up and out position – the open gate. With the shorter peptide the Tyr84 was positioned down and in, assuming the traditional closed-groove orientation. A Tyr84 in the open position is consistent with several extended <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands and a number of host ligands. This structural configuration is distinct from c-terminal extensions previously reported with C-terminal extension of covalently linked peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitaksov et al., 2007</xref>) and predicted configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hörig et al., 1999</xref>) where the peptide travels up and over Tyr84. Note that Tyr84 modestly rotated to facilitate the reported binding of calretulin to HLA-A*02:01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 1994</xref>), and the gate-open displacement of Tyr84 observed here confirms that the MHC I binding pocket is less rigid than previously realized. Importantly, this method of binding appears to be a major mechanism by which <italic>T. gondii</italic> and peptides are bound and presented in contrast to host-derived peptides where this mode of binding significantly less frequent.</p><p>The increased frequency of extended peptides following infection suggests that <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands emerge from a distinct pathway of antigen processing and presentation. Class I MHC peptide ligands are typically derived from the proteasomal degradation of cytosolic proteins, active transport by TAP into the lumen of the ER, further proteolytic trimming in the ER, and chaperone mediated loading into class I MHC prior to egress to the plasma membrane. In the case of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, parasites are contained within a fusion resistant parasitophorous vacuole (PV), making it necessary that alternative mechanisms contribute to <italic>T. gondii</italic> protein degradation, transport, and trimming prior to presentation. Current evidence shows that <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins secreted into the PV can be retrotransolcated via the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) complex from lumen of the PV to the host cytosol where they are routed to MHC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feliu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grover et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubbels et al., 2005</xref>). This process of presenting canonical peptide ligands from exogenous non-cytosolic proteins by class I MHC is referred to as cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard and Shastri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grotzke and Cresswell, 2015</xref>). The extended <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands observed here do not seem to fit this model of cross-presentation as their C-terminal extensions suggest a lack of interaction with proteolytic agents of the host cytosol and as many <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands are derived from proteins not secreted into the PV. Rather, infected cells seem to exhibit a distinct means of cross-presentation, almost as though extended ligands move directly from the PV or the pathogen itself to the host’s ER, forgoing exposure to carboxypeptidases found in the cytosol that are otherwise absent from the lumen of the ER. Indeed evidence of a semi-permeable channel between the PV and the ER might explain the presentation of extended peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldszmid et al., 2009</xref>). However it is that ligands of unusual length reach class I MHC, future studies of T cell immunogenicity to <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and possibly to other large intracellular pathogens, must factor the distinct environment of the infected cell into the identification of immune epitopes.</p><p>In summary, this study reports how antigens encoded by the large intracellular pathogen <italic>T. gondii</italic> are processed and presented by the host cell’s MHC I. Studies of peptides that are naturally processed and presented by the MHC I of mammalian cells have historically used healthy, or uninfected, cells to provide the baseline understanding for how antigens are made available for immune recognition. A foundation has emerged whereby peptide ligands of 9 amino acids are enveloped into an MHC I binding groove such that the central portions of the peptide ligand are available for review by adaptive immune receptors, and a legion of structural and functional data support this paradigm. Here we see that thousands of peptide ligands harvested from the MHC I of infected cells also fit this canonical antigen processing and presentation model, but in parallel we observe that alternate and unanticipated mechanisms result from infection and play a role in making <italic>T. gondii</italic> available for immune recognition. That long ligands can extend from their C-termini in a linear fashion out the end of what was previously recognized as a closed MHC I groove was unexpected. Our findings raise a plethora of important questions that must now be addressed, including whether other large intravacuolar pathogens such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species mediate similar changes to MHC I ligand presentation, how infection remodels host cell biology to facilitate the delivery of long extended ligands to MHC I, and the impact that unconventional ligand presentation has on adaptive immune responses to infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains</title><p>THP-1 cells acquired from ATCC (ATCC# TIB-202) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS.

This could be resolved for example by measuring the stability of the complexes (e.g. melting temperature) or the dissociation rates of the peptides.</italic></p><p>This is an outstanding point – characterizing the stability of these extended peptide/HLA complexes is positioned to further support the conclusions reached here. To address this point we have now performed thermostability assays on the two extended peptides YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR and FVLELEPEWTVK. We also completed a thermostability analysis with their respective binding cores. We find that the two extended ligand complexes are quite stable, having melting temperatures consistent with other reported HLA-A2 ligand complexes. Moreover, the core peptides, although they were never found to be presented, were considerably more stable, with a Tm of at least 10˚C above their extended counterpart. Thus, the extended ligands are stable in solution as compared to canonical as well as bulging peptide ligands while the core alone substantially increases the stability of the complex. In retrospect, it is likely that a highly stable core is key to the stability of the extended ligand. These data have been added as a new paragraph in the Results section of the manuscript along with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that depicts these data.</p><p><italic>2) All of the peptide ligands are eluted from an engineered, artificial HLA-A2 molecule that is designed to be secreted from the THP cells.

How have the authors ruled out that the longer T. gondii HLA-peptide ligands are not an artifact associated with the secreted HLA protein?</italic></p><p>The reviewers raise a question that we now address in the revised manuscript. While it is possible that the extended peptides are an artifact associated with the secreted HLA protein, there are previous studies demonstrating that secreted HLA proteins are not significantly altered in their trafficking or in their peptide repertoires (Skull et al 2012). Specifically, a study comparing secreted HLA-A*02:01 and membrane-bound HLA-A*02:01 shows that the secreted HLA traffics and matures in the same manner as membrane-bound HLA, albeit at different rates. Furthermore, there is little to no difference in the ligand repertoires of secreted and membrane-bound HLA (Skull et al 2012). In regards to the presentation of longer ligands, these data have been quietly emerging for some time, yet nobody has characterized them to the extent we have here. One analysis of ligands eluted from membrane-bound HLA ligands shows the presence of extended ligands, although the frequency of extended ligands was not addressed (Skull et al 2012, Chen et al 1994, and Hassan et al 2015). Reports of ligand extension in mouse MHC class I provide further evidence of extended ligands (Horig et al 1999). Simply put, membrane preparations of HLA provide relatively small quantities of eluted ligand for characterization. Furthermore, extended peptides remain hidden in membrane preparations of HLA because ligands from 3-6 HLA are usually characterized simultaneously such that it is difficult to assign a binding core and HLA restriction to the extended ligands and are often left out of the analysis. Secretion provides a single HLA so that extended ligands can clearly be assigned to their restricting class I molecule. Finally, the ligands discovered in secreted HLA have successfully been developed into viral vaccines and human melanoma vaccines (1, 2), demonstrating the biological relevance of the secreted HLA model. In summary, there is a considerable body of data supporting the use of secreted HLA to more fully appreciate ligand repertoires. Secreted HLA reflects membrane-bound HLA as demonstrated in both biochemical and clinical studies, and secreted HLA provides perhaps the only approach to clearly assign extended ligands to their corresponding HLA. We nonetheless included, in the revised manuscript, a Discussion statement suggesting that future studies using very large scale in vivomembrane-bound HLA will more definitively demonstrate these data.</p><p><italic>3) Why does the distribution of T. gondii derived peptides skew toward longer peptides than the host derived peptides? (One reviewer noted that the difference in the distributions of host-derived ligands between infected and uninfected cells seem to be derived from a single experiment</italic> – <italic>is there more data to support this?). The potential for cross-presentation is not discussed, and this issue should be addressed.</italic></p><p>Again, we are in complete agreement with the referees. To address this concern in the revised manuscript we have added a Discussion paragraph that briefly reviews cross-presentation and that expounds on possible cross-presentation mechanisms that might explain a possible mechanism by which extended <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands access the class I HLA peptide loading complex. We feel that this added paragraph succinctly addresses the potential role of cross-presentation in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Carreno BM, et al.
