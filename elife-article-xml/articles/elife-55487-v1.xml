Here, we report extensive phenotypic analyses of HIV-infected endometrial cells by CyTOF, and use a ‘nearest neighbor’ bioinformatics approach to trace cells to their original pre-infection phenotypes. Like in blood, HIV preferentially targets memory CD4+ T cells in the endometrium, but these cells exhibit unique phenotypes and sustain much higher levels of infection. Genital cell remodeling by HIV includes downregulating TCR complex components and modulating chemokine receptor expression to promote dissemination of infected cells to lymphoid follicles. HIV also upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5, which when blocked promotes death of infected endometrial cells. These results suggest that HIV remodels genital T cells to prolong viability and promote viral dissemination and that interfering with these processes might reduce the likelihood of systemic viral spread.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>female reproductive tract</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>t cells</kwd><kwd>mucosa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI127219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI147777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AI131374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF-DMS-1811866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Gourab</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HL146242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD4+ T cells from the female reproductive tract are unusually susceptible to HIV infection and are altered by HIV in ways that promote survival and systemic spread of the virus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual contact remains the most common mode of HIV transmission, and more than half of new worldwide infections occur in women. Most new cases arise in sub-Saharan Africa, where in 2018 four out of every five newly infected individuals aged 15–19 were female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">UNAIDS, 2019</xref>). The typical initial site of HIV acquisition in women is the female reproductive tract (FRT). Although HIV is initially deposited into the lower FRT (vagina and ectocervix), peristalsis propels vaginal lumen contents such as HIV into the upper FRT (endocervix, endometrium, and fallopian tubes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnhart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egli and Newton, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartman, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leyendecker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stieh et al., 2014</xref>). There, local exposure to progesterone may further increase the likelihood of infection by diminishing epithelial barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neidleman et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with both the upper and lower FRT being potential sites of transmission, SIV vaginal infection studies demonstrate that transmission can initiate throughout the entire FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stieh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Once infected, susceptible cells from the FRT become the founder population that eventually leads to systemic spread of the virus. A limited number of studies have queried the features of these initial HIV targets. Implementation of the FACS-based virion fusion assay – which identifies cells that HIV has entered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavrois et al., 2002</xref>) – on endocervical specimens revealed preferential entry of HIV into cells with higher levels of the CCR5 co-receptor and the activation/T resident memory (Trm) marker CD69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joag et al., 2016</xref>). A more recent study examining HIV fusion to cells isolated from endometrial and endocervical biopsies also found higher fusion to CD4+ T cells expressing CD69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavrois et al., 2019</xref>). Because fusion does not always lead to productive infection due to the activity of various post-entry viral restriction factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stevenson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zack et al., 1990</xref>), it is important to complement HIV fusion studies with assays that identify productively-infected cells.</p><p>To this end, FACS has been used to characterize expression levels of several cell surface receptors on FRT-derived cells productively-infected in vitro with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Swaims-Kohlmeier et al., 2016</xref>). These studies revealed interesting properties of HIV-infected FRT cells, but one limitation is their inability to determine whether such features are selected by HIV <italic>before</italic> infection, or changed by HIV via remodeling <italic>after</italic> infection. Indeed, HIV and other viruses markedly remodel cells by up- or down-regulating a variety of cell-surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sen et al., 2015</xref>), the classic example being the well-characterized decrease in surface expression of CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia and Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vincent et al., 1993</xref>). To distinguish between preferential infection versus remodeling, we recently implemented the bioinformatics approach SLIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sen et al., 2015</xref>) on HIV-infected tonsillar CD4+ T cells phenotyped with a 38-parameter CyTOF panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>). CyTOF, also known as mass cytometry, is a hybrid between mass spectrometry and flow cytometry that uses antibodies conjugated to metal lanthanides to quantify the expression levels of protein antigens on or within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendall et al., 2011</xref>). Because spectral overlap is not a limitation, CyTOF panels can be quite large allowing for deep phenotyping of individual cells. By matching the high-dimensional CyTOF profile of each HIV-infected cell to an ‘atlas’ of uninfected CD4+ T cells from the same donor, we are able to predict the phenotype of the original cell preferentially targeted for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>). Predictions made by this approach, which we term “Predicted Precursor as determined by SLIDE (PP-SLIDE)&quot;, were experimentally confirmed through sorting experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we employ a new and validated 38-parameter CyTOF panel tailored for genital T cells and implement PP-SLIDE to characterize the initial cells infected by HIV and the changes that take place in these cells. Our analysis – the first to analyze cells from the FRT by CyTOF – reveal that HIV efficiently infects these cells and remodels them in ways that favor prolonged cell survival and dissemination of the virus to lymphoid follicles within lymph nodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endometrial cells are highly susceptible to infection by CCR5-tropic HIV</title><p>While CD4+ T cells from unstimulated PBMCs are poorly permissive to productive infection by HIV, a fraction of these cells within tonsils are efficiently infected in the absence of ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glushakova et al., 1997</xref>). To determine whether genital T cells are similarly permissive in the absence of stimulation, we exposed single-cell suspensions of cells isolated from endometrial biopsies to the HIV-F4.HSA reporter virus. This replication-competent, Nef-sufficient virus harbors the 109FPB4 transmitted/founder (T/F) CCR5-tropic Env, and encodes an LTR-driven heat-stable antigen (HSA) cell-surface protein enabling identification of productively-infected cells by either FACS or CyTOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>). To boost infection rates, the semen-derived viral enhancer SEM86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roan et al., 2014</xref>) was added to all specimens (see Materials and Methods). Three days after exposure to the reporter virus or media alone as a negative control, cells were analyzed by FACS. CD4+ T cells were identified as live, singlet CD3+CD8- cells, to include cells that have downregulated cell-surface CD4 due to the activity of HIV accessory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia and Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vincent et al., 1993</xref>). A distinct population of CD3+CD8-CD4<sup>low</sup>HSA+ cells was observed in the HIV-exposed but not mock-treated culture, suggesting that productive infection of endometrial T cells (hereafter referred to as ETs) does not require ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To compare infection levels in ETs vs. T cells from other sites, we exposed equivalent numbers of cells from unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs and from tonsils (through generation of human lymphoid aggregate cultures, or HLACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>]) to the same dose of F4.HSA in the presence of SEM86. As expected, infection rates were higher in tonsils and stimulated PBMCs than in unstimulated PBMCs. Remarkably, infection rates were more than an order of magnitude higher in ETs than in any of the other tested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unstimulated endometrial T cells are highly susceptible to infection by CCR5-tropic HIV.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FACS plots demonstrating a distinct population of productively-infected endometrial T cells (ETs) following exposure to the HIV reporter strain F4.HSA.

After 3 days, infected cells (surrounded by a black ring) are identified as those expressing the HIV reporter HSA.

By using PP-SLIDE to identify for every infected cell the phenotypically most similar cell in the uninfected culture (upward arrows), we identify the PRE cells which harbor the predicted phenotypes of the original cells targeted for HIV infection.

This visualization method places phenotypically similar cells close together and can be used to identify local ‘islands’ of related cells. For both PBMCs and ETs, T cells from the uninfected culture (in aqua) segregated away from infected T cells from the infected culture (in magenta) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting HIV-induced remodeling.

Furthermore, transfer of supernatants from infected cultures to uninfected cultures in the presence of antiretroviral drugs to prevent infection did not lead to marked remodeling of the Tm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>).

This method, schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, assumes that a subset of the infected cell’s original identity markers is retained in a manner that can be captured by high-parameter phenotypic analyses such as that offered by CyTOF. By using a k-nearest neighbor approach to identify, for every infected cell, the phenotypically most similar T cell in the uninfected culture, we obtain a set of PRE cells that harbor the predicted phenotypes of the original cells targeted for HIV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Comparing the PRE cells to the entire population of uninfected T cells enables us to identify the features of cells that are preferentially targeted for infection by HIV.</p><p>After converting all the infected cells to their corresponding PRE cells, we assessed what T cell subsets they belonged to: memory CD4+ T cells (Tm), naïve CD4+ T cells (Tn), memory CD8+ T cells, or naïve CD8+ T cells. The PRE cells from both PBMCs and ETs were almost exclusively Tm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Among the Tm cells from both blood and the endometrium, effector memory T cells (Tem) were preferentially infected while central memory T cells (Tcm) were largely spared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To confirm these PP-SLIDE predictions experimentally, we sorted Tm cells based on surface expression of the Tcm marker CCR7 and infected them with F4.HSA. Endometrial biopsies yielded too few cells for this assay, but we successfully sorted Tm cells with different levels of CCR7 expression from PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Infection rates inversely correlated with CCR7 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>), validating the PP-SLIDE prediction. Direct comparison of the frequencies of Tn, Tem, and Tcm subsets in the specimens analyzed by CyTOF revealed Tn and Tcm frequencies to be higher in blood, and Tem frequencies to be higher in the endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>).

Markers of Th1 and Th2 cells (Tbet and CRTH2, respectively) were elevated as well, suggesting that HIV-susceptible cells among ETs may be more polarized than their blood counterparts. PRE cells also expressed elevated levels of Blimp-1 and BIRC5, which may facilitate the ability of these cells to support productive infection by promoting HIV transcription and enhanced survival of the infected cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaczmarek Michaels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Clustering reveals a diverse array of HIV-susceptible Tm cells in endometrium but not blood</title><p>We next implemented a complementary approach that incorporates all phenotyping parameters instead of manual gating in order to define cellular subsets.

To probe further whether the high susceptibility of ETs to infection was due to an increased state of T cell activation, we compared the features of HIV-susceptible cells from ETs to those of ex vivo stimulated T cells. ETs, unstimulated PBMCs, or PHA-stimulated PBMCs as a source of activated T cells, were inoculated with F4.HSA and processed for CyTOF analysis after 3 days. As expected, the infection rate was lowest in the unstimulated PBMCs. Interestingly, although the infection rate in stimulated PBMCs was an order of magnitude higher than that in unstimulated PBMCs, it was still lower than that in unstimulated ETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7C</xref>).

The PRE cells also had higher CD4 MSI than the infected cells, consistent with downregulation of CD4 upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then explored whether other components of the TCR signaling apparatus were also modulated by infection. CD28 and ICOS, co-stimulatory receptors important for signaling through the TCR, were both downregulated by infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of CD45RO, a splice form of CD45 which is important in T cell activation and stabilizing T cell binding to B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ledbetter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stamenkovic et al., 1991</xref>), was also downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results demonstrate that multiple components of the TCR signaling apparatus are downregulated upon HIV infection of genital T cells.</p><p>We went on to study whether any modulations that might promote systemic spread of the virus could be identified. The integrin α4β1 directs CD4+ T cells to the FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davila et al., 2014</xref>). Although we did not see differences in β1 expression between uninfected, PRE, or infected cells, there was selection of α4<sup>low</sup> cells for infection, followed by further down-regulation of α4 after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These events may facilitate exit of the infected cells from the genital tract.</p><p>Because lymph nodes provide a rich source of permissive CD4+ T cells that can propagate viral spread, we assessed whether there was evidence of upregulation of homing receptors that promote migration to lymph nodes. CCR7 is a homing receptor whose cell-intrinsic expression has been shown to be necessary for CD4+ T cells to depart mucosal tissues and migrate into draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bromley et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies using cells isolated from cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) demonstrated that Tm cells express high levels of CCR7 relative to memory CD8+ T cells, and that ex vivo exposure of these cells to HIV resulted in equivalent numbers of infected CCR7+ and CCR7- Tm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Swaims-Kohlmeier et al., 2016</xref>). We found that similar to cells from CVLs, endometrial Tm expressed more CCR7 than their CD8+ counterparts and that CCR7 levels were similar between uninfected and HIV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Interestingly, however, infected cells expressed higher levels of CCR7 than PRE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This finding suggests that cells with low levels of CCR7 are preferentially susceptible to infection, but that HIV infection actively upregulates expression of CCR7, which may help direct these cells to the lymph nodes. The higher susceptibility of the CCR7- Tm cells to HIV infection is consistent with the notion that Tem (which are CCR7-) are preferentially targeted for infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and may be attributable to the relatively higher levels of CCR5 on these cells relative to their CCR7+ counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Given that HIV actively replicates within the follicles of lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>), we also assessed expression levels of CXCR5, a chemokine receptor that directs cells from the extrafollicular region to the lymphoid follicles. CXCR5 was preferentially expressed on PRE cells, consistent with Tfh (which are CXCR5+) being preferential HIV targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and further upregulated by HIV after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

We further explore how these cells are remodeled by HIV and the potential biological consequences of these changes. We find that endometrial CD4+ T cells undergo unusually high levels of productive infection with R5-tropic HIV-1, likely reflecting in part the high expression of the CCR5 co-receptor on these cells. Consistent with our results, a prior study had found higher levels of HIV fusion to CD4+ T cells from FRT compared to blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joag et al., 2016</xref>). However, these fusion assays do not provide information on remodeling since these events occur later in the viral life cycle. Additionally, fusion does not equate productive infection due to the presence of various post-entry host restriction factors for HIV. In our study, we have characterized productively-infected cells, and by converting all infected cells to PRE cells via PP-SLIDE, were able to conduct an in-depth phenotypic analysis of the types of genital T cells preferentially targeted for productive infection by HIV, and to define precisely the remodeling events that occur in these cells.</p><p>The preferential targets of HIV in the FRT were memory CD4+ T cells, while their naïve counterparts were markedly resistant. Moreover, the most susceptible cells corresponded to Tem cells, while Tcm cells were largely spared. We observed preferential infection of Tem in PBMCs as well, consistent with prior reports of blood Tem cells being more susceptible than Tcm to DC-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-infection by an R5-tropic HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groot et al., 2006</xref>). Further characterization of the highly-susceptible Tem cells from the FRT revealed them to be comprised of multiple effector subsets including, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Tfh, and Trm cells, with the Th1, Th2, Tfh, and Trm cell subsets being particularly prone to infection. These subsets have been reported to also be preferentially targeted by HIV in blood and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gosselin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moonis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perreau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Trm cells were previously identified as preferential targets for infection in the cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantero-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>), similar to our findings in endometrial cells. Surprisingly, although we found Th17 cells among the HIV-susceptible cells in the endometrium, we did not find evidence of preferential selection of this cellular subset. This result differed from the observed increased infection of genital Th17 cells in SIV-infected macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stieh et al., 2014</xref>). The reason for the apparent discrepancy is unclear, but may reflect differences between HIV and SIV, tissue site examined, conditions of infection, and/or the relatively low frequencies of Th17 in the human endometrium. Of note, the preferential infection of Th17 cells by SIV was observed primarily in the lower reproductive tract with lower infection levels in the upper FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stieh et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with our results, an ex vivo HIV infection study did not find a significant difference in the proportion of infected endometrial T cells that did or did not express the Th17 marker CCR6. This study also found a relatively low frequency of Th17 cells in the endometrium relative to the lower FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our study also led to important insights into how HIV remodels its host cell. Interestingly, the remodeling that was observed required productive infection, since bystander Tm cells in infected cultures exhibited limited remodeling, as did Tm cells treated with culture supernatants from infected cultures. Cell-intrinsic innate immune recognition, active remodeling by viral accessory genes, and/or DNA damage responses as a result of viral integration are all potential contributors to the observed remodeling. Which proteins exhibit altered expression levels as a result of infection? Prior SILAC-based proteomics have been used to address this question but due to sample requirements, these analyses were limited to cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>). By implementing PP-SLIDE on HIV-infected genital cells phenotyped by CyTOF, we were able to characterize cellular remodeling by HIV at the single-cell level. We find that HIV significantly remodels both endometrial cells and PBMCs following infection and that remodeling involves downregulation of cell-surface CD4, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia and Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vincent et al., 1993</xref>), but also downregulation of other components of the TCR complex. In particular, the co-stimulatory molecules CD28 and ICOS, and the CD45RO spliced from of the CD45 phosphatase, are significantly downregulated by HIV infection. CD28 downregulation has been linked to Nef activity and is thought to promote disengagement of T cells from antigen presenting cells, thereby disrupting TCR signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swigut et al., 2001</xref>). ICOS is closely related to CD28 and the two function similarly during expansion, survival, and differentiation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Berkel and Oosterwegel, 2006</xref>). The downregulation of both co-stimulatory molecules by HIV, along with CD45 that stabilizes the interactions of T cells with B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ledbetter et al., 1993</xref>), suggests that disrupting TCR signaling in CD4+ T cells at the portal of viral entry may provide an evolutionary advantage for the virus.</p><p>We also identify a number of host proteins that are upregulated by HIV during infection, including CCR7, CXCR5, and CD69. A recent study suggested that CCR7 may drive migration of HIV-infected cells from the lower FRT to the lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Swaims-Kohlmeier et al., 2016</xref>). That study also demonstrated that HIV-infected T cells from CVL consist of equal proportions of CCR7+ and CCR7- Tm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Swaims-Kohlmeier et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we find that the levels of CCR7 are not significantly different in uninfected and infected Tm cells. Interestingly, we do find that PRE cells express significantly lower levels of CCR7 than both total Tm cells and HIV-infected cells, suggesting that HIV selects CCR7<sup>low</sup> cells for infection, but then as part of remodeling upregulates expression of this homing receptor. The likely reason for preferential infection of the CCR7<sup>low</sup> cells is high expression of the CCR5 co-receptor on these cells. The reason behind why HIV has evolved to upregulate CCR7 is unclear, but we speculate that it may help promote systemic spread of the virus from the FRT by directing infected cells to regional lymph nodes.</p><p>Further supporting this notion is our finding that the virus also upregulates expression of CXCR5, which directs T cells into the lymph node follicles, a known site of HIV replication in infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>). Together with our observation and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>) that HIV downregulates the α4 component of the genital-homing α4β1 integrin, these findings highlight how infected cells from the genital tract may be directed to the follicles of draining lymph nodes where a rich source of CD4+ target cells can further facilitate even broader tissue spread of the virus.</p><p>The finding that HIV preferentially infects CD69+ Trm cells from the FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantero-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>) may seem at odds with our model for how infection promotes changes leading to viral dissemination, since CD69 inhibits S1P1 to promote cellular retention within tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bankovich et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that HIV even further upregulated CD69 upon infection, similar to what has been observed in a cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is important to note that CD69 expression is not sufficient to confer tissue residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beura et al., 2018</xref>) and that CD4+ Trm cells tend to circulate to a greater exent than their CD8+ counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebhardt et al., 2011</xref>). We postulate that a subpopulation of infected cells expressing CD69, CCR7, and CXCR5 continue to traffic from the genital mucosa to the follicles of regional lymph nodes promoting viral spread.</p><p>In addition to remodeling of homing receptors, HIV infection of genital T cells also upregulates expression of BIRC5, an anti-apoptotic protein recently shown to promote the survival of HIV-infected blood-derived CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, PP-SLIDE suggests that the increase in BIRC5 expression in HIV-infected genital T cells is due to a combination of HIV preferentially infecting cells with higher levels of BIRC5 followed by further upregulation of this protein within the infected cells. The mechanism by which HIV actively upregulates BIRC5 expression remains unclear, but these events likely help further propel viral dissemination. Inhibition of BIRC5 with the YM155 small molecule antagonist is associated with decreased frequency of HIV-infected genital cells likely reflecting increased apoptosis of these cells. Interestingly, the HIV-susceptible cells that survive in the presence of YM155 exhibit unique phenotypic features including increased levels of NFAT, Tbet, and CXCR4. These factors have been previously associated with inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of T cell survival and may compensate for the loss of BIRC5 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>). Defining the precise signaling pathways enabling survival of these remaining cells may help identify additional drug targets aimed at limiting the survival of HIV-infected cells.</p><p>Our experimental system has some limitations. Like any system that entails viral infection of primary cells, it requires that the cells be cultured for multiple days in order to allow enough time for productive infection to occur. The ex vivo culture of primary cells can lead to phenotypic drift, the phenomenon whereby the phenotypes of cells diverge from their original in vivo state during ex vivo culture. A second limitation of our system is that the endometrial biopsies need to be digested with collagenase to isolate single-cell suspensions of FRT cells for the infection assay. This digestion cleaves some cell-surface markers, although re-expression of the markers occurs upon culturing of the cells. While these effects are impossible to avoid, we do not think they biased our results as all our infected endometrial specimens were compared to mock-treated cells that were digested similarly and cultured for the same period of time.</p><p>Our findings that HIV infects a diverse array of CD4+ T cells in the FRT (with the notable exception of naïve and Tcm cells), and remodels these cells in ways that can promote viral dissemination, may help explain the generally poor effectiveness of oral PrEP or microbicides in protecting women from sexual transmission of HIV. However, certainly other factors including adherence and genital drug levels also play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cottrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges-Mameletzis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riddell et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings also suggest that vaccines designed to elicit protective anti-HIV CD4+ T cell responses in the genital mucosa, for example via the ‘prime and pull’ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and Iwasaki, 2012</xref>), need to consider the high diversity of HIV-susceptible genital T cells present and the high levels of HIV infection supported by these cells. Such strategies may perhaps be most effective if they can preferentially elicit the poorly-susceptible subsets of Tcm and encourage their migration into the FRT. Moreover, combination microbicides that include components that can either disrupt the lymph node homing affinity of HIV-infected cells or the ability of HIV to promote the survival of infected cells – in particular the clinically approved BIRC5 inhibitor YM155 – could improve the overall effectiveness of these agents and provide at-risk women with the power to protect themselves from HIV acquisition. A key next step for the field will be to confirm in vivo the findings reported here using FRT specimens from non-human primate models of HIV transmission or from people living with HIV.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Endometrial tissue processing and cell isolation</title><p>Fresh human endometrial biopsies from HIV seronegative women were obtained from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) (IRB # 14–15361) and the Women’s Health Clinic of Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) in Virginia (CIP # NMCP.2016.0068), under standard operating procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fassbender et al., 2014</xref>).

FCS files corresponding to Tm cells (defined as CD3+CD8-CD45RA-CD45RO+ cells) were exported from FlowJo for FlowSOM analysis in Cytobank. FlowSOM was constructed using the default settings (Clustering method: Hierarchical consensus; Iterations: 10; Seed: Automatic) with a modification of total metaclusters from 10 to 20. All of the cell-related surface and intracellular antigens were used as clustering channels, except for CD19, CD8, CD45RA, and HSA, which were parameters used in the upstream gating strategy. For calculating the proportion of each cluster in the pie chart, the total cell numbers and the cell numbers in each cluster were exported from Cytobank and the proportion of each cluster was calculated using the following equation:</p><p>P(X) = [(number of cells in Cluster X) / (total number of cells)] * 100</p><p>For each sample, the proportions of each cluster at a frequency &gt;1% are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To explore whether PRE cells preferentially resided within any of the clusters, or alternatively whether the PRE cells were stochastically distributed, we compared the frequency of each cluster among total uninfected Tm cells versus PRE cells by calculating chi-square values (see below).

Student’s two-sided paired (by donor) t-tests were used to test for differences in MSI of each parameter among uninfected cells, PRE cells, and infected cells, or among PRE cells from ETs and PBMCs. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate (FDR) via the Benjamini-Hochberg method. FDR adjusted P-values that were less than 0.05 were considered as significant.</p><p>SLIDE analysis was conducted using the R package SLIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>). The method tests the global hypothesis of remodeling in infected cells based on multi-parameter protein expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sen et al., 2014</xref>). A nearest-neighbor approach is used in the SLIDE test, which enables it to identify remodeling in the presence of heterogeneity in the uninfected samples. Each infected cell is projected onto the uninfected sample to obtain its PRE cell. As there can wide variability in the characteristics of these PRE cells which can arise from different sub-populations, we compared the distance between the infected cell and its PRE cell taking into account the uninfected sample density at the PRE cell. This was done by calculating the distance between the PRE cell to its nearest neighbor cell in the uninfected sample. The ratios between these distances provides the remodeling score based on which the P-value of having significant viral remodeling of 20% or more global fold change is reported. To determine whether the SLIDE scores for infected PBMCs and ETs were significantly different, we considered a two-sample non-paired t-test based on the remodeling ratios from the two experiments corresponding to each particular donor, and reported the P value. Where indicated, SLIDE scores were calculated between bystander or conditioned media-treated cells by matching these cells against their uninfected cell counterparts, or among YM155-treated uninfected cells by matching against their non-YM155-treated uninfected counterparts.</p><p>Chi-squared test statistics values from the FlowSOM analyses were generated based on a goodness of fit test between the distribution of clusters between uninfected Tm and the PRE cells. To determine whether the chi-squared values between PBMCs and ETs were different, a conservative asymptotic test incorporating degrees of freedom correction was implemented. If S<sub>p</sub>(n<sub>p</sub>) and S<sub>e</sub>(n<sub>e</sub>) were respectively the chi-square statistic values from the PBMC and ET comparisons based on n<sub>p</sub> and n<sub>e</sub> groups, then, for testing the alternative hypothesis that PBMC chi-square values were significantly higher than the corresponding ET values, the P-value was computed based on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> having an asymptotic standard normal distribution.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 AI127219, R01 AI147777, and P01 AI131374 to NRR) and the National Science Foundation (NSF-DMS-1811866 to GM).

infects T cells from the female genital tract and remodels them to promote systemic viral spread&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marta Rodriguez-Garcia (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ma and colleagues evaluate the susceptibility of endometrial CD4+ T cells to HIV infection. They perform in-depth phenotypic analyses of HIV-infected T cells isolated from the female reproductive tract (FRT) using a Mass Cytometry approach (CyTOF).</p><p>The authors find that endometrial T cells are more susceptible to infection than blood T cells, and that the initial targets in the endometrium are phenotypically more diverse compared to blood T cells. Additionally, they identify specific modifications induced by productive HIV-infection that may result in increased cell survival, impaired antigen recognition and viral dissemination of HIV-infected cells to lymphatic tissues. Finally, they observed that HIV infection upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5 also in T cells from FRT as previously observed in CD4 T cells form peripheral blood (Kuo et al., 2018).</p><p>The major conclusion is, thus, that HIV reprograms the phenotypic profile of the infected cells in favor of the virus, by e. g. manipulating cell trafficking and cell survival mechanisms/cell surface markers. The study takes advantage of impressive, recently-developed technologies, including biocomputational algorithms for identifying &quot;predicted precursors&quot; of infected cells — a technique to infer the phenotypic profile of cells prior to infection.</p><p>In conclusion, the work is original, novel and presents three key components that differentiate this study from previous work: the use of transmitter/founder viruses, the inclusion of semen component in the infection protocol and the focus on endometrium. All three reviewers express high enthusiasm for the presented work, which represents a very notable advance to the field. The reviewers identified two very novel and unique findings that need additional work: 1) the high susceptibility of endometrial cells compared to blood cells and 2) the modification of cells following infection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the most important findings of this manuscript is that non-stimulated endometrial CD4 T cells are much more permissive to HIV infection than activated CD4 T cells from blood. This striking finding needs be analyzed in more detail — can the authors be more specific what mechanisms are responsible for this difference? Consideration should be given to using alternative viral species (e. g. X4-tropic or VSV-G pseudotyped viruses). The authors should also show the percentage of naÐ¯ve, CM and EM in in both PBMC and T cells from endometrial biopsies. These data would give the information on how many T cells from FRT are potentially targets for infection.</p><p>2A) The key experiment missing from the study is a control demonstrating that blocking infection abrogates remodeling. The study compares uninfected vs. infected T cells, which are analyzed only at day 3 post-infection. A control including T cells exposed to HIV in the presence of antiviral drugs that prevent productive infection (blocking RT for example) would demonstrate that productive infection is necessary for the remodeling effects observed.</p><p>2B) The authors conclude that the differences between infected and uninfected cells are due to remodeling induced by productive infection. But the data is generated by pre-gating the HIV+ population and comparing it to uninfected cells, which were not exposed to the virus. How would the t-SNE analysis look like if the whole population of cells that was exposed to the virus was included in the analysis? Are the HSA negative cells also modified? This would indicate an effect of viral exposure or indirect effects induced by other cells present in the mixture instead of direct modification by productive infection.</p><p>2C) The authors should also discuss the mechanisms leading to &quot;remodeling&quot; or reprogramming of phenotypic properties of infected cells more clearly — is this related to cell-intrinsic innate immune recognition? Is it related to cytopathic effects? Is it related to DNA damage responses resulting from chromosomal integration?</p><p>3) It is unclear whether PBMCs and tonsil cells were incubated with SEM86 for comparisons, and whether uninfected controls were treated with SEM86. How long was SEM86 incubation? Did it modify the phenotype of the cells by itself in the absence of virus? These controls need to be shown. This is a key difference in this study compared to other studies characterizing HIV infection in the genital tract, and it should be mentioned in the Results as well.</p><p>4) The analysis done to identify the PRE cells considers the HIV-infected cells three days after infection and analyzes the uninfected control (also three days of incubation?) to find the original preferential cell infected. How is this model accounting for the potential effects of culturing the cells? The uninfected control three days after culture is probably different than the initial population of cells present when infection was performed on day 0. What if specific T cell subsets survive culture conditions better than others?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55487.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the most important findings of this manuscript is that non-stimulated endometrial CD4 T cells are much more permissive to HIV infection than activated CD4 T cells from blood.

We found that relative to their blood counterparts, ET Tm cells expressed significantly higher levels of six of the eight activation markers (Figure 2—figure supplement 7A), and more frequently expressed the CCR5 co-receptor (Figure 2—figure supplement 7B). These results imply that both activation state and co-receptor expression may contribute to the increased permissivity of the ET Tm cells.</p><p>To assess whether the activation state of T cells alone can account for the high susceptibility of ETs to infection, we conducted an experiment where unstimulated ETs, unstimulated PBMCs, and PHA-stimulated PBMCs (as an abundant source of highly activated T cells) were exposed to F4.HSA, phenotyped by CyTOF, and analyzed by PP-SLIDE. Of note, the ETs and PBMCs in this experiment were all from the same donor. We found the following: (1) infection rates were higher in the unstimulated ETs than the PHA-stimulated PBMCs; (2) the phenotypes of the HIV-susceptible cells in unstimulated ETs were distinct from those in stimulated PBMCs; (3) multiple activation markers were expressed at higher levels on the stimulated PBMCs than the unstimulated ETs, despite the former being relatively less susceptible to infection; and (4) CCR5 levels were higher on the unstimulated ET Tm cells than stimulated PBMC Tm cells. These data are presented as the new Figure 2—figure supplement 7C-G. Together, these results suggest that T cell activation state does not fully account for the high susceptibility of ETs to infection. Instead, the high levels of CCR5 expression, and other unique aspects described in this manuscript, appear to be more important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also show the percentage of naïve, CM and EM in in both PBMC and T cells from endometrial biopsies.

While the proportion of Tn and Tcm cells was significantly lower in the endometrium than in blood, Tem cells showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that one mechanism rendering ET cells more susceptible than their blood counterparts is the higher frequency of Tem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2A) The key experiment missing from the study is a control demonstrating that blocking infection abrogates remodeling.

Instead of just adding ART to our infection assay, we first set up cultures of endometrial cells mock-treated or infected for 3 days with F4.HSA. We then took the supernatants from these two cultures and used them as a source of conditioned media, which we added to target cells isolated from the same endometrial biopsies, but in the presence of suppressive ART. The rationale for using conditioned media containing HIV, as opposed to free HIV virions, is that the conditioned media contains infection-associated factors such as cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, that may induce phenotypic changes in cells. In this experimental system, our target cells are exposed to both virions and conditioned media from infected cells, but cannot become infected with the virus due to ART. The results of these experiments, conducted on two donor specimens, revealed that endometrial Tm cells exposed to conditioned media from infected cultures in the presence of ART are not remodeled, as they exhibit lower SLIDE scores than productively-infected cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C), and appear in similar regions of t-SNE space as Tm cells exposed to conditioned media from uninfected cultures (Figure 2—figure supplement 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2B) The authors conclude that the differences between infected and uninfected cells are due to remodeling induced by productive infection. But the data is generated by pre-gating the HIV+ population and comparing it to uninfected cells, which were not exposed to the virus. How would the t-SNE analysis look like if the whole population of cells that was exposed to the virus was included in the analysis? Are the HSA negative cells also modified? This would indicate an effect of viral exposure or indirect effects induced by other cells present in the mixture instead of direct modification by productive infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this suggested analysis as the new Figure 2—figure supplement 4A. In contrast to the productively-infected HSA+ cells, the bystander (HSA-) Tm cells resided in regions of the t-SNE similar to regions occupied by Tm cells in the uninfected sample. Furthermore, the SLIDE scores for the HSA+ cells were significantly higher than that of the HSA- Tm cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4B), confirming that remodeling is primarily driven by productive infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2C) The authors should also discuss the mechanisms leading to &quot;remodeling&quot; or reprogramming of phenotypic properties of infected cells more clearly — is this related to cell-intrinsic innate immune recognition? Is it related to cytopathic effects? Is it related to DNA damage responses resulting from chromosomal integration?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, in contrast to productively-infected cells, bystander cells in infected cultures exhibit limited remodeling. These results suggest that the extensive remodeling that we observe requires proviral integration. The fact that bystander cells exhibit limited remodeling, and that addition of supernatants from infected cultures whilst blocking productive infection with antiretroviral drugs does not induce remodeling in the Tm cells (see above), suggests that the inflammatory cytokine milieu is not sufficient to remodel cells. Rather, it is likely that cell-intrinsic innate immune recognition and/or DNA damage responses, as well as viral-induced remodeling through the activity of viral accessory genes, drives the remodeling. Cytopathic effects are unlikely contributing as we had gated on live cells in our analyses. These concepts are now brought forth in the Discussion (paragraph three).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear whether PBMCs and tonsil cells were incubated with SEM86 for comparisons, and whether uninfected controls were treated with SEM86.</p></disp-quote><p>In the study comparing PBMCs and tonsil cells'responses to SEM86, all samples (including the uninfected ones) were treated with SEM86. This has now been clarified in the Results section (paragraph one).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long was SEM86 incubation?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of details on the experimental protocol implemented for SEM86 treatment. We had incubated the virus for 15-30 minutes with 100 μg/ml SEM86, followed by dilution of this viral stock 10-fold onto target cells. The details of the protocol have now been added to the Materials and methods section (subsection &quot;Virus Preparation and infection assays&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did it modify the phenotype of the cells by itself in the absence of virus?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that SEM86 did not remodel the cells independent of virus, because limited remodeling was observed in the bystander cells in the culture that were exposed to the same amount of SEM86 (see above). Consistent with this notion, in our FACS experiments the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD3 and CD4 was not significantly different between T cells treated or not with SEM86. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>SEM86 does not alter the surface expression levels of CD3 or CD4 in primary T cells.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55487-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These controls need to be shown.

How is this model accounting for the potential effects of culturing the cells? The uninfected control three days after culture is probably different than the initial population of cells present when infection was performed on day 0. What if specific T cell subsets survive culture conditions better than others?</p></disp-quote><p>The uninfected control was indeed mock-treated for 3 days. This has now been clarified in the Materials and methods (subsection &quot;Virus Preparation and infection assays&quot;). We opted to not compare the infected cells from day 3 to uninfected cells from day 0, since if that were done the phenotypic changes in the infected cells would reflect not only changes induced by infection, but also phenotypic changes that incur during ex vivo culture of primary cells, a process known as phenotypic drift. Such changes could include, as the reviewer mentions, the preferential survival of particular T cell subsets. To confirm that drift did occur in ETs, we conducted CyTOF analysis on an endometrial specimen immediately after generating the single-cell suspension of the freshly isolated specimen (day 0), and after 3 days of culturing the specimen in media (day 3). A t-SNE analysis of the resulting CyTOF datasets demonstrated differences between Tm cells of the two specimens, as revealed by the cells occupying unique regions of the t-SNE space, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic drift occurs upon culturing of freshly isolated endometrial T cells for 3 days.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55487-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>These results suggest that drift does indeed occur in ETs, but is an unavoidable issue with any kind of ex vivo viral infection experiments using primary cells targets. Of note, the phenotypic differences between the Day 0 and Day 3 specimens may also be in part due to the lack of time for the Day 0 specimen to re-express antigens following collagenase digestion. To recognize drift as an unavoidable limitation of our experimental model, we have now brought up the issue in the Discussion, as well as how we tried to account for it by always comparing infected samples to uninfected ones cultured for the same period of time (paragraph eight).</p></body></sub-article></article>
