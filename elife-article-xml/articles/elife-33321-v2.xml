Here, we describe a novel resting-state network based on the delayed connectivity between the brain and the slow electrical rhythm (0.05 Hz) generated in the stomach. The gastric network cuts across classical resting-state networks with partial overlap with autonomic regulation areas. This network is composed of regions with convergent functional properties involved in mapping bodily space through touch, action or vision, as well as mapping external space in bodily coordinates. The network is characterized by a precise temporal sequence of activations within a gastric cycle, beginning with somato-motor cortices and ending with the extrastriate body area and dorsal precuneus. Our results demonstrate that canonical resting-state networks based on instantaneous connectivity represent only one of the possible partitions of the brain into coherent networks based on temporal dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33321.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is always active. Even when it is not receiving sensory input, it generates its own spontaneous activity. This activity shapes how we interpret future sensory signals and creates our inner mental world. Moreover, this spontaneous activity is not random. When a healthy volunteer lies inside a brain scanner without performing any task, his or her brain shows predictable patterns of activity. Specific groups of brain regions – often with related roles – become active at the same time as one another. Each set of regions is referred to as a resting state network.</p><p>Of course, the brain does not operate in isolation from the rest of the body. Our internal organs continuously send signals to the brain via the spinal cord and cranial nerves. Specialized cells in the stomach wall in particular produce a slow rhythmic pattern of electrical activity. Known as the gastric rhythm, this activity helps ensure that the stomach muscles contract at the correct speed for digestion. But the stomach also produces this rhythm even when empty, suggesting that it has other roles too.</p><p>To find out what these might be, Rebollo et al. placed electrodes on the abdomen of healthy volunteers lying inside brain scanners. By examining the volunteers’ spontaneous brain activity, Rebollo et al. identified a new resting state network that is active in synchrony with the gastric rhythm. The regions within this so-called gastric network are not active at the same time as each other, but instead become active in a specific sequence that is repeated at each gastric cycle. Many of the regions within the gastric network belong to other resting state networks too. Some of the regions help regulate automatic bodily functions such as heart rate, while others process information about the body’s position in space.</p><p>The existence of the gastric network suggests a link between the automatic regulation of processes such as digestion, and spontaneous brain activity. Future studies could examine whether this link impacts perception and cognition, and whether this link plays a role in disorders where the connection between the digestive system and the brain appears to be altered.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>resting-state networks</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>phase synchrony</kwd><kwd>body maps</kwd><kwd>gastric rhythm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>670325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallon-Baudry</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallon-Baudry</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DIM cerveau et pensee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebollo</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebollo</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallon-Baudry</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coupling between the gastric rhythm and brain activity at rest reveals a novel resting-state network, characterized by delayed functional connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The parsing of the brain into resting-state networks (RSNs) has been widely exploited to study the brain’s functional architecture in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>). With long-time scales, RSNs closely match the anatomical backbone of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van den Heuvel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Honey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). With short-time scales (~10–100 s), spontaneous brain activity is characterized by the emergence and dissolution of network patterns encompassing and extending classical RSN topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shine et al., 2016</xref>) with rich temporal trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>). Temporal trajectories indicate the existence of delays between regions, whereas the methods most often used to parse brain activity into functional networks (seed-based correlation and independent component analysis) make the implicit assumption that RSNs are characterized by instantaneous or zero delay connectivity. Therefore, we analyzed delayed connectivity in resting-state BOLD signals using techniques widely used in electrophysiological studies of large-scale brain dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) that quantify the stability of temporal delays between time series.</p><p>More specifically, we studied the delayed coupling between resting-state brain activity and a visceral organ, the stomach. The stomach continuously produces a slow electrical rhythm (0.05 Hz, one cycle every 20 s) that can be non-invasively measured (electrogastrogram, EGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koch and Stern, 2004</xref>]). The gastric basal rhythm is continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozler, 1945</xref>) and intrinsically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suzuki et al., 1986</xref>) generated in the stomach wall by a network of specialized cells, the interstitial cells of Cajal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>), which form synapse-like connections not only with gastric smooth muscle but also with afferent sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Powley and Phillips, 2011</xref>). The stomach is an interesting candidate for large-scale brain coordination for several reasons. First, visceral inputs can reach a number of cortical targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Critchley and Harrison, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park and Tallon-Baudry, 2014</xref>). Second, gastric frequency (~0.05 Hz) falls within the range of BOLD fluctuations that are used to define RSNs and that are free from known cardiac and respiratory artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glerean et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the amplitude of alpha rhythm, the dominant rhythm in the human brain at rest, depends on the phase of gastric rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We simultaneously recorded brain activity with fMRI and stomach activity with EGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) in 30 human participants at rest with open eyes. We then determined the regions in which spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity were phase synchronized with gastric basal rhythm; we refer to these regions as the gastric network.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33321.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The electrogastrogram (EGG) and gastric-BOLD coupling.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bipolar electrode montage used to record the EGG.

The mean EGG peak frequency across the 30 participants was 0.047 Hz (±SD 0.003, range 0.041–0.053). EGG peak frequency measured inside and outside the scanner did not differ (EGG outside the scanner measured in 29 of the 30 participants, mean 0.046 Hz ± SD 0.006; two-sided paired t-test, t(28)=0.35, p=0.725 Bayes Factor &lt;0.001, indicating decisive evidence for the null hypothesis).</p><p>In each participant and at each voxel, we quantified the degree of phase synchrony between the EGG signal and BOLD time series filtered around gastric frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We computed the phase-locking value (PLV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>), a measure widely used in electrophysiology that varies between zero when two time series show no consistent phase relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, bottom panel) and one when two time series have a consistent phase relationship over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, upper panel). PLV has three important properties: PLV is high for any lag between the time series as long as this lag is constant over time, PLV is independent of signal amplitude, and PLV gives no indication on the directionality of interactions between the two time series. In each participant and at each voxel, we estimated the PLV that could be expected by chance from EGG signals that were shifted with respect to the BOLD time series. The empirical PLVs were then compared with chance-level PLVs using a cluster-based statistical procedure that intrinsically corrects for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>). Significant phase coupling between the EGG and resting-state BOLD time series occurred in twelve nodes (voxel threshold p&lt;0.01, two-sided paired t-test between observed and chance PLV; cluster threshold corrected for multiple comparisons, Monte-Carlo p&lt;0.05).

First, we verified that EGG-BOLD coupling was specific to gastric frequency. We filtered both EGG and BOLD time series at frequencies that were slightly offset from the peak gastric frequency of each participant and recomputed cluster statistics. Summary statistics (sum of the absolute t-values resulting from the paired t-test between empirical and chance-level PLV at each voxel, either summed across the whole brain or within the gastric network) decreased when shifting below or above the gastric peak frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This result indicates that the gastric network corresponds to BOLD fluctuations specifically occurring at gastric frequency.</p><p>Second, we estimated the likelihood of false positives with our statistical procedure. We randomly sampled surrogate datasets in which a random time shift was applied to the EGG of each participant a thousand times. Next, we tested whether any of those 1000 combinations would generate summary statistics as large as the original data when compared with the chance-level estimate we used to determine significantly coupled regions at the group level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This result was never observed, indicating that the probability of our results being a false positive is less than 0.001.</p><p>Third, we verified that gastric-BOLD coupling strength was unrelated to BOLD power at gastric frequency. We computed the correlation between BOLD power at gastric frequency and coupling strength for each participant and voxel, and found the two measures to be unrelated (Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation coefficients tested against zero, t(29)=1.19, p=0.24; Bayes factor &lt;0.001, indicating decisive evidence for the absence of a link between coupling strength across the brain and BOLD power at gastric frequency).</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether submillimeter head movements might have influenced the results. We defined voxel motion susceptibility as the regression coefficient of head movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Power et al., 2012</xref>) from the BOLD time series. Coupling strength and voxel motion were unrelated (Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation coefficients tested against zero, t(29)=-0.34, p=0.73; Bayes factor &lt;0.001, indicating decisive evidence for the absence of a link between coupling strength and head movement). Stomach contractions might also lead to small head movements that could be phase locked to gastric rhythm. Although gastric rhythm is continuously produced even during fasting, it is larger during stomach contractions. Thus, we tested whether the effects we found were due to differences in EGG power (or frequency) across participants. We found no link between coupling strength in the 12 nodes and EGG power (ANCOVA, F(1, 28)=0.9, p=0.51; all Bayes factor &lt;0.33, indicating substantial evidence for the null hypothesis) nor between coupling strength and EGG peak frequency (ANCOVA, F(1, 28)=1.6, p=0.17; Bayes Factor &lt;0.33, indicating substantial evidence for the null hypothesis in 9 of 12 nodes; Bayes Factor &lt;1.3 in the three remaining nodes, indicating anecdotal or no evidence).</p><p>The gastric network is thus specific to individual gastric peak frequency, is highly unlikely to be a chance finding, is not dependent on BOLD power, and is not linked to spurious effects of head movement on the BOLD signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The gastric network includes body maps associated with touch, action and vision</title><p>We then examined the areas comprising the gastric network in more detail. By definition, the gastric network is composed of regions with activity that co-fluctuates with gastric basal rhythm. Five nodes of the gastric network also share a common functional feature, somatotopic organization, as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>.</p><p>The gastric network includes the following regions with a well-known body representation based on touch: the right primary somatosensory cortex in the hand and mouth region and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortices.

The gastric network mostly overlapped with area 1 (60.2% of the SIr node) and to a lesser extent, with area 2 (13.1%) and area 3b (9.9%). The SII nodes of the gastric network overlapped with the secondary somatosensory cortices and more precisely with the somatotopically organized subdivisions of the parietal operculum OP1 and OP4 (22). The right SII node mostly overlapped with area OP1 (35.2% of the node), while the left SII node overlapped with both OP1 (21.7%) and OP4 (14.9%).

Thus, we performed post-hoc region-of-interest analysis of the three insular subdivisions (anterior dorsal, anterior ventral, posterior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deen et al., 2011</xref>]) in both hemispheres. Only the right posterior insula showed evidence for gastric-BOLD coupling across participants (empirical vs. chance-level PLV, paired t-test, two sided, t(29)=2.78, p=0.043, Bonferroni corrected; all other regions, p&gt;0.21).</p><p>The use of statistical thresholds results in binary outputs. To get a finer grained picture, we computed effect sizes in the 6 insular subdivisions and in the 12 gastric network nodes (Cohen’s d for the difference between empirical and chance PLV on the mean time series in each region of interest). Mean Cohen’s d across gastric network nodes was 1.19 ± 0.21 STD, ranging from 0.80 in the dorsal occipital cortex to 1.62 in the right secondary somatosensory cortex. The right posterior insula had an effect size of 0.84, within the lower range of the gastric network. All other insula subdivisions displayed smaller effect sizes (right: dorsal anterior 0.61, ventral anterior 0.54; left: posterior 0.60, dorsal anterior 0.41, ventral anterior = 0.52). Thus, the right posterior insula does show evidence for coupling with the stomach, with an effect size comparable to that of the weakest nodes of the gastric network, provided signal-to-noise ratio is first increased by averaging within a region of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Partial overlap between gastric network and autonomic networks</title><p>Is the gastric network specific to the stomach, or is it also linked to other organs such as the heart?

These temporal delays were accompanied by delayed functional connectivity (FC) between the nodes of the gastric network.</p><p>We first illustrated this point with an example in a single participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), with two 200 s time series of the gastric network (MWM and EBA). The two time series systematically co-varied with a temporal delay. The existence of temporal delays between the nodes of the gastric network is one of the reasons why the gastric network could not be observed in prior studies. Indeed, fMRI RSN studies are typically based on measures of instantaneous FC, such as shared variance estimated from the squared Pearson correlation coefficient, which does not detect the temporally delayed interactions revealed here. These measures differ from delayed FC measures based on the consistency of phase delays over time, such as shared variance estimated from squared coherence. In the example illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, instantaneous FC between the two time series is 56%, whereas delayed FC is 86%. If we advance the timing of the medial wall time series by 2 s, instantaneous FC increases to 86%. This finding shows that the difference between the two FC estimates is due to temporal delays only.</p><p>We then estimated both instantaneous and delayed FC between all nodes of the gastric network in all participants. Delayed FC between gastric nodes (mean 40.8% ± SD 8%, ranging from 26.5% between the right primary somatosensory cortex and RSC, up to 63.9% between the ventral and dorsal occipital cortices) was systematically larger (paired t-test, t(29)=9.02, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>) than instantaneous FC (mean 30.2% ± SD 11%, ranging from 9.3% between the dorsal precuneus and right SII, up to 61.2% between right and left SII). Next, we verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>) that two regions belonging to both the gastric network and the same RSN (i.e. two regions of the gastric network with little temporal delay, such as MWM and SIr) would display large values of both delayed and instantaneous FC, whereas two regions belonging to the gastric network but not to the same classical RSN (i.e. two regions of the gastric network with a large temporal delay, such as MWM and EBA) would show large delayed FC and small instantaneous FC. Thus, in contrast to classical RSNs, the gastric network appears to be characterized by between-node delayed connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Slow temporal fluctuations in gastric-BOLD coupling are associated with changes in BOLD amplitude and occur simultaneously in all nodes</title><p>Thus far, we have identified a sequence of activation that occurs at each gastric cycle, which characterizes gastric-BOLD coupling.

The three nodes showing the largest covariation in time-varying PLV with the other nodes were dPrec, pCS and vOcc, and the three nodes showing the least covariation in time-varying PLV with the other nodes were RSC, SIr and sPOS.

Within the gastric network, approximately 15% of the BOLD variance is explained by gastric-BOLD phase synchrony. The gastric network cuts across classical RSNs and shows only partial overlap with autonomic control regions. A number of brain regions composing the gastric network have convergent functional properties involved in mapping bodily space through touch, action and vision. The network is characterized by a precise temporal sequence of activations within a gastric cycle, beginning with somato-motor cortices and ending with extra-striate body area and dorsal precuneus. This temporal sequence is accompanied by delayed functional connectivity between nodes of the gastric network, which explains why this RSN could not be identified with standard correlation methods that only capture instantaneous connectivity. Furthermore, slow temporal fluctuations in gastric-BOLD coupling are associated with changes in BOLD amplitude and occur simultaneously in all nodes. Thus, our results suggest that canonical RSNs based on instantaneous connectivity represent only one of the possible partitions of the brain into coherent networks based on temporal dynamics.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neural origin of gastric-BOLD coupling</title><p>SIr, SII and medial wall motor regions likely receive direct gastric inputs. The stimulation of the splanchnic (spinal) nerve that innervates the stomach evokes responses in contralateral SI and bilateral SII in several mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amassian, 1951</xref>), and the spinothalamic tract was recently shown to target MWM in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dum et al., 2009</xref>). Vagal stimulation can also evoke responses in somato-motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, single neurons with convergent visceral and hand inputs have been observed in SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüggemann et al., 1997</xref>), in line with the overlap we observed between the gastric network and hand representation. SIr, SII and MWM are not only targeted by documented ascending visceral pathways, they are also early nodes of the gastric network, with a phase advance compared with that of other nodes. Thus, these areas could be the entry point of gastric afferences.</p><p>We found the right posterior insula, a region that receives direct cardiac inputs in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>) and is considered as a visceral cortex, to be coupled with the stomach, with coupling similar to the weakest node of the gastric network. In addition, the right posterior insula appeared with a phase advance, in line with its role in visceroception. To be revealed, gastric-BOLD coupling in the right posterior insula required a region-of-interest approach, that is an increase of signal-to-noise ratio by averaging across voxels. The modest involvement of the insula in the present data might be due to the absence of an interoceptive task. Indeed, BOLD signal in the insula increases when participants explicitly monitor a visceral variable (see, e.g.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Critchley et al., 2004</xref>]).</p><p>Regions receiving direct visceral inputs are also early nodes of the gastric network. This suggests that the BOLD fluctuations locked to the gastric rhythm have a neural origin. An additional argument for a neural origin is that we found gastric-BOLD coupling in parieto-occipital regions, where neural activity in the alpha range is modulated by gastric phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2017</xref>). However, below, we examine the possibility that other non-neural mechanisms might contribute to gastric-BOLD coupling.</p><p>Artefactual BOLD fluctuations caused by head movements driven by stomach contractions seem unlikely. Indeed, gastric-BOLD coupling was neither related to head movement nor to EGG power that increases during stomach contractions. Another possibility is a vascular artifact. During digestion, gastric blood flow does indeed vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matheson et al., 2000</xref>), but cerebral blood flow is unaltered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallavan et al., 1980</xref>). Artificial distension of the stomach can cause increases in peripheral blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Min et al., 2011</xref>), but this peripheral increase is mostly due to the insertion of a bag catheter, not to its inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantù et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, spontaneous fluctuations in blood pressure in humans occur at approximately 0.1 Hz (so-called Mayer waves), which is much faster than gastric rhythm. Thus, a vascular effect seems unlikely, and the hypothesis that activity in the gastric network is driven by neural activity in areas directly receiving ascending inputs appears more plausible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is the functional role of the gastric network?</title><p>Twenty years and thousands of articles after the discovery of the default network, the debate on its functional role at rest or during tasks is still open. Thus, any discussion of the functional role the gastric network can only be tentative and speculative at this stage. Several non-mutually exclusive interpretations can nevertheless be considered.</p><p>The functional role of the coupling between stomach and body maps might be related to homeostatic regulations, which would account for the partial overlap between the gastric network and regions involved in heart rate variability. More specifically, the gastric network might be involved in the regulation of digestion, which is accompanied by changes in cardiac output and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kelbaek et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, the unusual experimental setting with abdominal electrodes and a moderate fasting state might have drawn participants' attention toward their internal state, notably of hunger. Since participants had been fasting for only 2 hr, their state of hunger was probably rather moderate and unlikely to have dominated their spontaneous thoughts for 20 min.</p><p>We find areas containing body maps in the gastric network. This could simply indicate that the stomach, as any other body part, such as for example the hand, is represented in any body map. The body maps of the gastric network are classically associated with different sensory modalities and resting-state networks. In addition to the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, the gastric network includes MWM (CCZ, RCZp and SMA) that are involved in motor preparation and display a clear somatotopic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiez and Petrides, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Picard and Strick, 2001</xref>). The gastric network also comprises the EBA, a functional region in the occipito-temporal cortex that selectively responds to visual images of the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Downing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2011</xref>) and is causally involved in body visual recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Urgesi et al., 2007</xref>), with a fine topographical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orlov et al., 2010</xref>). The stomach, an organ that cannot be easily touched, moved or seen, thus appears to be mapped in body maps related to touching, moving or seeing the body. However, the areas where the stomach is represented are more multi-sensory than usually held. The EBA is not purely visual since it is also activated when participants move or imagine body parts without visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astafiev et al., 2004</xref>), as well as during haptic recognition of body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kitada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costantini et al., 2011</xref>). Primary somatosensory cortex combines internal and external bodily information since it receives both tactile and visceral afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüggemann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Follett and Dirks, 1994</xref>). Medial wall motor regions do not only contain motor maps but also receive visceral inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Levinthal and Strick, 2012</xref>). Thus, activity in 5 out of the 12 nodes of the gastric network could be simply explained by a representation of the stomach in the brain body maps.</p><p>However, the gastric network is not limited to body maps, it also comprises regions that play a role in mapping the external space in bodily coordinates, namely, the right superior parieto-occipital sulcus, dorsal precuneus and RSC. The superior parieto-occipital sulcus region is a visuo-motor area that encodes visual stimuli in bodily coordinates during action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernier and Grafton, 2010</xref>). The dorsal precuneus and RSC both implement the integration of information into an egocentric reference frame (i.e. centered on the body), a key basic mechanism involved in many different situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vann et al., 2009</xref>), including foraging. All 12 nodes of the gastric network but three (the posterior cingulate sulcus and ventral and dorsal occipital clusters) either contain body maps or map external information in bodily coordinates. One could thus speculate that the gastric network coordinates these different body-centered maps. Indeed, the gastric rhythm is continuously produced and originates in the center of the body. In this view, the function of gastric-BOLD coupling in those nine areas would be to co-register body-centered maps of the body and of the external space.</p><p>In which type of tasks would the gastric network play a role? Foraging and feeding behaviors are likely candidates, since they involve both the coordination of different egocentric maps and the homeostatic regulation of digestion. Besides, in SI and EBA gastric-BOLD coupling is maximal in the hand and mouth region, suggesting a potential link with the stereotypical actions of feeding behavior, where food goes from hand to mouth, and from mouth to stomach. Still, the coordination of different systems of bodily coordinates is important for many actions besides feeding, such as navigating in the environment or grasping any object. Whether the gastric network plays a role in food-related, but also nonfood-related behaviors, remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Delays and directionality of interactions</title><p>The gastric network is characterized by temporal fluctuations with delays between the gastric rhythm and brain regions. Delays in resting-state functional connectivity have been highlighted only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mitra and Raichle, 2016</xref>), but have long been documented in stimulus-induced BOLD responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kruggel et al., 1999</xref>). Within functionally coherent systems such as the visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saad et al., 2001</xref>) or auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kruggel et al., 1999</xref>) systems, delays of 2 s are common. In this light, our finding of up to 3 s delays between areas much further apart thus not appear so surprising. Still, the interpretation of long delays is not straightforward. They are unlikely to directly reflect synaptic delays of fast sequential neural transmission between areas since feed-forward transfer, with only minimal local computations, can be as fast as 10 to 15 ms per processing stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thorpe et al., 1996</xref>). However, if local recurrent processing is involved, longer delays might occur. Delays might additionally reflect regional differences in the timing of the vascular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kruggel et al., 1999</xref>), in slow changes of neural activity over time, as in accumulation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>), or in the involvement of neuromodulatory influences. The different factors may further be combined, that is neuromodulation might affect cerebrovascular reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krimer et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>What is the directionality of the brain-stomach interactions? The methods used here do not allow to answer this question since PLV is not a directed measure. If the gastric network plays a role in homeostasis, interactions are likely to be bidirectional, because homeostasis implies both the monitoring of ascending inputs, to evaluate the peripheral state, and the production of descending control commands. Medial wall motor regions, which both receive inputs from the spino-thalamic tract, and generate sympathetic outputs, might fit with this schema. On the other hand, the gastric-locked modulation of the alpha rhythm in the ventral and dorsal occipital clusters was previously shown to be mostly due to ascending influences from the stomach to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The gastric network is a novel resting-state network</title><p>RSNs have been defined as segregated systems that show synchronous fluctuations during rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>). The gastric network, albeit distinct from classical RSNs falls under this definition. In terms of dynamics, the gastric network is defined by its phase synchronization with the stomach and its delayed connectivity between nodes. The gastric network can thus be considered a novel RSN that could not be previously observed due to methodological reasons.</p><p>As opposed to classical RSNs, the gastric network is characterized by delayed connectivity, with temporal delays that can extend to several seconds but are stable over time and captured by coherence and phase synchrony. Delays are an intrinsic characteristic of brain dynamics unfolding in anatomically connected networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deco et al., 2011</xref>) and pervasive even at the timescale of BOLD signal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>). Canonical RSNs based on instantaneous connectivity represent only one of the possible partitions of the brain into coherent networks based on temporal dynamics. Therefore, we propose the addition of delayed connectivity to the operational definition of RSNs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-four right-handed human participants took part in this study.

Electrodes covered a large portion of the left abdomen, to increase the chance of having an electrode close to the pacemaker of the stomach, located at the greater curvature of the mid to upper corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Grady et al., 2010</xref>). Because the gastric rhythm propagates from the pacemaker zone to the whole stomach, any electrode placed over the stomach (not necessarily over the pacemaker) will record the gastric rhythm, but with a possible delay. The midpoint between the xyphoid process and umbilicus was identified, and the first electrode pair was set 2 cm below this area, with the negative derivation set at the point below the rib cage closest to the left mid-clavicular line. Another electrode pair was set 2 cm above the umbilicus and aligned with the first electrode pair. The positive derivation of the third pair was set in the center of the square formed by electrode pairs one and two. The positive derivation of the fourth electrode pair was centered on the line traversing the xyphoid process and umbilicus at the same level as the third electrode.

Spectral peak identification was based on the following criteria: peaking power larger than 15μV<sup>2</sup> and sharpness of the peak. Two participants were excluded from further analysis at this stage because their spectral peak was not well defined, with a power smaller than 15μV<sup>2</sup>. In 20 participants, peaking power was the largest at the EGG electrode with the best defined spectral peak. In 10 participants, we used the second most powerful channel because the spectral peak was sharper. Data from the selected EGG channel were then bandpass filtered to isolate the signal related to gastric basal rhythm (linear phase finite impulse response filter, FIR, designed with Matlab function FIR2, centered at EGG peaking frequency, filter width ±0.015 Hz, filter order of 5). Data were filtered in the forward and backward directions to avoid phase distortions and downsampled to the sampling rate of the BOLD acquisition (0.5 Hz).

The first and last 15 volumes (30 s) were discarded from both the BOLD and EGG time series. The updated duration of the fMRI and EGG signals in which the rest of the analysis was performed was 840 s. The Hilbert transform was applied to the BOLD and EGG time series to derive the instantaneous phases of the signals. The PLV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) was computed as the absolute value of the time average difference in the angle between the phases of the EGG and each voxel across time (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>∅</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>∅</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where T is the number of time samples, and x and y are the two time series. The PLV measures phase synchrony irrespective of temporal delays and amplitude fluctuations and is bounded between 0 (no synchrony) and 1 (perfect synchrony). Two pure sinewaves at the same frequency will thus always have a PLV of 1. However, the stomach is not perfectly regular, and the EGG is not a perfect sinewave. The phase-locking procedure identifies BOLD regions that go faster when the stomach goes faster, and slower when the stomach goes slower. The bandpass filter we use is large enough to retrieve all those fluctuations. The PLV was first assessed over the whole duration of the recording. In a second step, we computed the time-varying PLV in a 60 s time window shifted by 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Statistical procedure for determining regions showing significant gastric-BOLD coupling at the group level</title><p>We employed a two-step statistical procedure adapted from a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2017</xref>). We estimated chance-level gastric-BOLD coupling at each voxel and in each participant. We then used group-level statistics to determine regions in which gastric-BOLD coupling was greater than chance.</p><p>We first estimated the chance-level PLV at each voxel for each participant. We created surrogate datasets in which the phase relationship between the EGG and BOLD time series was disrupted by offsetting the EGG time series with respect to the BOLD time series. In other word, acceleration/deceleration in the EGG are no longer aligned with the acceleration/deceleration in the BOLD. In practice, the EGG time series was shifted by a time interval of at least ±60 s (i.e. approximately 3 cycles of the gastric rhythm) with respect to the BOLD time series. Data at the end of the recording were wrapped to the beginning. Given the 420 samples in the BOLD time series, this procedure generated 360 surrogate datasets from which we could compute the distribution of the chance-level PLV for each voxel in each participant. The chance-level PLV was defined as the median value of the chance-level PLV distribution for each voxel and participant. Because the amplitudes of the series in the surrogate datasets are identical to the original ones, any bias due to signal amplitude is present in both original and surrogate datasets. Note that PLV is a measure that depends on sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos and Schoffelen, 2015</xref>). Here, we can safely compare PLV values between the original and surrogate datasets in each participant because the original and surrogate datasets contain exactly the same number of samples (420 samples in all datasets in all participants). We defined coupling strength as the difference between the empirical PLV and chance-level PLV.</p><p>In a second step, we tested whether the empirical PLV differed from the chance-level PLV across participants. We used a cluster-based permutation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>), as implemented in FieldTrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>), that extracts clusters of voxels showing significant differences at the group level while intrinsically correcting for multiple comparisons. This non-parametric method is exempt from the high rate of false positives associated with the Gaussian shape assumption often present in fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eklund et al., 2016</xref>). The procedure consists of comparisons between the empirical PLV and chance-level PLV across participants using t-tests at each voxel. Candidate clusters are formed by neighboring voxels exceeding the first-level t-threshold (p&lt;0.01, two-sided). Each candidate cluster is characterized by the sum of the t-values in the voxels defining the cluster. To determine the sum of t-values that could obtained by chance, we computed a cluster statistics distribution under the null hypothesis by randomly shuffling the labels ‘empirical’ and ‘chance level’ 10,000 times and applied the clustering procedure. At each permutation, we retained the largest positive and smallest negative summary statistics obtained by chance across all voxels and thus built the distribution of cluster statistics under the null hypothesis and assessed the empirical clusters for significance. Because the maximal values across the whole brain are retained to build the distribution under the null hypothesis, this method intrinsically corrects for multiple comparisons. Clusters are characterized by their summary statistics (sum(abs(t))) and Monte-Carlo p value. Clusters with a Monte-Carlo p value&lt;0.05 (two-sided, corrected for multiple comparisons) were considered significant and are reported in the Results section as nodes of the gastric network.</p><p>As an additional control, we computed gastric-BOLD coupling at each voxel between the BOLD data of the participant and the EGG data of the other 29 participants. Chance-level PLV was defined as the median of the 29 surrogate PLVs, and compared to empirical PLV using the clustering method described above. Note that in this case, chance level PLV is estimated from only 29 surrogate data sets, as compared to 360 surrogate data sets in time-shift approach, resulting in a less precise estimate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Quantification of gastric-bold shared variance</title><p>To estimate the amount of variance in the BOLD signal that could be accounted for by gastric coupling, we computed the squared coherence coefficient between the EGG and average BOLD time course across all voxels in each significant cluster using FieldTrip software.

Therefore, its squared value can be interpreted as the amount of shared variance between two signals at a certain frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos and Schoffelen, 2015</xref>). First, we estimated the frequency spectrum of the full-band (0.01–0.1 Hz) EGG and BOLD signals (Welch method on a 120 s time window with 20 s overlap).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Hugo Critchley (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Rebollo and colleagues measured phase coupling between the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and stomach slow-wave potentials in resting humans. In their manuscript, the authors describe a novel, elegant experiment through which they achieved this goal obtaining an interesting set of findings. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrogastrography (EGG) recordings revealed that the time series of stomach slow waves and the time series of BOLD signal are significantly phase-coupled in twelve different voxel clusters scattered across the brain – a set of clusters that the authors call &quot;gastric network&quot;. In these clusters the empirically measured phase-locking value (PLV) of the two-time series is significantly different from the median value of simulated PLVs that could be expected by chance.</p><p>The empirical PLV is computed plugging the amplitude-normalised, Fourier-transformed values of the two series into the classical equation for coherence. In turn, squared coherence is used to estimate of shared variance between the BOLD signal and slow-wave potentials: on average, between 12% and 16.9%. The authors used PLV to calculate the relative phase-locking angle of each node of the gastric network – a measure of the lag between an event in the slow-wave cycle and the corresponding change of BOLD phase in a voxel cluster. This led them to conclude that some gastric network nodes are up to 3.3 s slower to adjust their phase to slow-wave potentials than other nodes. Such delays are accompanied by corresponding delays in between-node functional connectivity. Thus, in contrast with classical resting-state networks, the gastric network nodes are related to each other not only through instantaneous flows of current, but also through delayed connectivity.</p><p>The reviewers were impressed at the technical achievements described and agreed on the good aspects, potential interest and significance of this MS. The reviewers also recognised the need for some additional informative analyses. BTW I did not comment on the lack of Insula activity because that was the first and most striking observation!</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Testing phase timing relationships that take into account any temporal differences seems counterintuitive: Band-pass filtering at a specific frequency (here around 3 cycles per min) would reveal areas showing that frequency: The difference between high and low PVL reflects the consistency with which a region expresses that frequency, rather than necessarily any implied causal relationship perhaps. Can the authors present a clearer picture concerning causal relationships between EGG and brain haemodynamics?</p><p>2) In establishing the individual specificity of the relationships, the authors chose not to randomise across participants the testing of EGG (from other participants) PSVs with brain haemodynamics: Would this be a more or less powerful demonstration of the individual specificity of brain coupling to gastric rhythm?</p><p>3) The authors make a case for the gastric coupling to be unrelated to typical autonomic regulation areas, including insula, based on citation of a meta-analysis of largely task evoked changes in cardiovascular and or electrodermal autonomic responses. While this meta-analysis does include some HRV data and resting studies, they are predominantly focused on sympathetic cardiovascular arousal, which may be associated with EGG suppression. The author's acquired heart rate and pupil data on their participants, suggesting they could either test within their data for autonomic overlap with EEG-coupled areas on an individual basis, or test if EEG frequency rhythms apparent within these autonomic data series.</p><p>4) The measurement of slow fluctuations within already slow haemodynamic signal changes and suggesting that seconds-long lags between regions that argued to be functionally connected are both somewhat removed from the heuristic model of &lt;10ms-a-synapse processing and representation of sensory information within and between brain regions. It is for example possible that the neural input signal is modulating cerebrovascular reactivity /tonicity through intrinsic neuromodulatory systems rather than reflecting neuron to neuron information exchange. If the gastric input anchors body centered representations within a single functional system, the differential regional expression of significant time lags requires more mechanistic explanation.</p><p>5) Related to this is the controversial claim is the statement that the newly discovered coupling between gastric rhythm and resting-state BOLD signal &quot;appears to bind together distributed maps encoded in bodily coordinates into a coherent functional system (subsection “Gastric network and bodily space”)&quot;.</p><p>This assertion should be discussed in more detail. First, the very idea that synchronous oscillations serve a high-level cognitive purpose as binding may not be completely proved, as the unresolved debate over binding-by-γ-synchrony shows (Merker, 2013; Ray and Maunsell, 2015). Rather than acting as an information-processing neural code of a sort, γ oscillations may simply be a neural signature of the balance between excitation and inhibition. Likewise, the EGG-BOLD synchrony found by the authors may reflect general homeostatic processes which do not play a particular role in cognition. Cerebral blood flow supplies nutrients to neurons, and such nutrients come from digestive processes. In this context, the slow-wave potentials of interstitial cells of Cajal may simply trigger food intake, given the fact that participants fasted for at least 90 minutes before the experiment (Subsection “Experimental procedure”). This could explain why the gastric network so neatly overlaps with areas mapping faces and hands in general (OP1 and OP4: subsection “The gastric network includes body maps associated with touch, action and vision”), the mouth (EBA: subsection “The gastric network includes body maps associated with touch, action and vision”), teeth, lips, tongue, and hand fingers (right SI: subsection “The gastric network includes body maps associated with touch, action and vision”), as well as with three medial wall motor preparation regions (CCZ, RCZp, and SMA: subsection “The gastric network includes body maps associated with touch, action and vision”) which become more active when subjects are asked to move their tongue or their hand (Amiez and Petrides, 2014). The authors previously excluded that variations in cerebral blood flow could be due to digestion, although they backed their position with a single 1980 study on regional blood flow in the conscious dog (Gallavan et al., 1980). Nevertheless, they should consider the opposite hypothesis, namely, that the lack of nutrients to digest may spawn a long-range synchrony between the stomach and brain areas related to food intake. Data on caloric intake prior to the experiment, blood ghrelin levels, or a self-reported hunger scale may have shed light on the issue. Thus, I recommend the authors discuss and rule out more mundane interpretations before asserting that &quot;stomach-brain synchrony binds neural representations of the body&quot;.</p><p>6) The interesting, newly-discovered synchrony arises in a resting state: In a task-free environment, what is the functional advantage of having &quot;different body-centered representations&quot; anchored by a delayed-connectivity gastric network (subsection “The gastric network is a novel resting-state network”) with lags up to 3.3 seconds? Of note, previous &quot;binding-by-synchrony&quot; proposals were based on task-dependent results.</p><p>7) Only 5 out of 12 nodes of the gastric network have a clear somatotopic organisation (subsection “Experimental procedure”): thus, &quot;binding&quot; interpretation of the authors does not explain the role that the majority of the nodes play in the network. Even the nodes which do have a somatotopic arrangement contain neurons tuned to the external perception of body parts, be it touch (nodes partially overlapping with SI and SII), motor preparation (MWM) or vision (EBA). As the authors concede, the stomach is &quot;an organ that cannot be easily touched, moved, or seen (subsection “Gastric network and bodily space”)&quot;. It is intriguing and difficult to understand why the network revealed here seems organized around brain areas involved in body and bodily space as well as the stronger claim that it is gastric rhythm by itself that functionally links these areas.</p><p>8) The authors make the point that SI, SII and MWM &quot;likely&quot; have direct gastric input, hence their claim that gastric-BOLD coupling has a neural origin (subsection “Neural origin of gastric-BOLD coupling”). Yet the insular cortex is almost completely missing from the gastric network (subsection “Marginal gastric-brain coupling in the insula and autonomic control networks”). This is surprising, given that the insula is certainly linked to the stomach and likely supports representations of the whole body (Craig, 2002, 2009). The authors should advance a clear hypothesis to explain this seemingly counter-intuitive finding which relates to the real meaning of the brain-stomach synchronization.</p><p>9) The authors should discuss the possibility that unusual measuring circumstances, wherein the participants lie in the scanner with electrodes fitted on their stomach area, create unusual conditions leading heightened awareness of the own body. This is not to say that activity in all nodes of the current network is directly and primarily related to body awareness. Indeed, some areas (SI, SII) receive direct gastric input. The network presented here may be less homogeneous than argued here and that activity in some of the nodes may have multiple bases. This would particularly seem to be the case for EBA and one can imagine different explanations for activity in EBA and for the fact that it comes on the latest. In the same vein, some arguments in defense of the representational specificity of the network appear overly speculative, e.g. suggestions about the spatial aspects of the body representation function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33321.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Rebollo and colleagues measured phase coupling between the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and stomach slow-wave potentials in resting humans.

Briefly, we performed all required controls and additional data analysis, notably a refined analysis of the insula and analysis of HRV and pupil diameter. We have also rewritten large sections of the Discussion section, in particular to offer a more balanced and comprehensive view of the different possible functional roles of the gastric network (trying to synthetize all comments from the reviewers on this issue, i.e., points 5, 6,7,9), and to discuss the possible origins of the long delays observed here.</p><p>We respond to each point in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Testing phase timing relationships that take into account any temporal differences seems counterintuitive: Band-pass filtering at a specific frequency (here around 3 cycles per min) would reveal areas showing that frequency: The difference between high and low PVL reflects the consistency with which a region expresses that frequency, rather than necessarily any implied causal relationship perhaps. Can the authors present a clearer picture concerning causal relationships between EGG and brain haemodynamics?</p></disp-quote><p>We are measuring temporal (phase) differences that are consistent over gastric cycles, without any a priori on the value of the temporal difference. One of the reasons why we chose this approach is that the phase of the gastric rhythm recorded by external, cutaneous electrodes is arbitrary. This important information was missing in the previous version. Briefly, the gastric rhythm is mostly generated in the pacemaker zone located at the greater curvature of the mid to upper corpus and propagates to the rest of the stomach with delays (O'Grady et al., 2010). Depending on where the electrodes are located with respect to the pacemaker zone, we might pick the gastric rhythm with a delay specific to a given participant and electrode. Hence, the measure of interest is the consistency of the delay between BOLD and EGG across gastric cycles, rather than an absolute delay value. This is now specified in subsection “EGG preprocessing”). Note that this is also the reason why we analyze relative, rather than absolute, delays between nodes (now explained in subsection “Between-participants phase-delay consistency”).</p><p>The second issue raised in the comment is that &quot;band-pass filtering would reveal areas showing gastric frequency&quot;. The band passed EGG and BOLD data contain information about amplitude and phase. PLV is sensitive to phase, but not amplitude (as now specified when introducing PLV in the Results section). We nevertheless verified that coupling strength and BOLD power at gastric frequency were not correlated (Bayes factor&lt;0.001, indicating decisive evidence for the absence of a link between coupling strength across the brain and BOLD power at gastric frequency). This result has been added to subsection “Partial overlap between gastric network and autonomic networks”.</p><p>In addition, while we used a procedure validated in a previous study (Richter et al., 2017), we realized that the procedure was not fully explained in the previous version of this article. We have modified the Material and methods section to be more explicit. Briefly, the whole method relies on the fact that the stomach is not perfectly regular, and the EGG is not a perfect sine wave. The phase-locking procedure identifies BOLD regions that go faster when the stomach goes faster, and slower when the stomach goes slower. The band pass filter we use is large enough to retrieve all those fluctuations. In the surrogate dataset, the phase link between the BOLD and the EGG is broken because the two-time series are no longer temporally aligned. Furthermore, any bias due to power of the BOLD at gastric frequency is also present in the surrogate datasets and is thus taken into account.</p><p>Last, regarding causality: PLV reveals consistent temporal relationships between two-time series, independently from amplitude, but does not say anything about the directionality of interactions. This is now specified when introducing PLV in the Results section. We have also added a full paragraph in the Discussion section about the directionality of interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In establishing the individual specificity of the relationships, the authors chose not to randomise across participants the testing of EGG (from other participants) PSVs with brain haemodynamics: Would this be a more or less powerful demonstration of the individual specificity of brain coupling to gastric rhythm?</p></disp-quote><p>We opted for randomizing within participants for two reasons: first, this is a more conservative approach, since the only difference between empirical and surrogate datasets is BOLD-EGG phase relationships. Second, we can create a large number of surrogate datasets (360), to obtain a good estimate of chance level PLV.</p><p>Still, we ran this control and now also report the gastric-network when estimating chance-level PLV by computing gastric-BOLD coupling between the BOLD signal of one participant with the EGG of the other 29 participants. Although this approach should be more liberal (i.e., EGG frequency and power in the surrogate data are different from the original data) and less powerful (we estimate chance level PLV in each participant from only 29 surrogate data sets), the results are qualitatively similar, with coupling occurring either in the same or neighboring voxels. This additional control is presented in Figure 2, and the Material and methods section updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors make a case for the gastric coupling to be unrelated to typical autonomic regulation areas, including insula, based on citation of a meta-analysis of largely task evoked changes in cardiovascular and or electrodermal autonomic responses. While this meta-analysis does include some HRV data and resting studies, they are predominantly focused on sympathetic cardiovascular arousal, which may be associated with EGG suppression. The author's acquired heart rate and pupil data on their participants, suggesting they could either test within their data for autonomic overlap with EEG-coupled areas on an individual basis, or test if EEG frequency rhythms apparent within these autonomic data series.</p></disp-quote><p>- Heart-rate variability. We identified the brain regions associated with high and low frequency heart rate variability in our data, at rest (subsection “Partial overlap between gastric network and autonomic networks”). Briefly, the overlap between the gastric network with HRV regions is larger (30%) than previously observed with metanalytic data. The overlap occurs mostly in medial motor regions and in the posterior cingulate cluster, and, to a lesser extent, in the dorsal occipital clusters. We now present those results in a new Figure 3A. The overlap between a pure sympathetic measure (EDA) from the meta-analysis of Beissner et al., is presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, as well as the comparison between the resting state HRV (HF and LF) and meta-analytic HF-HRV and EDA. Note that in this new analysis we do find a link between low-frequency HRV and insula, as expected from the literature. We have modified the discussion to acknowledge the partial overlap between the gastric network and heart-rate variability regions.</p><p>- Pupil. As now reported in the Results section:</p><p>&quot; We also determined brain regions that correlate with pupil diameter (n=20 due to data loss or artefacts; Figure 3B). The strongest correlations were found in occipital regions, somato-motor cortices and medial wall motor regions. 17% of the gastric network (SI, SIIr, MWM and EBA) overlaps with regions correlating with pupil diameter. Shared variance between pupil diameter and EGG, estimated from squared coherence, was 9.7% ± 2.5%. Coupling strength averaged across SI, SIIr, MWM and EBA did not correlate with shared pupil-EGG variance (mean r= 0.05, p=0.82, BF= 0.17 which indicates substantial evidence for the null hypothesis). &quot;</p><p>These two new analysis led us to reconsider the potential link between gastric-BOLD coupling and homeostatic regulations, as reflected in the new section of the discussion entitled &quot;What is the functional role of the gastric network?&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The measurement of slow fluctuations within already slow haemodynamic signal changes and suggesting that seconds-long lags between regions that argued to be functionally connected are both somewhat removed from the heuristic model of &lt;10ms-a-synapse processing and representation of sensory information within and between brain regions.

We now consider several possibilities: a general role in homeostasis, a more specific role in digestion, a simple cortical mapping of the stomach (a body part) on body part maps, or a more speculative interpretation in terms of coordination of bodily coordinates.

The hypothesis of a simple cortical mapping of the stomach (a body part) on body part maps accounts for 5 out of the 12 nodes of the gastric network. As rightly underlined by the reviewer, this hypothesis involves a convergence between external and internal information and we know highlight the multi-sensory nature of SI, EBA and MWM.</p><p>We have also clarified the more speculative hypothesis that the gastric network coordinates areas involved in body and bodily space:</p><p>&quot;However, the gastric network is not limited to body maps, it also comprises regions that play a role in mapping the external space in bodily coordinates, namely, the right superior parieto-occipital sulcus, dorsal precuneus and RSC. […] In this view, the function of gastric-BOLD coupling in those 9 areas would be to co-register body-centered maps of the body and of the external space. &quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors make the point that SI, SII and MWM &quot;likely&quot; have direct gastric input, hence their claim that gastric-BOLD coupling has a neural origin (subsection “Neural origin of gastric-BOLD coupling”). Yet, the insular cortex is almost completely missing from the gastric network (subsection “Marginal gastric-brain coupling in the insula and autonomic control networks”). This is surprising, given that the insula is certainly linked to the stomach and likely supports representations of the whole body (Craig, 2002, 2009). The authors should advance a clear hypothesis to explain this seemingly counter-intuitive finding which relates to the real meaning of the brain-stomach synchronization.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considerably refined our analysis of the insula (subsection “Gastric-brain coupling in the right posterior insula”). Indeed, the use of statistical thresholds results in a binary output. To avoid this issue, we computed the effect size of gastric-BOLD coupling in the 6 insular ROIs, as well as in the 12 gastric nodes. Effect size in the right posterior insula was similar to that of the weakest node of the gastric network. This indicates the right posterior insula does show evidence for coupling with the stomach, provided signal-to-noise ratio is increased by averaging within a region of interest. We also analyzed the phase delay of the right posterior insula and show that the right posterior insula behaves as an early node, which is in line with its role in visceroception.</p><p>In addition, we underline in the Discussion section that the modest involvement of the insula in the present data might be due to the absence of an interoceptive task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors should discuss the possibility that unusual measuring circumstances, wherein the participants lie in the scanner with electrodes fitted on their stomach area, create unusual conditions leading heightened awareness of the own body. This is not to say that activity in all nodes of the current network is directly and primarily related to body awareness. Indeed, some areas (SI, SII) receive direct gastric input. The network presented here may be less homogeneous than argued here and that activity in some of the nodes may have multiple bases. This would particularly seem to be the case for EBA and one can imagine different explanations for activity in EBA and for the fact that it comes on the latest. In the same vein, some arguments in defense of the representational specificity of the network appear overly speculative, e.g. suggestions about the spatial aspects of the body representation function.</p></disp-quote><p>The unusual measuring circumstances are now acknowledged. In the new subsection entitled &quot;What is the functional role of the gastric network?&quot;, we specifically consider the possibility that participants' attention was drawn to their internal state (notably hunger, see also point 5).</p><p>Regarding delays, in the revised version we only highlight areas that come first as regions receiving visceral inputs. We have added a new subsection entitled &quot;Delays and directionality of interactions&quot;, where we list the different possible explanations for long delays.</p><p>Last, we concur with the reviewer about the speculative discussion of the functional role of the gastric network. This section of the Discussion section has been completely rewritten to offer a more balanced and comprehensive view of the different possibilities, trying to synthetize all comments from the reviewers on the functional role of the gastric network (i.e., points 5, 6,7,9). The hypothesis that gastric network coordinates different body-centered maps is explained more clearly, and its speculative nature highlighted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
