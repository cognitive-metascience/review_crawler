These complex behaviors emerge from the coordinated firing of prefrontal neurons. Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) control the timing of excitatory neuron firing via somatic inhibition and generate gamma (30–100 Hz) oscillations. Therefore, factors that regulate how FSIs respond to gamma-frequency input could affect both prefrontal circuit activity and behavior. Here, we show that serotonin (5HT), which is known to regulate gamma power, acts via 5HT2A receptors to suppress an inward-rectifying potassium conductance in FSIs. This leads to depolarization, increased input resistance, enhanced spiking, and slowed decay of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs). Notably, we found that slowed EPSP decay preferentially enhanced temporal summation and firing elicited by gamma frequency inputs. These findings show how changes in passive membrane properties can affect not only neuronal excitability but also the temporal filtering of synaptic inputs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>fast-spiking interneurons</kwd><kwd>synaptic integration</kwd><kwd>temporal summation</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin interneurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA F31 MH111219-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Athilingam</surname><given-names>Jegath C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 MH105948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sohal</surname><given-names>Vikaas S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA035913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bender</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serotonin changes passive membrane properties in prefrontal fast-spiking interneurons to affect not only neuronal excitability but also the temporal filtering of synaptic inputs with a preference for gamma-frequency summation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) organizes higher order cognitive functions ranging from decision making to social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Euston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dias et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ray and Zald, 2012</xref>).These complex behaviors emerge from the coordinated firing of PFC neurons, resulting in neuronal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki and Chrobak, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). Synchronized oscillations of neuronal activity in the gamma frequency range (30–100 Hz) play a key role in information encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki and Chrobak, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>) and prefrontal gamma oscillations influence the performance of tasks related to cognitive flexibility and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The neuromodulator serotonin (5HT) has been shown to regulate gamma power in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puig et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that it could play a role in regulating task-dependent changes in gamma oscillations. Furthermore, neuropsychiatric disease associated with deficits in PFC gamma synchrony, including schizophrenia and depression, are currently treated with medications that have high affinity for serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meltzer and Massey, 2011</xref>). Overall, this suggests that serotonergic modulation of gamma oscillations is important for prefrontal function; however, the cellular mechanisms by which 5HT modulates gamma oscillations remain elusive.</p><p>Gamma oscillations are orchestrated by cortical fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001</xref>). In contrast to neighboring excitatory cells, FSIs resonate intrinsically in the 30–50 Hz range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fellous et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pike et al., 2000</xref>). In turn, FSIs are more likely to generate action potentials in response to gamma-modulated sinusoidal waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pike et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that action potential generation in FSIs may favor gamma frequency input. This process may be regulated by 5HT. Indeed, 5HT can increase FSI intrinsic excitability, as measured at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weber and Andrade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou and Hablitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhong and Yan, 2011</xref>), but whether this also changes how FSIs encode synaptic input is not known.</p><p>Here, we used patch clamp electrophysiology, glutamate uncaging, optogenetic stimulation, and compartmental modeling to investigate how serotonergic modulation of FSIs can regulate the integration of synaptic inputs, particularly at gamma frequencies. We found that 5HT enhances the excitability of FSIs due to a depolarization caused by a suppression of inward-rectifying potassium channels. Furthermore, we found that this reduction of potassium conductance in FSI dendrites increases the time constant of synaptic potentials, leading to a selective enhancement of temporal summation of gamma frequency inputs. This made FSIs more likely to fire action potentials, specifically in response to gamma-frequency inputs, and resulted in more inhibition in the gamma frequency band in downstream pyramidal neurons. These results suggest that 5HT can play a role in modulating prefrontal circuit activity by enhancing the flow of gamma-frequency information through FSIs via modulation of passive membrane properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activating 5HT2A receptors increases FSI intrinsic excitability</title><p>To determine if 5HT modulated the intrinsic properties of FSIs, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of fluorescent neurons in PV-Cre::Ai14 mice and applied 5HT (30 µM). 5HT consistently depolarized FSIs by 6.1 ± 1.1 mV, from −71 ± 1.3 mV to −66 ± 2.2 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, p&lt;0.005, paired t-test 5HT vs. baseline, n = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, p=0.03, 5HT n = 10 vs. time-locked controls n = 8, post-hoc Tukey comparison after one-way ANOVA with p=<italic>0.005</italic>) and increased input resistance by 31.1 ± 6.0%, from 92.9 ± 11.5 MΩ to 121.6 ± 16.9 MΩ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, p=0.026, paired t-test 5HT vs. baseline, n = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, p=<italic>0.037</italic> 5HT n = 10 vs. time-locked controls n = 8, post-hoc Tukey comparison after one-way ANOVA with p=<italic>0.004</italic>).

Interneuron classes that arise from the CGE, including CCK and VIP interneurons, have been shown to express 5HT3A receptors exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>); however, It is unclear whether the other major MGE-derived class, somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM), express 5HT2A receptors. Therefore, we made similar excitability measurements from fluorescently identified SOM + neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Intrinsic excitability was unaltered by 5HT application (p=0.34 for V<sub>m</sub> and p=0.14 for <italic>R<sub>in</sub>, paired t-test 5HT vs. baseline</italic>, n = 6). Overall, this indicates that FSIs respond to serotonin in a unique manner.</p><p>To determine if activation of endogenous serotonergic fibers could also increase FSI excitability in mPFC, we expressed ChR2 in serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. A Cre-dependent virus (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP) was injected into SERT-Cre mice, which express Cre-recombinase under the promoter for the serotonin transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that both ChR2 expressing cells in the DRN and axon terminals in mPFC contained 5HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). After waiting 5+ months for trafficking of ChR2 to prefrontal terminals, whole-cell recordings were made from prefrontal FSIs and serotonergic terminals were stimulated with rhythmic flashes of light (470 nm,~2 mW, 5 ms flashes, 10 Hz for 10 s). Endogenous 5HT release increased FSI firing rate from 10.9 ± 3.8 Hz to 29.8 ± 6.8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, p=<italic>0.035</italic>, during stimulation vs. before stimulation, paired t-test, n = 7).

To further investigate effects of 5HT on FSI responses to synaptic inputs (as opposed to somatic current injection), we optogenetically activated glutamatergic inputs from contralateral mPFC while recording from FSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>, 470 nm, ~2 mW, 5 ms flashes, 10 flashes at 5 Hz). 5HT application increased the number of spikes elicited by each light flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic> for both treatment and flash number in repeated measures two-way ANOVA, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic> for the interaction term, p&lt;0.05 for flashes 1–8 5HT vs. baseline post-hoc comparison Bonferroni correction, n = 9).</p><p>By increasing membrane resistivity, 5HT could affect how synaptic inputs are filtered along FSI dendrites. To test this hypothesis, we delivered single light flashes at lower light power (~0.5–1 mW) and recorded excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) before and after 5HT application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> bottom).

To determine whether 5HT altered K<sup>+</sup> channel function, we made voltage clamp recordings during a membrane potential ramp from −130 mV to −50 mV over 3 s. We measured the total whole-cell current throughout the ramp before and after 5HT application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> top). 5HT decreased the slope of the I-V curve (p=0.037, paired t-test 5HT vs. baseline, n = 7), indicating a decrease in membrane conductance.

According to Ohm’s law, increasing R<sub>in</sub> might be expected to elicit an increase in EPSP amplitude (V<sub>syn</sub> = I<sub>syn</sub>R<sub>in</sub>). However, this could be countered by a decrease in driving force (V<sub>m</sub>-E<sub>syn</sub>) if the membrane depolarization from 5HT was sufficiently large. In fact, in our compartmental model, reducing the dendritic g<sub>K</sub> to mimic the experimentally observed effects of 5HT on <italic>somatic</italic> V<sub>m</sub> and R<sub>in</sub> caused a <italic>decrease</italic> in the EPSP amplitude and synaptic current when measured at the dendrite (90% of baseline amplitude, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), indicating that this reduction in driving force dominates the dendritic response to synaptic stimulation. However, due to the increase in R<sub>in</sub>, the dendritic EPSP also attenuates less as it travels toward the soma such that the EPSP amplitude, measured at the soma, is ultimately unchanged by this manipulation. As such, the effects of reducing dendritic g<sub>K</sub> on EPSP amplitude and tau should depend on the distance of the synapse from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Indeed, in our model, placing the synapse closer to the soma (&lt;100 µm) and reducing dendritic g<sub>K</sub> to match the observed effects of 5HT on V<sub>m</sub> and R<sub>m</sub> slightly reduced the somatic EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). By contrast, moving the model synapse further out along the dendrite (100–150 µm) did not affect the EPSP amplitude, presumably indicating that for a range of dendritic locations, the effects on driving force and EPSP attenuation cancel out. At distances furthest from the soma (&gt;150 µm), somatic EPSP amplitude was increased after reducing g<sub>K</sub>. We did consistently observe an increase in EPSP tau especially when the model synapse was placed far from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results from our computational model provide simple intuition as to how 5HT can modulate the EPSP decay without affecting EPSP amplitude.</p><p>Since our modeling results suggest that 5HT acts mainly to suppress K<sup>+</sup> channels located in the dendrites, we decided to test this experimentally by delivering 5HT exclusively to the dendrites using local iontophoresis under two-photon guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). 5HT significantly increased FSI firing rate when applied immediately adjacent to a dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, p=<italic>0.001</italic>, before iontophoresis vs. after iontophoresis, paired t-test, n = 9). By computationally filtering out spikes from our traces, we determined that dendritic iontophoresis of 5HT elicited a 1.19 ± 0.69 mV depolarization of the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). By applying this same filtering technique to spike trains elicited by somatic current injection, we found that a somatic depolarization of 2.63 ± 1.57 mV of FSIs was sufficient to cause an increase in firing rate comparable to that observed by dendritic iontophoresis of 5HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This effect disappeared when the iontophoretic pipette was withdrawn from the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, p=0.14, same analysis, n = 7).

All iontophoretic sites were &gt;30 µm from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), confirming that effects are due to local action of 5HT at receptors on the dendrite and not due to diffusion of 5HT to the soma.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31991.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Local 5HT iontophoresis at FSI dendrites increases FSI firing.</title><p>(<bold>A,C</bold>) Experimental design: Neurons were patched and filled with Alexa-488. 5HT was applied locally to the dendrite using iontophoresis (50 ms), while FSIs were injected with a small amount of depolarizing current to elicit spiking.

This suggests that 5HT might promote temporal summation (and spike output) in response to inputs arriving specifically in the 50 to 100 Hz range (i.e. in line with the prolonged decay), To test this, we first mimicked glutamatergic input onto FSI dendrites using two-photon flash photolysis of caged-glutamate, as this technique allows precise control of the position and timing of synaptic activity.

In our preparation, we did not find distinct subpopulations of FSIs with differential responses to 5HT; all recorded FSIs displayed an increase in membrane potential, input resistance, and excitability. Therefore, by regulating the temporal summation of inputs to FSIs and resulting FSI spiking, serotonergic actions on FSI dendrites may provide a substrate for regulating the power or frequency of network oscillatory activity, thereby enhancing information transfer to downstream structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>).

Recordings were discarded if Rs changed by &gt;25%.</p><p>Fast-spiking interneurons were identified by fluorescent visualization of td-Tomato (PV-Cre::Ai14 mice) or mCherry expressed by Cre-dependent viral injection (AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry or AAV-DJ-Ef1a-DIO-mCherry, PV-Cre mice) or mCherry driven by the Dlxi12b enhancer (AAV5-Dlxi12b-mCherry, SERT-Cre mice).</p><p>All bath-applied drugs (Tocris, Minneapolis, MN) were dissolved in water (3, 15, 30, or 100 µM 5HT, 10 µM CNQX, 100 µM DL-AP5, 10 µM gabazine, 1 µM CNO, 30 µM α-methyl-5HT, 2 µM carbachol) or DMSO (1 µM MDL100907) before being diluted in aCSF. MNI-Glutamate (2.5 mM) was dissolved directly in aCSF as powder. Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) was dissolved in water and then diluted to 10 µM in internal solution. For experiments including iontophoresis, the 5HT or vehicle solutions were made to pH = 4.5 using 10N HCl. The experimenter was not blind to pharmacological treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viral injection for expression of ChR2 or fluorescent reporter</title><p>Viral injections were performed using standard mouse stereotactical methods. Mice were anesthetized for the duration of the surgery using isofluorane gas. After cleaning, an incision was made in the scalp, the skull was leveled, and small burr holes were drilled over the brain region of interest using a dental drill. Virus was injected through the burr holes using a microinjector (WPI, Sarasota, FL) at a speed of 150 nL/min and the scalp was closed using sutures or tissue adhesive (3M, St. Paul, MN).</p><p>For expression of ChR2 in serotonergic neurons, we injected a Cre-dependent ChR2 virus (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP, 1 µL) into the dorsal raphe of SERT-Cre mice (&gt;p40) and waited 5–15 months for trafficking of ChR2 to the axon terminals in mPFC. In these mice, we additionally injected an AAV-Dlxi12b-mCherry virus (750 nL) into the mPFC one month before patching to label interneurons for easy identification.</p><p>For stimulation of synaptic inputs into mPFC using ChR2, we injected a ChR2 virus driven by the CaMKII promoter (AAV5-CaMKII-ChR2-eYFP, 750 nL) unilaterally into PV-Cre::Ai14 mice and patched FSIs in the opposite hemisphere after waiting 4–5 weeks for expression.</p><p>For DREADD activation of fast-spiking interneurons, we injected a Cre-dependent virus expressing the Gq-DREADD (AAV-DJ-Ef1a-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, 750 nL) or a control fluorophore (AAV-DJ-Ef1a-DIO-mCherry, 750 nL) into PV-Cre<sup>+/-</sup> mice and patched from fluorescent cells after waiting 5 weeks for expression.</p><p>Dorsal raphe injection coordinates were A/P=−4.55, M/L = 0.0, D/V = −3.0. mPFC injection coordinates were A/P=1.7, M/L = ±0.3, D/V = −2.75</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ChR2 stimulation</title><p>We stimulated ChR2 in terminals using 5 ms flashes of light generated by a Lambda DG-4 (Sutter Instruments) high-speed optical switch with a 300 W Xenon lamp delivered through a 470 nm excitation filter. For stimulation of 5HT terminals, light flashes were delivered at 10 Hz for 10 s through a 40x objective. For stimulation of ChR2 from contralateral PFC, we delivered a train of 10 light flashes at 5 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrical stimulation</title><p>mPFC synapses were stimulated using an IsoFLEX stimulator (AMPI, Israel, 200 µs pulse duration) via a bipolar glass stimulation electrode (Sutter, Novato, CA) placed within 100 µm of the patched cell. A 2-s stimulus train was delivered where stimulus pulses of varying interstimulus intervals (5, 10, 20, 50, 100 ms) were randomly distributed in the train.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-photon imaging, glutamate uncaging, and 5HT iontophoresis</title><p>Neurons were visualized using a two-photon imaging system (Bruker, Middleton, WI) powered by two femtosecond lasers (Coherent, Ultra II) as previously described (Bender and Trussell, 2009). Internal solution was supplemented with 10 µM Alexa 488 and dendritic arbors were visualized with an 880 nm excitation source. For local application of 5HT to specific neuronal subcompartments or minimal 5HT application during uncaging experiments, borosilicate pipettes were filled with 200 mM 5HT in H<sub>2</sub>O (pH adjusted to 4.5). Scanning interference contrast images of slice morphology and the iontophoretic pipette were acquired with a photomultiplier tube downstream of a 770 nm longpass filter. The iotophoretic pipette was positioned upstream of the application site, relative to the overall flow of extracellular solution, either directly above the slice, near the recorded somata (within 10 µm) for uncaging experiments, or in proximity to a dendrite (0–15 µm). 5HT was applied using a 200 nA pulses (40 nA backing current) for 5 s (uncaging) or 50 ms (local iontophoresis) using an ION-100 current generator (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN).</p><p>To activate putative synaptic sites along FSI dendrites, 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged L-glutamate (MNI-glutamate, 2.5 mM, Tocris) was photolyzed using a 720 nm excitation source (0.5 ms duration, power determined empirically to produce 0.5–5 mV EPSPs at the soma). Five uncaging locations were chosen on a single dendrite spaced 1 µm apart. Glutamate was uncaged at each location individually and then at all locations together in a burst with varying interstimulus intervals (0.12, 5, 10, 20, 50 ms). The sequence of uncaging events always began at the most distal dendritic location, approaching the soma serially. Results were averaged over 4–7 repetitions at each interstimulus interval before and after iontophoretic 5HT application. Trials in which EPSP failures were noted due to preparation drift, or in which spikes were generated, were discarded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Computational modeling</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Algebraic model</title><p>A simple double exponential voltage response (template EPSP) was created using the following equation: (1/normfac)* (-exp(-t/tau<sub>slow</sub>))+exp(-t/tau<sub>fast</sub>)) where normfac = (tau<sub>slow</sub>/tau<sub>fast</sub>)^(tau<sub>fast</sub>/(tau<sub>fast</sub>-tau<sub>slow</sub>)) and t is time. The decay tau (tau<sub>slow</sub>) was set to either 15 ms (tau<sub>baseline</sub>) or 23 ms (tau<sub>5HT</sub>). The template EPSP was convolved five times at varying ISIs (0–50 ms). EPSP amplitude was calculated by taking the maximum of the convolved trace.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Compartmental model in NEURON</title><p>Our compartmental neuronal model was adapted from a model FSI from the Allen Institute for Brain Science (ID#: 469610831). All channel parameters from this model were translated into NEURON and commands were run in the hoc language. The original model contained only one mechanism for passive conductance (reversal potential e = −61.6229). This single passive mechanism was split into two separate mechanisms: K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>pas</sub>, e<sub>K</sub> = −107 mV) and Na<sup>+</sup> passive (Na<sub>pas</sub>, e<sub>Na</sub> = 53 mV) and the values of these conductances (g) were altered while maintaining their relative conductances to each other until the resting membrane potential and input resistance of the cell matched experimental values. Dendritic diameter was set to 1.5 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gulyás et al., 1999</xref>) and axial resistance (R<sub>a</sub>) was set to 172 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nörenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Five double exponential synapses (e<sub>syn</sub> = 0 mV) were either placed at the midpoint of one dendrite (96 µm from soma, 1 µm apart). Synaptic parameters (tau, weight) were modified until the EPSP waveform matched experimental data. In some experiments, background synaptic noise was inserted as a point process into a subset of dendrites with a stochastic model containing fluctuating excitatory and inhibitory conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michalikova et al., 2017</xref>). The level of background noise was varied by scaling total synaptic conductance to match Rin values obtained during in vivo whole-cell recordings of cortical FSIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pala and Petersen, 2015</xref>). Each model was replicated 10 times with random noise. To mimic the effects of 5HT in the model neuron, the conductances of K + channels in the soma (K<sub>pas</sub>, Kv3.1, SK) and dendrites (K<sub>pas</sub>, Kv3.1, Mv2) were reduced by varying percentages (90–30%) and membrane potential and input resistance (calculated by Ohm’s law for a −50 pA current step) were measured. Synapses were stimulated in the model alone or at varying intervals (5, 10, 20, 50 ms). Tau of the single synaptic response was calculated by fitting an exponential to the decay of the EPSP. EPSP amplitude was calculated by taking the maximum of the voltage response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Brain slices obtained for electrophysiological recording were drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered solution overnight, then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cryopreserved in 30% sucrose solution in PBS, and then re-sectioned at 50 µm using a freezing stage microtome. Sections were rinsed in PBS and blocked with blocking solution (Fisher B10710) for 1 hr. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS overnight at 4°C. The following primary antibodies were used: Rabbit anti-5HT (Immunostar 20080; 1:500) and mouse anti-GFP (Invitrogen A11120; 1:500). Sections were then rinsed with PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies (1:250, Invitrogen: Alexa 405 goat anti-rabbit A31556, Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse A11029) for 4 hr. Finally, sections were rinsed and mounted (Fisher P36934). Images were obtained using a high speed wide-field microscope (Nikon Ti, with Andor Zyla 5.5 sCMOS) with a 10x/0.45 or 20x/0.75 (+ + 60 x) Plan Apo objective. Fiji software was used to make adjustments for brightness and contrast. Widefield images were stitched with Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are shown as mean ±1 SEM.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Athilingam et al. examines conclusively the influence of 5HT on the excitability of PV interneurons of the medial prefrontal cortex in mice using in vitro electrophysiology, optogenetics, 2P single cell imaging, pharmacogenetics and single cell computation. The authors demonstrate that 5HT has a depolarizing effect on PVIs, increases the input resistance of PV cells by reducing potassium conductances and, finally, slows the decay of EPSPs, which in turn enhances the temporal summation of EPSPs. The reviewers, however, formulated some critical points that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The effect of 5HT iontophoresis on the EPSP time course and the summation of EPSPs cannot be directly compared with the expression of hM3D receptors because rAAVs will allow an expression of hM3D receptors on the entire dendritic tree plus axon whereas the expression of 5HT receptors may be more compartmentalized. Thus, the conclusions of this set of data (hM3D receptor-mediated) should be toned down.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> should include the data mentioned in the text: the change in EPSP amplitude as a function of distance along the somato-dendritic domain with and without 5HT-mediated effects (Rin, Vm).</p><p>3) The relationship between the effects of 5HT on the enhanced summation of EPSPs evoked at gamma frequencies should be experimentally strengthened. One possibility could be to examine whether the effects of 5-HT on synaptic responses translates to more rhythmic spiking output of FSIs by measuring autocorrelograms. Alternatively, they may consider inducing gamma oscillations in slice preparations (e.g. bath application of kainite) and examine whether 5HT induces enhanced gamma power. If the experimental applications are not fruitful, the authors should acknowledge the limitations of their findings.</p><p>4) Using Gq-DREADDs to examine downstream signaling pathways of 5-HT, assuming the 2A receptors are responsible for the effects of 5-HT, is an interesting approach. However, this method may not necessarily activate these signaling pathways in the same way that 5-HT does and the Gq pathway is not specific to 5-HT. The involvement of 5HT2A receptors should be directly tested. The authors should also administer CNO in uninjected mice as a control (see MacLaren et al. 2016, JNeurosci).</p><p>5) &quot;[C]hanges in EPSP decay were most prominent in the 10-20 ms after the stimulus&quot;. The increase looks quite similar over the 10-50 ms range. Therefore, provide statistical support for this statement.</p><p>6) An outstanding question is how the effects described in the present study will translate to the intact brain. One study (Puig et al. 2010) found that 5-HT release decreased the amplitude of gamma oscillations in vivo. Please discuss more thoroughly the data in context to published work as well as future directions for examining the contribution of 5-HT to gamma oscillations.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend seems to be wrong.

However, it seems that the conclusions regarding retention of the 5HT-enhancing effects on gamma integration in vivo need to be fleshed out. If the in vivo condition can be modeled by an increase in leak (mixed Na/K) due to synaptic iGluRs, then the relative contribution of the Kir conductance to the overall leak conductance will be less than in the in vitro case. Is this what was modeled? The same absolute change in K conductance on top of an overall increased leak?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31991.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The effect of 5HT iontophoresis on the EPSP time course and the summation of EPSPs cannot be directly compared with the expression of hM3D receptors because rAAVs will allow an expression of hM3D receptors on the entire dendritic tree plus axon whereas the expression of 5HT receptors may be more compartmentalized.

Results were comparable to the DREADD experiment data, suggesting that DREADD expression at the very least engages the same downstream modulatory pathways, and that off-target effects of DREADD activation are not apparent. Therefore, we feel confident that 5HT2AR signaling in FSIs enhances FSI firing in response to gamma frequency inputs, and that DREADDs are a reasonable mimic. This is important for new experiments where we utilized DREADDs to address comment 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> should include the data mentioned in the text: the change in EPSP amplitude as a function of distance along the somato-dendritic domain with and without 5HT-mediated effects (Rin, Vm).</p></disp-quote><p>Since this is somewhat secondary to the main finding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we felt these data were best contained in a supplemental figure in the original submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>).

Unfortunately, we did not observe an increase in gamma power in these experiments, likely because of the experimental design. Here, we injected a stimulus train in which interstimulus intervals were randomly drawn from a predetermined set of ISIs. This elicited little repetitive spiking (the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is a good case – some cells had much less). The paucity of repetitive spiking (likely due to lack of background synaptic activity) limited our ability to observe changes in rhythmic gamma frequency spiking. Therefore, we did indeed turn to “active” slice techniques. Kainate bath application, unfortunately, did not elicit gamma at baseline. This is consistent with the literature, which has reported difficulty in generating gamma in PFC slices (though it is possible in hippocampus) (Fisahn, J Neurophys, 2004, McNally et al.,Neuroscience, 2009).</p><p>Given these results, we instead utilized an active slice preparation based on the application of carbachol, which we have successfully used in the past to elicit sustained network activity in prefrontal slices (Luongo, Horn, and Sohal, Biol Psych, 2016). Here, we recorded inhibitory responses from downstream pyramidal neurons. To isolate modulation to FSIs, we again made use of the Gq-DREADD, as this allows us to selectively activate Gq in FSIs (in contrast to 5HT2A application, which may have other effects in active slices). We found that Gq-DREADD activation of FSIs increased the probability of gamma frequency IPSCs recorded in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We believe this new data not only strengthens the relationship between 5HT signaling and the enhancement of gamma frequency activity in FSIs, but also provides insight into potential modulation of network activity by 5HT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Using Gq-DREADDs to examine downstream signaling pathways of 5-HT, assuming the 2A receptors are responsible for the effects of 5-HT, is an interesting approach.

These data are now contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. As mentioned above, we have also replicated the findings of the Gq-DREADD using a 5HT2A agonist and included this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;[C]hanges in EPSP decay were most prominent in the 10-20 ms after the stimulus&quot;.

Therefore, provide statistical support for this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon further examination, we realized that there was an error in the data analysis underlying this figure. In a few experiments, cell health diminished before the complete dataset could be acquired in 5HT. Thus, for 4 of the 43 total dendritic uncaging sites (27 total cells), there were no post-5HT data. For those conditions, baseline EPSPs were still included, but post-5HT values corresponding to the lost trials were not. For these lost trials, values of 0 were erroneously included in the original average. We have corrected this error and revised the figure. Please note that the revised figure matches the differences in mean decay far better than the original, and that there is a clear peak between 10-20 ms. Nevertheless, we cannot identify a straightforward metric to support the original statement. The wording has been changed to say “changes in EPSP decay peaked 10-20 ms after stimulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) An outstanding question is how the effects described in the present study will translate to the intact brain.

We have now performed a dose-response curve experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and observed that the dose of 30 µM is sub-saturating, eliciting a response that is ~80% of maximum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The computational modeling nicely complements the experimental results.
