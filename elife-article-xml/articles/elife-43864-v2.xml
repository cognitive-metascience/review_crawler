energy in most cells. We have previously reported cryo-EM maps of autoinhibited <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase imaged without addition of nucleotide (Sobti et al. 2016), indicating that the subunit ε engages the α, β and γ subunits to lock the enzyme and prevent functional rotation. Here we present multiple cryo-EM reconstructions of the enzyme frozen after the addition of MgATP to identify the changes that occur when this ε inhibition is removed. The maps generated show that, after exposure to MgATP, <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase adopts a different conformation with a catalytic subunit changing conformation substantially and the ε C-terminal domain transitioning via an intermediate ‘half-up’ state to a condensed ‘down’ state.

The enzyme consists of two reversible rotary motors, termed F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub>, coupled together by one central and one peripheral stalk, with the simplest subunit composition found in bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The F<sub>o</sub> motor spans the membrane and converts the potential energy of the pmf into rotation of the central stalk that in turn drives conformational changes in the three catalytic sites of the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> F<sub>1</sub> motor subunits to generate ATP. Moreover, this process is reversible so that, if the pmf drops below the threshold needed to power ATP synthesis, the motor has the ability to reverse and, in some bacterial species, operates primarily as a proton pump driven by ATP hydrolysis. Regulation of these ATPase/synthase activities is particularly important in times of cellular stress, primarily to prevent wasteful ATP consumption. However, different regulatory mechanisms are used by different F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> subtypes (bacterial, chloroplastic, mitochondrial) and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sielaff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morales-Rios et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stewart and Stock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gledhill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stewart, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pullman and Monroy, 1963</xref>).</p><p>It has been postulated that bacterial ATP synthases are regulated by several mechanisms, with conformational changes of the ε subunit and catalytic nucleotide occupancies likely playing major roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sielaff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyndman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feniouk et al., 2006</xref>). A long-standing question surrounds the role of the C-terminal domain of the ε subunit (εCTD). The εCTD is known to change conformation and block rotation of the central stalk in the F<sub>1</sub> motor from several bacteria, but this role is absent in the enzyme of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sielaff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laget and Smith, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shirakihara et al., 2015</xref>). In the active bacterial enzyme, the εCTD is proposed to adopt a condensed or ‘down’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krah et al., 2017</xref>), and this state has been observed for isolated ε subunit from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhlin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkens and Capaldi, 1998a</xref>) and <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> (or <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3, hereafter termed PS3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>) as well as in isolated F<sub>1</sub> from <italic>Caldalkalibacillus thermarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>). In autoinhibited states observed in crystal structures of F<sub>1</sub> from <italic>E. coli</italic> and PS3, the εCTDs are extended in similar ‘up’ conformations, so that a helix inserts into the F<sub>1</sub> central cavity and appears to block rotation of the complex by binding to both the central rotor subunit γ and several surrounding α and β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sielaff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendoza-Hoffmann et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, there is a key structural difference between these ‘up’ states: in <italic>E. coli,</italic> the εCTD consists of two helices (here termed εCTH1 and εCTH2; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) separated by an extended loop, with each helix interacting with a different region of the γ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodgers and Wilce, 2000</xref>); whereas in PS3, εCTH1 and εCTH2 instead join to form one continuous helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shirakihara et al., 2015</xref>). In PS3 and a related <italic>Bacillus</italic> species, ATP is known to bind to the ε subunit and stabilise the ‘down’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato-Yamada and Yoshida, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato-Yamada, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>), and a clear mechanism of regulation by the εCTD and ATP levels has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shirakihara et al., 2015</xref>). However, the physiological importance of the εCTD in ATP synthases of other bacteria, such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, has remained uncertain. Crosslinking studies have suggested that the εCTD of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase could act as a ratchet, preventing hydrolysis - but not synthesis - of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsunoda et al., 2001</xref>). However, deletion studies performed in vivo, in which the <italic>E. coli</italic> εCTD was removed, showed minimal impact on cell growth or viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shah and Duncan, 2015</xref>), although deletion of just the five terminal residues results in decreased respiratory growth due to increased inhibition of ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). For the highly latent enzyme from <italic>C. thermarum</italic>, an early study indicated the εCTD is involved in inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keis et al., 2006</xref>), but thus far crystallographic studies of its F<sub>1</sub> complex have shown the εCTD in the down conformation irrespective of ATP binding to ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>). Despite confusion over the possible importance of the εCTD for the bacteria noted above, one recent study demonstrated that the εCTD can impact the virulence of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> is essential for viability of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and functions in pH homeostasis and in its acid tolerance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrándiz and de la Campa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cortes et al., 2015</xref>). In a mouse model of pneumococcal bacteraemia, a frameshift mutation that scrambled the sequence of the εCTD was found to increase pneumococcal survival in the spleen, most likely by reducing killing by splenic macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerlini et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is important to characterize more fully the bacterial εCTD and its different conformational states and interactions within bacterial ATP synthases.</p><p>In contrast to the crystallographic reports mentioned above with isolated ε subunits or soluble F<sub>1</sub>, our previous cryo-EM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>) provided maps of the intact <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase. These data were obtained using purified protein without the addition of exogenous nucleotide, thus likely representing a state autoinhibited by ε, here termed ATP synthase<sup>AI</sup>. Here we have used similar methodologies to investigate the effect of ATP on the conformation of <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, by cryo-freezing and subsequently imaging the enzyme after a brief incubation with 10 mM MgATP. The maps obtained (termed ATP synthase<sup>+ATP</sup> hereafter) indicate that, in the presence of MgATP, the εCTD became detached from the body of the enzyme, coupled with a large change in one of the three catalytic β subunits. Further analysis identified an intermediate in which the εCTD was in a ‘half-up’ conformation, suggesting that the enzyme can still rotate, even when the ε subunit is not in its condensed down position, as well as an εCTD ‘down’ conformation likely showing an active intermediate. Further inspection of our maps demonstrated peaks present in all six nucleotide-binding sites in the ATP synthase<sup>+ATP</sup> enzyme (three catalytic β sites and three noncatalytic α sites), in contrast to the autoinhibited protein in which only four binding pockets (a single catalytic β site and three noncatalytic α sites) were occupied with nucleotide. Together with our previous work, these results reveal three distinct positions taken up by the εCTD in response to different catalytic nucleotide–bound states, providing further insight into the mechanism of ATP synthase regulation in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase in the presence of ATP</title><p>To determine the structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase in the presence of ATP, the detergent-solubilized <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>) was incubated with 10 mM ATP (containing 50 μM ADP [n = 3; stdev = 2 μM]) and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for 30 s at 20°C prior to preparing grids for cryo-EM. Sample preparation took a further 15 s before cryogenic temperature was reached, with approximately 0.25 mM ATP hydrolysed to ADP in the total time for preparation (45 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The time used for these experiments was optimized to be within the linear range of ADP production, so that uninhibited ATP synthase could be observed, with an ADP concentration of ~0.3 mM at the time of freezing. 10 mM ATP and a 45 s preparation time were chosen to emulate the concentrations seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> growing under aerobic conditions, where 9.6 mM ATP and 0.6 mM ADP has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yaginuma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The grids produced after incubation with ATP were similar to those used in our previous study of the autoinhibited enzyme and micrographs showed clear ATP synthase particles. A dataset of 8509 movie micrographs was collected at 200 kV accelerating voltage, of which 7858 were selected based on image quality. 579,942 particles were picked and 319,315 of these appeared to be of the intact complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Three different rotational conformations could be filtered from these data (each containing 97,095, 72,757 and 51,534 particles) that were related by a 120° rotation of the central stalk, displaying the hallmark dynamic movements predicted for ATPases/synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). The quality of the maps obtained for each conformation was comparable, with resolutions of 5.0 Å, 5.3 Å and 5.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). However, the proportion of particles corresponding to each reconstruction differed from our previous study (33% State 1, 44% State 2 and 23% State 3 in this study, compared with 46% State 1, 30% State 2 and 24% State 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that a larger number of molecules were now observed in State 2 rather than State 1.

Our previous maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>) described the overall peripheral stalk architecture in <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, to which density was attributed as belonging to two b subunits and one δ subunit. In light of recent higher resolution cryo-EM maps of the eukaryotic F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase from <italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>), we attempted to assign the density of the peripheral stalk more precisely in the new maps. Of particular interest was a small density peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>, pink density) that cannot be identified in other structures of related ATP synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morales-Rios et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). However, this density can be identified in all cryo-EM maps produced of <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase thus far (EMD-8357, EMD-8358, EMD-8359 and the maps presented in this study). The length of the density relating to the b subunits was measured to investigate whether this additional density could be attributed to the b subunits, and found to be 233 Å and 227 Å (termed b<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>2</sub>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Together with the prediction that residues 66–122 of the b subunits form an unstaggered coiled coil in the isolated dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Rizzo et al., 2002</xref>), this suggests that the additional density peak represents the C-terminus of just the b<sub>2</sub> subunit. The differing conformation between the b<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>2</sub> subunits seen here appears to be unique to some bacterial ATP synthases and is likely due to their being a homodimer in these systems. Other related F-ATP synthases, such as <italic>Paracoccus denitrificans</italic>, contain two different b subunits (termed b and b’) that differ in length and sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morales-Rios et al., 2015</xref>) and therefore can adopt their own individual folds. In <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase, each b subunit is required to adopt two different conformations using the same amino acid sequence. This may be due to the requirement of the homodimer binding to asymmetric α and δ surfaces, whereby the b<sub>1</sub> subunit forms the majority of the contacts between the F<sub>1</sub> motor while the b<sub>2</sub> subunit folds back onto itself providing rigidity to the peripheral stalk. Most recently, a high-resolution structure of PS3 ATP synthase has been reported using cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo and Rubinstein, 2018</xref>). Although the maps and models are not currently available, similar density can be seen suggesting that the break in symmetry of the b subunits observed at the top of the F<sub>1</sub> motor is conserved across species which contain a homodimeric b subunit. Moreover, analysis of our improved maps of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase<sup>AI</sup> (particularly State 2, which shows the clearest density in the F<sub>o</sub> region) corroborates the results from the far higher resolution structure of the PS3 enzyme, showing a similar overall fold in the membrane F<sub>o</sub> region to spinach chloroplast ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>), although following slightly different trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It is unlikely that the ‘half-up’ conformation we observe here is an artefact generated by the cysteine residue free construct used in this study, because in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>) the same cysteine-free enzyme did not show the ‘half-up’ state. In addition, previous studies using γC87S mutant protein did not show any change in ε inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 1995</xref>), and in the structure of the native enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>) loops in the γ subunit separate the cysteines in subunit γ and residues in the εCTH1, so that they are not in direct contact.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43864.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for the release of εCTD from the inhibitory ‘up’ conformation in <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase.</title><p>Structural models presented as maps (above; <italic>E. coli</italic> crystal structure in (<bold>a</bold>) presented as low smooth map for comparison) and simple schematics (below) to describe the possible structural movements of <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase during activation. In a nucleotide-free solution, the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase adopts an inactive state (seen in the crystal structure of isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>) and the ATP synthase<sup>AI</sup> cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>; (<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>) respectively). The isolated F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase shows one of the β subunits in a ‘half-closed’ state (labelled as HC), interacting with the ‘up’ conformation of the εCTH2 (<bold>a</bold>). In the cryo-EM maps of the intact enzyme (<bold>b</bold>), the same β subunit adopts an open conformation (labelled as O) where it no longer interacts with the εCTH2, allowing the reversible release of the helix from its inserted position. In the presence of ATP, the εCTD is seen in two conformations (<bold>c and d</bold>) that no longer contact the α and β subunits, and the aforementioned β subunit then adopts a closed state (labelled as C) that prevents the εCTD from returning to the ‘up’ conformation. The εCTD can either be in a ‘half-up’ (<bold>c</bold>) conformation, with the εCTH2 mobile, or a ‘down’ conformation (<bold>d</bold>) with both εCTH1 and εCTH2 in a condensed form.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43864-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Structural data from this and previous studies suggest that loading multiple catalytic sites with nucleotides disrupts access of the εCTD to the inhibitory ‘up’ state in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In a nucleotide-free solution, the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase adopts an autoinhibited state (seen in the crystal structure of isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>) and the ATP synthase<sup>AI</sup> cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). The isolated F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase shows one β subunit (β<sub>DP</sub>) in a ‘half-closed’ state, with ADP bound, which interacts directly with the ‘up’ conformation of the εCTH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In the ATP synthase<sup>AI</sup> cryo-EM map, the same β subunit is unoccupied and has adopted an open conformation that no longer interacts with the εCTH2, which could facilitate a reversible mechanism whereby the helix is able to escape from its inserted position. When compared with isolated F<sub>1</sub>, the reduced interactions with the ‘up’ state of subunit ε seen in the complete F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> complex may explain why ε inhibition is significantly reduced upon rebinding of <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub> to F<sub>o</sub>. In the ATP synthase<sup>+ATP</sup> cryo-EM maps, all catalytic sites are at least partially occupied with nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>) and the εCTD is seen in two conformations that no longer contact the α and β subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). Because we only observed the εCTD in the ‘up’ conformation in the absence of ATP, these results indicate that nucleotide binding to the catalytic subunits, in either one or a combination of catalytic sites, is important for the release of the εCTD. Binding of ATP is unlikely to accelerate release of the εCTD from the ‘up’ state, as that would conflict with the known noncompetitive nature of ε inhibition with <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>. Rather, as the εCTH2 escapes from the central cavity of the ATP synthase<sup>AI</sup> conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), rapid binding of ATP would induce a transition from the open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, ‘O’) to the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c/d</xref>, ‘C’), preventing re-entry of εCTH2 until the next catalytic dwell position. Finally, the ‘half-up’ conformation seen for the εCTD supports the prediction that the εCTH2 can remain mobile, anchored to γ by the εCTH1, so that it can re-enter the central cavity at a later step in the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>). It is also possible that this εCTH1 interaction alone may be able to modulate enzyme activity, as seen in a previous deletion study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakanishi-Matsui et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ‘down’ conformation of the ε subunit has been observed for the isolated ε subunit of PS3 with ATP bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>) and on F<sub>1</sub> from <italic>C. thermarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>). For ATP synthase<sup>+ATP</sup> cryo-EM maps containing the εCTD in the ‘down’ conformation, close inspection showed very weak density, consistent with a fraction of these complexes showing nucleotide bound to the ε subunit. Docking of the <italic>C. thermarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>) ε subunit with ATP bound, showed good correlation between the position occupied by the nucleotide and additional density seen in the ATP synthase<sup>+ATP</sup> map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). Partial occupancy would be consistent with the concentration of ATP employed in our study being slightly below the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ~22 mM observed for ATP binding to isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> ε subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>), and so because weak density attributable to nucleotide bound to the εCTD was only seen with the down conformation, it is possible that the ‘half-up’ conformation, with the associated probable disorder of εCTH2, might result when nucleotide is not bound to the ε subunit. Further work, for example, using a range of ATP concentrations, will be needed to resolve this point.</p><p>Although the movements of the εCTD are well defined by this study, the resolution of the reconstructions is limited compared to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo and Rubinstein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>). We believe this is likely due to inherent flexibility in the complex, possible varying subunit or lipid stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chorev et al., 2018</xref>), the detergent used, ice thickness, particle density and the lower accelerator voltage used during image acquisition (200 vs. 300 kV). Moreover, we only observed three rotational states whereas seven were seen in bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) and thirteen in <italic>Polytomella sp</italic>. mitochondrial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>). We did employ methods similar to those used in these studies in an attempt to observe rotary sub-steps in the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme, but were unsuccessful. Although the complex should be undergoing rotation, due to the ATP hydrolysis that is occurring during freezing, single molecule studies have shown that in order for the complex to spend significant time in rotary sub-steps it had to be imaged under high drag, such as in 30% polyethylene glycol with a large object attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the poor density seen at the membrane interface of the subunit b dimer, points towards these reconstructions containing multiple conformations, which may contribute to limiting the resolution obtained. It is possible that further work to obtain a much larger dataset, containing many more particles, may enable identification of more of the rotary sub-steps that are likely present in this sample.</p><p>Recent work on <italic>Polytomella sp</italic>. mitochondrial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>) has described this ATP synthase in great detail, showing a flexible coupling between the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> motors mediated by a hinge region in <italic>OSCP</italic> (analogous to the δ subunit in <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase). Comparison of the peripheral stalks in this study, by superposition of either the F<sub>o</sub> stator or the N-terminal region of subunit δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), shows that the peripheral stalk likely bends and twists as the enzyme undergoes rotary catalysis, as suggested in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). We do not observe movement in the delta/OSCP hinge, most likely due to our inability to resolve rotary substates in our maps.</p><p>In previous studies on <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase, the enzyme has been shown to become inactive four hours after purification, possibly due to aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, the enzyme was purified rapidly (see Materials and methods) and EM grids were made shortly after purification to ensure active enzyme was being imaged. The images obtained showing free monodisperse protein with little evidence of aggregation. Furthermore, the enzyme was purified in digitonin rather than the mixture of phosphatidylcholine, octyl glucopyranoside, sodium deoxycholate and sodium cholate used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishmukhametov et al., 2005</xref>). Digitonin was selected because enzyme purified in the original mixture of lipids and detergents was not stable on the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) employed as a final purification step prior to grid freezing. Because the enzyme had been purified in a different detergent and further purified using SEC, we assessed the activity of the digitonin solubilized enzyme using ATP regeneration assays after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 hr to compare with data taken on enzyme purified in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref>). Importantly the enzyme showed little change in activity over 8 hr, suggesting that <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase purified with digitonin and SEC may be less prone to inactivation or aggregation.</p><p>The present study has exploited the ability to manipulate sample conditions immediately before freezing to obtain images of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase at a time when ADP formation from ATP proceeds linearly, and hence likely unhindered, to identify the possible conformational changes that occur to remove the εCTD from the autoinhibitory position. This outcome was achieved by optimizing experimental design, considering particle concentration, as well as mixing and blotting time. Interestingly, employing similar methods on the related bacterial A/V type ATPase from <italic>Thermus thermophilus,</italic> showed that no conformational changes occur in the catalytic or related F subunits upon addition of the ATP transition state mimic fluoroaluminate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2017</xref>). This could be due to different nucleotide affinity, operating temperature or indeed function of the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study presents structural data of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase imaged in the presence of ~9.75 mM ATP and ~0.3 mM ADP, comparable to the concentrations present in the intact bacterium. Compared to our previous work on the autoinhibited enzyme in the absence of ATP, the cryo-EM reconstructions presented here show that a single β subunit and the C-terminal domain of subunit ε change conformation and position substantially upon addition of ATP. Together, our studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that the ε subunit acts as an emergency brake to minimize wasteful hydrolysis of cellular ATP in situations where the ATP-to-ADP ratio is low. As the εCTD has recently been shown to impact pathogenesis of at least one bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerlini et al., 2014</xref>), the different conformations of the εCTD observed in these studies may have potential to guide future development of drugs that could target this bacteria-specific inhibitory mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>ATP was purchased in the form of adenosine 5-triphosphate disodium salt hydrate (Sigma A7699).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>The same preparation was used as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobti et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM reveals distinct conformations of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase on exposure to ATP&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Werner Kühlbrandt as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer 1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Meier (Reviewer #2); Christoph Gerle (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Sobti et al. is a very useful follow up on the 2016 <italic>eLife</italic> paper mostly by the same authors, which reported the complete cryo-EM structure of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATP synthase (Sobti et al., 2016). The previous structure showed the epsilon subunit engaging with the α, β and γ subunits preventing rotation and locking the enzyme. In the present research advance, the authors show a new conformation that involves the epsilon C-terminal domain transitioning via an intermediate &quot;half-up&quot; to a condensed &quot;down&quot; state explaining different conformational states of the activated ATPase upon ATP addition. The data are put nicely into a mechanistic model of F1 activation (Figure 4). The new work complements previous work and provides insights into the structural alterations upon ATP binding. The method used to trap this structural alteration was particularly clever: the enzyme was incubated for a given time with an excess of ATP (10 mM), allowing ATP hydrolysis to proceed before plunge freezing. The exact ATP/ADP ratio was also determined by ATP and ADP quantification. Overall, the findings are important for understanding bacterial ATP synthase regulation and bacterial physiology in general.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear how we know that the &quot;half-up&quot; conformation is not just an artefact? The ATP synthase used was cysteine-free. Please check whether any cysteine(s) might play a role in the stabilising the &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; conformations.</p><p>2) Ishmukhametov et al., 2010, demonstrated that detergent-solubilised <italic>E. coli</italic> ATPase loses its hydrolysis activity within 4 hours. Can the authors exclude that some inactivation has already taken place when they froze their samples? A few more details e.g. on the timing of freezing/thawing the enzyme in the Results or Materials and methods would be interesting.</p><p>3) The <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ATP binding to epsilon was 22 mM (the authors mention and discuss this), but why did they freeze the sample in 9.75 mM ATP? Could this partly explain why only a fraction of the observed conformations was &quot;half-up&quot;, and the &quot;fully up&quot; conformation was not observed? Maybe there was just not enough ATP available, or the ATP/ADP ratio was not ideal for binding? What happens in the presence of more ATP or a higher ATP/ADP ratio? Presumably 9.75 mM ATP was not the only concentration tested, so it would be interesting to know what happened at higher ATP levels.</p><p>4) The map resolution remains significantly below that of other cryo-EM structures of closely related bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthases. The reasons for this are not clear and an explanation should be at least attempted.</p><p>5) Another point that merits more discussion is the partial presence of bound ATP at the epsilon subunit. What is the role of this nucleotide in ATP synthase inhibition? Is it part of a product inhibition mechanism?</p><p>6) To convince the sceptical reader that the structure is indeed in the catalytically active state and not in the ADP Mg<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited state, some additional information would help. Please state the source of the chemicals used, especially ATP and the ATPase concentration in mg/ml (as is usual in the cryo-EM field), rather than as a molar concentration. It is also important to know the ADP concentration for an estimate of how many particles were in the ADP Mg-inhibited state at the point when ATP was added. Please add a classification flow chart that clearly indicates the particle numbers at each stage of classification and refinement.</p><p>7) Three different rotational states were resolved, but why no substates? Please discuss with respect to single molecule studies. Are the unresolved substates the main limitation on resolution?</p><p>8) A key issue in the field is where torsional energy is transiently stored during rotary catalysis. Junge and colleagues have proposed the foot of the central stalk, but cryo-EM structures of inhibited complexes indicate that the peripheral stalk is more flexible. Is this also the case for the <italic>E. coli</italic> complex under working conditions?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised research advance &quot;Cryo-EM reveals distinct conformations of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase on exposure to ATP&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. You have dealt with the reviewer's comments very well, and everything is fine except for one small (but important) point:</p><p>In your response to the reviewers' comments 7 and 8 about rotational states and stalk flexibility, you write that the peripheral stalk flexes between the three rotary states you resolve, as it does in chloroplasts. You show this in a new figure, which is a great addition to the manuscript.</p><p>In your response to point 8 you write that the peripheral stalk flexes as a whole (as expected, and as it does in our structure of the chloroplast ATP synthase), but you did not observe the delta/OSCP hinge that we recently discovered in <italic>Polytomella</italic>. This is not surprising, because the hinge movement is required only between rotary substates, which you do not resolve. In the three primary rotary states, which you do resolve, delta/OSCP is necessarily in the same conformation, and there is no hinge movement. This is also the case in the chloroplast ATP synthase, where rotary substates are likewise not observed, because it is autoinhibited.</p><p>It would be good if you could address and clarify this point in a lightly revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43864.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear how we know that the &quot;half-up&quot; conformation is not just an artefact?

Although we cannot rule out this possibility completely, it is unlikely that the “half-up” conformation we observe here is an artefact generated by cysteine free construct used in this study, because, in our previous study (Sobti et al., 2016), the same cysteine-free enzyme used in the present work did not show the “half-up” state. In addition, previous studies using γC87S mutant protein did not show and change in ε inhibition (Duncan et al., 1995). Moreover, in the structure of the native enzyme (Figure 1—figure supplement 10), loops in the γ subunit separate the mutated cysteines and residues in the εCTH1, so that they are not in direct contact with the εCTD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Ishmukhametov et al., 2010, demonstrated that detergent-solubilised <italic>E. coli</italic> ATPase loses its hydrolysis activity within 4 hours.

A few more details e.g. on the timing of freezing/thawing the enzyme in the Results or Materials and methods would be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been expanded, with an extra paragraph in the Discussion (seventh paragraph), to address this point. The enzyme that was used in this study was made as promptly as possible. The purification method contained two changes compared to Ishmukhametov et al., 2010: (i) digitonin was used as the detergent and (ii) a size exclusion step was included. To test whether the enzyme retained hydrolysis activity over 4 hours at room temperature, the same regeneration assays were performed at the same time points as in Ishmukhametov et al., 2010 (Figure 1—figure supplement 12). Although a small amount of activity is lost over 8 hours, the reduction in ATPase activity is far less than seen previously, suggesting that either digitonin is keeping the protein more stable, or the size exclusion chromatography is removing aggregation nucleates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The K<sub>d</sub> of ATP binding to epsilon was 22 mM (the authors mention and discuss this), but why did they freeze the sample in 9.75 mM ATP? Could this partly explain why only a fraction of the observed conformations was &quot;half-up&quot;, and the &quot;fully up&quot; conformation was not observed? Maybe there was just not enough ATP available, or the ATP/ADP ratio was not ideal for binding? What happens in the presence of more ATP or a higher ATP/ADP ratio? Presumably 9.75 mM ATP was not the only concentration tested, so it would be interesting to know what happened at higher ATP levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been expanded (subsection “Structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase in the presence of ATP”, first paragraph and Discussion, fifth paragraph) to include our rationale for using 9.75 mM ATP and 0.3 mM ADP while freezing. In short, this was to simulate nucleotide concentrations found in <italic>E. coli</italic> and so identify conformations likely to be present in vivo. Importantly, autoinhibition appears to be removed at 1 mM ATP, well below the concentration we employed, and the balance of evidence indicates that nucleotide binding to the ε subunit is unlikely to make a major contribution to the physiological regulation of the ATP synthase in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Many biochemical studies of isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub> have shown that ε inhibition is non-competitive <italic>vs</italic> ATP<sup>3</sup>, and high ATP concentrations do not activate the ATPase of wild-type membranes compared to membranes lacking the entire εCTD (Nakanishi-Matsui et al., 2014). Because weak density attributable to ATP bound to εCTH1 was only seen with the down conformation, it is possible that the half-up conformation, with the associated probable disorder of εCTH2, might result when ATP is not bound to the ε subunit. We mention this possibility in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion and highlight that it would need additional work to evaluate. However, this possibility is peripheral to the main thrust of the present manuscript and would be a major investigation on its own. Imaging in higher or lower concentrations of ATP/ADP is something we are actively working on, but is well beyond the scope of this manuscript and using much higher ATP concentrations is not straight forward (e.g. due to large changes in ionic strength).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The map resolution remains significantly below that of other cryo-EM structures of closely related bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthases. The reasons for this are not clear and an explanation should be at least attempted.</p></disp-quote><p>To improve the resolution of the maps, additional micrographs were taken and merged with the previous data presented. This increased the overall resolution to ~5 Å (from the ~6 Å previously achieved), with a small number of side chains now visible in the centre of the F<sub>1</sub> motor. Although this resolution is still far below that of other structures published, the new maps do not change the conclusions drawn in the manuscript which are robust and do not require fine detail. The Discussion has been updated to include possible reasons for the moderate resolution observed (accelerator voltage, ice thickness, detergent, etc, together with multiple rotational states as discussed in point 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Another point that merits more discussion is the partial presence of bound ATP at the epsilon subunit. What is the role of this nucleotide in ATP synthase inhibition? Is it part of a product inhibition mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the literature is not completely clear about this question, the balance of evidence indicates that nucleotide binding to the ε subunit is unlikely to make a major contribution to the physiological regulation of the ATP synthase in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Many biochemical studies of isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub> have shown that ε inhibition is non-competitive <italic>vs</italic> ATP (Sielaff, Duncan and Borsch, 2018) and high ATP concentrations do not activate the ATPase of membranes containing wild-type protein compared to membranes lacking the entire εCTD (Nakanishi-Matsui et al., 2014). Also, no preference has been seen between ATP and ADP in the isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> epsilon subunit (Sielaff, Duncan and Borsch, 2018) and mutagenesis of this region in related organisms does not appear to interfere with the mechanism (Ferguson et al., 2016). We have discussed this point in greater detail in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) To convince the sceptical reader that the structure is indeed in the catalytically active state and not in the ADP Mg<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited state, some additional information would help. Please state the source of the chemicals used, especially ATP and the ATPase concentration in mg/ml (as is usual in the cryo-EM field), rather than as a molar concentration.

Please add a classification flow chart that clearly indicates the particle numbers at each stage of classification and refinement.</p></disp-quote><p>The source and product code of the ATP used has been added to the Materials and methods. Concentrations have been quoted in “mg/ml” as well as molar concentrations. The ADP concentration in 10 mM ATP was calculated to be 0.05 mM (n=3, stdev=0.002) as determined by HPLC and is now quoted in the text, in hindsight this should have been included. A flowchart has been added to the manuscript describing the particle numbers at each stage of classification and refinement (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). We have not commented on the proportion of particles in each state, because we felt that this would be over interpreting the data (i.e. how do we know that we have sorted all the particles correctly? Could we be preferentially imaging/picking a particular state?)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Three different rotational states were resolved, but why no substates? Please discuss with respect to single molecule studies. Are the unresolved substates the main limitation on resolution?</p></disp-quote><p>There are likely other rotational sub-states present in our data, and this may impact our resolution. We had tried similar methods employed by others to classify additional sub-states (e.g. classification after 3D refinement) and we attempted this again with the larger number of images/particles present in the updated data. However, we were unable to classify additional rotational states. This could be due to the very small proportion of the time spent in some of these states while undergoing rotation. For example, even with a large nanorod attached to the c-ring, rotational sub-states were only overserved in a viscous solution containing 30% PEG using single molecule methods (Ishmukhametov et al., 2010). This has been discussed further in the Discussion and compared and contrasted to the new cryo-EM study of <italic>Polytomella sp.</italic> which contains 13 rotational sub-states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) A key issue in the field is where torsional energy is transiently stored during rotary catalysis.

A recent study on <italic>Polytomella sp.</italic> mt. ATP synthase has shown a single hinge in the peripheral stalk to be essential for coupled rotation of ATP synthase. To investigate whether this same hinge is present in <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase under working conditions, we subtracted the peripheral stalk and supposed the three rotational states on either the membrane domain or the N-terminal domain of subunit delta (to highlight the same possible hinge region seen in <italic>Polytomella sp.</italic>) (Figure 3—figure supplement 2:). Interestingly, the flexibility of the peripheral stalk appears to come from the entire stalk, rather than just a hinge in delta (OSCP in <italic>Polytomella sp.</italic> mt. ATP synthase). This is now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for submitting your revised research advance &quot;Cryo-EM reveals distinct conformations of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase on exposure to ATP&quot; to eLife.

You show this in a new figure, which is a great addition to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2 has now been updated with additional text:</p><p>“Black arrows show the relative movement between the C-terminal domain of subunit δ and stator of F<sub>o</sub>, which is likely mediated by flection and twisting in the peripheral stalk.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In your response to point 8 you write that the peripheral stalk flexes as a whole (as expected, and as it does in our structure of the chloroplast ATP synthase), but you did not observe the delta/OSCP hinge that we recently discovered in Polytomella. This is not surprising, because the hinge movement is required only between rotary substates, which you do not resolve. In the three primary rotary states, which you do resolve, delta/OSCP is necessarily in the same conformation, and there is no hinge movement. This is also the case in the chloroplast ATP synthase, where rotary substates are likewise not observed, because it is autoinhibited.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Discussion to reflect this. It now reads:</p><p>“Recent work on <italic>Polytomella sp</italic>. mitochondrial ATP synthase (Murphy et al., 2019) has described this ATP synthase in great detail, showing a flexible coupling between the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> motors mediated by a hinge region in <italic>OSCP</italic> (analogous to the δ subunit in <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP synthase). […] We do not observe movement in the delta/OSCP hinge, most likely due to our inability to resolve rotary substates in our maps.” With the chloroplast ATP synthase structure now cited here as well.</p></body></sub-article></article>
