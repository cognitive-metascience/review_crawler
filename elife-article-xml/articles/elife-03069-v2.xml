and catalyze fast microtubule growth. We report here the structure of the TOG2 domain from Stu2p bound to yeast αβ-tubulin. Like TOG1, TOG2 binds selectively to a fully ‘curved’ conformation of αβ-tubulin, incompatible with a microtubule lattice. We also show that TOG1-TOG2 binds non-cooperatively to two αβ-tubulins. Preferential interactions between TOGs and fully curved αβ-tubulin that cannot exist elsewhere in the microtubule explain how these polymerases localize to the extreme microtubule end. We propose that these polymerases promote elongation because their linked TOG domains concentrate unpolymerized αβ-tubulin near curved subunits already bound at the microtubule end. This tethering model can explain catalyst-like behavior and also predicts that the polymerase action changes the configuration of the microtubule end.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03069.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03069.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03069.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Dynamic filaments of proteins, called microtubules, have several important roles inside cells. Microtubules provide structural support for the cell; they help to pull chromosomes apart during cell division; and they guide the trafficking of proteins and molecules across the cell.</p><p>The building blocks of microtubules are proteins called αβ-tubulin, which are continually added to and removed from the ends of a microtubule, causing it to grow and shrink. Other proteins that interact with the microtubules can help to speed up these construction and deconstruction processes. Ayaz et al. took a closer look at the structure of one particular family of proteins that make it easier for the microtubules to grow, using a technique called X-ray crystallography. The resulting images show two sites—called TOG1 and TOG2—on the enzymes that attach to the αβ-tubulin proteins. Ayaz et al. found that this binding can only occur when αβ-tubulin has a curved shape, which only happens when the tubulins are not included in, or are only bound weakly to the end of, a microtubule.</p><p>Previous research suggested that the two binding sites might work together to provide ‘scaffolding’ that stabilizes the microtubule. However, genetic experiments by Ayaz et al. show that microtubules will grow even if one of the binding sites is missing. Both TOG1 and TOG2 bind to αβ-tubulin in the same way, and by using computer simulations Ayaz et al. found that this helps to speed up the growth of microtubules. This is because the enzyme's two sites concentrate the individual tubulin building blocks at the ends of the filament. For example, TOG2 could bind to the end of the microtubule, while TOG1 holds an αβ-tubulin protein nearby and ready to bind to the filament's end. This tethering allows the microtubules to be assembled more efficiently.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03069.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03069.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>TOG domain</kwd><kwd>kinetic simulation</kwd><kwd>X-ray structure</kwd><kwd>conformation-selective</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1054947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geyer</surname><given-names>Elisabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Piedra</surname><given-names>Felipe-Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM053163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otwinowski</surname><given-names>Zbyszek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vu</surname><given-names>Emily S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grishin</surname><given-names>Nick V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using linked TOG domains that each bind a curved conformation of αβ-tubulin, a microtubule polymerase catalyzes fast elongation by concentrating αβ-tubulin near the polymer end.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules are dynamic polymers of αβ-tubulin that have critical roles in chromosome segregation and intracellular organization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). The polymerization dynamics of microtubules are regulated by multiple cellular factors. Evolutionarily conserved proteins in the Stu2p/XMAP215 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gard and Kirschner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohkura et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>) regulate microtubule dynamics by promoting fast microtubule elongation. These essential proteins use multiple αβ-tubulin binding tumor overexpressed gene (TOG) domains to selectively recognize the growing microtubule end and promote its elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Bassam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Bassam et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A significant advance in understanding occurred with a landmark study of XMAP215 in which in vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that the polymerase affected the <italic>rate</italic> of microtubule elongation without affecting the apparent <italic>equilibrium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>). This and other observations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shirasu-Hiza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Breugel et al., 2003</xref>) formed the basis for describing XMAP215 as a catalyst for microtubule elongation. Catalytic action in turn led to the concept that TOG-containing polymerases might stabilize an otherwise rate-limiting intermediate along the polymerization pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>). However, an understanding of mechanism has been limited because the nature of this intermediate, and how TOG domains might selectively promote it, remained unclear.</p><p>A recent study from our group revealed that the TOG1 domain from Stu2p binds preferentially to a ‘curved’ conformation of αβ-tubulin that cannot be incorporated into the body of the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>). Our study also showed that a TOG1-TOG2 construct could bind two αβ-tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>). This latter observation suggested that two TOG domains might cooperate to stabilize an αβ-tubulin:αβ-tubulin interface, and consequently that cooperative binding to αβ-tubulin might contribute to polymerase activity. Our study did not determine how the polymerase recognizes the extreme microtubule end, but we speculated based on apparent biochemical differences between the TOG1 and TOG2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Bassam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>) that selective interactions between TOG2 and a different, end-specific conformation of αβ-tubulin might be important.</p><p>In the present study we sought to gain insight into the mechanism of end recognition by determining the conformation of αβ-tubulin recognized by TOG2 and by testing whether cooperative TOG:αβ-tubulin interactions contributed to polymerase activity. We first determined the crystal structure of a TOG2:αβ-tubulin complex. This structure reveals that TOG2 binds to the same curved conformation of αβ-tubulin that TOG1 does. Our biochemical experiments underscore this structural similarity by demonstrating that the two TOG domains have comparable affinities for αβ-tubulin, with K<sub>D</sub> ∼100 nM. Next, we used analytical ultracentrifugation to show that in TOG1-TOG2 the two linked TOG domains bind non-cooperatively to two αβ-tubulins. Non-cooperative binding indicates that TOG1-TOG2 does not stabilize an αβ-tubulin:αβ-tubulin interface. Together with biochemical and genetic experiments, our results lead to a model that explains how the polymerase activity can emerge from the action of two tethered TOG domains that each bind independently to a conformation of αβ-tubulin that is incompatible with the microtubule lattice. We propose that the polymerase activity arises because linked TOG domains selectively increase the effective concentration of αβ-tubulin near weakly bound, curved αβ-tubulins already on the microtubule end. A computational realization of this model supports our proposal by recapitulating catalyst-like behavior. The model further suggests that the polymerase achieves its effect in part by transiently altering the configuration of the growing end.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TOG2, like TOG1, binds curved αβ-tubulin</title><p>We previously showed that the TOG1 domain from Stu2p binds preferentially to a curved conformation of αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>).

Conserved residues like W341 and R519 on the tubulin-binding surface of TOG2 make very similar contacts with αβ-tubulin as their equivalents in TOG1 (W23 and R200, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The structure of TOG2 bound to αβ-tubulin superimposes with the structure of ‘free’ TOG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Slep and Vale, 2007</xref>) with 0.7 Å rmsd over 237 Cα atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the TOG2 domains pack differently in the ‘bound’ and ‘free’ crystals, the similarity in structure suggests that these TOG domains are rigid modules that do not change conformation when they bind αβ-tubulin. Even though the structure reported here was obtained from a new crystal form, the conformation of αβ-tubulin in complex with TOG2 is nearly identical to that seen for TOG1-bound αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (12.3° of curvature in the TOG2 complex vs 13.1° in the TOG1 complex), and is characteristically distinct from the straight conformation of αβ-tubulin (1° of curvature by our measure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Löwe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Underscoring this similarity, individual tubulin chains between the TOG1 and TOG2 complexes superimpose on each other with 0.4 Å rmsd over Cα atoms. Thus, both TOG1 and TOG2 bind preferentially to the same, curved conformation of αβ-tubulin.

Because TOG:αβ-tubulin interactions are required for plus-end localization of Stu2p/XMAP215 polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Bassam et al., 2006</xref>), preferential binding of TOGs to curved αβ-tubulin suggests that curved αβ-tubulin itself is the distinctive end-specific feature the polymerase recognizes. In contrast, other plus-end tracking proteins like Eb1 recognize lattice-specific features and consequently show ‘comet-like’ localization that extends into the microtubule body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>).

Next, using a mixture in which αβ-tubulin was superstoichiometric with respect to TOG1-TOG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we observed a larger species sedimenting at 9.1 S. This value places a lower limit on the sedimentation coefficient for the TOG1-TOG2:(αβ-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, inset) that is consistent with hydrodynamic calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García De La Torre et al., 2000</xref>) using extended models in which the two αβ-tubulins do not contact each other and the TOG domains are separated by varying distances. Hydrodynamic calculations predict that compact models containing longitudinally or laterally of αβ-tubulins should sediment around 10.5–10.9 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>)<sub>.</sub> Knowledge about the sedimentation behavior of the one and two tubulin complexes allowed us to analyze a titration of TOG1-TOG2 into αβ-tubulin under different assumptions about cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The resulting signal weighted average sedimentation coefficients are not consistent with models that assume even modest 10-fold positive or negative cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Instead, the data are much better described by a model in which each TOG domain in TOG1-TOG2 interacts independently with its αβ-tubulin (the best fit was obtained from a model invoking less than twofold negative cooperativity, not shown). Noncooperative binding contradicts our initial expectation and indicates that αβ-tubulin:αβ-tubulin contacts do not provide additional stability to the TOG1-TOG2:(αβ-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex.</p><p>The lack of positive cooperativity stabilizing the TOG1-TOG2:(αβ-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex is striking because in this complex the two bound αβ-tubulins are physically constrained to occupy a relatively small volume and therefore are effectively at quite high concentration relative to each other. Indeed, allowing 55 Å for the length of each TOG domain and assuming that the ∼75 amino acid linker is flexible and can maximally span 220 Å we estimate that the two TOG1-TOG2-bound αβ-tubulins are minimally at an effective concentration of roughly 200 μM, likely higher because the linker will rarely be fully extended. This effective concentration of TOG1-TOG2-bound αβ-tubulin is in the range of current estimates for the longitudinal K<sub>D</sub> for αβ-tubulins (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>). Observing non-cooperative binding therefore suggests that some property of the TOG1-TOG2 linker antagonizes or counterbalances longitudinal interactions between αβ-tubulins (see below for experiments concerning the linker sequence). Our data do not rule out that linked TOG domains might stabilize lateral interactions between αβ-tubulins because these lateral interactions are thought to be much weaker (only molar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>]): even at effective αβ-tubulin concentrations approaching 1 mM a weak interface like this would not be populated and therefore would contribute little additional stability to the TOG1-TOG2:(αβ-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex. Whatever the underlying mechanism, the unexpected observation that the two linked TOG domains behave as independent αβ-tubulin binding modules places significant constraints on biochemical models for the mechanism of these polymerases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Two TOG domains are required for Stu2p function, but they do not have to be different</title><p>Stu2/XMAP215 family polymerases contain at least two different TOG domains.

To address the question ‘can tethering give catalyst-like activity’, we made a number of simplifying assumptions to create an implicit representation of polymerase action that isolates the ‘tethered delivery’ steps while ignoring other aspects of polymerase function and biochemistry. We assumed that every curved, longitudinally-bound ‘singleton’ αβ-tubulin at the MT end is engaged by one TOG domain of a polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, left panel). This assumption provides end-localized polymerase in the model without having to parameterize/describe its diffusive movement on the microtubule lattice (this movement is mediated by the basic domain, which is required for polymerase function), or if it arrives at the microtubule end with its TOGs pre-loaded with αβ-tubulin (XMAP215 has been observed to carry αβ-tubulin while diffusing on the lattice). To mimic the tethering-induced local increase in αβ-tubulin concentration, in the model we accelerated the rate of αβ-tubulin association to the site neighboring the polymerase-bound singleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, arrow). We do not assume that the linker is directing the tethered subunit to a particular site–separate simulations showed that accelerating the rate of αβ-tubulin association on top of the polymerase-bound singleton had no effect on growth rates (data not shown). We also assumed that when the polymerase bound singleton acquired a lateral neighbor it became straight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buey et al., 2006</xref>), and that this straightening was linked to TOG disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To explore if enhanced trapping of singleton αβ-tubulins could recapitulate catalyst-like activity, we simulated microtubule elongation rates using a range of accelerated tethered association rates. In reality, the tethered association rate is likely to be more or less constant, with maximal polymerase activity instead determined by the degree to which it saturates its binding sites on the plus end. Varying the tethered association rate provides a way to mimic this ‘saturation’ effect without having to model it explicitly. Strikingly, the simulated microtubule elongation rates increase with the tethered αβ-tubulin association rate while the apparent equilibrium constant for elongation (x-intercept) remains approximately constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, middle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Affecting the rate but not the apparent equilibrium indicates that tethering-enhanced associative trapping of weakly-bound singletons can recapitulate the essence of catalyst-like activity. The increase in simulated growth rate (less than 10-fold) is significantly less than the maximal increase in tethered αβ-tubulin association rate we explored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in addition to capturing catalyst-like action, our simple model also shows the modest overall stimulation that is characteristic of these polymerases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Relationship between microtubule end structure and polymerase activity</title><p>Why did the model only stimulate elongation modestly, as the polymerases do? We speculated that because longitudinally associated αβ-tubulin is weakly/transiently bound at the microtubule end (∼mM affinity in our fitted parameters and those of comparable models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">VanBuren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>); this compares to working concentrations of αβ-tubulin that are typically at most 20 μM), the low population and lifetime of this ‘substrate’ was limiting the activity obtainable in our model.</p><p>We probed the linkage between ‘substrate scarcity’ and polymerase activity in two ways. We first created an alternative model in which the polymerase accelerated delivery of αβ-tubulin adjacent to higher affinity and much longer-lived ‘corner’ (longitudinal + lateral interactions) sites, at least one of which is always present at the microtubule end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, left). In this alternative model the simulated elongation rates increase linearly with the increased effective concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, right), yielding much stronger stimulation that also lacks catalyst-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, middle). This result is consistent with the idea that catalyst-like activity is related to the low affinity/lifetime of the end-bound singleton substrate. To explore this implication more directly we obtained parameter sets with higher affinity longitudinal interactions by using different assumed values of k<sub>on</sub>. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">VanBuren et al., 2002</xref>), these alternative parameterizations can approximate the experimental rates of (uncatalyzed) microtubule elongation by compensating for faster/slower k<sub>on</sub> with weaker/stronger longitudinal affinity (but retaining the same ‘corner’ [longitudinal + lateral] affinity). We observed in simulations that stronger longitudinal affinity gave higher maximal polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results support the notion that the polymerase activity in our model is related to the population/lifetime of longitudinally-associated αβ-tubulin singleton at the microtubule end.</p><p>The tethering model suggests a plausible transition state/collision complex that limits the rate of microtubule polymerization in the absence of a polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The idea is that at the MT end, longitudinally-bound αβ-tubulins tend to dissociate much faster than the rate at which unpolymerized αβ-tubulins associate at neighboring sites. Accordingly, most of the ‘singleton’-type associations are unproductive for elongation, and the MT grows primarily by additions into ‘corner’ sites. In the model we propose, Stu2p/XMAP215 polymerases enhance elongation by selectively concentrating αβ-tubulin near singleton sites, thereby specifically promoting their associative trapping. We propose that the ‘trapping complex’—two side-by-side αβ-tubulins without additional neighbors to either side–may be the transition state. In our model the polymerase catalyzes formation of this ‘side-by-side’ state by selectively concentrating (tethering) the reactants that lead to it. Associative trapping of singletons also ‘roughens’ the microtubule end through the creation of additional, longer-lived ‘corner’ sites. By virtue of having more favorable sites of interaction, these rougher microtubule ends can transiently capture unpolymerized subunits more efficiently and independently of the polymerase, through ‘filling in’ (a contribution from filling-in was anticipated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>]).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03069.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic cartoons illustrating the origin of catalytic action.</title><p>The microtubule end has multiple sites where αβ-tubulin can associate, but elongation is largely dominated by additions into the few, high-affinity ‘corner’ sites (left panel) because pure longitudinal associations are weak. By preferentially recognizing curved αβ-tubulin with one of its TOG domains, the polymerase (TOG domains in blue, basic region in red) can selectively localize to these ‘unproductive’ binding sites (second from left). The tethering action greatly enhances the rate at which these weakly bound subunits are trapped by neighboring association of another αβ-tubulin (middle two panels).

Perhaps basic-domain mediated rapid diffusion on the microtubule lattice, as has been measured for XMAP215 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>), is sufficient for the liberated polymerase to engage a newly added αβ-tubulin.</p><p>In summary, we propose that Stu2p/XMAP215 polymerases localize to the plus end by virtue of preferential interactions between TOG domains and curved αβ-tubulin. Our proposal is consistent with the view that curved, GTP-bound αβ-tubulin is an on-pathway polymerization intermediate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>). It also explains the need for at least two TOG domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>) because one TOG is required to bind curved αβ-tubulin on the microtubule and another linked TOG is required for tethering an unpolymerized αβ-tubulin. In this model, side-by-side trapping and the release of TOG domains will be linked because of the polymerization-associated conformational changes that occur in αβ-tubulin. The model provides a simple molecular explanation for the catalytic-like action of the polymerase, recapitulates the modest maximal stimulation, and rationalizes how a polymerase can be built from domains that bind preferentially to a microtubule-incompatible conformation of αβ-tubulin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmids and their construction</title><p>Plasmids to express TOG2 and wild-type or polymerization-blocked yeast αβ-tubulin have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>) and were used without further modification. Some plasmids (to express ‘full-length’ Stu2p and its R200 and R519 mutants) for the rescue assay were also previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>). ‘Dimerization-impaired’ plasmids were constructed using mutagenesis primers to delete the region that codes for the coiled-coil dimerization element (corresponding to amino acids 658–761). These primers contained two regions that were complementary to the coding sequences just upstream and downstream of the deleted region. ‘Linker truncation’ plasmids were constructed using a similar strategy to remove increasingly large sections from the middle of the sequence linking TOG1 to TOG2 (deleted regions are: Δ14:273-286; Δ22:277-298; Δ32:273-304; Δ40:257-296; Δ50:251-300; Δ60:251-310). The ‘linker shuffled’ and ‘TOG swapped’ plasmids were made using GeneArt seamless cloning (Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA). Shuffled linkers were inserted starting from synthetic, codon-optimized cDNA (IDT, Coralville, IA), so we also prepared a codon optimized natural linker sequence to control for possible effects on expression levels. DNA coding for shuffled versions of the 65 central amino acids (residues 252–316) of the TOG1-TOG2 linker was obtained from IDT and amplified using primers to append flanking nucleotides of wild-type upstream and downstream flanking sequence. The parent plasmid, excluding the region coding for the to-be-replaced linker sequence, was amplified in a separate reaction. The two products were mixed, incubated, and transformed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A similar strategy was used to replace TOG1 (residues 11–245) with a second copy of TOG2 (residues 318–560).

In the program, the microtubule lattice is represented by a two dimensional lattice with a staggered periodic boundary condition to mimic the cylindrical microtubule structure.

The program simulates microtubule elongation one biochemical reaction (in this case subunit addition or dissociation, GTP hydrolysis is ignored) at a time. A lattice site is considered available for subunit addition if it is empty and a neighboring site is occupied. The rate of subunit addition into any available site is given by k<sub>on</sub>*[αβ-tubulin]. Occupied sites (excepting the seed) are considered available for dissociation, with the rate of dissociation given by k<sub>on</sub>*K<sub>D</sub> where K<sub>D</sub> is the affinity of interaction, which is determined by the neighbor state (number and type of lattice contacts) and obtained from longitudinal and corner affinities through thermodynamic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erickson and Pantaloni, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">VanBuren et al., 2002</xref>).

This acceleration mimics a ‘tethering’ effect. Control experiments showed that accelerating the rate for adding on top of a longitudinally-associated singleton had negligible effect (not shown). To keep the model as simple as possible, we did not account for any potential stabilization of TOG-bound singletons at the microtubule end.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D Borek for assistance with diffraction data processing, D Tomchick and Z Chen in the UT Southwestern Structural Biology Core facility for help and advice.

Further experiments show that tubulin binding to two linked domains is not cooperative. A series of experiments with “designed” Stu2 fragments then shows that any two TOGs on one molecule (either monomer or dimer) will give nearly normal catalytic activity. The authors find a minimum linker length for full activity of about 40 residues (consistent with the ca.300 TOG-TOG sequences in the database); the linker sequence is irrelevant. The manuscript then goes on to suggest a specific model for polymerization and to report results of simulations that embody the model. The notion is that one of the two required TOGs binds an αβ-tubulin that has associated longitudinally with the end of a MT, rather than at a “corner”, where the helical array creates lateral as well as longitudinal contacts. The former contact is, of course, weaker than the latter, but the model postulates that the high local concentration of αβ-tubulin created by the relatively weakly bound heterodimer on the second TOG domain (or presumably on any of the additional ones in a dimer or in a many-TOG monomer) promotes addition adjacent to the first heterodimer. Lateral contacts then enforce a straight conformation for both, releasing the catalyst and stabilizing the added pair as part of the growing end.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the experimental data are sound and that they impose interesting constraints on the mechanism of polymerization. We invite a revision that attends to the following questions and reservations.</p><p>1) The authors used HYDROPRO for the prediction of the sedimentation coefficients of the extended and laterally and longitudinally associated tubulin subunits with Stu2. As this information was used to interpret the AUC binding experiments of TOG1-TOG2 with tubulin using different assumption about cooperativity, the authors should provide more details about the exact way these calculations were performed. In this context, it is a bit surprising that the sedimentation coefficients for the two putative laterally and longitudinally arranged tubulin subunits in complexes with Stu2 are similar. Do the authors have an explanation for this similarity?</p><p>2) Modeling. The reviewers found the explanation of the rationale for the model – and even its specific details – hard to follow, although there was agreement that the model is interesting and plausible enough to be included. Because the data will stand, even if future work alters the model, the authors might want consider moving the entire model description and outcome into the Discussion, or in some other way underscore the distinction. A revision of the manuscript should in any case respond to the following points:</p><p>a) The authors considered only one possible mode of action, in which one TOG domain of Stu2 binds to a tubulin subunit at the distal end of a microtubule while the other TOG domain binds to soluble tubulin. Moreover, they did not consider the role of the basic microtubule binding domain, which is well known to be crucial for the XMAP215 polymerase activity. They should explain why they simplified their system to such a degree and why they did not consider additional possibilities.</p><p>b) The model assumes that when a singleton tubulin adds, Stu2p instantaneously binds to it. Brouhard et al. measured D=0.3 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for XMAP215, which means it would take 13 µsec to diffuse 8 nm. That seems pretty fast. But singletons also dissociate very rapidly. For k<sub>on</sub>=4 x 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and 8 mM K<sub>D</sub> of longitudinal affinity used by Ayez, k<sub>off</sub> = 3.2 x 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, meaning that singletons have a 30 µsec residence time if not stabilized. So it is likely that some singletons will not have a bound Stu2p, and association is not actually instantaneous. This effect will not fundamentally change the model performance – it is one of degree, and it will be diminished with stronger longitudinal associations simulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – but the authors should comment.</p><p>c) The model assumes that the second TOG domain will come with an attached tubulin. If the model were that one TOG domain binds the singleton tubulin and then the second binds a free tubulin, that would be a problem – even with a 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> on-rate and 1 µM tubulin concentration, the wait would be 100 µsec (longer than the association time of the singleton). Earlier in the paper, the authors find the Kd for tubulin binding to the TOG domains to be 100nM. That means that at 1µM free tubulin, 90% of TOG domains will have tubulin bound. So the assumption that the second TOG comes with a bound tubulin seems valid. One corollary, however, is that with µM free tubulin concentrations in solution, the TOG domains should all have a bound tubulin when the Stu2p is diffusing on the microtubule, held there by its basic domain, and the singleton will also be delivered by the Stu2p in most cases. It would have to be, because less than 10% of the Stu2p diffusing on the microtubule will have a free site that can bind the singleton. This point doesn't really change the model behavior, but it does give a picture of tubulin-bound TOGs diffusing on the microtubule that isn't conveyed in the paper. (See also comment a above).</p><p>d) The corner model, which is not consistent with the data, is a nice control. It was, however, difficult to clarify the differences between the two models – in both of them there is a “corner effect”, but one is with a curved singleton and the second is with a straight and stabilized subunit. The authors could do some work to clarify this difference.</p><p>e) The y-axis of the growth rate plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are in units µm/µM-min. Unless the reviewers are missing something, the units should be µm/min. When measuring the slope, the concentration comes in, but that's a different calculation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03069.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors used HYDROPRO for the prediction of the sedimentation coefficients of the extended and laterally and longitudinally associated tubulin subunits with Stu2.

The argument for this is as follows: if there is (say) 10X positive cooperativity, then under the conditions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> nearly all of the TOG1-TOG2 would be bound to two αβ-tubulins, and accordingly the species sedimenting at 9.1 S would be this ‘two tubulin’ complex. If there is less cooperativity, then there would be less two tubulin complex, and the observed species at 9.1 S would represent a ‘reaction boundary’ that contains contributions from tubulin, TOG1-TOG2, the one tubulin complex (which sediments at 7.1 S, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the two tubulin complex (which now has to sediment at greater than 9.1 S, otherwise the average would be lower than what we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The lower boundary for each ‘swath’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> corresponds to assuming the two tubulin complex sediments at its lower bound of 9.1 S. Only the non-cooperative swath has a lower boundary that is close to the measured values.</p><p>We provided the HYDROPRO values to provide some context for how 9.1 S might compare to different possible compact and extended configurations of the two tubulin complex, to obtain an upper bound for the sedimentation coefficient for compact complexes, and to get a sense of the robustness of our conclusion. In our initial submission we had used PyMOL to prepare coordinate files with different separations between TOG1:αβ-tubulin and TOG2:αβ-tubulin complexes, without explicitly including the linker (for which we did not have coordinates, obviously).</p><p>In the revised submission we re-visited these calculations after using MODELLER to generate linker coordinates (5 different sets of linker coordinates were generated for each model to provide a sense of how sensitive the predictions were to the modeling). The predicted sedimentation coefficients of these more complete models are somewhat lower than what we reported in our initial report (e.g. 10.5 S for longitudinal model with linker compared to 11.1 S for longitudinal model without linker), but the overall conclusion remains unchanged: the observed sedimentation coefficient of 9.1 S supports a more extended model and the titration data do not show evidence of significant positive or negative cooperativity for forming the TOG1-TOG2:(αβ-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex.</p><p>We have updated the main text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and its legend and the Methods section to clarify how we did these calculations and how they contribute to the conclusion we drew.</p><p>The similarity of the calculated sedimentation coefficients for longitudinal vs lateral compact complexes took some of us by surprise also. This can be understood as follows. Assuming the same partial specific volume and solvent density, the sedimentation coefficient is proportional to M/f, where M is the molar mass and f is the frictional coefficient. To obtain significantly different sedimentation coefficients for the same mass requires large changes in f. For a back of the envelope calculation, the longitudinal and lateral complexes can be approximated as prolate ellipsoids with axial ratios of 2.1 and 1.43, respectively. These axial ratios lead to frictional ratios (assuming 0.3 g/g hydration) of 1.17 and 1.14. Thus, HYDROPRO calculated relatively similar values from the two configurations we considered because they have relatively similar frictional ratios and the same molar mass.</p><p><italic>2) Modeling. The reviewers found the explanation of the rationale for the model – and even its specific details – hard to follow, although there was agreement that the model is interesting and plausible enough to be included. Because the data will stand, even if future work alters the model, the authors might want consider moving the entire model description and outcome into the discussion, or in some other way underscore the distinction</italic>. <italic>A revision of the manuscript should in any case respond to the following points:</italic></p><p>We are grateful for the chance to clarify the modeling, and we have modified the text to better explain our decision-making and to also address the specific points raised below.</p><p><italic>a) The authors considered only one possible mode of action, in which one TOG domain of Stu2 binds to a tubulin subunit at the distal end of a microtubule while the other TOG domain binds to soluble tubulin. Moreover, they did not consider the role of the basic microtubule binding domain, which is well known to be crucial for the XMAP215 polymerase activity. They should explain why they simplified their system to such a degree and why they did not consider additional possibilities</italic>.</p><p>We did not mean to give the impression that we were neglecting/ignoring the basic domain. In our understanding without a basic domain (or some other equivalent mechanism for microtubule association) the TOGs would not function as polymerases and would instead be αβ-tubulin sequestering factors. However, to explicitly model the diffusive process, and how being on the microtubule might modulate the affinity and/or kinetics of TOG:tubulin interactions, seemed too complicated at this time (especially given the relatively limited data available to restrain the additional parameters that would be required). We have now added a few sentences to better clarify our view of the basic domain and why it does not figure explicitly into our model.</p><p>Why did we simplify the system so much? It seemed clear to us that tethering-induced increases in the apparent concentration of unpolymerized tubulin could enhance growth rates. But it was not obvious that tethering near singletons would produce a catalytic effect. Thus, we implemented the simplest possible representation of the tethering effect to focus on this one narrow question. We cannot exclude other mechanisms (e.g. a diffusing polymerase carrying one or more tubulins might shuttle them to the end, see below for more on this), but the processive action demonstrated for XMAP215 by Brouhard et al. suggests that shuttling does not play a dominant role. In essence, we used the modeling as a device to synthesize our structural and biochemical observations into a kinetic framework capable of addressing the question of catalytic action in a way that structures and binding constants alone cannot. We have tried to make the rationale and limitations clearer through text modifications.</p><p>An obvious next step for us will be to perform in vitro reconstitutions using re-engineered variants. In this way we hope to obtain data that will support more parameter-intensive modeling of more aspects of the polymerase function.</p><p><italic>b) The model assumes that when a singleton tubulin adds, Stu2p instantaneously binds to it. Brouhard et al. measured D=0.3 µm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>/s for XMAP215, which means it would take 13 µsec to diffuse 8 nm. That seems pretty fast. But singletons also dissociate very rapidly. For k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub><italic>=4 x 10</italic><sup><italic>6</italic></sup> <italic>M</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup><italic>s</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup> <italic>and 8 mM K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> <italic>of longitudinal affinity used by Ayez, k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> <italic>= 3.2 x 10</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> <italic>s</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup><italic>, meaning that singletons have a 30 µsec residence time if not stabilized. So it is likely that some singletons will not have a bound Stu2p, and association is not actually instantaneous. This effect will not fundamentally change the model performance – it is one of degree, and it will be diminished with stronger longitudinal associations simulated in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, but the authors should comment</italic>.</p><p>This is a good comment that identifies a compromise inherent to our minimalist approach. We had included language attempting to make this compromise clear, and we have now added additional emphasis to the fact that in reality the maximal polymerase activity will likely be determined by its degree of saturation at the microtubule end. Varying the ‘tethered association rate’ is an artificial device that we use to avoid having to explicitly model the question of polymerase saturation at the microtubule end.</p><p><italic>c) The model assumes that the second TOG domain will come with an attached tubulin. If the model were that one TOG domain binds the singleton tubulin and then the second binds a free tubulin, that would be a problem – even with a 10</italic><sup><italic>7</italic></sup> <italic>M</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup><italic>s</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup> <italic>on-rate and 1 µM tubulin concentration, the wait would be 100 µsec (longer than the association time of the singleton). Earlier in the paper, the authors find the Kd for tubulin binding to the TOG domains to be 100nM. That means that at 1µM free tubulin, 90% of TOG domains will have tubulin bound. So the assumption that the second TOG comes with a bound tubulin seems valid. One corollary, however, is that with µM free tubulin concentrations in solution, the TOG domains should all have a bound tubulin when the Stu2p is diffusing on the microtubule, held there by its basic domain, and the singleton will also be delivered by the Stu2p in most cases. It would have to be, because less than 10% of the Stu2p diffusing on the microtubule will have a free site that can bind the singleton. This point doesn't really change the model behavior, but it does give a picture of tubulin-bound TOGs diffusing on the microtubule that isn't conveyed in the paper. (See also comment a above)</italic>.</p><p>We hope that our responses to the previous two comments also substantially address this one by better conveying the picture of tubulin-bound TOGs diffusing on the microtubule. It is certainly possible that a polymerase diffuses to the microtubule end carrying one or more tubulins. The Brouhard et al. paper indicates that for XMAP215, at least, this shuttling function cannot explain the observed increase in growth rate. Thus, some form of ‘end-resident’ polymerase must make substantial contributions to activity, and this is what our model is attempting to capture.</p><p><italic>d) The corner model, which is not consistent with the data, is a nice control. It was, however, difficult to clarify the differences between the two models – in both of them there is a “corner effect”, but one is with a curved singleton and the second is with a straight and stabilized subunit. The authors could do some work to clarify this difference</italic>.</p><p>This was a good way of explaining a potential source of confusion. It is correct that in each case the incoming tubulin adds into ‘corner’ sites that differ because curved singletons are much less tightly bound to the microtubule end than straight subunits that already participate in their own corner interactions. The lifetime of the stably bound tubulins (‘straight corner’) is long compared to the tethered delivery time, so every delivery to these sites will be ‘productive’ and accordingly a substantial enhancement in growth rate is predicted. In contrast, the relatively short lifetime of singletons means that they tend to dissociate faster than the tethered delivery time. We have altered the text in a few places to make this distinction clearer.</p><p><italic>e) The y-axis of the growth rate plots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are in units µm/µM-min.
