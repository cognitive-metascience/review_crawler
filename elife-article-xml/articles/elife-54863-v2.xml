The PP2A complex STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> blocks MST1/2 activation. The GCKIII family kinases associate with STRIPAK, but the functions of these phosphatase-associated kinases remain elusive. We previously showed that the scaffolding protein SAV1 promotes Hippo signaling by counteracting STRIPAK (Bae et al., 2017). Here, we show that the GCKIII kinase STK25 promotes STRIPAK-mediated inhibition of MST2 in human cells. Depletion of STK25 enhances MST2 activation without affecting the integrity of STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>. STK25 directly phosphorylates SAV1 and diminishes the ability of SAV1 to inhibit STRIPAK. Thus, STK25 as the kinase component of STRIPAK can inhibit the function of the STRIPAK inhibitor SAV1. This mutual antagonism between STRIPAK and SAV1 controls the initiation of Hippo signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human 293FT cell</kwd><kwd>human 293A cell</kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM107415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xuelian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM132275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xuelian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xuelian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SAV1-STRIPAK antagonism by STK25.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hippo pathway is critical for organ size control, tissue homeostasis, development, and tumor suppression by restricting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Misra and Irvine, 2018</xref>).

In humans, the core kinase cascade of the Hippo pathway consists of Sterile-20 family kinases MST1/2, NDR family kinases LATS1/2, the scaffolding protein SAV1, and the adaptor protein MOB1. When the Hippo pathway is on, the MST1/2–SAV1 complexes phosphorylate and activate the LATS1/2–MOB1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Praskova et al., 2008</xref>). Activated LATS1/2–MOB1 then phosphorylate transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ. Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ results in their cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). When the Hippo pathway is off, YAP/TAZ localize to the nucleus and form functional hybrid transcription factors with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins TEAD1-4. The YAP/TAZ–TEAD transcription factors induce the expression of Hippo-target genes to enable cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Activation of MST1/2 kinases initiates Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2010</xref>). MST1/2 contain an N-terminal kinase domain, a C-terminal SARAH dimerization domain, and a flexible linker between the two. MST1 and MST2 can each form a constitutive homodimer through the SARAH domain, and their activation requires trans-autophosphorylation of the activation loop (T183 for MST1 and T180 for MST2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avruch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). Activated MST1/2 autophosphorylate multiple threonine residues in the linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ni et al., 2015</xref>). The forkhead-associated domain (FHA) of the sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP), an adaptor protein of the multi-subunit PP2A complex STRIPAK (striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase), recognizes the phospho-threonine residues in the MST1/2 linker region. Binding of SLMAP to the phospho-MST2 linker recruits STRIPAK and promotes PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of pT180, thus ensuring low steady-state MST2 activation in fast dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, STRIPAK inhibits MST1/2 activation in a feedback mechanism. The MST1/2-associated protein SAV1 promotes MST2 activation by suppressing STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>-mediated dephosphorylation of MST2 T-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2017</xref>). The N-terminal region of SAV1 contains a phosphatase-inhibitory domain (PID) that directly associates with PP2A and inhibits its phosphatase activity in vitro. Thus, SAV1 activates MST1/2 by inhibiting the inhibitor STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>. These findings suggest dynamic antagonism between SAV1 and STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>.</p><p>As a major serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A consists of the scaffold subunit A, the catalytic subunit C, and the regulatory subunit B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi, 2009</xref>). STRIPAK is an unusually large PP2A assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang and Pallas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the A/C catalytic core and the PP2A regulatory B′′′ subunit striatin (STRN3 in humans), STRIPAK also contains STRIP1, MOB4, SIKE1, CCM3, and one GCKIII kinase (MST3, MST4, or STK25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couzens et al., 2013</xref>). These STRIPAK components form a complicated protein-protein interaction network, with STRN3 serving as a major scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). STRN3 comprises an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, a middle region, and a C-terminal WD40-repeat domain. STRN3 CC directly binds to PP2AA/C. The WD40-repeat domain interacts with MOB4. The middle region directly associates with CCM3, which in turn recruits GCKIII kinases to STRN3. STRN3 also directly interacts with STRIP1 and SIKE1. Recent studies have established STRIPAK as a platform to integrate upstream inputs to regulate the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The GCKIII kinase family is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, transformation, migration, polarity, apoptosis, Golgi assembly, and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugden et al., 2013</xref>). It has three members: STK25 (Serine/Threonine kinase 25; also called SOK1 or YSK1), MST3 (mSte20-like kinase3, also known as STK24), and MST4 (also known as STK26 or MASK). GCKIII kinases contain a conserved N-terminal kinase domain, a C-terminal dimerization domain, and a linker between the two. Depletion of <italic>Drosophila</italic> GCKIII or Cka (a homolog of human STRNs) has similar effects on suppressing ectopic wing veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that GCKIII kinases may promote STRIPAK function and suppress the Hippo pathway. On the other hand, it has been recently reported that STK25 promotes Hippo pathway activation through directly activating LATS1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the roles of GCKIII kinases in the Hippo pathway remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we clarify the functions of GCKIII kinases during Hippo signaling. We show that among the three GCKIII kinases, only STK25 regulates MST1/2. Similar to other STRIPAK components, STK25 suppresses Hippo pathway activation. One mechanism by which it does so is to phosphorylate SAV1 and antagonize the ability of SAV1 to inhibit PP2A. Thus, our study further extends the intricate, dynamic antagonism between STRIPAK and SAV1, and demonstrates the importance of the delicate balance between kinases and phosphatases in Hippo activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>STK25 inhibits the Hippo pathway in human cells</title><p>We individually depleted each GCKIII kinase from 293FT cells by RNA interference (RNAi) and monitored MST2 activation by examining the levels of MST2 T180 phosphorylation (pT180).

Conversely, overexpression of STK25, but not overexpression of MST3 or MST4, decreased MST2 pT180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Consistent with an activated Hippo pathway, STK25 KO cells displayed much slower cell proliferation compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, STK25_MST1/2 TKO cells displayed only slightly reduced cell proliferation rate, as compared to control cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of MOB1 at T35 and phosphorylation of YAP were diminished in STK25_MST1/2 TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Thus, deletion of MST1/2 bypasses the function of STK25 in Hippo signaling, indicating that the major function of STK25 in the Hippo pathway is to suppress MST1/2 activation.</p><p>Recently, the Ganem group has reported that STK25 promotes the activation of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2019</xref>), and activates LATS1/2 by increasing the phosphorylation of the LATS1/2 activation loop (AL) without altering hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation. These results are inconsistent with ours. To examine whether STK25 can promote LATS1 activation without phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif, we co-expressed LATS1 wild-type (WT) or a kinase-dead mutant (D828N) with STK25 or MST2, respectively. As expected, co-expression of MST2 increased both HM and AL phosphorylations of LATS1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). MST2 also increased HM phosphorylation of LATS1 D828N, but failed to increase AL phosphorylation of this mutant, consistent with the notion that AL phosphorylation of LATS1 is mediated by autophosphorylation. In contrast, co-expression of STK25 did not increase the phosphorylation of either HM or AL of LATS1 WT or D828N. Furthermore, expression of STK25 actually inhibited MST2-mediated activation of LATS1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified recombinant proteins. Addition of the phosphorylated HM peptide activated the AL phosphorylation of the LATS1 kinase domain that lacked the HM (LATS1C-ΔHM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Neither STK25 nor MST2 was able to directly phosphorylate the AL of LATS1.</p><p>The Ganem group has further shown that STK25 depletion inhibits Hippo pathway activation that is induced by cytoskeleton disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2019</xref>). To test whether STK25 indeed has a role in this process, we used two different compounds, latrunculin B (LatB) and cytochalasin D (CTD), to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton in control or STK25 KO 293A cells. Both LatB and CTD activated the Hippo pathway in control and STK25 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). However, there were no significant differences in Hippo pathway activation between control and STK25 KO cells under these conditions. Collectively, our results do not support direct or indirect roles of STK25 in activating LATS1/2 and downstream events.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>, control and STK25 KO cells had similar cell size. Taken together, depletion of STK25 did not affect the overall organization of F-actin cytoskeleton in 293 cells.

We performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant PID (SAV1<sup>1-90</sup>) as the substrate and STK25 as the kinase in the presence of cold ATP, and analyzed the treated PID with mass spectrometry. Several STK25 phosphorylation sites were identified in SAV1 PID, including T26. We then raised a phospho-specific antibody against pT26. The antibody selectively recognized SAV1 PID that had been phosphorylated by STK25, but not SAV1 T26A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using this antibody, we confirmed that SAV1 WT was indeed phosphorylated by STK25 at T26 in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

We have previously shown that the STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> complex binds the phosphorylated MST2 linker and reverses MST1/2 activation in a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2017</xref>). The Hippo pathway component SAV1 promotes MST1/2 activation by antagonizing STRIPAK. It is unclear how the PP2A-inhibitory activity of SAV1 is restrained in proliferating cells. In this study, we show that, as a component of STRIPAK, the GCKIII kinase STK25 phosphorylates SAV1 on multiple sites and neutralizes the ability of SAV1 to inhibit STRIPAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Inactivation of STK25 leads to unrestrained SAV1 activity and spontaneous MST1/2 activation, even without contact inhibition or other stimuli.</p><p>SAV1 may not be the only substrate of STK25 in the Hippo pathway. It remains to be tested whether STK25 can phosphorylate other STRIPAK components and if so, whether these phosphorylation events also regulate the conformation and activity of STRIPAK. Furthermore, STK25 may also play an indirect role in Hippo regulation. Many components of the STRIPAK complex have been shown to localize to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baillat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fidalgo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frost et al., 2012</xref>). Inactivation or depletion of STK25 has been reported to disassemble the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fidalgo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuki et al., 2010</xref>), which may in turn lead to the disassembly and inactivation of the STRIPAK complex. Importantly, phosphorylation of several STRIPAK components is increased in the presence of PP2A inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreno et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that the phosphorylation status of the STRIPAK complex might be dynamically regulated to modulate Hippo signaling output.</p><p>A recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al. (2019)</xref> has argued that STK25 activates LATS1/2 by phosphorylating their activation loop (AL) without the phosphorylation of their hydrophobic motif (HM). This proposed mechanism is inconsistent with the well-established two-step sequential activation scheme of NDR kinases, including LATS1/2. In this scheme, upstream kinases, such as MST1/2, first phosphorylate the highly conserved HM of LATS1/2, and the phosphorylated HM then promotes the autophosphorylation of LATS1/2 AL and full activation of LATS1/2. Both HM and AL phosphorylation events are essential for LATS1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bichsel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stegert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hergovich and Hemmings, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoa et al., 2016</xref>). Our results also contradict the findings of Lim et al. We show that STK25 suppresses Hippo pathway activation at the level of MST1/2, instead of activating the pathway at the level of LATS1/2. The reasons underlying this discrepancy are unclear at present. Future studies are needed to reconcile these disparate findings.</p><p>Interestingly, only STK25, but not the highly homologous MST3 and MST4, regulates Hippo pathway activation, although each GCKIII kinase is known to be incorporated into the STRIPAK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kück et al., 2019</xref>). Since we do not know the relative expression levels of the GCKIII kinases in cells, STK25 may simply be expressed at a much higher level compared with MST3 and MST4, making STK25 the dominant kinase in STRIPAK. Several previous studies have also reported distinctive functions for the GCKIII kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fidalgo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mardakheh et al., 2016</xref>). Another possible explanation is that different subcellular localization patterns of the GCKIII kinases produce different functions. For example, MST3 is evenly distributed through the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). Serum starvation relocates MST4 from the cytoplasm to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mardakheh et al., 2016</xref>). STK25 localizes to the Golgi apparatus where it partially co-localizes with SAV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). This Golgi co-localization may offer a venue for STK25 to specifically phosphorylate SAV1. In support of this idea, 14-3-3ζ localized at the Golgi apparatus is specifically phosphorylated by STK25, but not MST4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the GCKIII kinases appear to perform different cellular functions at distinct cellular locations. We also noticed that SAV1 and STK25 are clustered at the peri-nuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Components of the STRIPAK complex, including STK25, are known to localize to both the Golgi apparatus and the peri-nuclear region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kück et al., 2019</xref>). These regions likely provide specific sites for STK25 to assemble into the STRIPAK complex to regulate Hippo activation.</p><p>Because diverse physiological conditions can impinge on the activity of the Hippo pathway, STK25-mediated inhibition of MST1/2 may be regulated by upstream stimuli. For example, oxidative stress has been reported to release STK25 from the Golgi, which is thought to stimulate apoptosis, possibly involving the activation of MST1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lehtinen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2009b</xref>). Many components of the STIRPAK complex localize to the Golgi. Oxidative stress may disrupt the association of STK25 with the STRIPAK complex. This in turn may allow SAV1 to regain its ability to inhibit PP2A and activate MST1/2 to promote apoptosis. Identification of upstream signals of STK25 regulation will deepen our understanding of the Hippo pathway in physiology and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The coding region of human STK25 was cloned into the pET28 vector that included an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag.

adding several new experiments. The data are convincing that the STK25 kinase component of the PP2A STRIPAK complex down regulates the Hippo pathway by phosphorylating Sav1, which prevents Sav1 from inhibiting PP2A dephosphorylation of Mst<sub>1/2</sub>, which down regulates Mst<sub>1/2</sub> activity (the results shown in their Bai et al., 2017 <italic>eLife</italic> paper). They rule out other effects on STRIPAK on the actin cytoskeleton. This work adds another layer to the complex feedback that regulates the Hippo pathway.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;YSK1 suppresses Hippo signaling by regulating SAV1-STRIPAK antagonism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a significant advance from the Bae et al., 2017 paper. There these authors showed that Sav1 helps to activate the Mst<sub>1/2</sub> kinase by inhibiting its dephosphorylation by the STRIPAK PP2A phosphatase complex. Here, they show that the Ysk1 kinase component of the PP2A STRIPAK complex down regulates the Hippo pathway. They show that Ysk1 phosphorylates Sav1, which prevents Sav1 from inhibiting PP2A dephosphorylation of Mst<sub>1/2</sub>, thereby down regulating Mst<sub>1/2</sub> activity. This provides a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate the pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since the published literature has mostly focused on STK25 as influencing Golgi morphology and participating in oxidative stress response, could some of the reported effects on Hippo actually be indirect consequences of events occurring downstream of STK25? It would be particularly helpful to know whether STK25 has any effects on the F-actin cytoskeleton, given its central role in Hippo pathway regulation.</p><p>2) The experiments monitoring Hippo signaling don't include assessments of cell density (at least not adequately described in the Materials and methods or figure legends). When making comparisons between different experimental conditions, we need to know whether the cell density is the same, as variations in cell density can have substantial effects on Hippo signaling.</p><p>3) Based on knockouts in 293FT cells. they conclude that of the three GCKIII kinases, YSK1 is the only one that affects Sav1 activity. There is no information provided as to the relative expression levels of these three kinases in these cells, nor whether their relative expression is similar in other cell types, or whether each can incorporate in the STRIPAK complex. It should be clarified if this is already known in the literature. If not, the authors should be more circumspect in their claims. The brief mention of subcellular localization differences in the Discussion doesn't address this fundamental issue.</p><p>4) The experiments in Figure 4, which are key to the inhibitory mechanism, are incomplete. Using in vitro phosphorylation with recombinant kinase, they identify several phosphorylation sites and raise an antibody to a peptide containing one of these phosphorylated sites (T26). However, the T26A mutant has no effect, so they mutate Thr26 along with two other sites identified by mass spec, and subsequently observe functional effects. They imply that all of these sites might contribute weakly to the functional effects, but since they are rather dispersed in the PID sequence, it seems quite plausible that one of the non Thr26 phosphorylation sites is key. It would be helpful for the authors to state why they seem not to have mutated the other two sites individually. Such information would solidify the mechanism. They should also discuss the relative conservation of the sites in the PID. Also, how complete was the coverage in the mass spec analysis? Could there be other sites?</p><p>5) The Materials and methods to follow and/or reproduce the work are insufficient.</p><p>a) A large portion of their story is the identification of the phosphorylation sites on hSav by YSK1. However a detailed description of the methods used for generating the data (concentrations of enzyme/substrate a and details of the MS methods) is lacking and the MS data not provided.</p><p>b) The authors do not provide information on IF staining and the quantification (Figure 1B-C) – e.g. are they simply counting raw pixel values? How are images are processed etc.?</p><p>c) Materials and methods or standardization for &quot;RNA expression&quot; (Figure 1D, G), IP assays (Figure 2), for over-expression assays (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and complex formation and gel filtration (Figure 3H) were not found. It would be difficult to for other investigators to reproduce the data presented.</p><p>6) Although it doesn't affect the qualitative conclusions, many of the experiments claiming significant differences appear to use a p value threshold of 0.1. The authors may wish to be more cautious in concluding effects based on such a weak threshold.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54863.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since the published literature has mostly focused on STK25 as influencing Golgi morphology and participating in oxidative stress response, could some of the reported effects on Hippo actually be indirect consequences of events occurring downstream of STK25?

We tested the effect of STK25 knockout on the F-actin cytoskeleton by immunofluorescence. However, we did not observe any significant change of the F-actin cytoskeleton structure between control and STK25 KO cells. These data were presented in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 4. We have also added the detailed description of the experiments in the revised Materials and methods. Even though we did not observe an effect of STK25 depletion on the actin cytoskeleton, we cannot rule out the possibility of other indirect effects. We have thus revised the text to discuss the possibility that, in addition to SAV1 regulation, STK25 depletion might also affect the Hippo pathway through indirect effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments monitoring Hippo signaling don't include assessments of cell density (at least not adequately described in the Materials and methods or figure legends).

We agree with the reviewers that cell density is critical for Hippo signaling. For our Hippo signaling analysis, we always took great care to ensure that cells were cultured as sparse sub-confluent monolayers before collecting them for further experiments. We have revised the Materials and methods accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on knockouts in 293FT cells. they conclude that of the three GCKIII kinases, YSK1 is the only one that affects Sav1 activity.

We found that each GCKIII kinase was detectable by individual antibodies in 293 cells. Unfortunately, an antibody that recognizes all three GCKIII kinases is not available so that we cannot easily determine the relative protein levels of each GCKIII kinase. We have thus modified the text to discuss the possibility that STK25 might be the most abundant member. MST3 and/or MST4 may also be involved in regulation of the Hippo pathway in the context of different cellular localization or cell types. We also added the relevant references on the fact that each GCKIII kinase can be incorporated into the STRIPAK complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiments in Figure 4, which are key to the inhibitory mechanism, are incomplete.

The authors may wish to be more cautious in concluding effects based on such a weak threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching our mistake. * actually indicated P&lt;0.05, not P&lt;0.1 as we stated.
