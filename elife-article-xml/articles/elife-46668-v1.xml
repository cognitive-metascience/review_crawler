We found that nematode-infected rootworm cadavers are attractive to rootworm larvae, and that this behavior increases nematode reproductive success. Nematode-infected rootworms release distinct volatile bouquets, including the unusual volatile butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). BHT alone attracts rootworms, and increases nematode reproductive success. A screen of different nematode and herbivore species shows that attraction of healthy hosts to nematode-infected cadavers is widespread and likely involves species-specific volatile cues.

Biological control relies on this form of top-down control to protect crops from herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills, 2001</xref>). In order to exert their effects, herbivore natural enemies need to make contact with their hosts. Natural enemies have evolved various behavioral strategies to maximize their chances for host encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson and Pollard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Rijk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Rijk et al., 2016</xref>). Predators and parasitoids for instance can use herbivore-induced plant volatiles to locate herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turlings et al., 1990</xref>). Herbivores on the other hand can detect and actively avoid contact with natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lima and Dill, 1990</xref>). The interplay between behavioral adaptations of herbivores and natural enemies is likely to be an important determinant for the success of herbivore natural enemies and their capacity to suppress herbivore pests.</p><p>A key step in the life of many herbivore natural enemies is the acquisition of new hosts once the old host is exploited. Predators and parasitoids acquire new hosts through hunting, ambushing and trapping their prey. Parasites with indirect life cycles can also facilitate the transfer to new hosts through host manipulation strategies, including changes in color, smell and behavior of their current hosts to attract alternate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mauck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daoust et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>). How parasites with direct life cycles (i.e. involving a single host) can facilitate transmission from exploited hosts to new healthy hosts is less well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies show that insect bacterial pathogens can induce to changes in volatile emissions in infected individuals, which results in the attraction of non-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keesey et al., 2017</xref>). Whether predators, parasitoids and multicellular parasites with direct life cycles can use volatiles to attract additional hosts or prey remains to be determined. Furthermore, whether behavioral manipulation of herbivores by natural enemies can enhance top-down control of herbivores is unclear.</p><p>Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are obligate pathogens of soil insects and important biological control agents of insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grewal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pilz et al., 2014</xref>). Infective juveniles (IJs) are the only EPN stage surviving in the soil looking for a host. IJs can locate a host using volatile cues that are emitted by herbivores and herbivore-infested plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rivera et al., 2017</xref>). Once an IJ comes into contact with a compatible host, it penetrates it and injects entomopathogenic symbiotic bacteria. EPNs from the Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae families inoculate bacteria of the genus <italic>Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus</italic> respectively, which kill the insect by septicemia and toxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duchaud et al., 2003</xref>). The EPNs then feed on bacteria and infected host-tissues and multiplies within the cadaver. Eventually, a new generation of IJs emerges from the cadaver and begins searching for new hosts. A crucial factor that determines the success of EPNs is their transmission efficiency from exploited to healthy hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Labaude and Griffin, 2018</xref>). As EPNs are much less mobile than their hosts, they may have evolved host manipulation strategies to increase the probability of host encounters. Conversely, herbivores may effectively avoid EPNs by detecting their presence. So far, the impact of EPNs on host behavior has not been studied in detail.</p><p>Here, we investigated the interactions between healthy and EPN-infected conspecific insects. We first studied the behavior of the western corn rootworm (WCR, <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic>), a major root pest of maize that occurs sympatrically with <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic> and is the target of EPN-based biological control programs. WCR can use plant toxins to repel <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robert et al., 2017</xref>), but successful biological control of WCR through <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toepfer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toepfer et al., 2008</xref>). Through a series of behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that healthy WCR larvae are attracted to EPN-infected cadavers. We identify a volatile that is specifically released from infected cadavers and is sufficient to attract WCR larvae and increase WCR control by EPNs. Finally, we determine the impact of EPN infection on attraction of different insect and EPN species to test whether this phenomenon is widespread. Collectively, these experiments reveal a novel facet of EPN biology that enhances their capacity to infect and kill insect herbivores.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Western corn rootworm larvae are attracted to nematode-infected cadavers</title><p>To explore how WCR responds to the presence of nematode-infested conspecifics, we infested root-feeding WCR larvae with <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic>. We then measured the attractiveness of the maize+WCR+EPN complexes at different time points over 96 hr using belowground olfactometers. Maize+WCR+EPN complexes were attractive to WCR 48 hr after WCR and EPN application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The attraction coincided with high root consumption by WCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and high production of the WCR attractant (<italic>E</italic>)-Î²-caryophyllene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>) by the attacked maize roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Plants in the presence of WCR or EPNs alone were not attractive to WCR than plants alone at this time point. However, plants in the presence of WCR under EPN attack were attractive to WCR larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We next tested whether the cadavers of EPN-infected WCR larvae attract WCR by putting infected and uninfected WCR cadavers into small filter paper cages and burying them beneath individual maize plants. WCR larvae preferred EPN-infected WCR cadavers over uninfected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Time course analysis revealed that the attraction to EPN-infected cadavers was strongest 96 hr after infection, shortly before the emergence of IJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To better understand how WCR larvae respond to the presence of EPN-infected cadavers, we performed additional behavioral experiments in petri dishes using EPN-infected and uninfected WCR cadavers and small root pieces to provide plant background odors. WCR larvae visited infected cadavers more often than uninfected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and spent more time per visit on infected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The number of root visits was also increased for roots that were close to infected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). WCR larvae did not show any preference for uninfected or EPN-infected cadavers in the absence of plant roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We hypothesized that this may either be due to plant background odors which are required to elicit WCR search behavior, or due to plant-mediated attraction, where EPN-infected WCR cadavers render roots more attractive to WCR. To test the second hypothesis, we exposed maize roots to uninfected and EPN-infected cadavers, removed the cadavers and evaluated WCR choice. WCR larvae did not show any preference for the different roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these experiments demonstrate that EPN infection of WCR directly increases volatile-mediated recruitment and cadaver contact of healthy foraging WCR larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The presence of nematode-infected cadavers increases WCR recruitment and nematode predation success in the soil</title><p>To investigate whether the presence of EPN-infected cadavers increases EPN predation by attracting healthy herbivores, we conducted experiments in soil arenas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

GC-FID analysis revealed no significant difference in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between uninfected and EPN-infected WCR cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Headspace solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and GC-MS followed by automated alignment and peak picking revealed 279 distinct volatile features, including 15 features that were exclusively detected in the headspace of infected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation of volatile profiles from infected and uninfected cadavers along PC axis 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A single volatile eluding at 18.23 min explained 45.6% of the variability of axis one and was exclusively present in the headspace of infected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additional manual integration and relative quantification of the 11 highest peaks in the headspace chromatograms revealed that 9 out of 11 integrated peaks were emitted in higher quantities by infected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The highest peak, at retention time 18.23 min, was only present in chromatograms of infected cadavers. Based on comparisons of retention times, mass spectra and co-injection of a synthetic standard, the compound was identified as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). No BHT was detected in blank controls and in the headspace of different materials that were used for rearing and experimentation. Thus, environmental contamination as a source of BHT can be excluded. A single infected WCR cadaver was found to release up to 5 ng of BHT per hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Emission kinetics showed that BHT starts being released 72 hr after EPN infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), which corresponds to the onset of increased WCR recruitment to EPN-infected cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, further investigations focused on BHT as a potential volatile attractant of WCR. BHT has originally been described as a synthetic antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu and Wu, 2008</xref>), but has also been identified in the headspace of cyanobacteria, algae, and fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu and Wu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hussaini et al., 2011</xref>).

Here, we show that nematode-infection triggers the release of volatiles from the cadavers of herbivorous insects, resulting in the attraction of healthy herbivores, higher infection rates and increased nematode reproduction.</p><p>Parasites have developed diverse strategies to manipulate their hosts and thereby increase their fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moore, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poulin and Maure, 2015</xref>). Here, we show that entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) increase their predation success by inducing the release of volatiles from infected host cadavers. These volatiles attract healthy herbivores and increases nematode infection success. Thus, when nematodes emerge from the exploited cadaver, they will have a higher chance to find healthy hosts, which boosts their chances of survival and reproduction. Other nematodes may also cue in on these volatiles, which may also increase their chance of encountering additional hosts. Together, these phenomena markedly increase top-down control of herbivores in the soil, as shown here for an important agricultural pest, the western corn rootworm. Earlier work shows that EPNs can follow plant volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rasmann et al., 2005</xref>), which also serve as aggregation cues to the western corn rootworm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robert et al., 2012b</xref>).

Butylated compounds such as BHT are uncommon in nature, and naturally produced BHT has so far only been documented for a handful of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu and Wu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vikram et al., 2004</xref>). We found that BHT is specifically released from EPN-infected WCR cadavers, and that it is sufficient to elicit WCR behavior similar to EPN-infected cadavers. How BHT is produced in the cadavers requires further study. Digestion of the larvae by symbiotic bacteria of the nematodes is not sufficient to elicit BHT release, suggesting that nematode-specific factors are required. EPNs produce a variety of proteins to overcome and digest their insect hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), and it is probable that these proteins interact with host-derived metabolites to form BHT. A thorough screen of the rearing and experimental environments used in this study revealed no traces of environmental BHT, which, together with our control experiments, strongly suggests that the BHT we measure is of biological origin. BHT is a radical scavenger that is used as a food additive and synthetic analog of vitamin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burton and Ingold, 1981</xref>). Thus, the production of BHT may have additional benefits to the nematodes, for instance by preserving the herbivore cadavers as they are consumed. From an applied point of view, BHT may represent a cost-effective synthetic substance that could be applied as a bait that attracts the western corn rootworm and its natural enemies.</p><p>Parasites typically attract healthy hosts by hijacking adaptive behavioral responses. The flatworm <italic>Leucochloridium paradoxum</italic> for instance modifies the eye stalks of snails to resemble caterpillars, which prompts birds to attack the eyes, thus allowing the flatworm to be transmitted to its primary host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">WesoÅowska and WesoÅowski, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic> triggers the release of aggregation pheromones from infected <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which attracts healthy flies and thus enhances pathogen dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keesey et al., 2017</xref>). We show that EPNs can use volatiles such as BHT to attract healthy rootworm larvae in the soil. Why the rootworm larvae are attracted by the volatiles of infected cadavers is currently unclear. Given that approaching an infected cadaver bears a substantial mortality risk due to the presence of nematode infective juveniles and the suppression of immunity by volatiles such as BHT, it is unlikely that this behavior is adaptive for the herbivore itself. Based on the current literature, it seems more likely that following volatiles such as BHT is beneficial for the rootworm in a different context. Because WCR larvae and adults are attracted to and use certain aromatic compounds for host selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lampman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erb et al., 2015</xref>), one hypothesis is that BHT attracts the larvae either by interacting with the receptors of compounds involved in host location or by mimicking their activity. Such effects were for instance reported for volatile odorants blocking CO<sub>2</sub> receptors and responses in fruit flies and mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turner and Ray, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Even though the benefits of attracting healthy rootworms for EPNs seems evident, whether this is a true form of manipulation requires further mechanistic, evolutionary and ecological insights. As <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic> is a generalist with a broad host range, we hypothesized that the nematode should be able to induce attractive volatiles in a wide variety of hosts in order to benefit from this trait. Indeed, nematode-infestation triggered attraction of healthy conspecifics in five out of seven tested insect species and was induced by four different EPN species, suggesting that this phenomenon is widespread and may benefit different nematodes in the presence of different insect host species. Strikingly, WCR larvae were attracted to a variety of different EPN-infected hosts, suggesting that the nematodes may, at least in the case of WCR, also succeed in attracting additional hosts of other species. However, most of the other tested insect species were not attracted to nematode-infested WCR larvae, showing that the attraction to infected cadavers is not universal and, to a certain degree, specific. Our analyses of the volatile blends that are emitted upon infection by the different insects also reveal a high degree of specificity, with each insect producing a different, attractive volatile blend, with little overlap between the different species. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic> may have the capacity to adjust the induction of volatiles from the host it invades to maximize the attraction of healthy hosts. Different insect species are attracted by different volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MÃ¼ller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gershenzon and Dudareva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dicke and Baldwin, 2010</xref>), which makes such a mechanism beneficial as host communities vary. A better understanding of the proximal mechanisms of volatile induction by nematode infection and perception by different herbivores would help to shed light on this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbison et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A recent study found that volatiles from EPN-infected insect cadavers increases plant resistance against the Colorado potato beetle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helms et al., 2019</xref>). EPN-induced cadaver volatiles can thus affect herbivores directly, by altering their behavior, or indirectly, <italic>via</italic> plant-mediated changes. The different and diverse effects of EPN-induced cadaver volatiles should be better characterized and integrated in future studies to fully understand how the presence of herbivore natural enemies affects plant-herbivore interactions.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that infection with EPNs triggers the release of volatiles that are attractive to healthy hosts and suppress their nematode resistance, which increases predation success and top-down control of a herbivore pest. The finding that nematode infection increases the recruitment of healthy hosts across different insect species suggests that this phenomenon is widespread and may contribute to shaping the interactions between insects and their natural enemies in nature and in the context of the biological control of soil-borne insect pests.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additionnal <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Zea mays L.</italic>)</td><td>Maize;

All EPNs were reared in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMullen and Stock, 2014</xref>). EPN-infected insect larvae were obtained by placing larvae in solo-cups (30 mL cups, Frontier Scientific Services, Inc, USA) containing a 0.5 cm layer of autoclaved moist sand (Selmaterra, Bigler Samen AG, Thun, CHE) and 1000 infective juveniles (IJs) in 500 ÂµL tap water.

Briefly, different combinations of plants, EPNs and WCR larvae were placed in L-shaped glass pots. One control plant and one treated plant were connected by one glass connector closed by two Teflon connectors containing a fine mesh that prevented the larvae from accessing the plant root system while allowing volatiles to diffuse freely. Five third-instar WCR larvae were added to the central connector. The first choice of the larvae was recorded. Larvae remaining in the central connector longer than 15 min were recorded as âno choiceâ. First, WCR larvae were given the choice between a healthy maize plant or a maize plant infested with five WCR larvae and 2000 EPNs. WCR choice was evaluated 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr after infestation. Second, WCR preference 96 hr post infestation was investigated by offering larvae the choice between the following combinations: (i) maize <italic>vs</italic>. maize+EPNs; (ii) maize <italic>vs</italic>. maize+ WCR; (iii) maize <italic>vs</italic>. maize+WCR+EPN and (iv) five WCR larvae enclosed in a filter paper cage next to a healthy plant <italic>vs</italic>. five EPN-infected WCR larvae enclosed in a filter paper cage next to a healthy plant. Infestation of plants with WCR larvae was realized by adding five healthy third instar larvae to the bottom opening of the glass pots. EPN treated plants were obtained by adding 10 mL EPN solutions (200 IJs/mL with 30 mg EPN medium from Andermatt Biocontrol, CHE) to the bottom opening of the glass pots. Plants without EPNs were obtained by adding 10 mL of 3 mg/mL of EPN medium.</p><p><italic>Petri dish assays</italic>. BHT attractiveness to WCR larvae was assessed using Petri dishes (9 cm diameter, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, DE). A 5 mm layer of 1% agarose (m/v, Sigma Aldrich Chemie, CHE) was poured into the dishes. Two to three 5 cm root pieces were placed at the two opposite sides of the dish. Two filter paper (90 mm, Whatman, Sigma Aldrich Chemie, CHE) slices (lengthÂ =Â 7 cm, widthÂ =Â 1 cm) were placed in parallel in between the root sections at four cm distance from each other. Five frozen-killed control WCR larvae or EPN-infected WCR larvae (five days post-infection) were placed onto the filter paper slice respectively. BHT complementation was realized by adding 20 ng BHT in 100 ÂµL 0.01% ethanol (â¥99.8%, Sigma Aldrich Chemie, CHE) onto the filter paper slice. This dose corresponds to the amount that is released by four infected larvae over an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Control slices were imbibed with 100 ÂµL 0.01% ethanol. Five third instar WCR larvae were given the choice between (i) control and BHT slices, (ii) healthy and EPN-infected larvae, (iii) healthy larvae and healthy larvae complemented with BHT and (iv) EPN-infected larvae and healthy larvae complemented with BHT. The choice of WCR larvae was measured by adding five larvae in the center of the dish and recording their positions after 0.5 hr, 1.5 hr, 3 hr and 5 hr. To gain more insights into WCR behavior, this experiment was repeated and WCR behavior towards EPN-infected WCR cadavers (frequency and duration of contact) was continuously recorded over two hours. Using this petri-dish assay, the specificity of the preference response was compared in four experiments. First, the preference of six other insect species including <italic>D. balteata</italic>, <italic>T. molitor</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>S. littoralis</italic>, <italic>P. xylostella</italic> and <italic>G. mellonella</italic> to healthy and <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic>-infected conspecifics was assessed. Second, the preference of WCR larvae for conspecifics infected with different EPN species, including <italic>H. megidis</italic>, <italic>H. beicherriana</italic>, <italic>H. georgiana</italic> and <italic>S. feltiae</italic>, was tested. Third, the preference of WCR larvae between healthy and <italic>H. bacteriophora-</italic>infected <italic>D. balteata</italic>, <italic>T. molitor</italic>, <italic>S. littoralis</italic> and <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae was evaluated.

The choice of the insects was measured by adding five larvae in the center of the dish and adding food pieces on each side. Food pieced consisted of maize roots (var.

To test EPN behavioral response to BHT, exudates from healthy <italic>D. balteata</italic> larvae were complemented with BHT or water (control) and placed in two 5 mm diameter wells along the plate diameter and at 5 cm distance from each other. Exudates from <italic>D. balteata</italic> larvae were collected by rinsing third instar larvae with tap water (50 ÂµL per larva). BHT exudate complementation was performed by adding 20 ng BHT in 0.01% ethanol per well. Control exudates were obtained by adding the equivalent volume of 0.01% ethanol to the wells. BHT complementation of WCR larvae was realized by adding 20 ng BHT in 50 ÂµL 0.01% ethanol onto frozen-killed control WCR larvae.

Six maize plants were sown in rectangular plastic trays (25 cm *11.5 cm * 9.5 cm, Migros, Bern, CHE), such as two sets of each three plants grew at about 15 cm distance from each other. After 12 days, five cadavers of frozen-killed control larvae were buried on one side, and five cadavers of EPN-infected larvae (4 days post infection) were buried on the second side. EPNs (1500 EPN in 2 mL tap water) were added on each side. Finally, eight WCR larvae were placed in the middle section for four days. After this period, all larvae were collected to record infection rates. Infection rates were only considered when at least two larvae were collected. The number of emerging EPNs per larva was evaluated as a proxy for EPN fecundity. Counting emerging EPNs was performed by placing individual larvae in adapted white traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMullen and Stock, 2014</xref>). Briefly, the white trap consisted of 1.5 mL Eppendorf lid (Sarstedt AG and Co., Germany) placed upside down in a solo cup. The lid was covered with 2.5 cm diameter filter paper. Tap water was placed around the lid. Each larva was placed onto the filter paper and emerging EPNs could reach the water. The number of freshly emerged EPNs was counted 15 days after the emergence of the first EPNs. All larvae collected from one side of one arena were considered as pseudo-replicates and the number of emerging EPNs was averaged within each side for analyses.</p><p>The direct and indirect (WCR-mediated) impact of BHT on EPN infectivity was evaluated in three experiments.

Specifically, the SPME fiber (100 Î¼m polydimethylsiloxane coating, Supelco, USA) was inserted into the vial for 30 min. The fiber was desorbed at 220Â°C for 2 min. The column temperature was initially set at 60Â°C for 1 min and increase to 250Â°C at a speed of 5 Â°C min<sup>â1</sup> for plant samples, and 200Â°C for insect samples. The resulting GC-MS chromatograms were processed with Progenesis QI (informatics package from Waters, MA, USA). Compound identification was realized using the NIST search 2.2 Mass Spectral Library and pure compound standards. The mass spectrum and retention time of synthetic butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma Aldrich Chemie, CHE) matched those of the putative BHT peak in natural samples.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Entomopathogenic nematodes increase predation success by inducing cadaver volatiles that attract healthy herbivores&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lukasz Stelinski (Reviewer #1); Selcuk Hazir (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript of Zhang and colleagues makes important progress in understanding the role of volatile signals that mediate in (soil-borne) tritrophic interactions. The study shows that the third trophic level, that is entomopathogenic nematodes, can increase their infection efficacy by manipulating host behavior. It demonstrates that these nematodes cause the release of specific volatiles from infected herbivore cadavers to attract more herbivore hosts. The authors were able to identify a volatile cue of infected herbivore carcasses that attract healthy herbivores, thereby increasing nematode infection rates.</p><p>Although we agreed that the data is intriguing and deserves publication, we did not agree with one of the conclusions: in subsection âButylated hydroxytoluene emitted by nematode-infected cadavers attracts healthy hosts and renders them more susceptible to nematode attackâ and the final paragraph of the Discussion section you claim that BHT emitted by nematode-infected cadavers &quot;renders healthy hosts more susceptible to nematode attack&quot;. We judge that this claim is insufficiently supported by evidence. We also believe it is more farfetched than the alternative hypothesis that the pre-incubation with BHT simply makes larvae more attractive and thereby stimulates infection. This could be investigated by comparing the nematode infection rate or percentage of BHT treated and untreated larvae in a non-choice assay. Also an analysis of the headspace of BHT treated and untreated larvae may help here to explore the different scenarios. However, such data were not presented.</p><p>Therefore we ask for the following:</p><p>1) The claim that BHT suppresses larval resistance to nematodes should be removed from the manuscript. It can be addressed as a hypothesis in the Discussion provided the alternative scenario of increased infection caused by increased attractiveness of larvae when treated with BHT is addressed as well.</p><p>In subsection âPetri dish assaysâ you describe petri dish choice assays. We noticed that the WCR data was reported in a different manner (number and duration of visits) than the data for the other species. The description of the tests for the other species is also very superficial, while these results are an important part of your story. Therefore we ask you:</p><p>2) To describe the methodology in more detail to make clear in which aspects the WCR tests and the other tests differed. At least:</p><p>a) explain in the manuscript why you decided to report on% choice instead of number and duration;</p><p>b) explain in the Materials and methods section how/when the% choice was determined e.g. at which time points.</p><p>3) Indicate in the Materials and methods section if â and if so, how â additional larval attractants were used such the maize roots for WCR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46668.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript of Zhang and colleagues makes important progress in understanding the role of volatile signals that mediate in (soil-borne) tritrophic interactions.

We judge that this claim is insufficiently supported by evidence. We also believe it is more farfetched than the alternative hypothesis that the pre-incubation with BHT simply makes larvae more attractive and thereby stimulates infection. This could be investigated by comparing the nematode infection rate or percentage of BHT treated and untreated larvae in a non-choice assay. Also an analysis of the headspace of BHT treated and untreated larvae may help here to explore the different scenarios. However, such data were not presented.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we agree that the claim of BHT-induced susceptibility was too strong. We found that exposing WCR larvae to BHT increase their infection rate by nematodes by a mechanism different than through higher nematode attraction (&lt;0.001 ng.WCR<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> BHT is emitted by BHT-exposed and rinsed larvae and those amounts did not trigger a preference behavior for nematodes but still increased their infection rates). Yet, we agree with the fact that we canât prove that BHT exposure increases susceptibility, but may possibly result from a semi direct effect on nematodes in their hosts. We therefore added the data mentioned above and toned down our interpretation.</p><p>Second, we developed the Materials and methods section concerning insect preference assays and provided with schemes and pictures of the used designs. Yet, we could not use the same subtitles for the Materials and methods and Result sections, as most Materials and methods are used for Figures 1 and 2, and therefore lead to several empty method sub-sections (only âsee aboveâ). To help the reader understand which design was used, we added schemes on the figures and clearly mention them in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore we ask for the following:</p><p>1) The claim that BHT suppresses larval resistance to nematodes should be removed from the manuscript. It can be addressed as a hypothesis in the Discussion provided the alternative scenario of increased infection caused by increased attractiveness of larvae when treated with BHT is addressed as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this comment. We agree that our claim may not have been sufficiently supported by the data presented in the manuscript. First, we would like to clarify that Figure 4B presents the data for a non-choice experiment. Second, we had assessed BHT emissions from the larvae after rinsage and found that rinsing WCR larvae that were exposed to BHT is enough to remove most BHT from their surface. The chromatograms are now added as figure supplement (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). As traces of BHT remained (&lt;0.001 ng.WCR<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>) we conducted a nematode choice experiment between control and BHT-exposed and rinsed WCR larvae and found no nematode preference. These results are also now included in the manuscript (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B). Finally, we canât exclude that WCR sequesters BHT in their body, which could have a direct effect on nematodes. We therefore toned down our claim about induced susceptibility in the Results/Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subsection âPetri dish assaysâ you describe petri dish choice assays. We noticed that the WCR data was reported in a different manner (number and duration of visits) than the data for the other species. The description of the tests for the other species is also very superficial, while these results are an important part of your story. Therefore we ask you:</p><p>2) To describe the methodology in more detail to make clear in which aspects the WCR tests and the other tests differed. At least:</p><p>a) explain in the manuscript why you decided to report on% choice instead of number and duration;</p><p>b) explain in the Materials and methods section how/when the% choice was determined e.g. at which time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for these remarks.</p><p>2a) WCR preference was also assessed in proportion of WCR on each sides of the petri dishes. The data were presented in Supplementary Figure 1 but are now included in Figure 1 to increase consistency throughout the figures. Because of the interesting pattern we observed (more% of WCR larvae were found on the side of infected conspecifics), we repeated the experiment to get more insights into the WCR behavior (number of visits/duration). This experiment was only conducted with WCR larvae. This is now clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>2b) Done.
