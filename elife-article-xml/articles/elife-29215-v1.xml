In vivo studies have shown that Golgi cell activity is regulated by climbing fiber stimulation, yet there is little functional or anatomical evidence for synapses between climbing fibers and Golgi cells. Here, we show that glutamate released from climbing fibers activates ionotropic and metabotropic receptors on Golgi cells through spillover-mediated transmission. The interplay of excitatory and inhibitory conductances provides flexible control over Golgi cell spiking, allowing either excitation or a biphasic sequence of excitation and inhibition following single climbing fiber stimulation. Together with prior studies of spillover transmission to molecular layer interneurons, these results reveal that climbing fibers exert control over inhibition at both the input and output layers of the cerebellar cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spillover</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Golgi cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS093960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nietz</surname><given-names>Angela K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS064025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Overstreet-Wadiche</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS065920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wadiche</surname><given-names>Jacques I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Climbing fiber glutamate spillover enhances response complexity and regulates signaling to Golgi cells through a form of transmission not constrained to synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Information transfer between neurons predominantly occurs at synapses, where neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic cell activates postsynaptic receptors that are clustered at anatomically-defined specialized structures. Anatomical reconstructions of synaptic connectivity thus delineate pathways of information flow throughout the brain. Since monoamine neurotransmitters and GABA can signal through volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuxe and Agnati, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015</xref>), functional connectivity is not strictly synonymous with anatomical connectivity. Yet most excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by the fast neurotransmitter glutamate that is tightly limited to the synapse by diffusion and reuptake by glutamate transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tzingounis and Wadiche, 2007</xref>). Though this argues that anatomical connectivity faithfully represents excitatory circuits, at some synapses glutamate can spill out of the synaptic cleft at sufficient levels to activate nearby receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asztely et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isaacson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalifoux and Carter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szmajda and Devries, 2011</xref>). This process, termed spillover, has been studied extensively at cerebellar synapses, where it augments conventional point-to-point synaptic transmission between neurons and enables glutamate signaling to Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell and Silver, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiGregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchell and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coddington et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the abundance of spillover transmission at cerebellar synapses, it is unclear how glutamate spillover contributes to Golgi cell (GoC) activity.</p><p>Cerebellar climbing fibers (CFs) establish powerful synapses with Purkinje cells (PCs) comprised of several hundred anatomically defined release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</xref>). Each site releases multiple vesicles per action potential to generate a high glutamate concentration that overwhelms glutamate transporters, resulting in spillover to neighboring molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) in the absence of an anatomical synaptic connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wadiche and Jahr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, the magnitude of spillover-induced AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated depolarization is sufficient to trigger MLI spiking, and can modulate PC excitability through feed-forward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coddington et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, glutamate spillover signaling from CFs is sufficient to shape network dynamics even in the absence of anatomical connectivity.</p><p>GoCs are spontaneously active GABAergic interneurons providing the primary source of inhibition to granule cells. Early work suggested that CFs innervate GoCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheibel and Scheibel, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marr, 1969</xref>), an idea supported by subsequent in vivo studies showing transient suspension of GoC tonic firing following CF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulman and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Edgley, 2008</xref>). However, a recent study failed to find structural evidence of synaptic contacts between CFs and GoCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>), and it is unclear how synaptic signaling by glutamatergic CFs would suppress GoC activity. Here, we show that glutamate spillover from CFs controls GoC activity with a distinct temporal profile in comparison to synaptic transmission from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, and can suppress GoC spiking by mGluR2 activation. These results reconcile previously incongruous findings obtained by anatomical mapping and functional studies, and combined with previous work show that CFs influence inhibition at all levels of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CFs signal to GoCs through spillover transmission</title><p>We recorded from over 200 GoCs in the granule cell layer of mouse cerebellar slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dieudonne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Angelo, 2008</xref>; see Material and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We used focal stimulation in the molecular layer (while blocking GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition with picrotoxin, CGP55845 and strychnine) to trigger EPSCs with fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1Ai, D and E</xref>; 137 ± 20 pA; n = 17) and facilitating paired-pulse ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ai and F</xref>), consistent with PF synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dieudonne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beierlein et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, focal stimulation in the white matter or granule cell layer yielded EPSCs with slightly faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1Bi, D and E</xref>; 124 ± 16 pA; n = 14) and no short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi and F</xref>), consistent with MF inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kanichay and Silver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>). Both PF and MF EPSCs exhibited gradual increases in amplitude with increasing stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ai and 1Bi</xref>). In marked contrast, focal stimulation near Purkinje cell soma evoked all-or-none EPSCs in GoCs with kinetics slower than either PF- or MF-EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1Ci, D and E</xref>; 34.3 ± 4.2 pA; n = 11). Slow Purkinje cell layer-evoked EPSCs also exhibited robust paired-pulse depression (PPD), unlike PF- and MF-EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci and F</xref>). NBQX (5 µM) application equally blocked the response from all three afferent pathways, indicating that EPSCs were mediated by AMPARs (PF: inhibition to 8.5 ± 4.2%, MF: 7.0 ± 3.2%, CF: 8.3 ± 0.4%; n = 3–6, p&gt;0.99 for each comparison, ANOVA, data not shown). Based on the all-or-none response, strong PPD and the slow rise and decay kinetics of EPSCs, we hypothesized that stimulation near PC somata evokes EPSCs arising from nearby climbing fibers (CFs) that course through the granule cell layer en route to making synapses on PC dendrites and spines, similar to what is observed in molecular layer interneurons (MLIs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29215.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptic- and spillover-mediated EPSCs onto cerebellar GoCs. .</title><p>(<bold>Ai</bold>, left and middle) Parallel fibers (PFs) were stimulated with an electrode placed in the molecular layer (ML).

To assess whether the slow CF-GoC EPSC is due to glutamate spillover from distant release sites, we tested the sensitivity to glutamate uptake inhibition. Whereas the amplitudes of PF- and MF-evoked EPSCs were unaffected by TBOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aii, Bii, and G</xref>), the slow Purkinje cell layer-evoked EPSC was significantly potentiated by TBOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cii and G</xref>). While TBOA had little effect on the decay of the PF- and MF-evoked EPSC, the Purkinje cell layer evoked EPSC was robustly prolonged (PF: 106 ± 6%; MF = 111 ± 15%; CF = 257 ± 30%; n = 15, 9, and 11, PF v MF: p&gt;0.99, PF v CF: p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, MF v CF: p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, ANOVA, data not shown). Finally, we tested whether NMDA receptors sensed glutamate spillover by voltage clamping GoCs at +40 mV by pharmacologically isolating NMDARs. Indeed, single CF-stimulation was sufficient to evoke CPP-sensitive currents suggesting that under depolarizing conditions NMDARs may contribute to CF-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together these results suggest that the slow Purkinje cell layer-evoked EPSC is a result of CF signaling to GoCs through glutamate spillover transmission.

We constructed peristimulus probability histograms (PSHs) of GoC spiking (see Materials and methods).

CF-spillover to MLIs generates a similar biphasic change in excitability resulting from sequential glutamate-mediated depolarization followed by GABAergic feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>). However, inclusion of GABA receptor antagonists in our experiments precludes a contribution of feedforward inhibition. Alternatively, GoCs express mGluR2, a G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled glutamate receptor that reduces excitability by activating inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohishi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luján et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakanishi, 2005</xref>). CF-spillover could thus suppress GoC spiking via mGluR2-mediated GIRK activation, as occurs following strong or high frequency PF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watanabe and Nakanishi, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We therefore tested whether the mGluR2 antagonist LY341495 altered CF-dependent GoCs spiking. We initially used simultaneous recordings in neighboring PCs to monitor if CF activation revealed an mGluR2-dependent pause in GoC spiking, although stimulus-induced spike resetting (see below) made the window of mGluR2-inhibition difficult to quantify across cells with heterogeneous spike patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore used TBOA in addition to inhibitory blockers to enhance glutamate spillover. In the subset of GoCs showing CF-induced pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), TBOA increased the initial CF-evoked spiking probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>) as well as enhanced the duration of the subsequent pause period (from 93.3 ± 16 ms to 183 ± 23 ms; n = 9, p=0.01, paired t-test). The cumulative ratio trended to increase following TBOA application (0.6 ± 0.1) but was highly variable, likely due to the irregular effects on evoked spiking that could occlude the subsequent pause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> for variable TBOA effect on EPSCs). Inhibition of mGluR2s entirely blocked post-excitation pausing, returning the GoC spiking to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; TBOA + LY341495 = 6.0 ± 0.9 and 6.7 ± 0.5 Hz, respectively; n = 9, p=0.28, paired t-test). Furthermore, mGluR2 inhibition did not significantly change the number APs added with CF-stimulation and resulted in a cumulative ratio comparable to that of non-pause GoCs (0.89 ± 0.04 n = 12 and 0.93 ± 0.06; n = 9, p=0.57, unpaired t-test and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, CF-induced pausing results from spillover activation of mGluR2s. In the GoC subset showing a purely excitatory response (non-pause), application of TBOA enhanced post-stimulus spiking as expected and further application of LY341495 did not alter GoC activity (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that CF stimulation generates a rapid increase in GoC excitability which can be followed by a longer-lasting suppression of spiking. CF-induced inhibition happens in the absence of functional inhibitory connections, can be unmasked by uptake inhibition, and is dependent upon postsynaptic mGluR2 activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29215.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CF-mediated GoC pausing is dependent upon activation of postsynaptic mGluR2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, top) Example traces (10 traces overlaid) and raster plot (middle) from a GoC that displays a suppression of GoC spiking following CF stimulation (arrow) in control solutions.

The insensitivity of spiking to TBOA is consistent with the insensitivity of the PF and MF EPSCs to inhibition of glutamate transport (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and suggests that the pause in spiking reflects a resetting of tonic spike rate (or spike synchronization) due to intrinsic mechanisms that set the interspike interval.

Spillover generates direct excitation through activation of AMPARs, as well as inhibition through activation of mGluRs. The ability of glutamate spillover to inhibit GoC firing suggests that mGluR-mediated inhibition may contribute to the transient pauses in GoC tonic firing reported in vivo by stimulation of the inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulman and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Edgley, 2008</xref>).

We expect that CF spillover signaling occurs on apical GoC dendrites in the ML, due to their proximity to CFs that innervate PC dendrites. Spillover signaling may enable integration of synaptic inputs in apical dendrites over a broader time window in contrast to the narrow window of integration of synaptic inputs arising in basal dendrites.</p><p>GoCs exert their influence in the GC layer at glomerular MF-GC synapses. Here, single mossy fiber boutons are contacted by ~50–100 GC dendrites and usually a single GoC axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crowley et al., 2009</xref>). The influence of GoCs is facilitated by the complex glomerular geometry that enables GABA released from GoCs to spillover to adjacent, non-synaptically coupled GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamann et al., 2002</xref>). The extensive ramification of the complex GoC axon also allows a single GoC to contact many glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito, 2006</xref>). Synaptic activation of GoCs generates feedforward phasic inhibition of GCs, and pacemaker activity contributes to tonic inhibition of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brickley et al., 1996</xref>). Thus CF-excitation of GoCs has the potential to influence the excitability of thousands of GCs.</p><p>In addition to their glutamatergic inputs, GoCs receive GABAergic inhibition from Lugaro cells (at a ratio of 10:1 LC:GoC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dieudonné and Dumoulin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dumoulin et al., 2001</xref>), cerebellar nuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankri et al., 2015</xref>), and other GoCs but not MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hull and Regehr, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>).

We speculate that reciprocal GABAergic synapses between GoCs or connections from Lugaro cells or recurrent PC-GoC connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Witter et al., 2016</xref>) could contribute to CF-evoked pausing in vivo, a possibility that we did not test due to the difficulty of identifying CF-evoked EPSCs in the presence of intact inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Stimulation of GoC afferents perturbs intrinsic firing by distinct mechanisms</title><p>We found that CF-mediated regulation of GoC spiking displayed distinct temporal properties compared to synaptic signaling from PF and MFs. Single PF and MF stimuli triggered rapid GoC spiking followed by a short-latency pause in tonic firing that was unaffected by mGluR2 antagonism. It is likely that this brief pause is due to the intrinsic pacemaker firing of GoCs that is synchronized across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vos et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Angelo, 2008</xref>). GoCs respond to afferent stimulation with a short burst of spikes that disrupts their intrinsic pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Solinas et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2007a</xref>). As a result, the pause seen after synaptic stimulation or current injection results from the synchronized reset in the pacemaker activity of the GoC.</p><p>In contrast, CF evoked suppression of GoC spiking depended on mGluR activation rather than intrinsic spike resetting. Both CF excitation and inhibition were enhanced by application of the glutamate transporter antagonist TBOA, but suppression of CF spiking was selectively blocked by mGluR2 antagonism, suggesting suppression results from mGluR-induced inhibition, similar to PF burst stimulation that activates postsynaptic mGluR2 on GoCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watanabe and Nakanishi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakanishi, 2005</xref>). In the intact brain, multiple active CFs may provide spillover to GoCs to produce a response under physiological conditions. In addition, spillover dependent mGluR-mediated inhibition may augment feedforward GABAergic synaptic inhibition imposed by other GoCs and Lugaro cells, although these possibilities remain to be tested.</p><p>mGluRs may be uniquely poised to sense glutamate spillover from active CFs. Unlike mGluR1/5 subunits that preferentially localize near excitatory synapses, mGluR2 is randomly distributed across the entire somatodendritic domain and axon of GoCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luján et al., 1997</xref>). The preferential activation of mGluR2 by single CF stimuli likely reflects the accessibility of spillover glutamate to reach sufficiently large regions of extrasynaptic GoC membranes to recruit detectable mGluR2-mediated GIRK activation. Because spillover is not confined to an anatomical post-synaptic site, its actions are largely regulated by glutamate clearance in the extracellular space and the proximity of postsynaptic receptors to the release sites. Our results showing that transport blockade enhances the duration of the mGluR2-mediated pause are consistent with this idea. In contrast, glutamate release at PF and MF synapses is likely constrained to peri-synaptic regions by a high density of glutamate transporters at excitatory synapses, such that extrasynaptic mGluR2 activation is controlled by the strength and duration of synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watanabe and Nakanishi, 2003</xref>). Our results confirm that glutamate released by single PF and MF stimuli was insufficient to activate mGluR2-mediated inhibition, even when glutamate transporters are blocked.</p><p>Golgi cells in vivo do not show excitation but exclusively show a pause in firing in response to climbing fiber stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Edgley, 2008</xref>). It is possible that differences in experimental approaches between in vivo and in vitro studies contribute to this discrepancy in outcomes. We stimulated a single or a small number of CFs near recorded GoCs and identified CF-EPSCs by the well-known characteristics of CF spillover transmission (all-or-none EPSCs with PPD and TBOA sensitivity). Thus we ‘selected’ only GoCs that show AMPA receptor EPSCs - these recordings could be viewed as a ‘paired’ recording between a single CF and a single GoC. In vivo experiments use a protocol consisting of stimulation of the inferior olive, a site that is distant from recorded GoCs. We speculate that the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results reflects the difference in the probability of identifying a ‘paired’ recording between a particular CF and GoC in the two preparations. We expect that CFs can generate a range of GoC responses including excitation only, biphasic excitation-inhibition and inhibition only, depending on the complement of glutamate receptors responding to spillover. Since mGluRs have a higher affinity for glutamate than AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malherbe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>), it is possible that most GoCs in vivo exhibit solely an inhibitory response, but due to our selection criteria for confirming the CF source of glutamate, all of our GoC recordings have AMPA receptor components that will undoubtedly cause excitation. Just as extensive anatomical studies have detailed traditional synaptic connectivity, further work is needed to understand how release dynamics and tissue architecture might shape activation of extrasynaptic receptors to regulate functional connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for granule cell processing and heterogeneity</title><p>GoCs are responsible for regulating the responsiveness of GCs to MF afferent activity and thus setting the tone of information flow through the cerebellar cortex.

In this context, GoCs set the time window for GC spiking and time is encoded through the sequential activation of populations of GCs. Indeed, results from behavioral assays in combination with lesioning studies have shown that disrupting the cerebellar cortical circuit leads to changes in learned response times while failing to abolish the learned response itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perrett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raymond et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prestori et al., 2008</xref>).

This requires significant heterogeneity and randomness in GCL activity patterns. Heterogeneity can arise from differential connectivity patterns between GCs and mossy fibers, as well as by recurrent inhibition from the GoC network which enhances sparse GC activity. An additional source of heterogeneity comes from receptor activation profiles. In recent cerebellar models, mGluR2 activity was suggested to increase the dynamic range of GC responses while preventing the circuit from entering an erratic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rössert et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, heterogeneity in CF-mediated mGluR activation on GoCs could provide as a source of variability in GCL activity.</p><p>Our results identify a new mechanism for regulating GoC activity at the cerebellar input stage. Here, conjunctive stimulation of CFs and peripheral inputs may lead to LTD at the MF-GC relay and/or plasticity at excitatory GoC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Edgley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robberechts et al., 2010</xref>). In the broader context of cerebellar function, it is possible that CF spillover allows local interneuron circuits to monitor input to PCs and regulate local circuit excitation and inhibition required to refine cerebellar-dependent actions. In the context of CFs providing an error signal, spillover signal to GoCs may relay privileged information at the input stage that is not encoded by mossy fibers. In this manner, CF spillover may enhance response complexity and regulate signaling through a form of transmission not constrained to synapses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were conducted through protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Mice (C57BL/6 or CRH-ires-CRE, Jackson Labs stock # 012704 x ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP, Jackson Labs stock # 012569) of either sex aged P16-28 were anesthetized via isoflurane inhalation or with 2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol and intra-cardially perfused with ice cold cutting solution prior to decapitation.

Additional whole cell recordings were made from PCs in ChR2-expressing mice. Pipettes were filled with a solution containing in mM: 110 CsCl, 35 CsF, 10 Hepes, 10 EGTA, and 5 QX-314Cl. Recordings were made at −60 mV in the presence of 100 nM NBQX to reduce the size of CF-evoked EPSCs. In all cells tested, CF EPSCs were all-or-none in nature and no activation of multiple CFs onto individual PCs was observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging</title><p>In a subset of cells 0.2% biocytin was included in the intracellular solution to allow post-hoc morphological identification of GoCs. Slices were post fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 hr. Free floating sections were washed with 1X PBS and rinsed with 0.3M glycine and 0.5% Triton-X 100. Slices were blocked in TBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% glycine, and 0.4% Triton-X 100 for 1 hr at room temperature. After the initial block, slices were incubated with Streptavidin conjugated Alexa 647 (1:1000; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) overnight at 4°C. In cases of transgenic CRH-ires-CRE floxed ChR2-EYFP, slices were also incubated (overnight at 4°C) with rabbit anti-EGFP (1:1000; Invitrogen) to amplify staining of the EYFP-fused ChR2 protein. After staining, slices were rinsed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield anti-fade reagent (Vectorlabs, Burlingame, CA). Images of cells (Alexa 647) or CFs (ChR2-EYFP) were acquired using a 20X oil-immersion objective (0.85 NA) on an Olympus FluoView 300 confocal microscope using a 633 nm or 488 nm excitation wavelength. Images were processed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><p>Recordings were analyzed using AxographX software (Axograph Scientific, Sydney, Australia). Changes to basal spontaneous action potential firing were quantified as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, peristimulus histograms (PSH) were computed and integrated. A linear fit to the baseline (200–300 ms) of the integral was extrapolated and subtracted from the integral to yield the cumulative spike probability plot. The ratio of the steady state (600–800 ms) to the initial number of spikes added (within 20 ms) provided a relative measure of the inhibition that sometimes followed the excitation with each stimulus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, insets). Average PSH and cumulative probability plots were calculated for cells with at least 20 individual episodes. Data are displayed as mean ±SEM and statistical significance was determined using paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests or ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA). In some figures, the values of the number of cells (n) tested changed if experiments were not carried out through all pharmacological treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drugs</title><p>Picrotoxin (GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist; 100 μM), NBQX (AMPAR antagonist; 5 μM), QX-314 (Na<sup>+</sup>-channel blocker; 5 mM), and CGP55845 (GABA<sub>B</sub>R antagonist; 2 μM) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Non-synaptic signaling extends the influence of cerebellar climbing fibers&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While all agreed that the data are of high quality and the results novel, the reviewers shared a common concern regarding the presentation. In particular, the caveats related to the specific experimental conditions used (NMDA/GABA receptor block, TBOA) were not adequately addressed, and along the same lines, the conclusions were overstated. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months. If you decide to submit a revision, we will again seek the advice of the reviewers before a final decision is made.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show in their in vitro studies of the cerebellar microcircuit that release of glutamate during artificial climbing fiber activation can spill-over onto Golgi cells activating ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors leading, respectively, to excitation then inhibition. The inhibition of Golgi cells occurs through activation of mGluR2, and this is consistent with previously published in vivo recordings showing a pause in Golgi cell firing following climbing fiber stimulation, suggesting an interesting underlying mechanism for inhibition at the input stage of the circuit.</p><p>We think you need to make the title more accessible to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, perhaps by including something about potential function of this part of the circuit, or likely consequence of your findings that would not have been previously expected. A more specific title that raises GoCs or the GC layer would seem appropriate.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In several instances the authors conclude that climbing fiber activity provides a biphasic (excitatory followed by inhibition) control over Golgi cell spiking. However, this statement is mainly true in the presence of the glutamate transport blocker, TBOA. In the absence of TBOA, roughly half of the cells show a purely excitatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The authors need to acknowledge that the statement of biphasic response was only true in a subpopulation of cells, and discuss the caveats of these methodological details in terms of their interpretation of results in the broader context of cerebellar function.

However, this statement is mainly true in the presence of the glutamate transport blocker, TBOA. In the absence of TBOA, roughly half of the cells show a purely excitatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The authors need to acknowledge that the statement of biphasic response was only true in a subpopulation of cells, and discuss the caveats of these methodological details in terms of their interpretation of results in the broader context of cerebellar function. How do the authors imagine that these mechanisms are engaged under physiological circumstances, i.e. without TBOA/Picro/CGP, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that about half of the cells show a purely excitatory response, which is why we separated the two response types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> recorded without TBOA (subsection “CF stimulation can suppress GoC firing”). As mentioned in the discussion, we think that heterogeneity in receptor activation profiles may contribute to the ability of GoCs to exhibit variable activity patterns necessary to distinguish between stimuli. To clarify this point, we have now modified the abstract to highlight these two types of responses.</p><p>It is important for us to clarify that these two response patterns should not be interpreted as defining the only two possible GoC response patterns in vivo. Rather, we propose that AMPA-receptor mediated depolarization and mGluR2-mediated inhibition are two distinct mechanisms that mediate direct control of GoC activity by CFs that can be combined to generate a variety of GoC activity patterns. As described further in Point 3 (below), our experimental methodology of stimulating CFs near GoCs “selects” for GoCs wherein excitation dominates, since all our GoC recordings show an AMPA EPSC. We speculate that GoCs in vivocan also respond solely with mGluR-mediated inhibition, but an experimental caveat is that we would not have identified GoCs with only inhibition due to the small mGluR current that is not readily apparent in voltage clamp. We have clarified this critical interpretive point in the Discussion section.</p><p>Inclusion GABA-receptor blockers was experimentally necessary to strictly confirm CF identity based on characteristic properties of the EPSC, but we speculate that CF excitation of GoC activity in vivoresults in an additional source of CF-mediated suppression of GoC spiking through feed-forward GABAergic inhibition (Discussion section). Finally, we added a discussion of the possible scenarios that may engage distinct CF-GoC activity patterns during in vivo(Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the pause be driven by the higher peak spiking probability that occurs in TBOA?

This result replicates a previously published report that the post-spiking “reset” of GoC firing frequency increases with the number of evoked APs (Solinas et al., 2007). However, we show that blocking mGluR2 receptors has no effect on this post-spike resetting whereas blocking mGluR2 receptors selectively abolished the pause following CF stimulation <italic>without altering the peak firing frequency</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, we showed that CF-mediated cumulative ratio is correlated with the mGluR2 current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, while GoCs do exhibit post-injection spike “reset” related to spike frequency (potentially similar to what we showed for PF and MF spike resetting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the mGluR2 sensitivity suggests that CF-mediated pausing results from TBOA-enhancement of mGluR activation. This explanation has been included in the subsection “Stimulation of GoC afferents perturbs intrinsic firing by distinct mechanisms”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In vivo recordings of Golgi cells following climbing fiber stimulation do not show excitation and always have a pause in firing (Xu and Edgley, 2008), whereas these data show a consistent excitation and a variable pause in firing.

We stimulated CFs near GoCs and identified CF-EPSCs by well-known characteristics of CF spillover transmission (all-or-none EPSCs with PPD and TBOA sensitivity). Thus we “selected” only GoCs that show AMPA receptor EPSCs – these recordings could be viewed as similar to a “paired” recording between a single CF and a single GoC. in vivoexperiments use a different protocol consisting of stimulation of the inferior olive, a site that is distant from recorded GoCs. We speculate that the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro results reflects the difference in the probability of identifying a “paired” recording between a particular CF and GoC in the two preparations. We expect that CFs can generate a range of responses in GoCs including excitation only, biphasic excitation-inhibition and inhibition only, depending on the complement of glutamate receptors responding to spillover. Since mGluRs have a higher affinity for glutamate than AMPARs, it is possible that most GoCs in vivo exhibit solely an inhibitory response, but due to our selection criteria for confirming the CF source of glutamate, all of our GoC recordings have AMPA receptor components that will undoubtedly cause excitation. We have included this in the discussion as a possible explanation for the discrepancy between our data and prior in vivorecordings (subsection “Stimulation of GoC afferents perturbs intrinsic firing by distinct mechanisms”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The rationale for this study is a bit overstated.
