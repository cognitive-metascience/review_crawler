These diverse impairments suggest a control system gone awry. In engineered systems, feedback is critical for control. By contrast, models of the basal ganglia highlight feedforward circuitry and ignore intrinsic feedback circuits. In this study, we show that feedback via axon collaterals of substantia nigra projection neurons control the gain of the basal ganglia output. Through a combination of physiology, optogenetics, anatomy, and circuit mapping, we elaborate a general circuit mechanism for gain control in a microcircuit lacking interneurons. Our data suggest that diverse tonic firing rates, weak unitary connections and a spatially diffuse collateral circuit with distinct topography and kinetics from feedforward input is sufficient to implement divisive feedback inhibition. The importance of feedback for engineered systems implies that the intranigral microcircuit, despite its absence from canonical models, could be essential to basal ganglia function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02397.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02397.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei located deep within the brain that are involved in the control of movement.

This led Brown et al. to propose that structures called axon collaterals form a microcircuit that can instead supply such feedback in the substantia nigra. Axons are the nerve fibres that carry signals away from the cell body of a neuron, and axon collaterals are branches of those axons. Data obtained by recording and manipulating electrical activity in the substantia nigra were consistent with this model and further experiments allowed this microcircuit to be mapped in detail.</p><p>By revealing the circuit mechanisms of negative feedback within the substantia nigra, the work of Brown et al. changes our understanding of the basal ganglia and could have implications for understanding the mechanisms and ultimately the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02397.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02397.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>synaptic integration</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dudman</surname><given-names>Joshua Tate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Negative feedback signals within the substantia nigra regulate the output of the basal ganglia, with implications for disorders such as Parkinson's disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basal ganglia are a collection of interconnected subcortical regions of the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLong, 2000</xref>). Pathological disruptions of basal ganglia signaling produce profound deficits in the timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</xref>), vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>), and initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mink, 1996</xref>) of voluntary movements. While it is thus clear that the basal ganglia are critical for voluntary movement, the specific mechanisms by which movement is controlled by basal ganglia activity remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>). Voluntary control of movement can be explained in terms of optimal feedback control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>). The basal ganglia circuit can be described as an extended loop that begins with projections from deep layer cortical neurons and ultimately returns to the cortex via projections from the basal ganglia to the ventral thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haber, 2003</xref>). However, the basal ganglia circuit also contains intrinsic feedback projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerfen, 2004</xref>). In engineered control systems, feedback is critical for stable performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astrom and Murray, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The substantia nigra (SN) pars reticulata (SNr) is the primary source of output from the sensorimotor basal ganglia in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerfen, 2004</xref>). The vast majority of neurons in the SNr are projection neurons that synthesize and release the neurotransmitter ϒ-aminobutryic acid (GABA). Projection neurons of the SNr target pre-motor areas in the ventral thalamus, dorsal midbrain, and tegmentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parent, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hikosaka, 2007</xref>). In addition to these long range targets, nigral projection neurons also elaborate axon collaterals within the SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cebrián et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deniau et al., 2007a</xref>). There are no known interneurons in the SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deniau et al., 2007a</xref>), and thus collaterals of projection neurons are the sole source of intrinsic feedback for the basal ganglia output. Anatomical reconstructions have indicated that the axon collaterals of SNr projection neurons are sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>). The functional impact of this intranigral microcircuit remains unclear. Antidromic activation of SNr projection neurons in anesthetized animals has been used to infer the presence of inhibition via projection neurons collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tepper and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brazhnik et al., 2008</xref>); however, the relative impact, spatial organization and temporal properties of recruitment of feedback inhibition via SNr collateral inhibition remains largely unknown. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that the microcircuit formed by SNr collaterals could implement a critical negative feedback node in the context of a control system for voluntary behavior that is implemented in the extended cortico-basal ganglia circuit.</p><p>In engineered systems, the functional impact of a negative feedback can be difficult to detect and characterize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astrom and Murray, 2008</xref>). For example, at steady state or in the absence of change in the state of the system, there may be no obvious effect of appropriately functioning negative feedback. However, sudden transitions in the state of the system can reveal the contribution of negative feedback—altering, for example, the gain and/or the time course of settling around transitions. By analogy to an engineered system, the SNr microcircuit may have little apparent impact in the absence of sudden changes in the state of the population activity. However, changes in behavior and receipt of sensory stimuli are accompanied by phasic transitions, both increases and decreases, in the activity of the SNr population. We thus reasoned that the role of negative feedback, implemented by the SNr microcircuit, could become apparent under such conditions. Recent work has shown that a salient or conditioned stimulus (CS), for example an auditory tone, can lead to phasic changes in the activity of SNr neurons in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, these short-latency modulations of activity are predictive of the initiation of conditioned behavioral responses—that is action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). If the basal ganglia act as a control system for behavior, then we would predict that control over the gain or dynamic range of these phasic modulations should be critical for normal voluntary actions.</p><p>Detailed study of the local inhibitory connections within the SNr has been hampered by the difficulty in isolating and specifically exciting the SNr collaterals independent of afferent inhibitory and excitatory projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 1983</xref>). We overcame this challenge by using cell-type specific expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), in SNr GABA neurons. This optogenetic approach allowed us to stimulate SNr GABA neurons with high temporal and spatial resolution without contamination from excitatory afferents, dopaminergic transmission, or afferent inhibitory input from the striatonigral projection both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Consistent with the prediction from anatomical data, we show that inhibition derived from the collaterals of projection neurons in the SNr is sparse and has little to no effect on tonic baseline firing. However, we also observed that activation of the SNr projection neuron population could elicit a large and potent feedback inhibition capable of shaping output activity. Here, we show that this unique combination of effects is the result of a number of distinctive features of the SN microcircuit: (1) postsynaptic currents resulting from collateral synaptic input provided robust inhibition with a rapid onset during strong activation of the network; (2) unitary connections are weak with sufficiently low release probability to sustain release during repetitive stimulation; (3) asynchronous basal inhibition in the tonically active network is effectively compensated for by intrinsic conductances that sustain tonic spiking; (4) the potency of feedback inhibition is proportional to total activation of the microcircuit due to a sparse, spatially diffuse connectivity. Together, these properties of the intrinsic microcircuit of the SNr implement a robust inhibition that is rapidly and stably recruited in proportion to the sustained activation of the projection neuron population with little effect in the absence of stimulation—in other words, the inhibitory microcircuit of the SNr mediates a divisive gain control on the basal ganglia output.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>If collateral, feedback projections of SNr neurons provides a source of negative feedback, then we would expect that the level of activation of the population immediately prior to a stimulus should be inversely correlated with the modulation of the response of an individual neuron to that stimulus. In other words, if there were more activity producing collateral inhibition, the phasic response to a stimulus could be blunted. To test this possibility, we examined a dataset of 599 single units recorded from the ventral midbrain of mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5, strongly biased towards recordings from GABAergic neurons in the SN, ‘Materials and methods’) performing a classical trace conditioning task described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). For each individual unit, we computed the normalized response to a salient stimulus (an auditory tone that predicted a delayed reward) as a function of the normalized activity of the simultaneously recorded population of neurons for 32 recording sessions in which at least eight neurons were recorded simultaneously (median = 12; maximum = 21) for each trial in the recording session (median = 71 trials; range = 42:132) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). This yielded a data set of 28,277 comparisons from which we estimated the correlation between the activation of the population at baseline to the activation of each individual neuron in response to the conditioned stimulus (CS). We found that both the population (−0.1; p&lt;0.001 permutation test) and 22/32 individual sessions exhibited significant negative correlations (−0.12 ± 0.05 SD; p&lt;0.05, permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transient changes in the basal ganglia output are reduced by ongoing population activity.</title><p>A data set of 599 single units was isolated from recording sessions with at least eight simultaneously recorded units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>).

However, these data also imply a surprising structure to the SNr microcircuit—namely, even a relatively poor estimate of population activity (7–20 simultaneously recorded units across electrodes spread over hundreds of microns) is sufficient to provide predictive power for the response of individual units. However, significant individual pairwise correlations were very rarely observed in these recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>) consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevet et al., 2007</xref>). This would suggest that either the negative correlation observed is a consequence of correlations in activity due to extended feedback projections or that individual units receive relatively weak and diffuse input from many SN neurons rather than strong feedback inhibition from proximally located neurons.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we first sought to test whether this negative feedback property of the SN microcircuit could be recapitulated in an in vitro preparation where extrinsic, multisynaptic sources of feedback are eliminated. The functional properties of feedback inhibition to the basal ganglia were assessed by channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) mediated stimulation of SNr GABA neurons. In one set of experiments an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expressed a <italic>cre</italic>-dependent ChR2 transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>) was injected into the SNr of a mouse line in which <italic>cre</italic>-recombinase was expressed under the glutamic acid decarboxylase (<italic>Gad2</italic>) promoter to target expression to SNr GABA neurons (hereafter referred to as <italic>Gad2</italic>-ChR2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). In the other, we exploited a transgenic mouse line which has strong expression of ChR2 under the control of the thymus cell antigen 1 (<italic>Thy1</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenkiel et al., 2007</xref>), (hereafter referred to as <italic>Thy1</italic>-ChR2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). In this transgenic line ChR2 is robustly expressed in SNr GABA neurons, but not in SN dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>;) or in upstream projection neurons of the dorsal striatum (data available from the authors on request). Both approaches thus provide a method to specifically excite SNr GABA neurons with high reliability and fine temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–J</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Light evoked activity of ChR2-expressing SNr GABA neurons in vitro.</title><p>ChR2 was selectively expressed in SNr GABA neurons via two methods.

To quantify the gain effect across the population, we compared the normalized response to photostimulation of increasing duration both in the presence and absence of inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We found that the response of the population showed a significant increase as a function of stimulus duration and the magnitude of the increase was significantly reduced by the presence of feedback inhibition (two-factor ANOVA; p&lt;0.05). Divisive gain control is characterized by a suppression of spiking at large stimuli but little to no effect on the response to weak or absent stimuli. Consistent with a divisive gain control, we found that baseline firing was unaffected by removal of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, open circles). To contrast a feedback gain control with the effect predicted for subtractive inhibition, we examined recordings from dopamine neurons of the SN that do not express ChR2, but are strongly inhibited by ChR2 expressing projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). For dopamine neurons, we observed a constant suppression of spiking across the range of stimuli used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). If the reduction in spiking observed during stimulation was the result of feedback inhibition one would predict that the inhibition should onset after the onset of the population response and truncate the response present in the absence of feedback. Consistent with this prediction we found that suppression of spiking was characterized by a significant decrease in the duration of the evoked spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This effect on the duration could be observed in many individual neuron responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Our in vivo results suggested that the extent of suppression of transient activation in SNr neurons is proportional to the estimated activation of the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Anatomical studies indicate that the vast majority of projection neurons elaborate collaterals within the SNr, however, these collaterals can form relatively few (∼10) putative synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, we found that unitary release events produced relatively weak mIPSCs (∼150 pS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data imply that the inhibition observed results from the activation of approximately 50–100 presynaptic inputs. Given that the GABAergic neurons in the SNr are thought to be exclusively projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deniau et al., 2007b</xref>), this is consistent with the finding that projection neuron collaterals form 79.4 ± 96.1 (SD) boutons per neuron within the SNr of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Assuming a modest or low probability of paired connections, our connectivity estimates imply that the extent of activation across a large population of SNr neurons would determine the extent of feedback inhibition consistent with our observation in vivo. While we do not have a direct measure of the total extent of activation of the SNr by our photostimulation, we note that neurons recorded simultaneously experience the same activation state of the network. Thus, we reasoned that the extent of feedback inhibition in a pair of recorded neurons should be correlated if feedback inhibition is proportional to the total activation of the network. Consistent with this prediction, we found that there was a significant correlation (Pearson's correlation, p&lt;0.01 permutation test) in paired recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These results suggest that a given SNr projection neuron receives input from a spatially diffuse collection of other SNr projection neurons.</p><p>The data above are consistent with the claim that a large population of SNr projection neurons must be recruited to fire within a relatively small time window (5–20 ms) in order to achieve robust feedback inhibition and divisive gain effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These results were obtained in the <italic>Thy1</italic>-ChR2 mouse where all neurons in the SNr express ChR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This would suggest that if a local subset of the SNr was expressing ChR2, the divisive gain effect should be present, but reduced in magnitude analogous to the smaller effects observed when less of the network was recruited in the <italic>Thy1</italic>-ChR2 preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Indeed, we found that when the same experiment was repeated in ChR2+ nigral neurons from virally infected <italic>Gad2</italic>-ChR2 mice a divisive gain effect was observed, but reduced in magnitude (p&lt;0.05; two-factor ANOVA; 15% reduction in the saturated response).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intrinsic properties that produce tonic spiking effectively counteract transient inhibition</title><p>To alter the gain of a response to activation of the network requires a change in the slope of the curve. As described above, we observed that there was a substantial effect of feedback inhibition in the strongly activated SNr circuit, but no effect in the absence of stimulation—resulting in a change in the slope of the response to stimulation. However, it is confusing how a strongly coupled inhibitory network of tonically active neurons could exhibit no effect of feedback even in the absence of stimulation. We first asked whether the rate of spontaneous IPSCs was consistent with our estimate, and a prior anatomical estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>), of &gt;50 inputs from other SNr projection neurons.

Thus, with a relatively low release probability (&lt;0.5), we would predict 75–300 Hz of uIPSCs. This corresponds well to the rate of uIPSCs estimated directly from voltage clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Consistent with this estimate, we also show that repetitive stimulation of SNr collaterals fails to completely depress transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) consistent with a vesicular release probability low enough to allow vesicle recycling to keep pace with release. Such a mechanism has been described in detail for Purkinje cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Telgkamp et al., 2004</xref>). These observations suggest that there is indeed a substantial background rate of IPSCs that, when pharmacologically blocked, has no significant effect on the tonic firing of SNr projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atherton and Bevan, 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>High background inhibition has little affect on tonic activity of SNr neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-cell recording of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) onto SNr neurons in control conditions (Cntrl; black trace) and following addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to isolate miniature events (+TTX; red trace, V<sub>h</sub> 0 mV).

Alternatively, tonic spiking could be the solution. For a neuron to repetitively fire it must, upon the return from a spike, exhibit a net membrane current that is inward and thus drives the membrane towards spike threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raman and Bean, 1999</xref>). This implies a positive slope conductance combined with a net inward current below threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nolan et al., 2003</xref>)—in other words, the conductances that drive repetitive firing oppose hyperpolarizing currents in the perithreshold regime. Combined with a reduced driving force of inhibition near threshold, these biophysical features suggest that SNr neurons are much less sensitive to inhibition than to excitation in this regime. To test this hypothesis explicitly, we performed dynamic clamp experiments in which we systematically varied the balance between a high background rate of IPSCs and EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Indeed, we found that the sensitivity of the spike rate to increasing inhibition was much reduced compared to the sensitivity to increasing excitation. Stimulation strongly biased towards an inhibitory conductance often exhibited no effect on the mean spike rate relative to tonic levels. Consistent with the mechanistic model described above, we found that the slope conductance in the perithreshold regime was indeed nonlinear with a sharp positive slope near the inhibitory reversal potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we found that measured biophysical properties (e.g., slope conductance, spike threshold) were unaffected by pharmacological blockade of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The intrinsic inhibitory microcircuit provides a fast, transient inhibition</title><p>Collateral inhibition resulted in a strong suppression of evoked spiking and was sufficient to truncate evoked responses, often after only a few milliseconds. This suggested that collateral inhibition provided substantial inhibition that onset rapidly following stimulation. However, it is possible that the transient effect could also reflect properties of the photostimulation. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined the kinetics of feedback inhibition and compared it to the main source of feed forward inhibition to the SNr from the striatum.</p><p>We made intracellular recordings from individual SNr projection neurons in <italic>Gad2</italic>-ChR2 mice to probe the properties of local feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) and from <italic>Drd1a</italic>-cre mice which were injected with a virus expressing a <italic>cre</italic>-dependent ChR2 transgene into the striatum to target the D1 receptor expressing medium spiny neurons which send axons directly into the SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerfen, 1988</xref>) (<italic>Drd1a</italic>-ChR2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Postsynaptic neurons were recorded in the voltage clamp configuration with a holding potential of ∼+20 mV (reversal potential of the ChR2 current; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>) to isolate inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Slices were perfused with antagonists of excitatory synaptic transmission. Repeated pulses (10 Hz) of wide-field photostimulation elicited stimulus locked IPSCs in 15/23 SNr GABA neurons in the <italic>Gad2</italic>-ChR2 mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and 18/24 SNr GABA neurons in the <italic>Drd1a</italic>-ChR2 mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We positioned either 81-point or 140-point grids of stimulation sites to cover the SN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To achieve high spatial resolution of ChR2 activation, we used a focused 470 nm laser beam that could be rapidly re-positioned to each point on the grid in a pseudorandom sequence that avoided nearest neighbors. The duration of the light pulse was gated so as to deliver brief (&lt;1 ms) pulses of light at each stimulation site. To obtain reliable and spatially homogeneous expression of ChR2 across nigral projection neurons, we used slices from the <italic>Thy1</italic>-ChR2 transgenic mouse line. Relative to wide-field stimulation or stimulation targeting axonal fibers, we reduced the maximal power of the laser using neutral density filters and performed calibration experiments to find intensities that would evoke precise, time-locked spikes in a small number of neurons with somatodendritic arbors surrounding the stimulation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data were consistent with a requirement for propagating action potentials to elicit postsynaptic responses and we found no evidence in recorded neurons of direct axonal stimulation under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we focused on the rising phase and initial peak of IPSCs to bias our analysis towards transmission that resulted from highly reliable, low jitter spikes initiated at each stimulus site.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Circuit mapping of feedback inhibitory circuitry of SNr.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, left) Schematic of the experimental configuration used for channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping.

This would imply a collection of parallel channels each of which could exhibit strong feedback. By contrast, our recording data in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggested that feedback was proportional to the average activation across a large spatial extent of the SN.

In contrast to the first prediction, we found that there was no correlation between the location of individual neurons and the source of the strongest inhibition within the SNr. In other words, we found that neurons with non-overlapping dendritic arbors could have largely overlapping inhibitory receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The basal ganglia is part of the extended brain circuit that controls voluntary movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kandel et al., 2000</xref>). Within this extended circuit there are a number of potential feedback projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dudman and Gerfen, 2014</xref>). However, the only intrinsic source of feedback to the main basal ganglia output nucleus, the SNr, is the microcircuit formed by collaterals of projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deniau et al., 2007b</xref>). Despite anatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deniau et al., 2007b</xref>) and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tepper et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2007</xref>) evidence for the existence of this collateral microcircuit, its functional organization, relative impact, and properties were largely unknown. Here, we show that the unique properties of the SNr microcircuit—both intrinsic properties of projection neurons and the organization of functional activity—combine to implement a potent feedback inhibitory circuit that can exert a divisive gain control effect on the basal ganglia output.</p><p>In behaving mice, we observed that the SN microcircuit appears to modify transient responses to salient sensory stimuli, in our case a CS, in a manner consistent with negative feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We subsequently used cell-type specific expression of ChR2 to show that (1) the inhibition provided by collaterals of SNr projection neurons was sufficient to dramatically suppress firing of projection neurons even in the presence of strong activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); (2) collateral synapses produced inhibition with a rapid onset and modest short-term depression allowing for sustained inhibition during repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); (3) intranigral inhibition had distinct biophysical properties but comparable magnitude to the major source of feed forward input, the striatonigral pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); (4) individual intranigral synapses were weak, but potent inhibition resulted from a spatially diffuse microcircuit in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the functional architecture of the intranigral microcircuit is sufficient to provide robust feedback inhibition that is proportional to the activity SN population—that is it provides a potent gain control on the output of the basal ganglia.</p><p>Finally, existing anatomical studies were divided on whether the striatonigral and intranigral circuits were organized in spatial register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grofova et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>). The diffuse sources of collateral input to SNr projection neurons suggested that feedback inhibition extended across topographic divisions. We further confirmed this observation by combining axonal tracing together with circuit mapping to demonstrate that the striatonigral and intranigral projections were organized independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Thus, for these results the only significant differences between the virally-mediated and transgenic expression of ChR2 in the SNr was the fraction of the population found to express ChR2 and the resultant magnitude of feedback inhibition. While viral-mediated expression could be used to estimate the divergence of inhibitory projections from a single stimulation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it was not suitable for comprehensive mapping of convergence onto individual SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>). The concern in a transgenic mouse line is that ChR2 expression could be present in afferent fibers. To control for this, we blocked excitatory transmission, confirmed that light-activated currents had kinetics expected of ChR2 positive neurons, and confirmed that neurons of the major source of inhibitory input, the striatonigral pathway, did not express ChR2. Consistent with these observations it has previously been suggested that inhibitory fibers in this <italic>Thy1</italic>-ChR2 mouse line do not express ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>). However, in addition to expression in the SNr, we did also observe that neurons of the external globus pallidus (GPe) express ChR2. The GPe is the source of a projection to the subthalamic nucleus and a more modest projection to the SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerfen, 2004</xref>; ). Nonetheless, we found that potent feedback inhibition could be observed in <italic>Gad2</italic>-ChR2 mice and that stimulation of GPe axons yielded relatively less inhibition in SNr neurons than either the striatonigral or intranigral pathways under our stimulus conditions. Finally, we used laser powers that were attenuated relative to the powers necessary to directly stimulate severed axons in these mice (data available from the authors on request), consistent with our observation that only perisomatic stimulation was sufficient to evoke reliable spiking in SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A mechanism for divisive gain control in a circuit lacking interneurons</title><p>Unlike many other circuits in which gain control has been studied, projection neurons of the SNr are spontaneously active. Divisive gain control requires that there is little effect of inhibition in the absence of stimulation. In the case of gain control mediated by an interneuron this can be achieved in a number of ways, for example, through facilitating inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silver, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, in spontaneously active neurons, it is less clear how to prevent feedback inhibition from altering the baseline firing rate as we observe here. One possibility suggested by our data is that a broad distribution of firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) combined with relatively weak individual connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) could produce inhibition that is essentially tonic and too small to significantly affect intrinsic currents that drive repetitive spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and so is counteracted via subthreshold inward currents necessary for repetitive firing. We provided support for such a model by demonstrating that there is, indeed, a high frequency (200 Hz) of spontaneous IPSCs bombarding SNr projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further consistent with this model, simulation of a steady background rate of IPSCs using dynamic clamp revealed a relative insensitivity of spike rate to a tonic net inhibitory background of inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This balance in the tonic firing rate can be disrupted by synchronously recruiting neighboring neurons to produce a rapid inhibition that, combined with the positive feedback produced by inhibition and subsequent disinhibition, overcomes via de-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nolan et al., 2003</xref>) the inward currents that drive the membrane potential towards threshold. This mechanism combining intrinsic properties and synaptic properties is sufficient for a population of spontaneously active inhibitory neurons to implement divisive gain control in the apparent absence of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deniau et al., 2007b</xref>). To our knowledge this represents a novel circuit mechanism for divisive gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silver, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of proposed mechanism for divisive gain control in a circuit lacking interneurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the canonical basal ganglia circuit with detail showing the anatomical basis for intrinsic feedback control of the basal ganglia output via the intrinsic microcircuitry of the substantia nigra.

On the one hand, it has been argued for some time that the feed forward pathways of the basal ganglia are topographically organized and largely independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mink, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hikosaka, 2007</xref>). Movement is thus thought to occur when a focal population of projection neurons becomes inhibited by feed forward input and thus disinhibits downstream pre-motor structures. From this perspective, the diffuse intranigral microcircuit could act to release neighboring projection neurons from intranigral inhibition and thereby suppress unintended movements. Thus, during focal activation of the SNr, collateral inhibition may be thought of as a mechanism for contrast enhancement akin to the role of lateral inhibition in sensory systems. This mechanism may be reflected in the time locked, bidirectional changes in the firing of SNr projection neurons that are commonly observed prior to and during movement in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2012</xref>) and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner and Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevet et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, while the direct striatonigral pathway is topographically organized there is considerable divergence in the corticostriatal input in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, there may be less precise topographic organization of the indirect pathway that enters the SNr via the subthalamic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolam et al., 2000</xref>). The subthalamic nucleus also receives direct cortical input and ascending input from the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coizet et al., 2009</xref>) and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bevan and Bolam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Winn, 2006</xref>). The topographic organization of these ascending pathways is less well understood. Regardless of the topographic precision, the inputs that arrive at the SNr from the subthalamic nucleus convey a great diversity of information and likely exhibit a diversity of dynamics. While there are mechanisms that could maintain activity within a fixed dynamic range in upstream structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silver, 2010</xref>), individual neurons that constitute the output of cortical areas project to multiple subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kita and Kita, 2012</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that the dynamic range of even the cortical output is appropriate for the diverse computations performed in all target structures. To effectively control the basal ganglia output in the presence of such diverse input dynamics and anatomical divergence would seem to require coordinated processing across functional domains. Thus, divisive gain control supplied by a diffuse but potent inhibitory microcircuit could be well suited to ensure that activity remains within a fixed dynamic range.</p><p>We favor a model in which these contrasting descriptions of the role of the intranigral microcircuit are two aspects of its function that can be engaged in different input regimes. The diffuse organization that could produce lateral inhibition in some regimes under the animal's control (i.e., activation of specific well learnt actions), but, may be necessary to produce divisive gain control in other regimes (i.e., ‘global’ activation of the SNr by salient stimuli). While it is not currently possible to monitor nigral dynamics during selective manipulation of feedback, but not feed forward or efferent inhibition, such an approach will be required to definitively test the predictions of our work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The impact of intranigral inhibition on the function of the basal ganglia</title><p>Simple geometrical considerations suggest that the intranigral microcircuit integrates functionally distinct information on a large scale. Cortical afferents to the basal ganglia are derived from an estimated 17 million neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng and Wilson, 2002</xref>) spanning the majority of the roughly 100 mm<sup>3</sup> volume of neocortex. These inputs are funneled through the basal ganglia and will ultimately terminate on approximately 30,000 projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oorschot, 1996</xref>) within the roughly 4 mm<sup>2</sup> volume of the SN. Dendrites of nigral projection neurons and intranigral inhibition that extends over hundreds of microns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grofova et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mailly et al., 2001</xref>) could therefore shape activity derived from cortical inputs separated by several millimeters.</p><p>Existing functional models focus on the feed forward structure of processing within the intrinsic basal ganglia circuitry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mink, 1996</xref>). However, our observation that intranigral inhibition is strong relative to the major source of feed forward input suggests that local processing of diverse streams of information in the SN could be critical for generating dynamics in the basal ganglia output. We hypothesize that the diverse impairments characteristic of pathological disruption of basal ganglia function could reflect, in part, a control system operating outside of a stable regime. Although there is evidence of perturbed dynamics in the SNr in disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ibanez-Sandoval et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samadi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), the specific contribution of the intranigral microcircuit to the diverse behavioral impairments observed in diseases afflicting the basal ganglia circuit remains unclear.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For in vitro experiments, adult transgenic mice (10–30 weeks old) expressing either; ChR2-YFP fusion gene under the control of the mouse thymus cell antigen 1 promoter (Line 18, Stock #007612; Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, Maine, ‘<italic>Thy1</italic>’ mice), <italic>cre</italic>-recombinase under the control of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 gene (Stock #010802; Jackson Labs, ‘GADcre’ mice) or <italic>cre</italic>-recombinase under the control of the dopamine receptor D1A (GENSAT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2010</xref>, Rockefeller University, ‘<italic>Drd1a</italic>-cre’ mice).

For mIPSC experiments, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was replaced with 2 mM Sr<sup>2+</sup> to desynchronize release. Patch pipettes (resistance = 5–8 MΩ) were pulled on a laser micropipette puller (Model P-2000; Sutter Instrument) and filled with one of the following intracellular solutions: Current-clamp recordings of spike activity used a potassium gluconate-based intracellular solution (137.5 mM potassium gluconate, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM GTP, 4 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, pH 7.5).

Spiking was measured in the cell-attached configuration. The spiking frequency and action potential waveform were used to classify neurons as DA or GABA as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Upon break in while diffusion of QX314 was allowed time to progress, negative voltage clamp steps were used to measure the hyperpolarization-activated inward (Ih) current. The presence of detectable inward currents was diagnostic for DA neurons. In current clamp recordings lacking QX314 in the internal solution the intracellular spike waveform and spontaneous firing frequency were further used to confirm cell identity. Analysis of postsynaptic currents (direct photocurrents, sIPSC, mIPSCs and evoke IPSCs) and spiking was performed using custom written analysis code in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Peak current amplitude was measured as the peak synaptic current relative to the baseline holding current preceding each stimulus. Tonic current amplitude was measured as the peak evoked synaptic current relative to the holding current preceding each train. The conductance (g) underlying IPSCs were calculated from g = IPSC<sub>peak</sub>/(V<sub>m</sub> − E<sub>CI</sub>), where IPSC<sub>peak</sub> is the peak amplitude of the IPSC and V<sub>m</sub> is the holding voltage. The equilibrium potential of GABA<sub>A</sub> current (E<sub>CI</sub>) was estimated at −70 mV from the Nernst equation. Rise time constants of postsynaptic currents were measured by finding the 20–80% slope of the rising phase of the stimulus-evoked current. Decay time constant of postsynaptic currents were measured by fitting a single exponential to the decay phase of the stimulus-evoked currents.</p><p>Spikes were detected at the threshold of maximum acceleration. Phase plots were constructed by plotting the first derivative of the somatic membrane potential (dV/dt) vs the somatic membrane potential for the average spike waveform. The membrane potential at which phase plot slope reached 10 mV∙ms<sup>−1</sup> was denoted the voltage threshold and a linear fit was used to calculate the slope. The perithreshold slope was calculated as the slope of the ‘kink’ defined as the slope of dV/dt for 7 ms after the peak of the perithreshold dV/dt.</p><p>For dynamic clamp experiments, individual postsynaptic conductances were generated using IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics), from the sum of two exponentials with rise tau and decay tau derived from measured IPSC and EPSC rise and decay kinetics (rise tau = 0.5 ms, decay tau = 5 ms). The times of individual events were computed by sampling a Poisson distribution in which the rate of IPSC and EPSC events were independently changed from 1000 to 5000 Hz to generate different balances of excitation and inhibition. The convolved waveforms for excitation and inhibition were computed independently and passed to a custom made, digital dynamic clamp (update rate 30 kHz; to be described elsewhere) assuming reversal potentials of −70 mV and 0 mV for inhibition and excitation, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optical stimulation and imaging</title><p>The optics were designed to minimize the spread of the laser in the x, y dimensions of the focal plane while accentuating the focus in z by underfilling the back aperture of the objective. Stimulation intensity was controlled by pulse duration (0.2–1 ms). Stimulation typically consisted of 9 × 9 and 10 × 14 maps of stimulation sites with independent stimuli being delivered in a pseudo-random (non-neighbor) sequence at an interstimulus interval of ≥150 ms and values reflect the average of 3–4 repetitions of the mapping experiment for each cell. Stimulation strength was modulated by gating the laser at maximal power (473 nm, AixiZ or 488 nm, BlueSky Research) with varying durations using timing signals from an external pulse controller (PrairieView software) and the internal power modulation circuitry of the laser or an external Pockels cell (Conoptics) with indistinguishable results. Wide-field activation of ChR2 was accomplished using blue LED (470 nm, ThorLabs) transmitted through the fluorescence light path of the BX51 microscope. LED intensity and timing were controlled through a variable current source (ThorLabs).

Analysis of the full field photostimulation was performed using standard analysis metrics as described in the text. To attempt to minimize the variability in estimates of short-term plasticity stimulation was performed at the half-maximum stimulus intensity determined by generation of an input–output function at the beginning of the experiment. The analysis of circuit mapping experiments was more complicated and is described briefly below and demonstrated more explicitly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Briefly, averages of 3–10 multisite photostimulation experiments were used in all analyses. The moment of photostimulation was determined by thresholding a photodiode signal positioned in a parallel light path to the stimulation light path. Galvonometer position signals were recovered from the PrairieView software and aligned using a transmitted light laser scanning DIC image of the brain slice. Offline analysis routines automatically detected the orientation of the stimulus grid and applied a rotation to put that grid into 0 rotation orientation. The dorsal and medial edges of the grid were manually annotated and used to flip or further rotate all grids into a common reference frame. The average dimensions of the SN are 1.67 mm wide by 1 mm tall. We found that the average of all grids had an identical (1.67–1) aspect ratio. There was modest variation (∼10%) in the dimensions of the SNr grids. All grids were linearly stretched or compacted to the same mean aspect ratio and cell positions moved accordingly. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in the presence and absence of warping. Full depth maps were generated by convolving the response amplitude at individual stimulus positions with an empirically-estimated Gaussian response function. An isocontour of the resulting image was generated at the half maximum level using the ‘contour’ function supplied by Matlab.

This distinction does not seem central to the conceptual importance of feedback inhibition. How it behaves in vivo would seem to depend critically on the precise spatial pattern of the excitation driving it – i.e., whether it functioned as lateral inhibition (favoring one output over another), or spatially homogenous divisive inhibition (turning down all outputs) or even in a disinhibitory mode (removing inhibition by inhibiting the firing of neurons providing feedback inhibition). The fact that in operates divisively in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> seems to reflect two factors: one that a wide field stimulus was used (e.g., as opposed to a smaller moving spot, or some other pattern) and second that there is no significant effect on baseline firing. This last point is somewhat counterintuitive. If individual SNr neurons are pooling feedback inhibition over a large pool (e.g., 70-100 neurons or more, spread out over a large spatial extent) and if each is firing spontaneously at 10-40 Hz, the tonic current is comprised of events at an aggregate rate of 700-4000 Hz.

Potential concern about the electrotonic location of the feedback inhibition is mitigated by the fact that the events observed are rapid.</p><p>Although this proposed experiment might clarify the issue, it should be viewed as a suggestion and it may be feasible to clarify the issue with additional textual changes. Alternatively, it was also suggested that the manuscript would be improved by the inclusion of cell filling (at a minimum from slices but much better from in vivo staining) showing the axonal arborizations of the SNr projection neurons (this could also potentially address the concern above). If is not so, as the authors claim that the level of convergence of the SNr collaterals onto neighboring SNr (or DA) neurons cannot be reliably inferred from anatomical studies such as this, it would be more correct to say that this is beyond the scope of the present study, since many such studies have been performed in the laboratories of Somogyi, Bolam, Magill and others in the basal ganglia and elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, one reviewer felt that prior work supporting the idea that interneurons are absent in this structure should also be mentioned in the Discussion and not only raised in the Abstract.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02397.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>One main point that could use further clarification concerns the distinction between subtractive versus divisive inhibition.

We have now added new data and a more detailed discussion supporting the main conceptual challenge to a divisive gain model: how is it that one can have a strongly coupled, tonically active network of GABAergic neurons that nonetheless have no effect on baseline spiking? We describe briefly the logic of the mechanism we believe can explain this empirical observation.</p><p>This question can be broken down in to two related questions: 1) Are the background rates of IPSCs consistent with the predicted convergence of collateral inputs? 2) How do SNr projection neurons appear to be relatively insensitive to this tonic background input?</p><p>Question 1) First, what is the predicted background rate of IPSCs? Our stimulation results, combined with an estimate of amplitude of a unitary synaptic connection, predicted 50B100 synapses from neighboring SNr projection neurons on to any given projection. If we assume that the lack of interneurons is correct this number is in good agreement with the ∼80 boutons per neuron estimated using bouton counting in reconstructions of the axon collaterals of projection neurons in the SNr of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al. 2003</xref>) . We roughly agree with the reviewers that there could be a background rate of spiking in the range of 1B2 kHz (50B100 inputs * 20 Hz); although we note that this estimate is somewhat high given that in our attempts to measure the saturating number of synapses some connections were almost certainly the product of severed axons. Thus, in the slice the effective background rate of spiking will be somewhat reduced from predictions. The expected rate of IPSCs is then:</p><p><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>R</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>uIPSCs</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>R</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>release</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where R<sub>uIPSCs</sub> is the predicted rate of unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs), N<sub>pre</sub> is the number of presynaptic inputs (release sites), R<sub>pre</sub> is the mean firing rate of presynaptic inputs, and P<sub>release</sub> is the effective release probability at each release site. Although we, as in many other cases, do not have a direct measure of P<sub>release</sub> it can be estimated. In general P<sub>release</sub> is closer to 0 than to 1 for many central synapses. Likewise, our data are consistent with a low vesicular release probability combined with multiple release sites similar to that reported for Purkinje cell synapses by the Raman Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Telgkamp <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). The most telling piece of data in this regard is the balance between vesicle recycling and vesicle release revealed by sustained stimulation. Despite the fact that SNr collateral synapses are depressing we found that even with sustained stimulation steady state depression is only ∼50B60% (very similar to that observed at Purkinje synapses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>.) This is consistent with a low vesicular release probability that allows vesicle recycling to keep pace with release and preventing complete depletion. If we assume release probabilities in the range of ∼0.1B0.3 (consistent with a binomial fit to the distribution of IPSCs observed in our voltage clamp experiments) we would obtain estimates of the expected background rate of uIPSCs in the range of 100B600 Hz, or less if some of the release sites were in severed axons or silent somata. We have now directly measured the background rate from spontaneous activity and observed a mean of ∼200 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, consistent with these predictions.</p><p>Question 2) Given a tonic background rate of IPSCs at ∼200 Hz this would predict that there is a tonic current less than the peak of a unitary event (τ<sub>decay</sub> ≈ 5 ms). The question posed implies that tonic spiking is the problem. We would suggest that tonic spiking is, in this case, the solution. For a neuron to have tonic background firing it means that upon the return from a spike the net membrane current is constantly inward and thus drives the membrane towards threshold and the regenerative spike is triggered. This implies a positive slope conductance with a net inward current below threshold – in other words the biophysics of the neuron opposes hyperpolarizing currents in the perithreshold regime. This, combined with the reduced driving force of inhibition near threshold, suggests that tonic spiking neurons such as SNr projection neurons should be much less sensitive to inhibition relative to excitation. To test this hypothesis explicitly we performed dynamic clamp experiments in which we systematically varied the balance between a high background rate of inhibition and excitation. Indeed, we find that the sensitivity of SNr projection neurons to high background rates of inhibition is relatively weak compared with excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, for a tonic conductance equivalent to a uIPSC (∼150 pS) little or no change in spiking was observed. An alternative or complementary possibility is that homeostatic mechanisms could serve to counteract such changes. Thus, we also examined phase plots of the perithreshold membrane potential dynamics in the presence and absence of inhibition. We found that there was no change in any perithreshold or threshold properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we could directly observe the nonlinear kink in the perithreshold slope conductance such that near the inhibitory reversal potential there is a rather steep positive slope conductance that can oppose transient hyperpolarizing currents (i.e<italic>.,</italic> a background of uIPSCs).</p><p>Thus, taken together we believe our data show that the low release probability of the SNr synapses together with a net inward current and positive slope conductance in the perithreshold regime are sufficient to explain how a strongly coupled inhibitory neuron network of tonically spiking neurons can remain relatively unaffected by inhibition in the absence of stimulation yet strongly suppress changes in response to stimulation – i.e<italic>.</italic>, implement a divisive gain control mechanism. We propose that this suggests that evolution has discovered multiple implementations using inhibitory interneurons in other circuits, but in the basal ganglia appears to have discovered a mechanism in a circuit lacking interneurons.</p><p><italic>Potential concern about the electrotonic location of the feedback inhibition is mitigated by the fact that the events observed are rapid</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are quite right to point out that there are some potential issues with space clamp in these experiments. We have taken steps to mitigate space clamp issues (Cs<sup>+</sup> based internal solution) and use nominal holding potentials that effectively isolate IPSCs (consistent with the estimated junction potential offset); however, space clamp is always imperfect. We have taken extra care to note this point in text.</p><p><italic>Although this proposed experiment might clarify the issue, it should be viewed as a suggestion and it may be feasible to clarify the issue with additional textual changes. Alternatively, it was also suggested that the manuscript would be improved by the inclusion of cell filling (at a minimum from slices but much better from in vivo staining) showing the axonal arborizations of the SNr projection neurons (this could also potentially address the concern above). If is not so, as the authors claim that the level of convergence of the SNr collaterals onto neighboring SNr (or DA) neurons cannot be reliably inferred from anatomical studies such as this, it would be more correct to say that this is beyond the scope of the present study, since many such studies have been performed in the laboratories of Somogyi, Bolam, Magill and others in the basal ganglia and elsewhere</italic>.</p><p>While the abundance and organisation of feedback inhibition can be measured with anatomical studies, the functional properties of these synapses can still remain opaque. Our prediction of the density of synaptic contacts based on our functional measurements corresponds quite well to the anatomical data obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mailly et al. (2003)</xref>. We do note that, to our knowledge, the correspondence between boutons and functional synapses has not yet been directly demonstrated at these collateral synapses and Mailly et al. measurements were made in rats not mice. Both points could be addressed by staining for multiple presynaptic protein markers and counting boutons in mice, however we believe this is beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p><italic>Finally, one reviewer felt that prior work supporting the idea that interneurons are absent in this structure should also be mentioned in the Discussion and not only raised in the Abstract</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this helpful comment. We have made the suggested change.</p></body></sub-article></article>
