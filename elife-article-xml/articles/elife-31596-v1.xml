Our previous crystal structure of MgtE in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound, closed state revealed the existence of seven crystallographically-independent Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, Mg1–Mg7.

Here, we investigated Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes in the structure and dynamics of MgtE using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mg<sup>2+</sup>-titration experiments, using wild-type and mutant forms of MgtE, revealed that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites Mg1, Mg2, Mg3, and Mg6, exhibited cooperativity and a higher affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, enabling the remaining Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites, Mg4, Mg5, and Mg7, to play important roles in channel closure.

They bind to a number of proteins and nucleic acids, regulating a wide range of biological processes such as ATP utilization, enzyme activation, and maintenance of genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hartwig, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cowan, 2002</xref>). In humans, abnormal Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is reportedly associated with several diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is maintained by a class of transmembrane proteins termed Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters. The MgtE family of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters in bacteria, which operates as Mg<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hattori et al., 2009</xref>), is homologous to the eukaryotic SLC41 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Goytain and Quamme, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolisek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Moomaw and Maguire, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sahni and Scharenberg, 2013</xref>). With respect to the role of the MgtE family in Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensor riboswitch upregulates the gene expression of MgtE in response to a decrease in intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dann et al., 2007</xref>); MgtE then restores and maintains the intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Our prior electrophysiological study of MgtE from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> revealed that MgtE facilitates Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake across the cell membrane at intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations lower than 5–10 mM, whereas at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, MgtE does not allow further Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hattori et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have reported the crystal structure of full-length MgtE in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound state, which revealed that it forms a homodimer comprised of an N-terminal cytoplasmic (CP) region (residues 1–263) and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) region (residues 264–450) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hattori et al., 2007b</xref>). The CP region consists of three parts, an N domain (residues 1–131), a cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain (residues 132–245), and a plug helix (residues 246–263); the plug helix connects the latter with the TM region. The two subunits in the dimer are related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, with the ion-conducting pore being formed along the axis of symmetry at the centre of the dimer in the TM region. The ion-conducting pore is closed at the CP side of the TM region, which is stabilized by the interactions with the C-termini of the plug helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, this portion appears to act as a gate for Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport, with the structure obtained reflecting the closed MgtE state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hattori et al., 2007b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31596.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of MgtE in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The MgtE dimer (PDB code:2ZY9) viewed in the membrane plane, with the N domain (blue), the CBS domain (green), the plug helix (yellow), and the TM region (red) highlighted in one subunit.

The direct interaction between these residues closes the ion- conducting pore at its cytoplasmic side; thus, this region is assumed to function as a gate in MgtE.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31596-fig1-figsupp1-v1"/></fig></fig-group><p>In the crystal structure, seven crystallographically independent Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (Mg1–Mg7) can be identified, among which Mg1 is located on the 2-fold axis in the ion-conducting pore at the extracellular side of the TM region, whereas the other six sites are located in the CP region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to these sites coordinate with acidic residues, through at least one carboxylic group, and further bridge two different MgtE domains, either in the same or other subunits. Recently, the structural basis for ion selectivity was revealed through a high resolution crystal structure of the TM region, in which the Mg1 site accommodates a hydrated Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>). Electrophysiological investigation of MgtE Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding site mutants indicated that every Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding site in the CP region (Mg2–Mg7) contributes to the formation of the MgtE closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hattori et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although the structure of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free full-length MgtE has not been reported, we have presented the crystal structure of the N-terminal 275 residues of MgtE, which includes the whole CP region (residues 1–263) in both the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free and -bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hattori et al., 2007b</xref>). A structural comparison of the two states suggests that Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding alters the relative orientation of the N and CBS domains in each subunit, as well as changing the inter-helical angle between the plug helices of the two subunits. Recently, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the MgtE CP region in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free state, conducted by our laboratory, revealed that the N domain tumbles widely in space, and that it transiently approaches the CBS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Imai et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these results, we have proposed a structural mechanism for MgtE gating, in which Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to the CP region of MgtE allosterically alters the conformation of the plug helices, resulting in gate closure. However, the concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> required to saturate each Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding site remains unknown, as does the site(s) to which Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding causes the changes in the structure and dynamics of each portion of MgtE, resulting in the closed MgtE state.</p><p>In the present study, we used solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes in the structure and dynamics of full-length MgtE. Mg<sup>2+</sup>-titration experiments using the wild-type and mutant forms of MgtE revealed the functional roles of each Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding site: Whereas the Mg1, Mg2, Mg3, and Mg6 sites exhibit a higher affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup> and stabilize the structure of the TM region, the Mg4, Mg5, and Mg7 sites play critical roles in changing the conformation and dynamics of the CP region including the plug helices, leading to channel closure. This study thus revealed the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating mechanism of MgtE that underlies cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Methyl-TROSY signals of Ile δ1 methyl groups as probes of the conformation and dynamics of MgtE</title><p>Full-length MgtE was overexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, solubilized in <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM) micelles, and purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography analysis indicated an apparent molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa, suggesting that MgtE formed a dimer in the micelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In order to observe the solution NMR signals with sufficiently high resolution and sensitivity in such a large membrane protein, we elected to observe the methyl-TROSY spectra of Ile δ1 methyl groups in {u-<sup>2</sup>H, Ileδ1-[<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>]}MgtE. This demonstrated that the fifteen Ile residues in full-length MgtE are widely distributed across the whole MgtE structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with I28 and I84 being located in the N-terminal domain; I168, I171, I190, I201, and I242 in the CBS domain; I260 in the plug helix; and I291, I293, I302, I338, I339, I397, and I438 in the TM region. Hereafter, each Ile residue is represented by its residue number and its location, such as I28<sup>N</sup>, I168<sup>CBS</sup>, I260<sup>Plug</sup>, and I291<sup>TM</sup>.</p><p>We next established the resonance assignments for twelve of the fifteen Ile δ1 methyl groups in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free and bound states, respectively, by comparing the methyl-TROSY spectra of fifteen individual Ile to Val mutants with that of the wild-type protein, in the absence and presence of 16 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The remaining three signals for I242<sup>CBS</sup>, I291<sup>TM</sup>, and I302<sup>TM</sup> were assigned only in the presence of 16 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, due to line broadening and/or degeneracy of the signals in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

The missing of these signals is presumably caused by the exchange broadening between Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound and unbound states for the sites Mg2-7 of the Mg1-binding mutant. These spectral comparisons strongly suggest that the mutation of the Mg1-binding site precludes the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes in the whole MgtE molecule, as has been observed for the wild-type MgtE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left).</p><p>Essentially the same spectra, seen for the Mg1-binding mutant (D432A), were observed for the Mg2- (E258Q), Mg3- (D259N), and Mg6- (D95N) binding mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the mutation at the site Mg2, Mg3, or Mg6 also precludes the complete Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes in the whole MgtE molecule at 4 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

The present study revealed that gating of MgtE occurs at Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of 4 mM. Below this threshold, MgtE adopts an open state, and allows the transport of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> into cells; thus, the intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> level is maintained higher than the threshold. Consequently, under physiological conditions, MgtE is not in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free state. Cooperative Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Mg1-, Mg2-, Mg3-, and Mg6-binding sites, which changes the conformation and dynamics of the TM region, saturates at 3 mM, suggesting that these sites are also constitutively Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound at the physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup> level, which is higher than 4 mM.</p><p>Electrophysiological results indicated that a mutation at Mg1 abolishes Mg<sup>2+</sup> conductivity, whereas a mutation at either of the sites Mg2, Mg3, or Mg6 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hattori et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results are apparently inconsistent with the current NMR data that the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the Mg1-, Mg2-, Mg3-, and Mg6-binding sites is cooperative, i.e., the loss of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding ability at either of the Mg2-, Mg3-, or Mg6-binding site, should impair the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity of the Mg1-binding site, and therefore, should abolish the ion conductivity. This inconsistency is presumably due to the differences in the experimental conditions on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration between NMR and electrophysiological experiments. Whereas the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration is constant in an NMR sample solution, ranging from 0 to 5 mM, those in the electrophysiological experiments are 90 mM and 0.2 mM, respectively, on the extracellular and intracellular sides. Among the seven Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, the Mg1-binding site is the only one among the seven sites that lies at the extracellular side of the TM region of MgtE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that, under the condition for the electrophysiological experiments, high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration at 90 mM on the extracellular side seems to force the Mg1-binding site of the Mg2-, Mg3-, and Mg6-binding mutants to accommodate a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, leading to the channel opening of these mutants, in spite of the cooperativity revealed by NMR.</p><p>The mutation at either of the Mg2-, Mg3-, or Mg6-binding sites prevents the channel closure in the presence of 10–20 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the roles of the cooperative Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Mg1-, Mg2-, Mg3-, and Mg6-binding sites are likely to include the formation of an ion-conducting pore in the TM region mainly by the Mg1-binding site, and adjustment of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinities of the Mg4, Mg5, and Mg7 sites, enabling the CP region to act as an Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensor for gating in response to increases in intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels above 4 mM. The functional roles of each of these Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites therefore underlie the intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis mediated by MgtE.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>NMR analysis in combination with a high resolution crystal structure has provided site-specific information on changes in the protein conformation and dynamics of MgtE in relation to its function.

The Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration reaching the half maximal values in the changes ([Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>1/2</sub>) and Hill coefficients (<italic>n</italic>) were calculated using the equations<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>or<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where Δ and Δ’ are the changes in the chemical shift or the signal intensity of Ile δ1 methyl signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Patch-clamp analysis</title><p>The Mg<sup>2+</sup>-auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (BW25113 ΔmgtA ΔcorA ΔyhiD DE3) was transformed with each MgtE expressing plasmid, and maintained in growth medium supplemented with 100 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. <italic>E. coli</italic> giant spheroplasts were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hattori et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

This was a technically challenging project in which a combination of sophisticated isotopic labeling methods and methyl-TROSY methods allowed NMR spectra to be acquired for some 15 assigned isoleucine residues (spread rather evenly throughout the protein). This took quite a lot of work for a &gt;150 kDa detergent/intact channel complex. Binding was monitored examining the Mg(II)-concentration dependence of peak positions and/or intensity.

The channel is tightly regulated by Mg, and closes at Mg concentrations above 5 mM. Previous crystal structures showed that the dimeric channel contains one central Mg ion in the permeation pathway (Mg1) and 6 additional sites per subunit in three cytoplasmic regions: N-domain, CBS domain and plug helix. To address the role of the Mg binding sites, the authors employed Ile Methyl-TROSY NMR. They found that in the absence of Mg, N-domain and plug residue I260 showed high mobility. Titrating in Mg, led to changes of Ile peaks characteristics throughout the protein with EC50 varying between 0.8 and 2.5 mM, and with high Hill coefficients from 2 to 7. The authors mutated out each Mg binding site one at a time, and found Mg binding to sites Mg1, 2, 3 and 6 was essential for all conformational changes. In contrast, binding to sites Mg4, 5, and 7 was not essential for changes in TM regions, but was required for changes in N-domain, CBS domain, and plug helix (Mg 5 and 7). The authors construct a model whereby at low, but physiologically relevant Mg concentrations, Mg binds cooperatively to sites 1, 2, 3 and 6 to produce a conducting state; at higher concentrations Mg binds cooperatively to sites 4, 5 and 7, increasing interactions between N-domain and CBS and leading to channel closing. I found the work compelling even if there were some unresolved questions.</p><p>1) While the spectra of WT apo protein and Mg1 mutant in the presence of 4 mM Mg are similar as the authors state, they are not identical. The authors should discuss what are the differences and what might be their origin. In Discussion (subsection “The effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding at each site on the conformation and dynamics of MgtE”, first paragraph), the authors say that Mg binding to sites 1, 2, 3 and 6 affect Ile in TM region &quot;cooperatively&quot;. The last term is ambiguous here. In particular, the TM Ile sites show Mg-dependent changes with different EC50s and Hill coefficients, such that, for example, I397 has EC50 of 0.8 (Nhill=2.8) while I338 has EC50 of 2 mM (Nhill=5.2). The latter residue shows sensitivity more similar to residues in the N- and CBS-domains. Therefore, while Mg binding to the sites might be cooperative, the structural changes in TM region may occur in two steps (with binding of Mg to the first and second sets of binding sites). This needs to be clarified.</p><p>2) According to Figure 5E, Mg4 mutations do not affect Mg-dependent changes of I260Plug, while both Mg7 and Mg5 mutations decrease cooperativity, but not affinity. Text in the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the subsection “Role of each Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational change in MgtE” contradicts the figure (also Figure 6B, right).</p><p>3) The statement about cooperative binding to sites 4, 5, 7 is confusing. Binding to site 4 does not seem to affect the structural changes in the plug, while binding to sites 5 and 7 does.</p><p>4) Can the signal changes, such as the chemical shift changes and peaks' sharpening/appearance be interpreted in terms of changes of protein dynamics?</p><p>5) What kind of cooperative coupling is expected between the subunits in the dimer?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper on the role of the binding of seven Mg(II) ions to the microbial MgtE channel, providing the apparent Mg(II) binding affinity as well as Hill coefficients informing on binding cooperativity. This was a technically challenging project in which a combination of sophisticated isotopic labeling methods and methyl-TROSY methods allowed NMR spectra to be acquired for some 15 assigned isoleucine residues (spread rather evenly throughout the protein). This took quite a lot of work for a &gt;150 kDa detergent/intact channel complex. Binding was monitored examining the Mg(II)-concentration dependence of peak positions and/or intensity. Different peaks exhibited changes that led to different apparent Kd and Hill coefficients. Along with the results of additional NMR studies conducted using Mg(II) ion binding site mutant, this led to the realization that three of the Mg(II) sites can regarded a distinct set of site from the other 4 sites. In particular, the three sites are proposed to be responsible for stabilizing the gated form of the channel, whereas the other 4 may help stabilize the channel but also exert other structural and/or dynamic roles in modulating Mg(II) channel function. Exactly what these other roles is was a little vague. This is an admirable and difficult study that significantly advances our understanding of Mg(II) channel structure and function.

Such measurements are not reported in this paper.

These include a very high energy of dehydration, small ionic but very large hydrated radius. How ion channels and transporters move Mg<sup>2+</sup> in and out of compartments is important to understanding both the molecular mechanisms and function of this ion. The authors of this study use solution-NMR to study the dynamics of the prokaryotic Mg<sup>2+</sup> channel, MgtE. The size and helix content make this a challenging NMR target. Addressing this, the group used methyl-TROSY with specific labeling of isoleucines as reporters of channel dynamics in detergent micelles. Coupled with site directed mutagenesis of residues responsible for binding Mg<sup>2+</sup> residues (determined from previous functional and structural studies), the authors initially titrate and then use a set Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration to study what role binding plays in the dynamics of MgtE.</p><p>The authors have used NMR in previous studies to begin to address MgtE dynamics using PRE. Further, they've characterized the function of MgtE. Working from these previous studies, the authors combine this information to derive a model that asks how the dynamics of the transmembrane region, N-domain, CBS, and net cytoplasmic portion are related to the known Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites. They arrive at a model where 4 of 7 Mg<sup>2+</sup> sites act on the transmembrane domains and Plug Helix, whereas the remaining 3 of 7 Mg<sup>2+</sup> sites are principally focused on dynamics in the cytoplasmic domain. They propose a model based on the absence or presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on channel function. This is a useful finding that advances our knowledge of how the structure, dynamics and function reveal the mechanisms of Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeation in an ion channel.</p><p>Questions/concerns:</p><p>1) Physiological range – While 0.05% of dry weight mass of <italic>E. coli</italic> is Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and the estimated cellular concentrations are 30 mM, the free Mg<sup>2+</sup> is estimated to be around 0.3 mM for <italic>E. coli</italic>. How does the model in Figure 7 account for this range and for the estimated binding affinities?</p><p>2) It is suggested that the authors establish an explicit correlation between the behavior of the NMR-derived Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding behavior at the different Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of MgtE, and the know Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence of the channel open probability, as determined by electrophysiological methods (perhaps as part of Figure 5?).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Functional roles of Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in ion-dependent gating of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> channel, MgtE, revealed by solution NMR&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.
