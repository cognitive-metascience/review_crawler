The dynamics of spindle formation are determined primarily by correctly localising the MT nucleator, γ-<underline>Tu</underline>bulin <underline>R</underline>ing <underline>C</underline>omplex (γ-TuRC), within the cell. A conserved MT-associated protein complex, Augmin, recruits γ-TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs, amplifying their number, in an essential cellular phenomenon termed ‘branching’ MT nucleation. Here, we purify endogenous, GFP-tagged Augmin and γ-TuRC from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos to near homogeneity using a novel one-step affinity technique. We demonstrate that, in vitro, while Augmin alone does not affect Tubulin polymerisation dynamics, it stimulates γ-TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We also assemble and visualise the MT-Augmin-γ-TuRC-MT junction using light microscopy. Our work therefore conclusively reconstitutes branching MT nucleation. It also provides a powerful synthetic approach with which to investigate the emergence of cellular phenomena, such as mitotic spindle formation, from component parts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000737</institution-id><institution>University of Exeter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Proof of Concept</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000737</institution-id><institution>University of Exeter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Carlota Palmer PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tariq</surname><given-names>Ammarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000271</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Facilities Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Innovation Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeynes</surname><given-names>J Charlie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purification of two conserved protein complexes, the γ-TuRC and Augmin, using a simple affinity technique, demonstrates that they are necessary and sufficient for the essential phenomenon of branching microtubule nucleation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Branching MT nucleation is dependent upon Augmin and γ-TuRC and generates the bulk of MTs required for both meiotic and mitotic spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Petry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sánchez-Huertas and Lüders, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">David et al., 2019</xref>) and has been visualised in vivo in <italic>Drosophila, Xenopus</italic>, plants, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Petry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">David et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lawo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Prosser and Pelletier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). However, understanding, and in vitro reconstitution of, this phenomenon has been hampered by methodological constraints relating to purification of functional protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Song et al., 2018</xref>); Augmin is composed of 8 subunits, while the γ-TuRC is a ~ 2 MD protein complex containing multiple copies of at least six proteins, including 14 molecules of γ-Tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tovey and Conduit, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oegema et al., 1999</xref>). In vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oegema et al., 1999</xref>) generally use proteins that have been individually- or co-expressed and purified in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>), where folding and post translational modifications crucial to function may not occur. Although purification of protein complexes from autogenous cells can be achieved using affinity-based methods, non-specific binding of contaminating proteins and difficulties in releasing purified proteins from affinity matrices are major problems.</p><p>We therefore developed an approach to allow the isolation of intact, functional Augmin and γ-TuRC, to test the hypothesis that these two complexes are necessary and sufficient for branched MT nucleation. The approach is based on biotinylated, amine-reactive thiol- or photo-cleavable linkers, Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and PC-Biotin-NHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Stepwise incubation of the ~12 kD camelid anti-GFP nanobody, GFP-binding protein, with either of these linkers resulted in covalent linkage, while subsequent incubation with a Streptavidin Agarose matrix led to stable tri-partite reagents – GFP-TRAP-Sulfo beads and GFP-TRAP-PC beads; where GFP-binding protein is immobilised, but cleavable through the addition of DTT or exposure to UV light, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of functional γ-TuRC and Augmin using cleavable affinity purification.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sketch of purification methodology.

Individual beads fluoresced with varying intensity and, upon brief exposure to 50 mM DTT or UV light, fluorescence decreased, concomitant with an increase in the surrounding medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

We have previously shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Augmin can be purified from extracts of early embryos expressing a GFP-tagged variant of the Msd1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos have also been used to purify the γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oegema et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>), and flies expressing γ-Tubulin-GFP are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hallen et al., 2008</xref>). As branching MT nucleation is essential during mitosis, we used embryos arrested in a metaphase-like state through incubation with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chesnel et al., 2006</xref>). Both Msd1-GFP and γ-Tubulin-GFP were efficiently immobilised on GFP-TRAP-Sulfo or GFP-TRAP-PC beads and western blotting confirmed that, upon cleaving, Msd1-GFP and γ-Tubulin-GFP were concentrated in the eluate, with other subunits of the complexes co-eluting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). To test the purity of the complexes, we subjected MG132-treated (mitotic) control (OrR), Msd1-GFP or γ-Tubulin-GFP embryo extracts to GFP-TRAP-Sulfo cl-AP followed by gel electrophoresis and SYPRO-ruby staining of eluates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Bands corresponding to each subunit of both Augmin and γ-TuRC were identified at intensities expected for the known stoichiometric relationships between subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oegema et al., 1999</xref>). One additional set of low intensity bands was seen in all eluates, at ~45 kD; almost certainly corresponding to yolk proteins - the most abundant proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnett et al., 1980</xref>). Importantly, γ-Tubulin did not co-purify with Augmin, and Dgt3 (a subunit of the Augmin complex) did not co-purify with γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Moreover, sucrose gradient analysis undertaken on purified mitotic complexes determined that Msd1-GFP sedimented as expected for Augmin-GFP (~360 kD) and that γ-Tubulin-GFP sedimented in two populations – one consistent with γ-Tubulin-GFP alone and one consistent with incorporation into the γ-TuRC (2MD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Neither complex co-fractionated, again strongly suggesting that Augmin and γ-TuRC are purified independently of one another, or other cellular activities.</p><p>Both γ-TuRC and Augmin bind MTs in co-sedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wainman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore incubated mitotic Augmin-GFP or γ-TuRC-GFP with purified Tubulin, in the presence of GTP and taxol to promote MT polymerisation, sedimenting through a glycerol cushion to separate MTs and MT associated proteins from soluble Tubulin and non-MT binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). As expected, both Msd1-GFP and γ-Tubulin-GFP co-sedimented with MTs, demonstrating purified Augmin and γ-TuRC maintain at least some of their cellular properties.</p><p>To assess the effects of purified Augmin and γ-TuRC on MT nucleation and polymerisation, we used a highly-reproducible quantitative assay, where incorporation of a dye into MTs as they polymerise is measured as a change in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonne et al., 1985</xref>) (Cytoskeleton Inc). Incubation of Tubulin in the presence of GTP and glycerol at 37°C resulted in its polymerisation over ~1 hr, with sigmoidal dynamics corresponding to lag, nucleation, polymerisation and plateau phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The time at which 50% of polymerisation was achieved (x50) was 31.5mins (± 0.5 mins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Addition of purified γ-TuRC-GFP stimulated MT nucleation, causing a shift in the polymerisation curve and a reduction in the x50 to 16.5 mins (± 1.2 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>), confirming its functionality. In contrast, addition of purified Augmin-GFP had no significant effect on the shape of the polymerisation curve or the x50 (32.5 mins (± 1.5 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Therefore, although Augmin-GFP binds MTs it does not, in isolation, change MT nucleation/polymerisation dynamics. However, addition of Augmin-GFP dramatically enhanced γ-TuRC-dependent nucleation of MTs, further reducing the x50 to 9.5 min (± 0.45 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). This effect was specific for the physical interaction between Augmin and γ-TuRC, as addition of bacterially expressed and purified truncated Augmin subunits, Dgt3, Dgt5 and Dgt6, which we previously demonstrated interact directly with γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), resulted in nucleation/polymerisation curves indistinguishable to γ-TuRC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, purified Augmin does, indeed, augment γ-TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Pure Augmin enhances γ-TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in a cell cycle dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Tubulin polymerisation assays, where fluorescence is directly related to the amount of Tubulin polymer present.

However, when incubated together, either mitotic γ-TuRC and cycling Augmin or cycling γ-TuRC and mitotic Augmin were able to enhance MT nucleation to the same extent as both mitotic complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As cell cycle dependent changes in protein function are determined mostly by post-translational modifications (PTMs), this observation suggests that PTMs of either Augmin or γ-Tubulin are crucial in vivo.</p><p>To characterise the morphology of MTs generated in the presence of purified mitotic Augmin and γ-TuRC, we initially took samples from the in vitro assays at t = 15 min, fixing and imaging them via fluorescence microscopy. Control samples, or those containing purified Augmin, showed only very few, short MTs per field of view while, as expected, γ-TuRC-containing samples possessed many individual MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In contrast, samples incubated simultaneously with γ-TuRC and Augmin showed extensive MT branching, bundling and nesting, rather than individual MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the observation that, in vivo, Augmin is required for γ-Tubulin localisation to the mitotic spindle, purified mitotic Augmin was able to recruit purified γ-TuRC to MTs in vitro, co-localising along the length of MTs in distinct punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To temporally resolve the MT nucleation and polymerisation in the presence of Augmin and γ-TuRC, we fixed reactions at earlier timepoints. Even within 1 min of the simultaneous addition of Augmin and γ-TuRC, MT nucleation and putative branching were observed, though background fluorescence of soluble tubulin was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Samples taken at t = 2 and t = 5 min showed similar numbers of MTs to each other, per field of view, though the mean length of MTs, and proportion of MTs with branches, were significantly greater after 5 min, than after 2 min (4.01 μm versus 3.24 μm and 34% versus 24%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This suggests that MT nucleation from purified γ-TuRCs reaches maximal activity within the first few minutes of the assay. Moreover, the estimated number of γ-TuRCs per coverslip (6.0 x 10<sup>6</sup>) was 2-3 times less than the mean number of MTs per coverslip (1.7 x 10<sup>7</sup>) (see Materials and methods). These calculations suggest ﻿﻿either (i) that our approximations of γ-TuRC molarity are out by a factor of 2-3, (ii) that the MTs counted include a proportion that have been nucleated by a γ-TuRC and subsequently broken or (iii) that a single γ-TuRC is able to nucleate multiple MTs at a rate of &gt;1 MT/min, perhaps by nucleation and subsequent release.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of the MT-Augmin-γ-TuRC-MT junction.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Confocal images of fixed, fluorescent polymerisation assays at t = 15 mins for each condition.

To do this, we generated populations of taxol-stabilised fluorescent MTs in the presence or absence of individual mitotic protein complexes, subsequently co-incubating them. Co-incubation of HiLyte Fluor 488-MTs (<sup>488</sup>MTs) with Rhodamine-MTs (<sup>Rhod</sup>MTs) resulted in independent populations of MTs. Occasional examples of <sup>Rhod</sup>MTs terminating at <sup>488</sup>MTs were observed, but at a frequency consistent with random placement of MTs on coverslips (~6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Although the polarity and angles of the <sup>Rhod</sup>MTs branches in relation to the ‘mother’ <sup>488</sup>MTs varied far more widely than seen in vivo, presumably due to how the MTs settled on the coverslip during preparation, we found a bias in the angle, similar to that seen in living <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Verma and Maresca, 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). To unequivocally demonstrate the polarity of the MTs, and to take into account MTs that might have lost their native γ-TuRC-bound minus end during sample preparation, we formed these junctions in the presence of pre-stabilised HiLyte 647-labelled GMPCPP MT seeds. As expected, the polarity of the interaction between γ-TuRC-<sup>Rhod</sup>MTs and Augmin-<sup>488</sup>MTs was specific; with only the minus ends of γ-TuRC-<sup>Rhod</sup>MTs precisely terminating at the Augmin-<sup>488</sup>MTs lateral surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

Finally, we found that the formation of junctions on Augmin-containing <sup>488</sup>MTs was length independent – branches were equally distributed at the very distal MT tips, throughout their length and on the GMPCPP seed itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Our work confirms a long-standing hypothesis, first articulated to explain the loss of γ-Tubulin on the mitotic spindle when the expression of Augmin subunits is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>). It demonstrates conclusively that Augmin directly recruits γ-TuRC to MTs and that these two protein complexes are sufficient for robust and efficient branching MT nucleation. Although our calculations suggest that 65% of the mitotic γ-TuRCs are competent to bind MT minus ends and Augmin, and that they are able to nucleate at a rate of &gt;1 MT/min, we expect that, in vivo, other proteins further enhance these γ-TuRC activities. For example, a clear role has been reported for the MT associated protein, TPX2, in stimulating Augmin-dependent branched MT nucleation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> meiotic extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Petry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thawani et al., 2019</xref>).

More broadly, cleavable affinity purification provides the basis to generate more complex, but molecularly defined, mixes of purified proteins, complete with in vivo PTMs, in order to reconstitute higher-order aspects of spindle formation. Indeed, by isolating and combining purified, active proteins and protein complexes from any biological system of interest, &quot;cl-AP TRAP&quot; overcomes the limitations of traditional ‘bottom-up’ approaches, allowing exploration of the level of biological organisation between individual protein and biological process – the level at which emergence of cellular phenomena often occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> husbandry and embryo collection</title><p>Flies were kept on standard medium and grown according to standard laboratory procedures. w1118 or Oregon R (OrR) strains (Bloomington Stock Center) were utilized as a wild-type controls.

A one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the four variables (control, Augmin, γ-TuRC, and Augmin+γ-TuRC), with each variable having six repeats. A <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey test showed that all variables were significantly different from each other at p=0.001 apart from the control and Augmin, which were not significantly different from each other. Similar analyses were undertaken for the comparison of polymerisation datasets between complexes isolated from MG132 and cycling embryos, and the augmenting activity of Augmin in the presence of truncated Dgt3, Dgt5 and Dgt6 proteins. All fitting and analyses were performed in MATLAB.

eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Branching microtubule nucleation from the lateral surface of pre-existing microtubules has emerged as an important nucleation mechanism contributing, for example, to mitotic and meiotic spindle assembly and to microtubule organization in post-mitotic neurons. In this manuscript the authors show that the previously identified main players, augmin and γ-TuRC, purified as native protein complexes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extract, are sufficient to reconstitute branching nucleation in vitro. It is further shown that augmin stimulates γ-TuRC nucleation activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner. These are important conceptual advances in our understanding of fundamental cell biological processes. By establishing the minimally required components and revealing a regulatory activity, this manuscript also provides the framework and tools for further analyses in future studies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;in vitro reconstitution of branched microtubule nucleation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jens Lüders as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper &quot;in vitro reconstitution of branched microtubule nucleation&quot; by Tariq et al. presents the biochemical reconstitution of microtubule nucleation from the lattice of pre-existing microtubules. Using affinity purification from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extract the study suggests that purified augmin and γ-TuRC, two multi-subunit protein complexes previously implicated in branching nucleation, are sufficient for this activity.</p><p>The reconstitution of branching nucleation from purified proteins is a major achievement. A weakness of the study is that the visualization of branched nucleation in fixed samples is not very convincing and that the authors have never looked at the branching nucleation process by real-time imaging; it would have been a doable experiment assuming the authors had access to a TIRF microscope. On the other hand, all reviewers agree that a unique aspect of this study is that, by collecting embryos in mitosis and interphase, the authors directly compared the augmin and γ-TuRC activities of both phases. This is not easily achievable by approaches utilizing recombinant proteins. Moreover, the finding that augmin stimulates γ-TuRC dependent nucleation would also be an important contribution to our understanding of branching nucleation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In summary, while the study represents an important advance, it is not fully convincing in its current form. The authors need to improve the quality of the branching nucleation assay, include quality controls for the purified protein complexes and provide an estimate of the efficiency of the reconstitution. This is crucial since reconstitution with low efficiency may indicate that an important factor is missing.</p><p>1) The demonstration of reconstituted branching nucleation in Figure 3A needs to be improved. Tubulin appears to form aggregates rather than clear branches. If real-time imaging cannot be provided, another possibility is to perform the assay on pre-assembled MTs. These could be labeled in one color and then, after addition of augmin and γ-TuRC, the nucleated branches could be labeled with tubulin of a different color.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to &quot;pure&quot; proteins, for example &quot;pure Augmin.&quot; However, none of the protein reagents are pure as would be revealed by analysis by mass spectrometry. Therefore &quot;pure&quot; should be replaced with &quot;purified&quot; or &quot;enriched.&quot; Following the same reasoning, the statement – &quot;It demonstrates conclusively that Augmin directly recruits γ-TuRC to MTs and that these two protein complexes are sufficient for the phenomenon of branched MT nucleation.&quot; cannot be made. This issue could be potentially resolved by demonstrating a high efficiency of the reconstitution (see point 3 below) and by ensuring the quality of the purified complexes. The authors should at least show that they purify complexes of the expectd size (e.g. by gel filtration or sucrose gradient analysis) and also probe purified augmin with γ-TuRC antibodies and purified γ-TuRC with augmin antibodies to exclude significant co-purification. It is also important to compare size and composition of preparations from the two different cell cycle stages that are used in the assays. Gels are only shown for &quot;interphase&quot; augmin and γ-TuRC.</p><p>3) Please indicate protein concentrations used in each experiment in a reader-friendly manner (provide nM or µM instead of providing volume and mass). The authors should provide an estimate of the efficiency of the branched nucleation, the fraction of γ-TuRC that is active.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;in vitro reconstitution of branching microtubule nucleation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have evaluated your revisions and have noted that an important issue raised in the first round of review was not addressed. It concerns the estimation of the specific activity of gTuRC in the branching nucleation assay (assay in Figure 3A). As outlined in the previous decision letter and in the follow-up clarification, the reviewers feel that without this information it is difficult to assess if the reconstituted system is complete. It seems that in your revision you have provided an alternative quantification, the efficiency of branch site formation from preformed MT/augmin and MT/gTuRC complexes. However, this is not a measure of the gTuRC nucleation activity.</p><p>Before coming to a decision, we would like to ask if you can obtain this data and add it to your revised manuscript?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49769.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In summary, while the study represents an important advance, it is not fully convincing in its current form.

We therefore spent significant time over the last two months developing an alternative live branching assay, in collaboration with Remy Chait, a recently appointed Living Systems Institute lecturer in microfluidics. We are encouraged by our progress but, unfortunately, we are not yet at a point at which we can robustly image branched nucleation using our purified components to the quality expected for <italic>eLife</italic>. We also contacted Thomas Surrey, with whom we have had conversations in the past about live imaging of MTs. However, given Thomas’ imminent move to Barcelona, he was unable to assist in the timeframe required.</p><p>As an alternative, we have, therefore, re-performed the fixed analysis of dynamic branched MT nucleation, taking samples at 1, 2 and 5 minutes after initiation, fixing with glutaraldehyde and imaging. We believe these images, now incorporated into a revised Figure 3 (Figure 3B), very clearly demonstrate the progressive morphological changes of MT nucleation, showing MT branching within 2 minutes of simultaneous addition of Augmin and γ-TuRC, and leading nicely on to the latter panels, where we used pre-assembled fixed MTs and both two and three colour imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to &quot;pure&quot; proteins, for example &quot;pure Augmin.&quot; However, none of the protein reagents are pure as would be revealed by analysis by mass spectrometry.

As requested, we have undertaken sucrose gradient analysis for each of the two purified complexes, Augmin and γ-TuRC, for each cell cycle stage and probed purified complexes to exclude significant co-purification of Augmin and γ -TuRC. We present these in a revised Figure 1. So, in Figure 1D, we now include western blots of MG132 (mitotic) Augmin and γ-TuRC purifications, probed with reciprocal antibodies. This clearly demonstrates that subunits of neither complex co-purify with each other. In addition, in Figure 1F, we show the results of sucrose gradients undertaken from MG132 (mitotic) Augmin and γ-TuRC purifications, probed with anti-GFP. These results show that Msd1-GFP sediments as expected for Augmin-GFP (~360kD) and that γ-Tubulin-GFP sediments in two populations – one consistent with γ-Tubulin-GFP alone and one consistent with incorporation into the γ-TuRC (2MD). Neither overlap with each other, again strongly suggesting that these two complexes are purified independently – and independently of additional activities. We now mention these results in the text.</p><p>We have undertaken similar sucrose gradients for Augmin and γ-TuRC purified from interphase/cycling embryos. As they show similar profiles and as our focus here is on the activity of mitotic Augmin and γ-TuRC we have chosen not to show these in the Figure. If the reviewers feel it is important to show the similar sucrose gradient profiles, we will incorporate those panels into a further Supplementary Figure.</p><p>Finally, to clarify, the SYPRO-ruby gels shown in Figure 1 are for the “mitotic” Augmin and γ-TuRC, not interphase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please indicate protein concentrations used in each experiment in a reader-friendly manner (provide nM or µM instead of providing volume and mass).</p></disp-quote><p>Within the manuscript text, we have now provided the estimated protein concentrations used in each experiment in nM. We have also provided a summary of how we arrived at these concentrations within the Materials and methods, and a detailed explanation the calculations as Materials and methods subsection &quot;Calculation of the molarity of Augmin and γ-TuRC following Cl<sup>-</sup>AP&quot;. The sucrose gradient results (now shown in Figure 1F; see point above) were used to determine the proportion of Msd1-GFP and γ-Tubulin-GFP incorporated into Augmin and γ-TuRC respectively. For purified Augmin, protein concentration can be directly arrived at through comparison with the concentration of GFP moiety, as all the Msd1-GFP was found to be incorporated in a complex of the expected size of Augmin. This provides an estimate of purified Augmin concentration of 300nM.</p><p>However, estimation of the concentration of γ-TuRC requires both an estimation of the proportion of γ-Tubulin-GFP incorporated into γ-TuRC – obtained from the sucrose gradients (~60% in TuRC and 40% monomeric) – and an estimation of the number of molecules of γ-Tubulin-GFP within the γ-TuRCs. Purified γ-TuRCs contain ~14 molecules of γ-Tubulin. As the γ-Tubulin-GFP expressing embryos also express endogenous γ-Tubulin, the γ-TuRCs isolated by Cl<sup>-</sup>AP will be heterogeneous. We have now included a western blot of post-cleaved eluate isolated from γ-Tubulin-GFP expressing embryos, probed with anti- g-Tubulin antibodies (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). This provides an estimate that ~75% of the γ-Tubulin is present as γ-Tubulin-GFP while 25% is present as γ-Tubulin with no tag. Therefore we estimate that the purified γ-TuRCs contain, on average, 8-10 molecules of γ-Tubulin-GFP and 4-5 molecules of unlabelled γ-Tubulin. Therefore, we estimate the molar concentration of γ-TuRC purified by Cl<sup>-</sup>AP under the conditions described, as 300nM x 0.6/9 = 20nM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide an estimate of the efficiency of the branched nucleation, the fraction of γ-TuRC that is active.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the co-incubation of taxol stabilised Alexa488-MTs + mitotic Augmin with Rhod-MTs + mitotic γ-TuRC, reported in our original Figure (B,C,F), provides us with the perfect experiment with which to answer this question. Based on the concentrations of the protein complexes in our assay and the number of MTs per field of view, we predict that every Rhod-MT minus end should have a γ-TuRC bound to it, and that Augmin-dependent γ-TuRC binding sites on Alexa488 MTs are in excess. Therefore, the ratio of Rhod-MTs terminating precisely at an Alexa488 MT against the total number of Rhod-MTs provides an estimate of the fraction of γ-TuRCs that are active (where activity is defined as the ability of a γ-TuRC to simultaneously bind Augmin and the minus end of a MT). We have modified Figure 3D – the histogram that originally detailed the% of Alexa488 MTs with Rhod MT branches; it now measures and represents the% of Rhod MTs that terminate at an Alexa488 MT.</p><p>This quantification demonstrates that, in the presence of Alexa488-MTs+Augmin, 55% of Rhod-MTs+γ-TuRC form branches. Moreover, when repeated using the Alexa633-GMPCPP-MT seeds, labelling the minus ends of the Rhod MTs, the percentage increases to 64%. This probably reflects a proportion of Rhod MTs that break during the preparation process, losing their native γ-TuRC-bound minus end. Thus, we conclude that the fraction of γ−TuRC that is active in our assays is at least 64%.</p><p>We have altered the manuscript to reflect the above result, commenting that while it is still possible that other proteins in the cell either further enhance the ability of g-TuRC to bind Augmin, or increase the dynamics with which it is able to nucleate MTs, it is clear that mitotic γ-TuRC, isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos using Cl<sup>-</sup>AP is sufficient for robust and efficient branched MT nucleation in vitro.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have evaluated your revisions and have noted that an important issue raised in the first round of review was not addressed.

However, this is not a measure of the gTuRC nucleation activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewers that we would count the number of MTs nucleated in the gTuRC+Augmin polymerisation assay at early timepoints, specifically t=2 and t=5 minutes. These would then directly correlate with the panels shown in Figure 3B from our previously revised manuscript. Given that, in our initial Response, we estimated the number of gTuRCs per ul of eluate, we could then relate the number of gTuRCs per field of view, with the number of MTs nucleated in that field of view. This would give a measure of nucleation activity.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Measuring the number of MTs at t=2 mins of the polymerisation assay</p><p>We obtained data from 10 fields of view from both t=2 and t=5 minutes in the polymerisation assay, counting the number of MTs using Image J. We also manually counted the number of branching MTs, providing this as a percentage of total MTs. Finally, we used Image J to automatically segment and measure the length of the MTs at each time point.</p><p>We describe this experiment in a revised section:</p><p>“Samples taken at t=2 and t=5 minutes showed similar numbers of MTs to each other, per field of view, though the mean length of MTs, and proportion of MTs with branches, were significantly greater after 5 minutes, than after 2 minutes (3.24 μm versus 4.01 μm and 34% versus 24%, respectively) (Figure 3B; Figure 3—source data 1). This suggests that MT nucleation from purified γ-TuRCs reaches maximal activity within the first few minutes of the assay”.</p><p>In the Materials and methods under “Image and Image analysis”, we detail how the above values were measured.</p><p>In the raw tabular data file, we now add the measurements within a new, appropriately labelled, sheet. We have also edited the legend for this file.</p><p>Measuring the activity of the purified gTuRCs</p><p>We then go on to use these values to calculate the activity of the gTuRCs, in the following manner:</p><p>In our previously revised manuscript, we calculated the number of molecules of GFP per ul of Cl<sup>-</sup>AP eluate (8.5ng) as 1.8x1011. We used this to estimate the number of molecules of purified g-TuRC, taking into account that ~9 of the g-Tubulin molecules in a purified TuRC is present as GFP-g-Tubulin (via Western blotting) and that 60% of the GFP-g-Tubulin purified is present as part of g-TuRCs (via sucrose gradient fractionation).</p><p>Therefore, we estimate that the number of molecules of g-TuRC in 1 μl of eluate is 1.8x1011 x 0.6/9 = 1.2x1010</p><p>In our polymerisation assay, we added 5 μl of GFP-g-TuRC eluate to a 50 μl final volume. At t=2 and t=5, we then took 1 μl of this reaction mix and diluted into 200 μl of glutaraldehyde fixative. We then spotted 1 μl of this onto a coverslip. Therefore, the number of g-TuRCs on the coverslip can be estimated as (1.2x1010 x 5)/1000 = 6.0x106.</p><p>Given that there was an average of 130 MTs in a field of view at t=2 mins and that the field of view was 60.5 μm2, the 22 mm2 coverslip contains ~1.32x105 fields of view; equating to 1.7x107 MTs per coverslip.</p><p>Therefore, within 2 minutes of incubation, 6.0x106 g-TuRCs are able to nucleate 61.7x107 MTs. We state this in two ways in the manuscript: (i) that one TuRC is capable of nucleating 2-3 MTs within 2 minutes, (ii) purified TuRCs nucleate MTs in the assay at ~1MT/min.</p><p>We now say: “To calculate this activity, we related the estimated number of γ-TuRCs per field of view to the mean number of MTs (see Materials and methods), These calculations suggest that a single γ-TuRC is able to nucleate multiple (2-3) MTs within 2 minutes (i.e. a rate of &gt;1MT/min).”</p><p>In the final discussion, we state: “Although our calculations suggest that 65% of the mitotic g-TuRCs are competent to bind MT minus ends and Augmin, and that they are able to nucleate at a rate of &gt; 1MT/min, we expect that, in vivo, other proteins either further enhance these γ-TuRC activities.”</p><p>In the Materials and methods, we add a section headed: “Estimation of the nucleation efficienct of purified g-TuRC in vitro”, providing the detailed calculations above.</p><p>We very much hope that the reviewers will look positively on this additional data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
