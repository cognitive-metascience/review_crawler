However, the generation of functional human GIN subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has not been established. By expressing LHX6, a transcriptional factor that is critical for GIN development, we induced hPSCs to form GINs, including somatostatin (SST, 29%) and parvalbumin (PV, 21%) neurons. Our RNAseq results also confirmed the alteration of GIN identity with the overexpression of <italic>LHX6</italic>. Five months after transplantation into the mouse brain, the human GABA precursors generated increased population of SST and PV neurons by overexpressing <italic>LHX6</italic>. Importantly, the grafted human GINs exhibited functional electrophysiological properties and even fast-spiking-like action potentials. Thus, expression of the single transcription factor LHX6 under our GIN differentiation condition is sufficient to robustly induce human PV and SST subtypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>direct differentiation</kwd><kwd>PV neuron</kwd><kwd>SST neuron</kwd><kwd>HiPSCs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81471301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFC1306703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jiangsu Outstanding Young Investigator Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BK20160044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ShanghaiTech Start-up Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Shuijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program XDA16010306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inducing expression of a single transcription factor LIM homeobox 6 showed efficient generation of human parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GABAergic interneurons (GINs) form the major inhibitory system in the mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>). There are many subtypes of cortical GINs that are differentiated on the basis of the expression of molecular markers, including calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), and somatostatin (SST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>). PV interneurons display a chandelier or basket morphology andÂ have a fast-spiking property. They are essential for regulating emotion and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). SST interneurons are characterized as Martinotti or non-Martinotti in morphology and play important roles in reducing epileptic form activity andÂ in facilitating motor and spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yavorska and Wehr, 2016</xref>). Dysfunction of PV and SST interneurons is involved in neurological and psychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MarÃ­n, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hashimoto et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, theÂ availability of human PV and SST GINs is important for cell-replacement treatment and for studies of disease etiology.</p><p>Cortical GINs are primarily derived from theÂ MGE (medial ganglionic eminence), which is located in the ventral forebrain during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kelsom and Lu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). The developmental process is orchestrated by a cascade of transcription factors, including DLX2, DLX5, NKX2.1, and LHX6, which is induced by theÂ morphogen Sonic hedgehog (SHH) that is secreted by theÂ notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kelsom and Lu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2005</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liodis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flandin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Du et al., 2008</xref>). On the basis of this principle, approaches have been developed for generating human GINs from hPSCs by efficiently inducing MGE progenitors using sonic hedgehog (SHH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>), or SHHÂ together with telencephalic inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nicholas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). However, GINs expressing SST and PV are usually generated only after 100 days and relied on co-culture with rodent cortical neurons/astrocytes and cell sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nicholas et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, GINs have also beenÂ generated by overexpressing transcription factors, such as Ascl1 and Dlx2. Again, however, the populations of SST(~9%) and PV neurons are very low after 5 weeks of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, efficient generation of human PV and SST interneurons from hPSCs is desirable for disease modeling using patientÂ induced pluripotent stem cellsÂ ( iPSCs).</p><p>In this study, we established human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and iPSC lines with inducible expression of <italic>LHX6</italic>. Differentiation of transgenic <italic>LHX6</italic> hPSCs to GINs under our established GIN differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>) significantly increased the percentage of PV and SST interneuron subtypes within 80 days when LHX6 is induced. Importantly, the PV and SST neurons thatÂ wereÂ generated following transplantation into the mouse brain exhibit increased population sizeÂ and aÂ fast-spiking-like electrophysiological property.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of inducible <italic>LHX6</italic> overexpressing hPSC cell lines</title><p>We first established a human ESC (H9) line and an iPSC line (ihtc) with inducible expression of <italic>LHX6</italic> by inserting,Â usingÂ TALEN-mediated targeting, a tet-on inducible cassette into the AAVS1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qian et al., 2014</xref>). After electroporation, transgenic LHX6 hPSCs were selected by puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The transgenic colonies showed a morphology similar to that of the parental PSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). For theÂ H9 cell line, 14 colonies were selected by puromycin treatment.

After floating for 7 days, EBs were attached on vitronectin-coated surfaces. Rosette structures could be observed at day 10â16. At day 16, rosette clones were detached manually with a 1 ml pipette. Non-neuroepithelial clones were removed at this stage. Neurospheres were continuously floated in NIM and then dissociated by TrypLE (Life Technologies) and plated on vitronectin (Life Technologies) and poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) pre-coated coverslips for further neuronal differentiation. For dorsal differentiation, no morphogen was added. For ventral differentiation, 500 nM SAG was added from day 10 to day 25.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Induction of human SST and PV neurons by expressing a single transcription factor <italic>LHX6</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Yuan et al. describe the generation of somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) GABAergic interneurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) using a directed differentiation approach based on overexpression of <italic>LHX6</italic>. These two types of interneurons play significant roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders, so the availability of a cell culture model system to study their function could represent an important advance in the field. It has been difficult to produce these types of interneurons using either reprogramming or directed differentiation of hPSC. The authors describe a relatively efficient system for production of the cells, and characterize the neurons through RNA-seq, immunofluorescence microscopy, transplantation in vivo and electrophysiological recording.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection â<italic>LHX6</italic> promotes the generation of GINsâ Figure 2B â what are the actual proportions of these cell types in control cultures?</p><p>2) Subsection â<italic>LHX6</italic> promotes the generation of GINsâ Figure 2B â the cell types that were counted make up at most 40% of the total. Do the authors know what the remaining cells represent?</p><p>3) Figure 2D â what proportions of SST and PV positive cells develop the characteristic morphology as shown?</p><p>4) Figure 4 â were the controls for this study ventralised with SAG?</p><p>5) Subsection âGrafted neurons display characteristic firing patterns in vivoâ â a reference to the electrophysiological properties of SST and PV neurons is missing.</p><p>6) &quot;For neural differentiation, hPSCs were detached by dispase</p><p>(Life Technologies) to form embryoid bodies (EBs) and then cultured in neural induction medium (NIM) as previously described.&quot; What is the reference?</p><p>7) &quot;dox was added at 3 Î¼g/mL on day 10&quot; â was this continued or just a one-day treatment? It is mentioned that in some experiments dox was continued from day 10 to day 25, but for some other experiments it is not clear.</p><p>8) &quot;hPSC-derived progenitors were broken into little clusters with diameters of around 30 Î¼m 2-3 days before transplantation&quot;. This statement needs clarification as to what is meant by &quot;broken into&quot; â was this done at a passage, what exactly was the procedure?</p><p>On a related note, are the cells mitotic, and if so for how, after forced <italic>Lhx6</italic> expression? While it has not been definitively shown for human, in mice <italic>Lhx6</italic>+ cells are post-mitotic and thus would not be referred to as &quot;progenitors&quot;, but could be referred to as post-mitotic precursors.</p><p>9) &quot;The injection site was located at the basal forebrain.&quot; This needs to be defined more precisely with coordinates.</p><p>10) The specificity of the <italic>Lhx6</italic> antibody needs to be established. Same for the <italic>Foxg1</italic> antibody, and the hN antibody.</p><p>11) Figure 3H. and also text referring to Figure 2. There is nothing distinctly chandelier like about dendritic morphology. The chandelier interneuron is defined by its distinctive axo-axonic targeting onto the initial segment of pyramidal neuron axons. Unless axo-axonic targeting is shown any mention of chandelier cell in results in a misrepresentation of the data.</p><p>12) Figure 5. What was the protocol used in this experiment regarding duration and timing of dox?</p><p>13) Where are the cells â in striatum? There are PV+ and <italic>Lhx6</italic>+ GABA projection neurons in the globus pallidus â could some of these transplanted cells have this fate?</p><p>14) The histology in Figure 5 looks odd â it seems that nearly all cells in the field express hN, but if these were &quot;real&quot; mge-like interneuron precursors they should migrate and disperse. Perhaps they need to try making transplants earlier in the protocol? Place them in the neocortex?</p><p>15) The trace in Figure 6 appears to be about 20Hz. This is not typically considered fast-spiking, which should be 40+ Hz in vitro.</p><p>16) It seems as though cells were cultured without pyramidal neurons. If that is the case any apparent PV expression is a bit hard to interpret since PV is at least partially activity dependent, depending on NMDA activation and ERBB4, for example, which one might not expect to see in monocultures of GABA cells.

In our system, activity could at least come from three ways: (1) since GABA is excitable in the newborn neurons (Ben-Ari, 2002, Nat Rev Neurosci3(9): 728-739; Rivera, Voipio et al. 1999, Nature, 397: 251), GABAergic synapses that form among interneurons are the driver for neural activity; (2) our data showed that newly generated interneurons displayed a relative more positive resting membrane potential (around 40 mV, Figure 6B), where neurons could get excited more easily; (3) vGlut1 staining of day120 cells in V-LHX6 OE group revealed that there was a small amount of excitatory inputs in our system which could trigger the PV activity (less than 1%).</p><fig id="respfig7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37382.021</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>V-<italic>LHX6</italic> OE neurons also received a small amount of excitatory inputs by vGlut1.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37382-resp-fig7-v2"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
