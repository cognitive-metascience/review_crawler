Here, using large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening, we find that KDM3A, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and di-demethylase, plays a pivotal role in anoikis induction. In attached breast epithelial cells, <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression is maintained at low levels by integrin signaling. Following detachment, integrin signaling is decreased resulting in increased <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>KDM3A</italic> substantially reduces apoptosis following detachment and, conversely, ectopic expression of <italic>KDM3A</italic> induces cell death in attached cells. We find that KDM3A promotes anoikis through transcriptional activation of <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic>, which encode pro-apoptotic proteins. Using mouse models of breast cancer metastasis we show that knockdown of <italic>Kdm3a</italic> enhances metastatic potential. Finally, we find defective <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16844.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16844.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16844.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Epithelial cells line the inside of blood vessels, intestines and other organs throughout the body. Any epithelial cells that become detached from their natural surroundings die by a process called anoikis (a Greek word meaning “being without a home”). This process has an important role in preventing cancer from spreading around the body because it eliminates cells that are not in their proper environment. However, some cancers that start from epithelial cells, such as breast cancer, develop resistance to anoikis. Gaining a better understanding of the cellular factors that regulate anoikis, and how resistance develops, may reveal new drug targets for the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>Previous studies found proteins called BIM and BMF promote anoikis by inducing cell suicide. However, it is possible that other factors can also promote this process in different ways. Pedanou et al. performed a large-scale genetic screen in human breast epithelial cells and identified several new factors that promote anoikis.</p><p>Inside our cells, DNA is packaged around proteins called histones, which can influence whether a gene is switched on or off. One of the factors Pedanou et al. identified is a protein called KDM3A that can remove small chemical groups (known as methyl groups) from histones – a process that is known to switch on genes. Further experiments show that epithelial cells in their natural surroundings only produce low levels of KDM3A, but that the levels of this protein increase if these cells become detached. This promotes anoikis by activating two genes called <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> that induce cell suicide. However, KDM3A levels are low in human breast cancers, which suggests that these cancers become resistant to anoikis by preventing increases in KDM3A production.</p><p>Using a mouse model of breast cancer, Pedanou et al. found that switching off KDM3A in cancer cells increases their ability to move around the body. Collectively, these findings reveal a new mechanism that triggers anoikis in normal breast epithelial cells and is disabled during breast cancer development. Future challenges are to identify factors that directly regulate the production of KDM3A, and to understand how these factors are manipulated in breast cancer cells to cause anoikis resistance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16844.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16844.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>anoikis</kwd><kwd>BNIP3</kwd><kwd>BNIP3L</kwd><kwd>KDM3A</kwd><kwd>histone demethylase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM033977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>068101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BC060871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A large-scale RNA interference screen uncovers a new transcriptional regulatory program involving the histone H3 demethylase KDM3A, which mediates detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) in breast epithelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial cells that lose attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM), or attach to an inappropriate ECM, undergo a specialized form of apoptosis called anoikis. Anoikis has an important role in preventing oncogenesis, particularly metastasis, by eliminating cells that lack proper ECM cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>). Anoikis also functions to prevent the invasion of tumor cells into the luminal space, which is a hallmark of epithelial tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>). In general, epithelial-derived cancers, such as breast cancer, develop resistance to anoikis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schwartz, 1997</xref>). Several signaling pathways have been shown to regulate anoikis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Paoli et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, anoikis is suppressed by integrin signaling, which functions through focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an activator of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">King et al., 1997</xref>). FAK signaling is active in attached cells and is inactive following detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frisch et al., 1996</xref>). Anoikis is also suppressed by integrin-mediated, ligand independent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moro et al., 1998</xref>), which, like FAK, also stimulates RAF/MEK/ERK activity.</p><p>These cell signaling pathways have been found to regulate the levels of BIM (also called BCL2L11) and BMF, two pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators previously shown to contribute to anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmelzle et al., 2007</xref>). However, depletion of BIM or BMF diminishes but does not completely prevent anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmelzle et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting the existence of other factors and regulatory pathways that can promote anoikis. Moreover, the basis of anoikis resistance remains to be determined and to date has not been linked to alterations in expression or activity of BIM or BMF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To investigate the possibility that there are additional factors and regulatory pathways that promote anoikis, we performed a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen for genes whose loss of expression confer anoikis resistance. The screen was performed in MCF10A cells, an immortalized but non-transformed human breast epithelial cell line that has been frequently used to study anoikis (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmelzle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Taube et al., 2006</xref>).

Following selection, the cells were divided into two populations, one of which was plated on poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA)-coated plates for 10 days to inhibit cell attachment to matrix, and another that was cultured attached to matrix for 10 days as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Surviving cells were selected and shRNAs identified by deep sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of the two populations identified 26 shRNAs whose abundance was significantly enriched &gt;500-fold following detachment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>); such shRNAs presumably confer upon MCF10A cells a selective advantage by protecting them from undergoing anoikis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16844.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of KDM3A as an anoikis effector in breast cancer epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the design of the large-scale RNAi screen to identify anoikis effectors.

Briefly, MCF10A cells were transduced with a single shRNA, detached from matrix for 96 hr, and analysed for cell death by annexin V staining. As expected, knockdown of BIM, a positive control, decreased cell death following detachment compared to the control non-silencing (NS) shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of the 20 candidate shRNAs tested, five reduced the level of detachment-induced apoptosis compared to the NS shRNA, indicating they conferred anoikis resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained using a second, unrelated shRNA directed against the same target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed in all cases that expression of the target gene was decreased in the knockdown cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>One of the top scoring validated candidates was KDM3A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), a histone demethylase that specifically demethylates mono-methylated (me1) and di-methylated (me2) histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamane et al., 2006</xref>). H3K9 methylation is a transcriptional repressive mark, and the identification of KDM3A raised the intriguing possibility that induction of anoikis involves transcriptional activation of specific genes through H3K9me1/2 demethylation. Therefore, our subsequent experiments focused on investigating the role of KDM3A in anoikis.</p><p>We asked whether ectopic expression of KDM3A was sufficient to promote cell death in attached cells. MCF10A cells were transduced with a retrovirus expressing wild-type KDM3A, a catalytically inactive KDM3A mutant [KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beyer et al., 2008</xref>) or, as a control, empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and then treated with puromycin for 10 days at which time viability was assessed by crystal violet staining. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> show that ectopic expression of wild-type KDM3A but not KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N) greatly reduced MCF10A cell viability.

As mentioned above, anoikis is suppressed by integrin signaling, which functions through FAK, a regulator of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frisch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">King et al., 1997</xref>). Detachment causes a disruption in integrin–ECM contacts, resulting in a loss of FAK signaling in the detached cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frisch and Francis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frisch et al., 1996</xref>), which we observed have elevated KDM3A levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and B</xref>). We therefore tested whether restoration of integrin signaling in detached cells would block the increase in KDM3A levels. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> show that the addition of Matrigel basement membrane-like matrix, which restores integrin signaling, to detached cells markedly blocked the elevated levels of the BIM isoform BIM<sub>EL</sub>, as expected, and KDM3A. Treatment of MCF10A cells with a FAK inhibitor increased the levels of KDM3A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the increase in KDM3A levels upon detachment of MCF10A cells is due, at least in part, to the loss of integrin/FAK signaling.</p><p>We next analyzed the relationship between the EGFR signaling pathway and KDM3A levels. In the first set of experiments, we ectopically expressed either EGFR or a constitutively active MEK mutant, MEK2(S222D/S226D) (MEK2DD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Voisin et al., 2008</xref>), both of which have been previously shown to block anoikis in detached cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with these previous results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows that in detached MCF10A cells, expression of either EGFR or MEK2DD substantially decreased the level of BIM<sub>EL</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>). Expression of either EGFR or MEK2DD also decreased the levels of KDM3A in detached MCF10A cells. Conversely, KDM3A protein levels were increased in attached MCF10A cells treated with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ward et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Favata et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Both gefitinib and U0126 treatment also resulted in increased <italic>KDM3A</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>The results described above suggest a model in which following detachment, the resulting increase in KDM3A demethylates H3K9me1/2 to stimulate expression of one or more pro-apoptotic genes. To test this model and identify pro-apoptotic KDM3A target genes, we took a candidate-based approach and analyzed expression of a panel of genes encoding pro-apoptotic BCL2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lomonosova and Chinnadurai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Matsushima et al., 1998</xref>) in attached MCF10A cells and detached cells expressing a NS or <italic>KDM3A</italic> shRNA. We sought to identify genes whose expression increased following detachment in control but not in <italic>KDM3A</italic> knockdown cells. We found that expression of the vast majority of genes encoding pro-apoptotic BCL2 proteins were unaffected by detachment in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmelzle et al., 2007</xref>), expression of <italic>BIM</italic> and <italic>BMF</italic> were increased upon detachment. However, knockdown of <italic>KDM3A</italic> did not decrease expression of either <italic>BIM</italic> or <italic>BMF</italic>. By contrast, following detachment, expression of <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> increased, and were the only genes whose expression was diminished more than 2-fold by <italic>KDM3A</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The immunoblot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that BNIP3 and BNIP3L levels were very low in attached cells and substantially increased following detachment, with a time course similar to that of detachment-induced KDM3A expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that KDM3A was bound to the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters in detached but not attached cells. Moreover, the levels of H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and H3K9me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters were greatly diminished following detachment, which was counteracted by knockdown of <italic>KDM3A</italic>. Conversely, overexpression of KDM3A but not KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N) in attached MCF10A cells resulted in decreased levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters and increased expression of <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, knockdown of <italic>BNIP3</italic> or <italic>BNIP3L</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) resulted in decreased apoptosis following detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). To further establish the pro-apoptotic role of BNIP3 and BNIP3L in MCF10A cells, we ectopically expressed BNIP3, BNIP3L or both in attached cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> shows that moderate cell death was observed upon ectopic expression of either BNIP3 or BNIP3L, but substantial cell death occurred in cells ectopically expressing both BNIP3 and BNIP3L. Collectively, these results establish <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> as critical KDM3A target genes that mediate anoikis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that decreased <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression may contribute to anoikis resistance in breast cancer cells and performed a series of experiments to test this idea. We first analyzed a panel of human breast cancer cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, SUM149 and T47D) comparing, as a control, anoikis-sensitive MCF10A cells. As expected, detachment-induced apoptosis was significantly diminished in breast cancer cell lines compared to MCF10A cells, indicative of anoikis resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, ectopic expression of KDM3A was sufficient to induce apoptosis in each of the five breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that anoikis-resistance of human breast cancer cells is due, at least in part, to inefficient induction of KDM3A following detachment.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16844.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>KDM3A</italic> prevents metastasis and its expression is defective in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell death, monitored by annexin V staining, in MCF10A cells and a panel of human breast cancer cell lines cultured as attached cells or detached following growth in suspension for 96 hr.

Interrogation of the Oncomine database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>) revealed decreased expression levels of <italic>KDM3A</italic> in several breast cancer datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To confirm these in silico results, we analyzed <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression by qRT-PCR in a series of human breast cancer patient samples. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> show that compared to normal breast epithelium <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression was significantly decreased in a high percentage of breast cancers. Likewise, basal <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression levels were also diminished in most human breast cancer cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we performed a series of experiments to determine whether KDM3A affects metastatic potential. We first asked whether depletion of KDM3A would promote anoikis resistance in vivo using a mouse pulmonary survival assay. Briefly, immortalized but non-transformed mouse mammary epithelial CLS1 cells were stably transduced with an NS or <italic>Kdm3a</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) and injected into the tail vein of syngeneic mice. After 2 weeks, the lungs were harvested, dissociated into single cell suspensions, and plated in media containing puromycin to select for cells expressing the shRNA. The surviving colonies were visualized by crystal violet staining and quantified. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> show that <italic>Kdm3a</italic> knockdown significantly increased the number of cells that survived in the mouse lung relative to the control NS shRNA.</p><p>In a second set of experiments, we used a well-characterized mouse breast cancer carcinoma progression series comprising isogenic cell lines with increasing metastatic potential: (1) non-invasive and non-metastatic 67NR cells, which form primary tumors, (2) invasive and non-metastatic 4T07 cells, which enter the circulation but fail to establish secondary tumors, and (3) highly metastatic 4T1 cells, which disseminate widely and colonize distant organ sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aslakson and Miller, 1992</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis revealed decreased <italic>Kdm3a</italic> expression in cell lines with greater metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). We expressed either a control NS shRNA or a <italic>Kdm3a</italic> shRNA in 67NR cells containing a luciferase reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Cells were injected into the tail veins of three syngeneic mice and pulmonary metastases were visualized by live animal imaging after 5 weeks. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> show, as expected, that control 67NR cells failed to form pulmonary metastases in any of the three mice analyzed. By contrast, <italic>Kdm3a</italic> knockdown 67NR cells formed substantial pulmonary metastases in all three mice.</p><p>Finally, in a more stringent metastasis experiment, control and <italic>Kdm3a</italic> knockdown 4T07 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>), a non-metastatic mouse breast cancer cell line, were injected in the mammary fat pad of ten syngeneic mice. After 22 days the primary tumors were surgically removed and 8 weeks post-injection the animals were sacrificed and pulmonary tumors quantified. The growth of primary tumors formed by NS or <italic>Kdm3a</italic> knockdown cells was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). However, <italic>Kdm3a</italic> knockdown cells caused significantly increased metastatic burden in the lungs compared to control 4T07 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Consistent with our results, knockdown of <italic>Bnip3</italic> has also been shown to cause increased metastasis in similar in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Manka et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, these results show that KDM3A functions to prevent metastasis.</p><p>Based on the results presented above, we propose a model of anoikis induction that is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and discussed below. Following detachment of non-transformed cells, integrin signaling is decreased leading to transcriptional induction of <italic>KDM3A</italic>. The increased levels of KDM3A results in its recruitment to the pro-apoptotic genes <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L,</italic> where it promotes demethylation of inhibitory H3K9me1/2 marks and transcriptional activation of the two genes, resulting in anoikis induction. Consistent with this model, previous studies have shown that hypoxia results in transcriptional activation of <italic>KDM3A, BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sowter et al., 2001</xref>). We have found that in anoikis-resistant human breast cancer cell lines and tumors, <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression is defective, highlighting the importance of this pathway in promoting anoikis. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis in non-transformed cells and is disabled during cancer development.</p><p>As described above, previous studies have shown that BIM and BMF are also effectors of anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reginato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmelzle et al., 2007</xref>). However, we have found that unlike BNIP3 and BNIP3L, BIM and BMF are not regulated by KDM3A. Thus, our results reveal that anoikis is promoted by multiple non-redundant pathways, which may help prevent the development of anoikis resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>T47D, MDA-MB-231, BT549 and CLS1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown as recommended by the supplier.

Cells were then harvested from subconfluent plates, washed once with PBS, and resuspended (5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells) in 50 µl of a 50:50 solution of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and PBS. This cell suspension was injected into the right abdominal mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice (n = 10 mice per shRNA) and measurements were taken beginning on day 7 post-injection. Animals that did not develop a primary tumor were excluded from the study. Tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: <italic>πLW</italic><sup>2</sup>/6, where <italic>L</italic> is the length and <italic>W</italic> is the width of the tumor. Tumors were surgically removed, using a cautery unit, once they reached a volume around 500 mm<sup>3</sup>, approximately 3 weeks post injection. Lungs were collected 8 weeks post-injection. Tumor burden in the lungs was quantified from four H&amp;E stained step sections (200 µm/step). The number of lesions per section were counted using Imagescope software (Aperio, Vista, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>All quantitative data were collected from experiments performed in at least triplicate, and expressed as mean ± standard deviation, with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, which are expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences between groups were assayed using two-tailed Student’s t test, except where noted above. Significant differences were considered when P&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Fred Miller, Donald Hnatowich, Peter Staller, Sylvain Meloche, Fergus Couch for reagents; Douglas Green for insightful suggestions; the UMMS RNAi Core Facility for providing for shRNA clones; Lynn Chamberlain and Alysia R Bryll for experimental assistance; and Sara Deibler for editorial assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ali Shilatifard as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The two reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor and there is a clear agreement that your study is very well done and the manuscript is a suitable candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> following the implementation of the minor experimental suggestions and the textual modifications indicated in the reviewers' comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In their short report Green and colleagues identify the histone H3K9me2/me1 demethylase KDM3A in an unbiased shRNA screen as a positive regulator of anoikis, a form of apoptosis that is initiated upon cell detachment from the extracellular matrix. KDM3A is transcriptionally induced upon cell detachment as a result of reduced integrin signaling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the EGFR pathway via RAF/MEK/ERK and demethylates H3K9me2 on the promoters of the proapoptotic genes BNIP3 and BNIP3L resulting in their transcriptional induction and apoptosis. Further experiments provide clear evidence that KDM3A mRNA levels are generally kept lower in metastatic cell lines/tumors versus non-metastatic cell lines/tumors suggesting a mechanism by which detached cancer cells can avoid apoptosis and invade other tissues.</p><p>What makes this paper particularly strong is the fact that it starts with a functional phenotypic assay (anoikis) and an unbiased shRNA screen so that the identification of KDM3A as the second strongest hit makes it a very promising candidate from the very start. The manuscript is written very clearly, logically and is easy to follow (not convoluted which is a great plus). The experiments seem to carefully build on each other and delineate a clear mechanistic pathway from the beginning of cell detachment to apoptosis. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides relevant data highlighting the importance of the KDM3A/anoikis axis for the clinical setting. In summary, this manuscript not only introduces a novelty aspect by implicating KDM3A in anoikis but also provides the mechanistic and clinical framework to make this an appropriate story for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, some details are missing that should be addressed:</p><p>1) Is the FAK and EFGR pathway also required to regulate KDM3A on the transcriptional level? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> only provides evidence that this is the case on the protein level.</p><p>2) Discrepancy in KDM3A levels between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and other westerns throughout the paper. KDM3A levels appear to be virtually absent under attached conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> whereas generally the difference appears to be somewhere in the range of approx. a 5 to 10-fold increase in KDM3A levels 24 hr after detachment. It would be better to show a more representative blot.</p><p>3) Loading controls (TUBA) are often not adjusted very carefully making it hard to assess the claimed differences in protein levels. For example this is the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>. This needs to be adjusted.</p><p>4) It would be helpful to know how long the cells have been treated with the respective inhibitors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref> and G.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: is H3K9me1 changed on the BNIP3 and BNIP3L promoters?</p><p>6) ChIP KDM3A and H3K9me1/me2 under KDM3A and KDM3AH1120G/D1122N overexpressing conditions in attached MCF10A cells and perform qRT PCR for BNIP3 and BNIP3L to confirm the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><p>7) MF10A detached (96 h) plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a smaller second &quot;hump&quot; and thus looks different from the control MF10A detached (96 h) plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> suggesting that the cells might have responded abnormally in this experiment. This should be repeated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Green and colleagues in this very interesting study perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify new factor that cause anoikis resistance. The study identified a previously unknown transcriptional program regulated by the chromatin modifier protein KDM3A. The manuscript is well written and the data is robust and with appropriate controls. The gene expression data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> also establish the clinical significance of the observed pathway. Overall, this manuscript is a strong candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as a Brief Report. Addressing the following remaining issues will further strengthen this manuscript.</p><p>1) In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> the authors show that KDM3A knockdown does not affect the tumor forming ability of the breast cancer cells. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref> there seems to difference in tumor growth between NS and KDM3A shRNA. Is this difference significant? On the same line it will be important to include a few lines in the Discussion in regard to the role of anoikis resistane in tumor growth versus metastasis phenotypes. One would imagine that it might also play a role in tumor growth.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, is it possible to present the data in the context of major breast cancer subtypes (ER+, HER2+, triple negative).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16844.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] In summary, this manuscript not only introduces a novelty aspect by implicating KDM3A in anoikis but also provides the mechanistic and clinical framework to make this an appropriate story for</italic> eLife.</p><p> <italic>However, some details are missing that should be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Is the FAK and EFGR pathway also required to regulate KDM3A on the transcriptional level? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> only provides evidence that this is the case on the protein level.</italic></p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we performed qRT-PCR to measure <italic>KDM3A</italic> mRNA levels after treatment of attached MCF10A cells with the same FAK and EGFR inhibitors used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,F</xref>, and G.

In particular, the new immunoblot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a low level of KDM3A in attached cells, similar to the other immunoblots in the manuscript. The other immunoblots shown in the manuscript were visualized using a digital imaging system, whereas the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> was an older experiment that used a scanned film, which is less sensitive and explains why the weak KDM3A expression in attached cells was not detected.</p><p><italic>3) Loading controls (TUBA) are often not adjusted very carefully making it hard to assess the claimed differences in protein levels. For example this is the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>. This needs to be adjusted.</italic></p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment we have replaced the original immunoblots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,F</xref>, and G with new immunoblots in which there is not lane-to-lane variability in TUBA levels.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, six different cell lines are analyzed. It is well known that tubulin levels can vary between cell lines (Verdier-Pinard et al. 2003, <italic>Biochemistry</italic> 42:12019<bold>-</bold>12027), which is the basis of the variation of TUBA levels in this figure. In this experiment TUBA levels in the same cell line should be compared and in all cases are relatively equivalent. To avoid possible confusion, in the revised manuscript we have divided the original single immunoblot into six separate immunoblots, each one showing the results of only one cell line</p><p><italic>4) It would be helpful to know how long the cells have been treated with the respective inhibitors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref> and G.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript, this information was provided in the Materials and methods section. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have also specified the length of inhibitor treatment in the revised legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,F and G</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: is H3K9me1 changed on the BNIP3 and BNIP3L promoters?</italic></p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment we performed ChIP analysis monitoring H3K9me1 enrichment on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters in attached versus detached MCF10A cells, and in <italic>KDM3A</italic> knockdown MCF10A cells following detachment. We found that, like H3K9me2, enrichment of H3K9me1 on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters significantly decreased following detachment, which was counteracted by knockdown of <italic>KDM3A</italic>. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript and are consistent with previous studies showing that KDM3A removes both mono-methyl and di-methyl groups from H3K9 (Yamane et al. 2006, <italic>Cell</italic> 125:483-495).</p><p><italic>6) ChIP KDM3A and H3K9me1/me2 under KDM3A and KDM3AH1120G/D1122N overexpressing conditions in attached MCF10A cells and perform qRT PCR for BNIP3 and BNIP3L to confirm the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</italic></p><p>We performed all of the experiments requested by the reviewer, which are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> of the revised manuscript. As expected, overexpression of KDM3A resulted in increased occupancy of KDM3A on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). There was also increased occupancy of KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N) on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters, which is not unexpected because the mutations are in the catalytic domain and should not affect the DNA-binding activity (Yamane et al. 2006, <italic>Cell</italic> 125:483-495; Beyer et al. 2008, <italic>J Biol Chem</italic> 283:36542-36552). As expected, overexpression of KDM3A, but not KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N), resulted in decreased levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 on the <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> promoters. Finally, as expected, overexpression of KDM3A, but not KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N), resulted in increased expression of <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> as monitored by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In summary, these new results confirm the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and demonstrate that the inability of the catalytically inactive KDM3A mutant to reduce MCF10A cell viability is due to its inability to remove H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 from the promoters of <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic> and induce their expression.</p><p><italic>7) MF10A detached (96 h) plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a smaller second &quot;hump&quot; and thus looks different from the control MF10A detached (96 h) plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> suggesting that the cells might have responded abnormally in this experiment. This should be repeated.</italic></p><p>In these apoptosis experiments, the important measurement is the total percentage of annexin-V positive cells, which is similar (~30%) in the controls (non-silencing (NS) shRNA or uninfected MCF10A cells) in the three experiments mentioned by the reviewer. The “hump” in the histogram noted by the reviewer reflects a subpopulation of apoptotic cells that stain intensely with annexin and has no bearing on the calculation of the total percentage of annexin-V positive cells. It is well known that the annexin-V fluorescent intensity of apoptotic cells can vary substantially (Engeland et al. 1998, <italic>Cytometry</italic> 31:1-9; Prieto et al. 2002, <italic>Cytometry</italic> 48:185-193).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] Overall, this manuscript is a strong candidate for publication in eLife as a Brief Report.

However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref> there seems to difference in tumor growth between NS and KDM3A shRNA. Is this difference significant? On the same line it will be important to include a few lines in the Discussion in regard to the role of anoikis resistane in tumor growth versus metastasis phenotypes. One would imagine that it might also play a role in tumor growth.</italic></p><p>The differences in primary tumor growth noted by the reviewer are not statistically significant. In response to by the reviewer’s comment, we have added a sentence to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref> explicitly stating that the differences in primary tumor growth between control and <italic>Kdm3a</italic> knockdown cells are not statistically significant. Likewise, we have also added a sentence to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> stating that the differences in primary tumor growth are also not statistically significant.</p><p>Finally, as requested by the reviewer, we have added a brief statement about the role of anoikis in primary tumor growth to the Introduction of the revised manuscript (page 3).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, is it possible to present the data in the context of major breast cancer subtypes (ER+, HER2+, triple negative).</italic></p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> in the revised manuscript) was obtained from the Oncomine database. For the specific Oncomine studies used in our manuscript information regarding breast cancer subtype is not available. We note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, in which we experimentally analyzed <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression in human breast cancer samples, the results are separated by subtype and show no significant difference between the subtypes.
