The homomeric nature raises important questions regarding coupling between subunits and complicates the application of techniques such as FRET or DEER spectroscopy. These challenges can be overcome if the subunits of a homomeric protein can be independently modified for functional or spectroscopic studies. Here, we describe a general approach for in vitro assembly that can be used for the generation of heteromeric variants of homomeric membrane proteins. We establish the approach using Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, a glutamate transporter homolog that is trimeric in the native state. We use heteromeric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporters to directly demonstrate the lack of coupling in substrate binding and demonstrate how heteromeric transporters considerably simplify the application of DEER spectroscopy. Further, we demonstrate the general applicability of this approach by carrying out the in vitro assembly of VcINDY, a Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled succinate transporter and CLC-ec1, a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>in vitro folding</kwd><kwd>DEER</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>multimerization</kwd><kwd>transporters</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM087546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valiyaveetil</surname><given-names>Francis I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boudker</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 NS085318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchard</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name><name><surname>Boudker</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Valiyaveetil</surname><given-names>Francis I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freed</surname><given-names>Jack H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12POST1910068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Focke</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM123779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Georgieva</surname><given-names>Elka R</given-names></name><name><surname>Freed</surname><given-names>Jack H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Methodology for the in vitro assembly of multimeric membrane proteins and the utility of the approach for generating heteromeric variants of homo-multimeric proteins is described.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Movement of ions and small molecules across cellular membranes takes place through transport proteins such as ion channels and transporters. A frequently observed feature of transport proteins is that they form multimeric assemblies of identical subunits in their native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veenhoff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forrest, 2015</xref>). There are challenges in spectroscopic investigations of homo-multimeric (or homomeric) proteins that arise due to the presence of multiple identical subunits. One such example is in using Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) spectroscopy with homomeric proteins. These spectroscopic techniques, which are commonly used for detecting structural changes accompanying function, rely on site-specific labeling with appropriate spectroscopic probes, typically at introduced cysteine residues. In homomeric proteins, such efforts result in the labeling of each of the individual subunits and therefore the presence of multiple probes in the protein, which can complicate the spectroscopic measurements. It is also not feasible to label a single subunit in a homomeric protein, which hinders the use of these spectroscopic approaches for investigating the structural changes that take place within individual subunits. The presence of multiple identical subunits in transport proteins also raises the pertinent question of whether there is a functional coupling or ‘crosstalk’ between the subunits. These challenges in investigating homomeric proteins can be overcome if we generate heteromeric variants in which a single subunit (or a set of subunits) can be selectively modified. Labeling a single subunit with spectroscopic probes will facilitate the investigations of the intra-subunit structural changes, while functional perturbation of a subset of subunits in the assembly will enable investigations of the functional coupling between protomers. Thus, the ability to generate a heteromeric variant of a homomeric protein will be a great asset.</p><p>Cellular expression of heteromeric proteins containing wild type and mutant subunits has been carried out using either concatenation or co-expression approaches. In the concatenation approach, protein expression is carried out using a DNA construct in which the genes for the wild type and mutant subunits are concatenated into a single reading frame. Expression of this concatenated construct yields a heteromeric membrane protein in which the subunits are linked together. This approach has been widely used for the expression of heteromeric ion channels in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes for functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon and Zagotta, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). There are only a few examples where multimeric membrane proteins encoded in a single polypeptide have been purified for functional and spectroscopic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raghuraman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Last et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In the co-expression approach, the wild type and the mutant subunits are co-expressed in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), wherein the random mixing of the subunits during assembly results in the generation of heteromeric and homomeric proteins. Placing different purification tags on the wild type and the mutant subunits allows the purification of the desired heteromeric protein. Both of these approaches frequently suffer from very low yields.</p><p>The alternate approach is to assemble the heteromeric proteins in vitro by using a mixture of wild type and mutant subunits. In this manner, a mixture of heteromeric and homomeric proteins is produced from which the desired heteromeric complex can be purified. The advantage of the in vitro approach is that the ratio of the wild type and the mutant subunits can be adjusted to ensure formation of the desired heteromeric protein in good yields. The heteromeric assembly can be carried out through a coupled folding and oligomerization process starting with fully unfolded subunits. However, refolding of membrane proteins is very challenging, and there are only few reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Popot, 2014</xref>). In lieu of complete refolding, we envisioned an approach in which we dissociate the native wild type and mutant multimeric proteins into subunits and then use a mixture of the dissociated subunits for assembly of the hetero-oligomers. We anticipated that this dissociation/reassociation approach should be generally applicable and also provide higher yields compared to complete refolding.</p><p>Here, we describe a simple methodology for the in vitro reassembly of functional multimeric membrane proteins from dissociated subunits. We develop the methodology using the archaeal glutamate transporter homolog Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by assembling heteromeric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporters that we use to investigate the cross-talk between the substrate binding sites and to evaluate the intra-subunit structural changes in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> using DEER spectroscopy. Further, we establish the general applicability of the methodology by carrying out the in vitro reassembly of the archaeal transporter Glt<sub>Sm</sub> and the bacterial transporters VcINDY and CLC-ec1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro reassembly of Glt<sub>Ph</sub></title><p>To develop a protocol for the in vitro reassembly of multimeric membrane proteins, we initially focused on Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, a homo-trimeric sodium coupled aspartate transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>). Each subunit of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> has a complex topology with eight transmembrane and two reentrant hairpin segments. Remarkably, we have previously successfully refolded Glt<sub>Ph</sub> from a completely unfolded state by using lipid vesicles to obtain an active native-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Focke et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we investigated whether Glt<sub>Ph</sub> can be reassembled in vitro from dissociated subunits using lipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36478.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dissociation and reassociation of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> trimer (pdb: 2nwx) is shown in ribbon representation.

Glutaraldehyde cross-linking confirmed complete dissociation of the trimeric species by SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Focke et al., 2015</xref>). While crosslinking of the native Glt<sub>Ph</sub> gives a protein band on SDS-PAGE corresponding to the trimer, crosslinking following SDS treatment only yields monomers. For reassembly, we diluted the protein after SDS treatment into buffer supplemented with lipid vesicles achieving SDS concentrations below the critical micellar concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Focke et al., 2015</xref>). Consequent glutaraldehyde crosslinking showed the presence of a trimeric band indicating subunit reassociation. We solubilized the reassembled Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) from the lipid vesicles using dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent and purified it by affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The SEC elution profile for r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> was similar to that of native Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and crosslinking confirmed the trimeric state of r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Lipid vesicles were required for the reassociation process, and dilution of the SDS-dissociated Glt<sub>Ph</sub> subunits directly into DDM did not yield a trimeric species, as indicted by both SEC and cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To establish the functionality of r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, we examined its ability to bind and transport substrate L-aspartate (Asp). Substrate binding was assayed by monitoring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the L130W mutant of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> upon titration with Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hänelt et al., 2015</xref>). The Asp dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of the reassembled L130W mutant of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> was similar to that of the transporter prior to the dissociation/reassociation procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We reconstituted r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> into lipid vesicles to measure transport activity and observed uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Asp into proteoliposomes in the presence of an inwardly directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The specific transport activity observed for r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> was similar to that of the native transporter.</p><p>The key conformational transition of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> that underlies substrate translocation across the membrane is an elevator-like movement of the peripherally located transport domain within each protomer relative to the central trimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Previously, single-molecule FRET (smFRET) was used to visualize these movements in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erkens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>). These experiments further suggested that the transition frequency determined the overall rate of substrate transport. We used smFRET to compare the dynamics of the r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> to the native protein. For these experiments, N378C mutant of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> was derivatized with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores and with a PEG-biotin linker either before or after the reassembly procedure. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>), the labeled proteins were immobilized on passivated streptavidin-coated microscope slides and imaged using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) to obtain smFRET recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In these experiments, movements of two transport domains within the trimers relative to each other are detected. We found that r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in the presence of 200 mM Na<sup>+</sup> and 100 μM Asp, sampled three FRET efficiency states, low-, intermediate- and high-FRET centered at ~0.35, ~0.55 and ~0.8, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar FRET efficiency states were observed for the native protein, where the low-FRET state was attributed largely to the outward facing state of the transporter. Excursions into the higher-FRET states reflect sampling of the inward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>). The populations of the low-, intermediate-, and high-FRET states for the r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> were 76%, 17% and 7%, respectively, in good agreement with the values observed for the native transporter (71%, 16% and 13%, respectively). Transition density plots showed that the r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> exhibit conformational transitions at a rate of ~0.03/s, also in good agreement with the transition frequency of the native transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In line with these findings, the FRET-state lifetimes were similar in the native and reassembled transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These smFRET measurements suggest that the reassembled transporter samples the outward- and inward-facing state with probabilities and frequency similar to the native protein. Collectively, these results show that r-Glt<sub>Ph</sub> is structurally, functionally and dynamically similar to the native transporter.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36478.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>smFRET experiments on reassociated Glt<sub>Ph</sub> molecules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Labeling and surface-immobilization strategy for smFRET experiments.

It is especially challenging to use DEER to probe the structural changes taking place within a single subunit, because dipolar coupling is present not only between the spin labels within this subunit, but also between those in different subunits. In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, the key transition involves the movement of the transport domain relative to the scaffold domain by as much as 15 Å. Probing this movement requires spin labels in both these domains. However, the introduction of Cys mutations into each domain and subsequent labeling of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> yields six spin labels per the trimeric protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the simplest case, with all subunits being in the outward-facing state, we expect up to five unique distances between spin labels, depending on symmetry. Consequently, the distance distributions, generated from DEER signals, are very broad and difficult to extract, being further complicated by non-linear effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeschke et al., 2009</xref>) and less than ideal spin-labelling efficiency.

In this conformational state, the C<sub>α</sub>-C<sub>α</sub> distance between residues 216 and 294 is 48 Å based on the crystallographic model, in good agreement with the DEER measurement.

The method involves the assembly of the multimeric proteins from dissociated subunits in the context of lipid vesicles. Heteromeric proteins are obtained simply by mixing wild-type and mutant subunits. We established the approach using the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporter and then demonstrated its applicability to a number of other systems including Glt<sub>Sm</sub>, VcINDY and CLC-ec1 transporters. Using biochemical, functional and single molecule approaches, we show that the reassembled transporters are indistinguishable from native proteins.</p><p>Heteromeric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporters allowed us to probe the communication between the Asp-binding sites. In typical binding experiments, the presence or absence of coupling between multiple binding sites in multimeric transporters is deduced from the shape of the binding isotherms and corresponding Hill coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiss, 1997</xref>). The Hill coefficients that are greater or less than unity suggest, respectively, positive or negative cooperativity between the binding sites. However, Hill coefficients are relatively poorly determined and can be affected by baseline drifts and noise in the data. Furthermore, the existence of multiple coupled substrate binding sites within single subunits, as for example in BetP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ge et al., 2011</xref>), may obscure the extent of inter-subunit coupling. The approach that we develop here allows us to circumvent these complications by assembling the reporter subunit together with test subunits that either can or cannot bind substrate with relevant affinity. Using this approach, we show that binding to the adjacent test subunits does not affect Asp binding to the reporter subunit thereby establishing unambiguously that the substrate-binding sites in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> are uncoupled.</p><p>Whether independent binding sites are a general feature of the multimeric transporters is not fully known, and our approach can provide a facile means of probing for such long-distance interactions between subunits. Interestingly, some transporters are assembled from multiple subunits with substrate-binding sites located at the interfaces, for example, the EmrE and the semi-SWEET transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latorraca et al., 2017</xref>). The ability to break the intrinsic symmetry of these systems by assembling them from distinct subunits may open novel approaches to probe their mechanisms.</p><p>A multitude of spectroscopic approaches to probe the dynamics of transporters and channels has been developed in recent years. Most of them rely on site-specific labeling of introduced cysteine residues. DEER spectroscopy and smFRET microscopy specifically have been applied to study conformational flexibility and dynamics of diverse systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McHaourab et al., 2011</xref>). A major challenge in the experimental design is identification of informative labeling sites. Because these approaches are based on distance measurements, an ideal labeling strategy would incorporate two labels at sites that show conformation-dependent distance changes. However, in multimeric proteins this effort is compounded by the presence of multiple subunits, each of which would carry cysteine substitutions. Thus, many of the successful experiments relied on measurements of inter-subunit distance changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Georgieva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hänelt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dastvan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). Clearly, these approaches have severe limitations when the structural transitions of interest occur within individual subunits. The ability to assemble a multimeric system of interest with single reporter subunits bearing cysteine mutations would significantly expand the repertoire of useful experiments and also facilitate and simplify analysis. We demonstrate the advantage of the reassembled heteromeric proteins by using DEER spectroscopy to probe the conformational state of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporter. Indeed, the distance distribution that was obtained for heteromeric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> bearing a single labeled subunit is dramatically simplified compared to a homomeric labeled protein, and allows facile determination of the conformational state of the labeled subunit. Similarly, the heteromeric transporters will be useful in introducing fluorescent probes at appropriate sites for smFRET studies of multimeric membrane transporters and channels. For example, we expect significant simplification and increased resolution compared to approaches previously employed to study dynamics of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erkens et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Many ion channels are homomeric in nature. Ion channels transition between different conformational states during function. Determining the structural nature of these conformational changes and how these changes are coupled among the individual ion channel subunits is important for understanding their mechanism. The approaches developed herein for the study of transporters can similarly be applied to homomeric ion channels to generate heteromeric variants. These heteromeric variants will provide the ability to alter the amino acid sequence of one or several of the subunits for functional or spectroscopic investigations and will potentially be very useful in probing the mechanism of action.</p><p>In our approach, SDS is used to dissociate the multimeric protein. SDS is not a strong denaturant for most membrane proteins and therefore we expect that the SDS-dissociated subunits are only partially unfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris and Booth, 2012</xref>). We also used a stringent dissociation process involving treatment with strong acids and organic solvents. Following this stringent dissociation protocol, we were able to observe successful reassembly for only two of the proteins in our test set, Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and CLC-ec1 while VcINDY and Glt<sub>Sm</sub> could not be reassembled. This observation suggests that the success of the disassembly/reassembly depends on the gentle dissociation of the multimeric proteins without extensive unfolding of the subunits. Further, lipid bilayers were required for the reassociation process, and a mere dilution of the SDS in the presence of mild detergents did not result in successful reassembly. We speculate that incorporation of the dissociated subunits into lipid bilayers concentrates and orients the subunits to facilitate the assembly.</p><p>The overall mechanism of coupled refolding and assembly that takes place in the lipid bilayers is not clear. For CLC-ec1, it was shown that monomers are stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>), and thus, it is possible that these transporters first assume a native-like fold and then assemble into dimers. The trimeric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> forms a bowl-like structure in the outward facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>). The bowl extends approximately half way across the bilayer; it is lined with polar residues and is most certainly filled with water. It seems unlikely that the conformation of dissociated Glt<sub>Ph</sub> monomers is entirely native-like because it would lead to the exposure of the polar regions of the bowl to the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane. Thus, it seems likely that reaching the native conformation is coupled with the trimer assembly in this protein. Our reassembly protocols will be useful to probe the mechanisms of multimeric membrane protein assembly. For example, these processes have been shown to have specific lipid requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). The ability to assemble multimeric membrane proteins in defined lipid environments will facilitate an investigation of how lipid molecules participate in the multimerization process.</p><p>While our experiments have only focused on bacterial and archaeal transporters, it will be of great interest to determine whether this simple protocol is applicable also to eukaryotic proteins. Using this procedure for multimeric eukaryotic proteins will involve identifying appropriate detergents for mild dissociation and appropriate compositions of lipid bilayers for reassociation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GltPh</td><td valign="top">10.1038/nature03018</td><td valign="top">Uniprot ID: O59010</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VcINDY</td><td valign="top">10.1038/nature11542</td><td valign="top">Uniprot ID: Q9KNE0</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CLC-ec1</td><td valign="top">10.1085/jgp.200308935</td><td valign="top">Uniprot ID: P37019</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Staphylothermus marinus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GltSm</td><td valign="top">10.1111/febs.12105</td><td valign="top">Uniprot ID: A3DPQ3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pBCH/G4-GltPh</td><td valign="top">10.1038/nature03018</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pET-VcINDY</td><td valign="top">10.1038/nature11542</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pASK-CLC-ec1</td><td valign="top">10.1085/jgp.200308935</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pBAD-GltSm</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">GltSm from the GltSm-GFP fusion gene <break/>(ref: 10.1111/febs.12105) was cloned <break/>into a pBAD-HisA vector <break/>(Fisher Scientific)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Asolectin</td><td valign="top">Avanti Polar Lipids</td><td valign="top">Cat # 541601G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td valign="top">Pymol</td><td valign="top">PyMOL Molecular <break/>Graphics <break/>System, <break/>Schrödinger, LLC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">www.pymol.org</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td valign="top">Matlab</td><td valign="top">Mathworks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com">www.mathworks.com</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td valign="top">Origin</td><td valign="top">Originlab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014212">SCR_014212</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.originlab.com">www.originlab.com</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Glt<sub>Ph</sub></title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Native expression</title><p>Glt<sub>Ph</sub> constructs used in this study were expressed from the pBCH/G4 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Eric Gouaux) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TOP10 cells (Fisher Scientific)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>).

The lipid vesicles were then solubilized and the in vitro assembled CLC-ec1 (r-CLC-ec1) was purified as described for the native protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Chloride flux assays for CLC-ec1</title><p>The native and r-CLC-ec1 channels were reconstituted into liposomes and Cl<sup>-</sup> flux assays were carried out similarly to that previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walden et al., 2007</xref>) with some minor differences. Briefly, ClC-ec1 was reconstituted into <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids at a concentration of 0.4 µg of protein per mg lipid. Detergent was removed to form liposomes by dialysis against 300 mM KCl, 25 mM citrate pH 4.5. For flux assays, vesicles were freeze-thawed five times in dry ice/acetone and extruded through a 400 nm filter. Extra-vesicular solution was exchanged by centrifuging 60 µl of extruded vesicles through a 1.5 ml Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in Flux Buffer (100 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05 mM KCl, 25 mM anhydrous citrate pH 4.5 with NaOH). The vesicles were then diluted into Flux buffer and extra-vesicular chloride concentration was monitored with a Ag/AgCl electrode. Chloride efflux was initiated with ~5.8 µM valinomycin, and after an additional 1 min, vesicles were broken upon with addition of ~0.13% Triton X-100. Flux was normalized to the total amount of chloride release after addition of Triton X-100.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the grants from the NIH: R01 GM087546 (FV), R37NS085318 (OB, SB and FV), P41GM103521 (JHF, ACERT) and R01 GM123779 (JHF and ERG).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The production of multimeric complexes of membrane proteins of defined subunit composition has been a challenge for investigating many fundamental aspects of membrane protein function, including stoichiometry of ligand binding and cooperative interactions between subunits, as well as structural dynamics using FRET or EPR. The conventional approach of concatenating subunits to achieve the desired mixture has often been problematic because concatemers do not always faithfully assemble. In this manuscript, the Valiyaveetil laboratory reports a method for producing functional multimeric transporters of defined subunit combinations by first partially denaturing with SDS to achieve single subunits, and then refolding to form multimers using lipid vesicles. Although this work is a natural extension of the group's successful semi-synthesis of the glutamate transporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, where they discovered that subunits could be folded efficiently when diluting detergents in the presence of vesicles, the demonstration that defined subunit mixtures can be achieve is a significant advance. They show that they can produce trimeric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> that is competent to bind Asp with high affinity, can transport the amino acid in a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent fashion, and that exhibits dynamic behavior in smFRET experiments that resembles what is observed with more traditional methods of producing and purifying Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. They then show that heteromeric complexes can be produced that contain a single subunit with a Trp mutant that reports on Asp binding, and that Asp binding to that subunit is unaffected by mutations in the other two subunits that effectively ablate Asp binding. Although other evidence supports the idea that the three subunits in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transport Asp independently, this is the most direct demonstration to date. They also show that they can label a single subunit with DEER probes and that they can acquire greatly simplified EPR spectra with a single relatively tight distance distribution. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the refolding/assembly approach also works for another transporter VcINDY, as well as for a CLC proton/Cl<sup>-</sup> antiporter.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the work on the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporter is extensive, aspects of the work on CLC-ec1 and VcINDY appear less rigorous. 'Notably, TCA treatments of CLC-ec1 likely leads to extensive if not complete unfolding […].these results also show that the CLC-ec1 transporter undergoes a coupled in vitro folding and dimerization [...]' This statement is not supported by the data presented, as the authors do not attempt to measure the unfolding of CLC-ec1 using spectroscopy, or measure the refolding. We think this is an area that many readers would find interesting, and pertains to the effectiveness of trying to refold membrane proteins using this approach. Is it possible for the authors to show what they mean by 'successful refolding' (Discussion). Is this a measure of monodispersity or function?</p><p>2) Although the manuscript is well-written, the authors should carefully go through the document to fix a few awkward sentences. Examples include the fourth paragraph of the Discussion where 'An' should be changed to 'The&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36478.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the work on the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporter is extensive, aspects of the work on CLC-ec1 and VcINDY appear less rigorous.

We show by size exclusion chromatography and cross-linking that the re-associated (r-) CLC-ec1 is dimeric similar to the native transporter (Figure 7B). We have now included new data showing that the fluorescence properties of CLC-ec1 following treatment with SDS is distinct from the native protein while the r-CLC-ec1 has identical fluorescence properties to the native protein (Figure 7C). Further, we have demonstrated that the r-CLC-ec1 has similar functional properties to native CLC-ec1 (Figure 7D). These data therefore establish that the re-assembly process using lipid vesicles results in the conversion of CLC-ec1 from a monomeric to a natively folded dimeric state.</p><p>It is quite likely that SDS treatment in addition to dissociating the CLC-ec1 dimer into monomeric subunits also causes a partial unfolding of the subunits. Further, our dissociation procedure for CLC-ec1 also included a TCA/organic solvent precipitation and lyophilization step prior to dissolution in SDS. We therefore inferred that the CLC-ec1 subunits following this stringent dissociation procedure are extensively unfolded.</p><p>We have not determined the extent of unfolding of CLC-ec1 following this procedure. It is very challenging to determine the extent of unfolding for an α-helical membrane protein such as CLC-ec1. The challenge is that additives such as SDS or trifluoroethanol, which are required for maintaining the unfolded/dissociated protein in solution, favor the formation of an α-helical state. As we do not know the extent of unfolding, we have deleted the following lines from the manuscript:</p><p>“Notably, TCA treatment of CLC-ec1 likely leads to extensive if not complete unfolding of the transporter. Thus, these results also show that the CLC-ec1 transporter undergoes a coupled in vitro folding and dimerization from an extensively unfolded state.”</p><p>We have also added a new panel (panel C) to Figure 7 showing that the fluorescence properties of the native and r-CLC-ec1 are similar to each other and different from the fluorescence properties of the proteins after treatment with SDS.</p><p>While we are presently not certain whether the procedure results in refolding of CLC-ec1 from an extensively unfolded state, our data clearly establish that the procedure does achieve the stated goal of in vitro assembly of a natively folded CLC-ec1 dimer from a dissociated state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the manuscript is well-written, the authors should carefully go through the document to fix a few awkward sentences.
