Chikungunya (CHIKV) virus, do not directly activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), robust IFN-I producing cells. Herein, we demonstrated that DENV and CHIKV infected cells are sensed by pDCs, indirectly, resulting in selective IRF7 activation and IFN-I production, in the absence of other inflammatory cytokine responses. To elucidate pDC immunomodulatory functions, we developed a mouse model in which IRF7 signaling is restricted to pDC. Despite undetectable levels of IFN-I protein, pDC-restricted IRF7 signaling controlled both viruses and was sufficient to protect mice from lethal CHIKV infection. Early pDC IRF7-signaling resulted in amplification of downstream antiviral responses, including an accelerated natural killer (NK) cell-mediated type II IFN response. These studies revealed the dominant, yet indirect role of pDC IRF7-signaling in directing both type I and II IFN responses during arbovirus infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34273.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses, like the ones responsible for the tropical diseases dengue and chikungunya, are parasites of living cells.

The issue is timely since climate change is allowing the mosquitos that transmit dengue and chikungunya to live in new places, exposing more people to these serious infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>virology</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-JCJC-EXAMIN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dreux</surname><given-names>Marlène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003323</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hepatites Virales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANRS-AO 2016-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dreux</surname><given-names>Marlène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dreux</surname><given-names>Marlène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14-CE14-0015-02 CHIKV-Viro-Immuno</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo study of arbovirus infections reveals the dominant role of pDC IRF7-signaling in directing both type I and II IFN responses, and leading to viral control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon sensing invading viruses, host cells produce type I interferons (IFNs), leading to the expression of an array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). This first-line response suppresses viral spread by generating an antiviral state within host cells, and supports the initiation of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>). Viral sensing may involve non-hematopoietic or hematopoietic cells that are targets of infection. Specific pathogen-associated motifs, such as viral nucleic acids, are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, which can be cytoplasmic (e.g. retinoic inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors, and NOD-like Receptors) or endosomal (e.g. Toll-like receptors; TLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen and Thomsen, 2012</xref>). Due to the potency of these innate responses, most viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert or evade pathogen-sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GarciaGarcía-Sastre, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We and others have recently highlighted the existence of alternative or indirect pathogen-sensing mechanisms that circumvents cell-intrinsic viral evasion mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). Such alternative pathways involve the sensing of infected target cells by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a DC subtype specialized in the production of robust level of type I IFNs (referred herein to as IFN-I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). Notably, this was illustrated in the context of dengue virus (DENV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which represents global health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Recent in vitro work highlighted a newly defined mode of pDC activation, which is mediated primarily by non-infectious immature DENV particles and requires physical cell-cell contact with DENV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Décembre et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, such cell-cell contact-dependent activation of pDCs has also been reported for several other genetically distant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, DENV, like some other viruses, does not to directly infect pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Décembre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). We thus aimed to test how such indirect cell-cell sensing of viral pathogens by pDCs, in the absence of pDC infection, engages host mechanisms for in vivo viral clearance.</p><p>pDCs function as sentinels of viral infection, predominantly via recognition of single-stranded RNA and unmethylated CpG containing DNA by endosomal TLR7 and TLR9, respectively. Activation of TLR7 or TLR9 results in copious secretion of IFN-I as well as other proinflammatory cytokines (notably TNFα), driven by the transcription factor(s) interferon regulatory factor (IRF)−7 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, despite the inherent ability of pDCs to produce both IFN-I and NF-κB-induced cytokines, previous studies have suggested a ‘bifurcated’ pattern of TLR7/9 signaling, where IFN-I production may occur in the absence of NF-κB activation, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). The production of IFN-I or pro-inflammatory cytokines may in part be dependent on the sub-cellular compartment in which these TLRs encounter activating signal, as CpG-A accumulates in early endosomes to induce IFN-I whereas CpG-B aggregates in endolysosomes to activate NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). In the context of viral infection, pDCs exposed to cell-associated Hepatitis C virus produced IFN-I but not NF-κB-dependent cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dental et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these observations, the consequences of pDC IFN-I production in the absence of NF-κB induction remain unclear, and have not yet been shown to be sufficient for in vivo viral control.</p><p>Herein, we show that indirect activation of pDCs by contact with DENV or CHIKV infected cells results in an IRF7-induced IFN response, in the absence of NF-κB inflammatory responses. We developed a novel mouse model where <italic>Irf7</italic> expression is pDC-restricted, that is, <italic>Irf3<sup>-/-</sup>;Irf7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double knockout mice, with <italic>Irf7</italic> expression driven under the pDC-specific promoter <italic>Sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin H</italic> (<italic>Siglech</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blasius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takagi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). We demonstrated that pDC-restricted IRF7-induced signaling is sufficient to achieve in vivo control of DENV and CHIKV infections. We further elucidated that the early pDC IRF7-mediated response accelerates type II IFN (IFNγ) responses via natural killer (NK) cell activation, thus positioning pDCs as a cell type that regulates the interplay between type I and type II IFN responses in the control of these viral infections, an immune axis that is independent of other sources of type I IFN or pDC-derived NF-κB-induced cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-cell sensing of DENV-infected cells does not induce inflammatory NF-κB responses by pDCs</title><p>We previously reported that ex vivo activation of an antiviral response by pDCs requires physical contact with DENV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Décembre et al., 2014</xref>). Prior studies suggested that pDC TLR7/9 signaling differentially induced IRF7 and/or NF-κB, depending on the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). Thus, we determined relative pDC secretion of representative NF-κB-induced (TNFα) and IRF7-induced (IFNα) cytokines in response to DENV. The sensing of DENV-infected cells by human pDCs failed to induce TNFα secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was in contrast to the robust TNFα production triggered by direct TLR7 stimuli, including the synthetic ligand imiquimod (IMQ) and influenza A [Flu], which directly activates pDCs as cell-free virus as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Décembre et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>pDC activation by DENV, the result of cell-cell transfer of TLR7 ligands, may occur more slowly than direct activation by cell-free stimuli. To assess if differential kinetics of pDC activation underlie the difference in TNFα production, we evaluated pre-treatment of human pDCs with low-dose IFNβ, prior to coculture with infected cells. Such pre-treatment regimens have been previously shown to accelerate both IFNα and TNFα production in response to influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phipps-Yonas et al., 2008</xref>). While IFNβ pretreatment accelerated the kinetics of pDC-derived IFNα (all stimuli) and TNFα production (IMQ/Flu), we observed minimal TNFα production in response to DENV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These observations imply that the defect in DENV-mediated TNFα induction by pDCs might be due to the indirect mechanism of stimulation. Furthermore, we showed that pDC TNFα levels in response to IMQ were not diminished in presence of DENV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Together, these results indicated that DENV is neither promoting nor preventing the activation of NF-κB-induced TNFα production by pDCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34273.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lack of NF-κB response by pDCs in ex vivo coculture with DENV infected cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of IFNα and TNFα in supernatants of human pDCs cocultured with DENV-infected (DENV cells) or uninfected BHK-21 cells (Mock), in presence of synthetic TLR7 agonist: Imiquimod; IMQ; 1 µg/mL or influenza infectious supernatant; Flu; 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> FFU.

The initial sites of CHIKV replication (i.e. the infection site: skin/muscle and muscle) displayed relatively higher viral titers as compared to more distal sites (i.e. the spleen and liver), where virus was barely detectable at 48 h p.i. in pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

This discrepancy between DENV and CHIKV infections likely reflects the greater impact of IFN-I signaling in CHIKV versus DENV infection and/or a differential contribution of the alternate IRF-mediated signal transduction.

We provide compelling evidence that pDCs are a key cell type in the initiation of antiviral responses to these two distinct RNA viruses. We demonstrate that pDC activation by DENV/CHIKV is characterized by IRF7-prioritized signaling, while passively excluding NF-κB-mediated responses. Despite undetectable levels of systemic IFN-I, pDC IRF7 signaling is critical for the induction of a potent antiviral response. This might reflect a local pDC IFN-I response and is in keeping with the requirement for physical contact with infected cells to activate pDCs, in turn inducing a potent ISG response. Notably, pDC-IRF7 activation accelerates NK-mediated IFN-II induction, which assists in control of viremia.</p><p>pDCs have previously been demonstrated to be required for the control of several viral infections, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). In contrast, others reported that pDCs are dispensable and/or do not contribute to IFN-I production in the case of certain infections, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Prete et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GeurtsvanKessel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jewell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumagai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swiecki et al., 2013</xref>), which may be a reflection of viral replication mechanisms, inoculum size, or location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Swiecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swiecki et al., 2013</xref>). These observations bring the emerging concept that while antiviral response (i.e. IFN-I production) in infected cells acts as a first line defense, pDCs may serve as a failsafe, triggered upon systemic infection and therefore failure of viral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GarciaGarcía-Sastre, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomasello et al., 2014</xref>). This assumption is in line with the multiple inhibitory mechanisms of antiviral sensing by viral proteins expressed by infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GarciaGarcía-Sastre, 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, previous investigations have primarily demonstrated the importance of pDCs in viral control by depletion of pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). Here, we validated a model consisting of a pDC-restricted IFN response, which offers a unique opportunity to define pDC function. This new model also permitted the study of the possible cryptic pDC-mediated control of certain infections. For instance, pDC antiviral function might be masked due to the homeostasis of the innate immunity, including an enhanced response by other cell types when pDCs are depleted.</p><p>We demonstrated that pDCs are sufficient to initiate early control of viral infections, via induction of IRF7-prone signaling. In this mouse model, the restoration of <italic>Irf7</italic> expression in pDCs does not reflect control under the endogenous promoter, as the <italic>Irf7</italic> gene is under the control of the pDC-specific <italic>Siglech</italic> promoter. However, <italic>Irf7</italic> overexpression artifacts are avoided in the pDC:IRF7+ model as <italic>Irf7</italic> steady-state expression is reduced under the control of the <italic>Siglech</italic> promoter relative to the <italic>Irf7</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Siglech</italic> expression by pDCs is inversely correlated to ISG upregulation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), in agreement with prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puttur et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, while systemic IFN-I was not detectable in response to DENV/CHIKV infection, the pDC-IRF7 response rapidly and potently induces a broad array of ISGs in multiple organs, dependent on IFN-I signaling. Therefore, in line with our ex vivo results in this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Décembre et al., 2014</xref>), we propose that pDCs respond in a contact-dependent manner to infected cells, and thus induce highly localized IFN-dependent responses. Importantly, this response is sufficient to impart a large-scale antiviral response, which protects from viral infections.</p><p>The engagement of TLR7/9 leading to IFN-I production and NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines by pDCs may affect downstream immunological parameters, such as for example, B cell differentiation induced by pDC response to influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jego et al., 2003</xref>). We observed that pDCs fail to respond via NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses to DENV/CHIKV-infected cells, indicating that pDC TLR7 signaling induced by these viruses primarily leads to IRF7 induction. Consistently, on the whole-organism level, while ectopic IRF7 expression in pDCs fully restores ISG responses, NF-κB responses to DENV were absent in both pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> and Irf3/7 DKO mice, thus underlining the importance of the IRF7 and dispensability of the NF-κB responses in pDC-mediated control of DENV and CHIKV infections. Our results also imply that NF-κB induction by these viruses in other cell types likely requires cross-talk between IRF3 and NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freaney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwanaszko and Kimmel, 2015</xref>).</p><p>While pDC IFN-I responses were important in early control of both DENV and CHIKV infections in vivo, substantial differences were observed in the overall outcome of infections. CHIKV infections were invariably lethal in the Irf3/7 DKO genetic background, and pDC IFN-I responses provided 100% protection to this lethal phenotype. By contrast, DENV infections were well-controlled even in Irf3/7 DKO mice by 72 h p.i. Notably, pDC IFN-I responses lead to substantial control of DENV viremia at time points intermediate between WT and Irf3/7 DKO mice (~42–48 hr). In our study, the lethal phenotype in CHIKV infection in Irf3/7 DKO mice correlated with substantially higher viral titers, as compared to DENV levels. Interestingly, blockade of IFN-I signaling in Irf3/7 DKO mice only increased viremia in situations where lower basal viral titers were observed: for example, DENV infections in all organs, or CHIKV viral titers in the liver. We thus suggest that the persistence of IFN-I-mediated viral control under these conditions depends on IRF5 or IRF1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lazear et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rudd et al., 2012</xref>), as control of flaviviral infections is still contingent on IFNAR signaling in the absence of <italic>Irf3/Irf7</italic> expression.

In agreement, we observe an IFN-II response in DENV-infected Irf3/7 DKO mice peaking at ~42 h p.i., which is largely absent in WT mice. Importantly, the antiviral IFN-II response is accelerated in pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> mice relative to Irf3/7 DKO mice. These pDC-regulated IFN-II responses are consistent with prior work showing a defect in type II IFN activation in a pDC-deficient mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guillerey et al., 2012</xref>). We demonstrated that IFNγ production in DENV-infected pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> mice is largely mediated by NK cells in the spleen, the primary site of DENV replication. These activated NK cells mediate downstream IFN-II responses that contribute to control of DENV viremia, in accordance with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa et al., 2017</xref>). A similar decrease in viremia was observed in CHIKV-infected pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> mice depleted of NK cells, although these results did not reach statistical significance. DENV may be more sensitive to type II IFN signaling (relative to type I IFN) compared to CHIKV, as DENV infections cause higher lethality in <italic>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, a situation that is reversed in the context of CHIKV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shresta et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, IFNγ production by NK cells was not observed in the blood, a site of low DENV viremia, likely indicating a necessity for NK cells to be closely apposed to DENV-infected cells and/or DENV-activated cells to achieve NK cell activation of IFN-II responses. We also observed an association with other immune cell parameters, including a pDC IRF7-mediated influx of neutrophils and monocyte activation in the spleens of DENV-infected mice. While some reports suggested that type I IFN directly contributes to NK cell response, NF-κB-dependent cytokines are well-known to regulate IFNγ production by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schulthess et al., 2012</xref>). Along the same lines, in vitro studies suggested that pDCs act in concert with monocytes to potentiate NK-cell-mediated IFNγ production in the context of HCV and DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies are required to determine how DENV/CHIKV-activated pDCs can directly augment NK cell IFNγ responses, or whether pDC-produced type I IFN acts through other cell types and attendant NF-κB-dependent cytokine responses for this amplification of type II induction.</p><p>The ability to segregate NF-κB and IRF7 responses may have potential use in developing novel therapies.

This is juxtaposed with pDC-derived IFN responses supporting viral clearance while avoiding possible inflammatory responses. As arboviral infections tend to be acute, rather than chronic diseases, this study provides an important indication of how early viral control may be mediated by one of the key drivers of the IFN response, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Huh7.5.1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_E049">CVCL_E049</ext-link>), Vero cells (CLS Cat# 605372/p622_VERO, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0059">CVCL_0059</ext-link>), and BHK-21 cells (ATCC Cat# CCL-10, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1915">CVCL_1915</ext-link>) were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units (U)/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies).

Viral stocks were titered on Huh7.5.1 cells, as described below, and adjusted to 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> focus-forming units (ffu)/mL.</p><p>CHIKV-21 viral stocks, used for all in vivo infections, were prepared from clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schilte et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, CHIKV-21 was propagated in C6/36 mosquito cells, and infectious supernatants were harvested, clarified through a 0.2 µm filter, and frozen at −80°C until titration and/or use. Recombinant CHIKV-GFP, which expresses GFP under a subgenomic promoter (CHIKV-GFP 5’), was generated from a full-length infectious cDNA clone provided by S. Higgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vanlandingham et al., 2005</xref>) and was used for all CHIKV in vitro mouse studies. Briefly, CHIKV-GFP 5’ plasmid was linearized with <italic>NotI</italic> (New England Biolabs) and RNA transcripts were produced and purified using mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion). RNA transcripts were introduced into BHK-21 cells by electroporation (using 1 µg RNA to transfect 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells). Virus-containing supernatants were collected when the viral cytopathic effect reached 75% of transfected cells, clarified through a 0.2 µm filter (Corning Inc), and frozen at −80°C until titration and/or use. Viral stocks were titered on Vero cells, as described below.</p><p>DENV infectivity titers in concentrated culture supernatants or mouse organ homogenates were determined by end-point dilution using Huh 7.5.1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Décembre et al., 2014</xref>). Foci forming units (ffu) were detected 72 hr after infection. Briefly, Huh7.5.1 cells were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized by incubation for 7 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton. Cells were then blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA for 15 min and incubated for 1 hr with mouse anti-E glycoprotein (clone 3H5) hybridoma supernatant diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated 1 hr with secondary Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Virally-infected foci of E-positive cells were determined using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope.</p><p>CHIKV infectivity titers in culture supernatants or mouse organ homogenates were titrated as TCID<sub>50</sub> endpoint on Vero cells using a standard procedure. Serial 10-fold dilutions of supernatants were added in six replicates in 96-well plates seeded with 10<sup>4</sup> Vero cells. The cytopathic effect was scored 5 days after infection and the titers were calculated by determining the last dilution giving 50% of wells with cells displaying a cytopathic effect.

Viral titers and cytokine levels were considered non-parametric due to the presence of many data points at the assay detection limits; therefore, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn’s multiple comparison corrections were performed on this data. Viral RNA levels and transcript fold changes, as log-normal parametric data, were log-transformed prior to analysis using parametric tests. Kinetic analyses of ex vivo pDC cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) were analyzed by one-way ANOVA parametric tests of AUC (area under the curve). Parametric tests were: unpaired Student’s t test for comparisons of two conditions, one- or two-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak multiple comparison correction for comparison of multiple conditions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jonathan J Miner (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript was reviewed by two experts in the field and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). All reviewers felt the manuscript has the potential to be an important contribution to the literature. However, the reviewers had several comments that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. While the complete, unedited reviews are given below, the reviewers and the BRE member have come up with a consensus statement that outlines the priority issues that need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) While describing experiments with two viruses is a strength of the manuscript, the manuscript would be improved by focusing on one virus throughout the manuscript.

This difference in ages can make a substantial impact on vulnerability to viral infections (for example, during West Nile virus infection, infection at age 5 weeks results in ~90% lethality, whereas infection at 8 weeks results in ~75% lethality.) Instead of providing a range of ages, could the authors be more precise about the age of infected mice of each genotype?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Webster et al. describes the assessment of pDCs in two different arboviruses: dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) through the role of IRF7-driven IFN production. In general, the study is technically well-conducted and to decipher the immunomodulatory functions of pDCs in arbovirus sensing, authors generated the pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> mouse model in C57BL/6 mice in order to restrict the role of IRF7 to pDCs. A wealth of data was produced that showed an indirect role for pDC IRF7-signalling in both viruses. However, the authors should consider removing one virus to streamline the datasets to improve clarity. As it stand, the datasets are scattered and all over the place due to the different viral characteristics of the 2 viruses.

Insufficient data points for proper statistics to be performed that weakened the study. Have the authors considered putting the levels of ISGs from 2 different types of infections together as a comparative? This will be more insightful to understand the similar and different mechanistic effects of virus sensing on IRF signalling on pDCs. Heat-maps provided in Figure 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 suggest different signatures in terms of fold change.

For example, BHK21 cells were used as DENV-infected cells (Figure 1A-B) and Huh7.5.1 cells were used as CHIKV-infected cells (Figure 7E) in cocultures with human pDCs. However, the xenogeneic nature of the DENV cocultures was purposeful, to allow qPCR analysis specifically of the human pDCs rather than DENVinfected cells by using species-specific primer sets (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Importantly, this manuscript and prior work (Decembre et al., 2014) have demonstrated that pDC responses are robust and not dependent on specific coculture conditions (e.g., tissue origin and/or species of the virally-infected cells).</p><p>Additionally, as suggested by this reviewer, we performed a direct comparison of pDC response to cells infected by either DENV or CHIKV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the IFNα levels are within the same range.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34273.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of IFNα by ELISA in supernatants of human pDCs cocultured with Huh7.5.1 cells infected by either CHIKV or DENV, or uninfected.</title><p>Cells were infected 48 hours prior to cocultures.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34273-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>Further, we performed new additional experiments and statistical analyses for ex vivo studies of TNFα versus IFNα production as well as other ex vivo studies, now included in:</p><p>- new Figure 1 panels A and B</p><p>- new Figure 3 panels A and B</p><p>These panels include additional new results.</p><p>For the comparison of pDC cytokine production across mouse genotypes, rank-order statistical analysis (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis) was necessary due to many non-parametric data points at the limit of detection of the ELISA assay. Strong statistically significant differences were observed when comparing IFNα secretion between only pDC:IRF7<sup>+</sup> and Irf3<sup>-/-</sup>/7<sup>-/-</sup> pDCs in response to various TLR7/8 stimuli. However, the inclusion of WT pDCs, with greater IFNα secretion in these analyses, distorted the rank orders in a fashion that very large sample sizes would be necessary to ascertain statistical differences between pDC:IRF7<sup>+</sup> and Irf3<sup>-/-</sup>/7<sup>-/-</sup> pDCs (n&gt;8 independent pDC isolations). We believe it is more informative to include data from WT pDCs in these analyses, even at the expense of losing statistical power for the pDC:IRF7<sup>+</sup> versus Irf3<sup>-/-</sup>/7<sup>-/-</sup> comparison, especially as the pattern of IFNα secretion was broadly similar across a range of TLR7/8 stimuli (DENV, Flu, IMQ, R848).</p><p>We have now included new Figure 7 panels A-to-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 3 to 7 on in vivo responses of DENV and CHIKV in pDC:Irf7<sup>+</sup> mice – a mix of DENV and CHIKV datasets are distributed between the main and supplementary figures.

In vivo results now include additional data and statistical analysis:</p><p>- in new Figure 2 panels B and C, with inclusion of new data;</p><p>- in new Figure 6 panels B-to-E and corresponding Figure 6—figure supplement 2, with inclusion of new mouse cohort.</p><p>The comparison for ISGs would be interesting but the study for CHIKV infection was not designed for this type of analysis, so none of these samples or data are available. We agree that, moving forward, extending these types of analyses of IFN signaling to viruses other than DENV will be quite interesting in the future.</p><p>The heat-maps from new Figure 3E-G (previous Figure 4) and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are indeed presented differently: results in new Figure 3E-G are expressed as Z-score and are magnitude-independent while the fold change in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 provides information on the magnitude of the change. The reasoning for these distinct displays was to show the general pattern of ISG/NF-κB gene change in Figure 3E-G, while providing the data on the magnitude of the response for those interested in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. This has been clarified in the text, as follows: “(Figure 3E-G, expressed as magnitude-independent Z score, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1, expressed as magnitude-dependent fold-change)”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
