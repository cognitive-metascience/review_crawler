The unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> divides by multiple fission, wherein a ‘counting’ mechanism couples mother cell-size to cell division number allowing production of uniform-sized daughters. We identified a sizer protein, CDKG1, that acts through the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting. Loss of CDKG1 leads to fewer mitotic divisions and large daughters, while mis-expression of CDKG1 causes supernumerous mitotic divisions and small daughters. The concentration of nuclear-localized CDKG1 in pre-mitotic cells is set by mother cell size, and its progressive dilution and degradation with each round of cell division may provide a link between mother cell-size and mitotic division number. Cell-size-dependent accumulation of limiting cell cycle regulators such as CDKG1 is a potentially general mechanism for size control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10767.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10767.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10767.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells are programmed to maintain a certain size. This property, known as size control, is achieved by balancing growth and division, such that a cell will only divide after it reaches a certain size. However, and despite years of research, it is largely unknown how cells sense their size (or growth) to be able to divide accordingly. One theory proposes that there is a “sizer” protein inside cells, and that cells measure the abundance of this protein and use it to link cell size to the process of division. However, the existence of such a protein remained unproven.</p><p>Li, Liu et al. have now used the cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas to identify a candidate sizer protein. Chlamydomonas cells, like many other algae, can grow to become very large mother cells that then divide one or more times in succession to produce many daughter cells. Larger mother cells undergo more divisions than smaller mother cells in order to produce daughter cells of a correct size. Using a range of genetic and biochemical techniques, Li, Liu et al. identified a protein that is produced in Chlamydomonas cells just before they begin to divide. Larger mother cells contain more of this protein than smaller cells and the protein encourages cells to divide. For example, mutant cells that lack this protein divided too few times, while cells that produce too much of it divided too many times.</p><p>The protein, called CDKG1, belongs to a family of proteins that regulate cell division in many organisms. CDKG1 is a kinase – an enzyme that alters the activity of other proteins by adding a phosphate group on to them. In Chlamydomonas, CDKG1 couples cell size to cell division by altering the activity of an important protein called the retinoblastoma-related protein that controls cell division in numerous organisms. This protein is also frequently disrupted in cancers in humans.</p><p>These findings shed new light on a molecular pathway for size control. Future work will need to determine how the accumulation of CDKG1 links to the size of a mother cell and how it is inactivated once daughter cells reach the appropriate size.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10767.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10767.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>D cyclin</kwd><kwd>multiple fission</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>algae</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-05-196-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umen</surname><given-names>James G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM069521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umen</surname><given-names>James G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CDKG1 is a D-cyclin dependent retinoblastoma related protein kinase whose abundance scales with cell size and controls cell division cycle number during multiple fission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Active maintenance of cell size has been observed across eukaryotic taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tzur et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Umen, 2005</xref>), yet the molecular bases for eukaryotic cell-size homeostasis have not been extensively investigated outside of fungi. Cell-size checkpoints were first described in budding and fission yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fantes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et al., 1977</xref>) and subsequently investigated using a variety of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). Bistable switches that control cell cycle transitions are increasingly well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kapuy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pomerening et al., 2003</xref>), but proteins or other molecules that couple cell size to cell cycle activation (e.g. ‘sizer’ proteins) have been more difficult to identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>No consensus exists for the mechanisms underlying cell size control in budding yeast, though several molecular pathways have been found to impact cell size. These include a regulatory loop involving accumulation of G1 cyclins and the removal of the inhibitory protein Whi5p from the transcriptional activator SBF that controls S phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Talia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). A phosphatase, Rts1p, appears to function upstream of this loop through the transcription factor Ace2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Talia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zapata et al., 2014</xref>). Budding yeast cell size control is also influenced by ribosome biogenesis that acts to modulate growth rate and the critical size at which cells enter S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez-Herreros et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jorgensen et al., 2004</xref>). It is still unclear what is the parameter monitored by size checkpoints in budding yeast. In fission yeast, it was proposed that cell size is controlled by polar localization of the kinase Pom1 that establishes an inhibitory gradient which blocks the initiation of cytokinesis in the mid-cell region, thereby establishing a minimum length for cells prior to division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). However, this result has been challenged by new work showing that cells may instead sense their surface area through the local concentration of a kinase cdr2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). One complication in yeasts is that size thresholds for cell cycle transitions are modulated by cell growth rates, a property that adds an additional layer of complexity to size control networks in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (Chlamydomonas) is a well-developed model organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris, 2001</xref>) that is highly amenable to the investigation of cell-size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Umen, 2005</xref>). Like many chlorophyte algae and diverse unicellular eukaryotes, Chlamydomonas cells proliferate using a multiple fission cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisova and Zachleder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavalier-Smith, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cross and Umen, 2015</xref>). Multiple fission is characterized by a prolonged G1 period during which cells can grow more than ten-fold in size. At the end of G1 mother cells undergo a series of rapid alternating S phases and mitoses (S/M) to produce 2<sup>n</sup> uniform-sized daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Umen, 2005</xref>). Size control is evident during S/M because larger mother cells divide more times than smaller mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craigie and Cavalier-Smith, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donnan and John, 1983</xref>). Although size control mutants have been identified as described below, the mechanisms by which mother cells 'count' the correct number divisions or regulate daughter cell-size remain unclear. A second key attribute of multiple fission is that in diurnally-synchronized cultures growth occurs during the light period, while S/M phase occurs during the dark period with no additional growth of newborn daughter cells until the next light period. Under these conditions daughter cell-size is a direct readout of the mitotic size control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Umen, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Cell size control in Chlamydomonas also occurs during mid-G1 at a checkpoint termed <italic>commitment</italic>. Daughter cells pass commitment when they have attained a minimum size that is about twice their average birth size. Committed cells remain in G1 for an additional five to eight hours where they may continue to grow, and will proceed to divide at least once, even if no further growth takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cross and Umen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donnan and John, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oldenhof et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spudich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Umen, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Previously we found that the Chlamydomonas retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway regulates both commitment size and cell division number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Umen and Goodenough, 2001</xref>). Mutants that are missing the retinoblastoma related (RBR) protein MAT3 pass commitment at an abnormally small size, remain in G1 for a normal post-commitment length of time, and then divide too many times during S/M to produce small daughters. These defects can be suppressed by mutations in <italic>DP1</italic> or <italic>E2F1</italic> that encode subunits of a conserved heterodimeric E2F-DP transcription factor that binds directly to MAT3/RBR to form a stable complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olson et al., 2010</xref>). To date no upstream regulators that integrate cell size information into the RBR pathway have been identified.</p><p>Here we describe CDKG1, a mitotic sizer protein that functions through the RBR pathway. CDKG1 is a nuclear-localized, D-cyclin dependent MAT3/RBR kinase whose mutant and mis-expression phenotypes indicate that its abundance is limiting for mother cell division number and mitotic size control. The production of CDKG1 was found to scale with mother cell size and was partially regulated through its long 3’ untranslated region. After each round of mitosis the amount of CDKG1 protein per nucleus decreased until it disappeared upon mitotic exit. Cell-size-dependent production of regulatory proteins is a potentially general means of linking cell size to downstream cell cycle events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CDKG1 is required for mitotic size control</title><p>In order to identify size regulators in Chlamydomonas we performed an insertional mutagenesis screen using the selectable marker <italic>NIT1</italic> to generate tagged mutants in a <italic>nit1-305</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tam and Lefebvre, 1995</xref>).

CDKG1 was found associated with MAT3/RBR only in S/M phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) where it is most highly expressed (see below) and not in a control extract prepared from untagged cells in S/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Previously we were able to detect cell-cycle controlled phosphorylation of MAT3/RBR that could be qualitatively observed by migration changes on SDS-PAGE gels in synchronized cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olson et al., 2010</xref>). We constructed isogenic strains where a HA-tagged MAT3/RBR transgene was in a wild type or <italic>cdkg1-2</italic> background and compared the phosphorylation levels in daughters and in S/M phase populations. Although we observed S/M phase hyperphosphorylation of MAT3/RBR, we did not observe a detectable change in MAT3/RBR phosphorylation in the <italic>cdkg1-2</italic> mutant compared with controls. These results indicate that CDKG1 is not the predominant kinase for MAT3/RBR, and that like its animal homologs, MAT3/RBR is likely to be a substrate for multiple CDKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together our data suggest that MAT3/RBR is a substrate for CDKG1 during S/M phase but that CDKG1 is not the dominant kinase for the MAT3/RBR complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CDKG1 mRNA and protein accumulation are cell-cycle regulated</title><p>The expression pattern of CDKG1 during the cell cycle was determined by synchronizing <italic>cdkg1-2::HA-gCDKG1</italic> cultures and Western blotting of samples prepared from different time points.

However, because cells increase in mass by about ten-fold during G1 phase, loading by equal cell number provides an indication of how much total CDKG1 protein is present in each cell. HA-CDKG1 was nearly undetectable during early G1 prior to Commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> lanes 1–4) and was expressed at very low levels in post-Commitment G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> lanes 5–7).

Reciprocal swaps of promoter and 3’UTR sequences generated <italic>AR:luc:G1</italic> and <italic>pG1:luc:RBCS</italic>. All four constructs were transformed into wild-type cells and random transformants were tested to identify positive clones. When the <italic>CDKG1</italic> promoter (pG1) was used to express luciferase we were unable to detect expression above background even after screening hundreds of clones suggesting that pG1 is a relatively weak promoter. However, for both <italic>AR:luc:RBCS</italic> and <italic>AR:luc:G1</italic> we identified transformants with luciferase activity. Using these strains we measured luciferase activity in synchronized cultures growing in a 12 hr light/12 hr dark regime. <italic>AR:luc:RBCS</italic> transformants showed an immediate increases in luciferase activity at the beginning of the light period and slow decline that continued into the dark period. In contrast, <italic>AR:luc:G1</italic> expression remained low until the end of the light phase when it increased and peaked near the time of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We measured mRNA from both of these luciferase constructs using qRT-PCR and compared them to the mRNA levels of the endogenous <italic>CDKG1</italic> mRNA in synchronized cultures. <italic>AR:luc:G1</italic> and endogenous <italic>CDKG1</italic> mRNA showed the same accumulation profiles suggesting that the <italic>CDKG1</italic> 3’ UTR sequence exerts its effects on mRNA accumulation by regulating the stability of mRNAs in a cell cycle dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CDKG1 production scales with mother cell-size</title><p>We next determined how the abundance of CDKG1 is related to mother cell size. To do so, we synchronized the <italic>cdkg1-2::HA-gCDKG1</italic> strain and generated two populations of mother cells— large and small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). The large mother cells (population III) were obtained by leaving the cultures in the light for a normal diurnal period of 14 hr, while the small mother cells (population II) were obtained by dark shifting a culture at 7 hr in the light. Both populations II and III divided at the same time (13–15 hr), but the large mother cells divided three or four times while the small mother cells divided one or two times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). A control population of cells (I) was dark-shifted prior to Commitment (3 hr light), and had no dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>).</p><p>We prepared extracts from each of the three populations of cells sampled at 13 hr and 15 hr that correspond to late G1 and S/M respectively for populations II and III. HA-CDKG1 was barely detectable in non-dividing control cells from population I (pre-Commitment cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> lanes 1, 2) indicating that its expression is correlated with cell division. In contrast, both small and large mother cells expressed CDKG1 just prior to and during cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> lanes 3–6). Moreover, the amount of HA-CDKG1 that accumulated in small mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, lanes 3, 4) was lower than that in large mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> lanes 5, 6). This size-dependent difference was evident even when equal protein was loaded from each sample meaning that the total concentration of CDKG1 is higher in large versus small mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, upper panels, lanes 3, 4 versus 5, 6). Thus both cellular concentration and total amounts of CDKG1 per cell scale allometrically (i.e. non-linearly) with mother cell size. This allometric scaling relationship was also reflected in <italic>CDKG1</italic> mRNA abundance that also increased relative to an internal control in large versus small mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to bulk protein observable on coomassie-stained gels CDKG1 accumulation does not scale linearly with mother cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We also asked whether the CDKG1 accumulation pattern was distinct from two other proteins, histone H3 and alpha-tubulin, neither of which is expected to play a role in cell-size control. The alpha tubulin mRNA has a cell cycle regulated accumulation pattern with a peak during S/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zones et al., 2015</xref>) as does histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waterborg et al., 1995</xref>). Quantitative Western blotting from the same populations of non-dividing cells, small mother cells and large mother cells revealed that the scaling relationship of CDKG1 with cell cycle stage and cell size is different from histone H3 and tubulin where the former protein had an approximately fixed amount per cell and the latter was produced proportionally to total protein biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the allometric accumulation pattern of CDKG1 where the amount made is not linear with respect to bulk protein and cell size suggests that its abundance in mother cells might be related to its role in cell size control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CDKG1 is nuclear-localized and is diluted and degraded during cell division</title><p>To gain more detailed insight into how CDKG1 is temporally regulated we determined its accumulation pattern in individual <italic>cdkg1-2::HA-gCDKG1</italic> cells using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) with anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We determined the relative nuclear concentration of HA-CDKG1 in dividing cells and found that it gradually decreased with each round of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To determine whether the decline of nuclear CDKG1 concentration was attributable to dilution and/or protein turnover we first measured the nuclear volumes (N) and total cell volume (C) from mitotic cells in which a nuclear-localized ble-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuhrmann et al., 1999</xref>) was constitutively expressed and used to mark the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When we measured N/C in mitotic cells we found that it remained constant and that nuclear volume halved with each round of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This finding indicates that total nuclear volume in dividing cells is fixed, and that changes in CDKG1 concentration were due to a small but significant amount of net degradation as cells progressed through each round of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, all the CDKG1 protein that was synthesized in cells appears to have been made in mother cells just prior to S/M and it was not replaced as cells progressed through division. While the absolute concentration drop in CDKG1 was relatively shallow with each round of S/M, its concentration with respect to nuclear DNA dropped by more than two fold with each cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and this ratiometric decrease could potentially be used as a threshold signal to control mitotic exit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mis-expression of CDKG1 causes a small-cell phenotype</title><p>The large-cell phenotype of <italic>cdkg1</italic> mutants, the cell-size dependent scaling of pre-mitotic CDKG1 production, and the dynamic changes in CDKG1 nuclear abundance with each round of division suggests that this protein might be limiting for normal mitotic cell division number and size control.

We next compared the HA-CDKG1 expression patterns from a complemented strain (<italic>cdkg1-2::HA-gCDKG1</italic>) where CDKG1 expression is controlled by its native promoters and UTRs, versus a wild-type strain expressing native CDKG1 and an exogenously integrated <italic>PL23:HA-CDKG1</italic> construct. In the complemented control strain <italic>CDKG1</italic> mRNA and HA-CDKG1 protein were detected almost exclusively in S/M phase cells with little or no expression in daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>).

Taken together our data indicate that CDKG1 is a limiting component of the normal S/M size control mechanism in Chlamydomonas, that its abundance is tightly controlled, and that its overexpression and/or prolonged expression during S/M phase causes extra cell divisions and a small-cell phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have made use of the uniquely accessible mitotic size control pathway of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> to identify a new cell-size regulator, CDKG1, whose activity enables mother cells to execute the correct number of mitotic cell divisions according to mother cell-size. Key properties of CDKG1 indicate that it couples mother cell size to the extent of cell division during S/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and mis-expression phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) show that while dispensable for overall cell cycle progression, CDKG1 is limiting for the normal number of S/M division cycles of mother cells and thereby acts as a determinant of daughter cell-size. The timing of CDKG1 expression is also consistent with its function as a size regulator during S/M phase: <italic>CDKG1</italic> message and protein accumulate in late G1 just before entry into S/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); nuclear CDKG1 is then diluted with each round of division until the end of S/M when it disappears in daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The loss of CDKG1 does not eliminate size control completely, but instead alters the normal set points that govern the relationship between mother cell size and cell division number. Thus, other mechanisms must exist that trigger exit from S/M in the absence of CDKG1, but do so prematurely. <italic>cdkg1</italic> mutant strains may be valuable for investigating this next layer of size control that operates when CDKG1 is missing.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10767.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for CDKG1 as a limiting size regulator for cell division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of cell cycle with kinetics of CDKG1 accumulation depicted by solid or dashed curves. Large mother cells accumulate higher concentrations of CDKG1 than small mother cells.

Interestingly, <italic>CDKG1</italic> abundance was at least partly controlled by its 3’ UTR that conferred a cell-cycle-specific expression pattern to a heterologous reporter gene similar to the expression pattern of endogenous <italic>CDKG1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We speculate that the unusually long and uridine-rich 3’ UTR of <italic>CDKG1</italic> plays an essential role in CDKG1 accumulation in mother cells, likely through the control of mRNA stability. Control of mRNA stability of cell cycle regulators is an important mechanism operating in early embryonic development at the midblastula transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>), but less is known how mRNA stability impacts somatic cell cycles where mRNAs for cyclins and CDKs such as the <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>CDK6</italic> are subject to cell-cycle-stage dependent differential turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshpande et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Understanding how the 3’ UTR of <italic>CDKG1</italic> confers a highly specific S/M phase expression pattern to its mRNA may shed light on how mRNA abundance is coupled to cell cycle progression in other contexts. Finally, we emphasize that mRNA abundance alone cannot explain the tightly controlled pattern of protein accumulation and degradation for CDKG1 where its net synthesis is restricted to a narrow window of time prior to S/M, its levels drop slowly during division, and it is completely eliminated in post-mitotic cells.</p><p>How might the abundance and turnover of CDKG1 mRNA and protein contribute to cell size control? A straightforward way of conceptualizing a sizer protein involves its synthesis in proportion to cell growth followed by triggering of a downstream cell cycle event when enough protein accumulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fantes et al., 1975</xref>). The G1 cyclin CLN3 in budding yeast has been proposed to function in this manner with its abundance being sensed through occupancy of nuclear DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). However, a mitotic 'sizer' in Chlamydomonas cannot simply trigger a single event, but must instead provide quantitative information so that mother cells execute the correct number of cell divisions. Cell division counting mechanisms exist in early embryonic cell cycles of some metazoans where a fixed number of rapid division cycles occurs prior to the midblastula transition that is triggered when the cytoplasmic to nuclear DNA ratio (N:C) reaches a specific value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). The ratio of CDKG1 to nuclear DNA changes dynamically during S/M as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, so a direct N:C sensing mechanism is possible. If a threshold amount of CDKG1 is required to initiate a new round of S/M, and the amount per nucleus decreases by over half with each division, then at some point the level of CDKG1 would fall below the critical amount. This model assumes that the main mode of reduction for CDKG1 is by dilution, but we also see some degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and possibly there is inactivation of a portion of CDKG1 with each round of S/M. Either of these latter two effects might account for larger mother cells needing proportionally more CDKG1 than smaller mother cells. For example a small mother cell undergoing one cycle of S/M might require <italic>one</italic> unit of CDKG1 (one division, two daughters); while a four-fold larger mother cell would require <italic>seven</italic> units of CDKG1 for executing a total of <italic>seven</italic> mitoses (1+2+4) to produce eight daughters. Alternatively, the allometric scaling of CDKG1 abundance might reflect a signal amplification process that increases the robustness of the system output (cell division number) by buffering what might otherwise be noisy fluctuations in CDKG1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Talia et al., 2007</xref>). Cell-size dependent effects on cell physiology are difficult to investigate, but do occur in other systems, such as yeast, where transcription can be size controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), and in animals, where bulk protein turnover rates appear to be cell-size dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conlon et al., 2001</xref>). Intriguingly, cell size is linked to developmental fate in the multicellular relative of Chlamydomonas, <italic>Volvox carteri</italic> where large post-mitotic daughters (&gt;8 µm diameter) differentiate into reproductive cells and small post-mitotic daughters (&lt;8 µm diameter) differentiate into sterile somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kirk et al., 1993</xref>). We speculate that this size-dependent differentiation may be driven by a modification of the CDKG1-D cyclin-MAT3/RBR pathway that is conserved in <italic>Volvox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prochnik et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, our data do not completely rule out more complicated and alternative models where other properties of CDKG1 besides its abundance, such as activation and inactivation by posttranslational modification or cyclin association, also contribute to its function in coupling mother cell size to cell division number.</p><p>Our model of allometric CDKG1 production and dilution can be compared to a recent model for size control in budding yeast where dilution of a negative cell cycle regulator, Whi5, provides a threshold triggering passage through Start that initiates the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). In the former case a positive regulator is titrated away to control cell cycle exit, while in the latter it is a negative regulator being titrated away to control cell cycle entry; but in both models a fixed amount of a limiting factor is being used to gauge an important cellular change such as DNA content or cell volume. Non-linear scaling relationships between regulatory proteins and other cell constituents may be a general way of converting continuously scaling features of cells such as size to digital behaviors such as cell division that require an all or none response.</p><p>In yeast and mammalian cells, cyclin accumulation is typically rate-limiting for cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan, 1997</xref>), but here we demonstrate that abundance of the CDK subunit, CDKG1, may control the extent of cell division. Similarly, overexpression of the human RB kinase CDK6 is associated with sporadic cases of lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corcoran et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayette et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with its role in regulating cell size and S/M phase entry upstream of MAT3/RBR, CDKG1 can directly phosphorylate RB/MAT3, and the simplest interpretation of our data is that the extent or rate of MAT3/RBR phosphorylation by CDKG1 on specific sites controls S/M phase entry. Although we could not detect changes in bulk phosphorylation patterns in MAT3/RBR caused by loss of CDKG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) this is not inconsistent with CDKG1 being a MAT3/ RBR kinase. Animal RBRs are phosphorylated on over a dozen sites by multiple CDK-cyclin complexes with site specificity, redundancy and function of individual phosphorylation sites still not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubin, 2013</xref>). MAT3/RBR has 16 predicted CDK phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Umen and Goodenough, 2001</xref>), any one of which might be a substrate for one or more CDKs and phosphatases. Indeed, at least three CDKs are likely to be active during S/M—CDKA1, CDKB1 and CDKG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tulin and Cross, 2014</xref>), with the first two having mRNAs that are expressed at several fold higher levels than that of <italic>CDKG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zones et al., 2015</xref>). We predict that CDKG1 complexed with D-type cyclins will target a single or small subset of these sites to influence the activity of the MAT3/RBR complex towards promotion of cell division, an idea that can be tested when the phosphorylation sites and kinases for MAT3/RBR are better understood. While CDKG1 may have substrates other than MAT3/RBR, it appears to act mainly through MAT3/RBR in size control since the <italic>cdkg1</italic> mutation is completely suppressed in <italic>cdkg1 mat3</italic> double mutants. If there are additional CDKG1 substrates that influence the cell cycle, they either function through the MAT3/RBR-E2F1-DP1 complex or play a relatively minor role in size control.</p><p>Previous work on Chlamydomonas RB pathway mutants revealed defects in commitment threshold size as well as defects in S/M checkpoint suggesting that these two size control points are at least partially coupled. Here we have identified <italic>cdkg1</italic> as a mutant that appears to affect only the S/M size control mechanism and not the size at which cells pass Commitment. Two lines of evidence support a specific role for CDKG1 in S/M size control. First, <italic>cdkg1</italic> mutants and <italic>CDKG1</italic> mis-expressing strains show daughter cell size phenotypes, but pass Commitment at close to wild-type size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Second, CDKG1 protein is produced in late G1 and S/M, and does not accumulate significantly at Commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, 4–6 hr). The identification of a separate S/M size control mechanism will enable future work aimed at dissecting the relationship between the Commitment and S/M sizers that both converge on the MAT3/RBR-E2F1-DP1 complex. It will also be interesting to determine how CDKG1 and the RB pathway connect to the NIMA related kinase, CNK2, that appears to function in both cell size and flagella length control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley and Quarmby, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Yeasts have a single key cell cycle CDK (CDC28/cdc2) while metazoans have additional accessory CDKs such as CDK2, CDK3, CDK4 and CDK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan, 1997</xref>) that have been proposed to be tied to the evolution of metazoan multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>). Our work with CDKG1 shows that unicellular eukaryotes also evolved complex cell cycle regulatory systems with multiple CDKs, and that this complexity was most likely lost in fungi rather than gained in metazoans. Moreover, the parallels between CDK4/6 and CDKG1 are striking: both are non-essential CDKs with variant PSTAIRE signature motifs; both bind specifically to and are activated by D-type cyclins; both phosphorylate RB-related proteins as their key substrates; and both are part of a system that integrates intra- or extra-cellular information (growth factors or cell size) into the cell cycle program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These similarities underscore the potential for Chlamydomonas to provide insights into cell cycle control mechanisms that evolved in ancestral single-celled eukaryotes prior to the divergence of major multicellular lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, culture conditions and transformation</title><p>The following <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> strains were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Stock Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chlamy.org/strains.html">http://www.chlamy.org/strains.html</ext-link>): CC1690 (21gr wild-type <italic>MT+</italic>), CC1691 (6145c wild-type <italic>MT-</italic>), CC125 (<italic>MT+</italic>), CC124 (<italic>MT-</italic>), CC2453 (<italic>nit1-305 MT-</italic>), CC3995 (<italic>mat3-4 nit1-305 MT+</italic>).

Quantification of HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity was done using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramoff et al., 2004</xref>). For quantitation of IF signals cells identified first from DIC images and data from all cells in a field were collected. Identical numbers of Z stacks for each cell were collected with identical settings (using untagged control samples to determine background) and converted to maximum projection images that were imported into ImageJ for further analysis. Cell boundaries were defined manually using the DIC image. Nuclear area was defined by automated segmentation of the DAPI signal. The total nuclear HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity was calculated as the portion of the 488nm signal that overlapped with the DAPI stained region of the cell. The nuclear area (A) was converted to the nuclear volume (V) using a formula that approximates nuclei as spheres V=4/3*(A/π)<sup>3/2</sup>. Nuclear concentrations of HA-CDKG1 were calculated as nuclear HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity divided by nuclear volume (V). Cells where at least three divisions were predicted to occur based mother size were used in order to allow meaningful comparisons of CDKG1 concentrations at different division numbers. Mean values of nuclear concentration of HA-CDKG1 in daughter cells were compared between dividing cells at different stages (2, 4, or 8 nuclei) using a non-parametric two-tailed t test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors take advantage of the powerful genetic advantages of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> to identify an exciting new player in the mechanism that couples cell growth to cell division. The kinase CDKG1, a divergent CDK, was identified from a screen for cell-size mutants. <italic>cdkg1</italic> mutants exhibit relatively normal growth through G1 and commitment, but fail to undergo the normal number of S/M cycles, resulting in larger than normal cells. CDKG1 can interact with RB and might be in a complex with CYCD3 and genetically, acts upstream of RB. The authors show that CDKG1 is required for execution of the normal number of reductional cell divisions that determine cell size, and, over-expression of CDKG1 causes reduced cell size. They propose a model by which CDKG levels act as a &quot;sizer&quot; and that dilution + degradation of CDKG sets a limit on the number of cell divisions once the concentration of CDKG is below a threshold, divisions stop.</p><p>Size control is an important (and currently hot) topic in cell and developmental biology. This work includes exciting and significant findings, and the genetic and biochemical analysis of CDKG1 and its interaction with MAT3 is sufficiently convincing that the paper should make a major impact. All three reviewers felt that several issues need to be dealt with before publication, however.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors postulate that CDKG1 levels scale with cell size and that this is a unique property of CDKG1 that is important for its role in cell size control. One concern is how accurate the quantification of CDKG protein and nuclear size derived from images can be. A second concern is whether CDKG is unique in its accumulation vis-à-vis cell size. It is possible that many other proteins scale with cell size, so the accumulation of CDKG1 in large cells may not be unique or relevant to cell size control. For example, the mother cell could be stockpiling many different proteins necessary for the subsequent S/M divisions. So it would be helpful to look at a few other proteins in mother cells that could be stockpiled, such as a histone (e.g., MBT work in Amodeo, PNAS, 2015) plasma membrane protein, or nuclear envelope protein. If numerous other proteins show the same behavior as CDKG1, it would be hard to conclude which protein is actually being measured.</p><p>2) In the author's model, CDKG1 is a limiting factor for S/M divisions, such that gradual depletion of CDKG1 causes cessation of division at a specific size. However, this cannot be completely true because cells carrying a deletion of CDKG1 nevertheless undergo several divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). If CDKG1 is limiting for cell division, how do cells completely lacking CDKG1 undergo division? The authors should address this issue in their discussion of the data. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref> is an important figure and should be moved out of the Supplemental Information.</p><p>3) How is [CDKG] actually measured in the cell to trigger a threshold effect on RB? What's the evidence that CDKB-phosphorylated RB acts in a dose dependent (or at least a threshold) manner to drive a cell cycle? This may be shown in the author's previous work, but if so, should be noted explicitly here.</p><p>4) The author's model is interesting and represents a reasonable interpretation of the data. Yet the data for the model are largely correlative. Also, the model relies, to a large extent, on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, which suggest that the amount of CDKG1 in the nucleus decreases with each division. However, there is a significant amount of scatter in the data, and comparative measurements of total fluorescence are always difficult to carry out in a reliable and accurate manner. So the authors should do more to consider other models. One simple alternative is that CDKG1 promotes cell division, and upstream mechanisms that control the kinase activity of CDKG1, rather than its concentration, play a more important role in defining the number of cell divisions.</p><p>5) Finally, there is a great deal of data in this manuscript and some danger that side issues may detract from the main point. One example is the role of the CDKG1 3' UTR in its cell cycle regulation. While an interesting finding, the key point of the paper is that the amount of CDKG1 protein in the nucleus regulates cell division, probably decreasing as a result of cell division diluting the pool. The 3'UTR observation is not incorporated in a discussion of the mechanism of protein dilution (pure dilution, regulated degradation, other?). A tighter Discussion pulling together all of the germane observations, perhaps leaving related results for a subsequent paper would make for a more compelling discussion of the main point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10767.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors postulate that CDKG1 levels scale with cell size and that this is a unique property of CDKG1 that is important for its role in cell size control.

If numerous other proteins show the same behavior as CDKG1, it would be hard to conclude which protein is actually being measured.</italic></p><p>The first concern above regards reliability of quantitation for the CDKG1 IF signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We are aware that IF quantitation is potentially problematic and that care must be taken to eliminate subjective bias. For this reason we used a semi-automated method where all dividing cells were first identified and marked from a field of DIC images. IF data was collected from all of the pre-marked cells using an automated process of signal detection for the nucleus (DAPI channel) followed by quantitation of the overlapping CDKG1 signal. For this reason we are convinced that the reduction in CDKG1 IF signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> reflects a small but real reduction in its concentration as cells progress through each division. We also emphasize that the ratio of CDKG1 to nuclear DNA unambiguously drops by at least two-fold with each round of division and we argue that this ratio is likely to be the key parameter sensed in this system, though we acknowledge other possibilities as described in Point 4 below (paragraph three, Discussion).</p><p>The second concern relates to the uniqueness of the CDKG1 abundance scaling and whether there are other proteins that behave the same way. We disagree with the notion that what we observed for CDKG1 would have to be unique for it to be a useful gauge of mother cell size or regulator of division. It is completely conceivable that many proteins scale in abundance the same way as CDKG1, but CDKG1 was evolutionarily selected as a proxy to be used for division control. We also note that our bulk protein data from coomassie gels shows that most proteins do not scale the way CDKG1 does. However, as suggested by the reviewers, it was still worthwhile to examine the behavior of two other cell cycle regulated proteins, α-tubulin and histone H3. Transcripts of the former show cell cycle regulation with a peak around the time of division (Zones et al., 2015) while the histone transcripts and proteins were both previously measured and found to be cell cycle regulated (Waterborg et al., 1995). Our new quantitative Western blotting experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> show that neither α tubulin nor histone H3 scaled the same way as CDKG1 in mother cells of different sizes and in non-dividing controls (paragraph two, subsection “CDKG1 production scales with mother-cell size”).</p><p><italic>2) In the author's model, CDKG1 is a limiting factor for S/M divisions, such that gradual depletion of CDKG1 causes cessation of division at a specific size. However, this cannot be completely true because cells carrying a deletion of CDKG1 nevertheless undergo several divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). If CDKG1 is limiting for cell division, how do cells completely lacking CDKG1 undergo division? The authors should address this issue in their discussion of the data. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref> is an important figure and should be moved out of the Supplemental Information.</italic></p><p>We appreciate reviewers’ comments. This is an important point that we clarify in the first paragraph of the Discussion. In wild-type cells CDKG1 is limiting for executing the correct number of cell divisions (but not limiting in the sense of being required to do any division).</p><p>We agree about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref> that has now been moved into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as panel 1E.</p><p><italic>3) How is [CDKG] actually measured in the cell to trigger a threshold effect on RB? What's the evidence that CDKB-phosphorylated RB acts in a dose dependent (or at least a threshold) manner to drive a cell cycle? This may be shown in the author's previous work, but if so, should be noted explicitly here.</italic></p><p>This is a difficult question to answer as it requires a system with a quantitative readout of the effect of CDKG1 concentration on phosphorylation of RB which could be competing with other kinases, phosphatases and modifiers whose activities are likely integrated into a signal for cell cycle progression and/or for exit from S/M. We were able to address the question of whether phosphorylation of RB is strongly impacted by loss of CDKG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and found that it is not. This result is not surprising given that CDKG1 is non-essential and its mRNA is never expressed at more than a fraction of the levels of the two major cell cycle kinases, CDKA and CDKB. The possible roles of CDKG1 phosphorylation of RB are addressed in the revised Discussion section on paragraph five.</p><p><italic>4) The author's model is interesting and represents a reasonable interpretation of the data. Yet the data for the model are largely correlative. Also, the model relies, to a large extent, on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, which suggest that the amount of CDKG1 in the nucleus decreases with each division. However, there is a significant amount of scatter in the data, and comparative measurements of total fluorescence are always difficult to carry out in a reliable and accurate manner. So the authors should do more to consider other models. One simple alternative is that CDKG1 promotes cell division, and upstream mechanisms that control the kinase activity of CDKG1, rather than its concentration, play a more important role in defining the number of cell divisions.</italic></p><p>We addressed the reliability of our IF data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the response to Point 1 above.</p><p>Regarding alternative interpretations, our data showing that overexpression of CDKG1 leads to extra divisions is not correlative and suggests that cells are highly sensitive to the amount of this protein. Were cell-size control exerted mainly through an upstream regulator of CDKG1 then overexpression of CDKG1 would not have a phenotype. Our data on extra cell divisions in lines expressing CDKG1 from a strong promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the overall sensitivity of cells to CDKG1 overexpression (paragraph two, subsection “Mis-expression of CDKG1 causes a small-cell phenotype”) lead us to conclude that levels of this protein are meaningful and tightly controlled, but acknowledge that other levels of control might also exist in the revised Discussion (paragraph three).</p><p><italic>5) Finally, there is a great deal of data in this manuscript and some danger that side issues may detract from the main point. One example is the role of the CDKG1 3' UTR in its cell cycle regulation. While an interesting finding, the key point of the paper is that the amount of CDKG1 protein in the nucleus regulates cell division, probably decreasing as a result of cell division diluting the pool. The 3'UTR observation is not incorporated in a discussion of the mechanism of protein dilution (pure dilution, regulated degradation, other?). A tighter Discussion pulling together all of the germane observations, perhaps leaving related results for a subsequent paper would make for a more compelling discussion of the main point.</italic></p><p>We understand this concern, yet at the same time felt that there were two important points to be addressed. One is the question how the overall expression pattern of CDKG1 might be controlled, and the second is how its abundance might be coupled to the extent of cell division. Our UTR experiments provide a straightforward answer to the first question suggesting that mRNA abundance is sufficient to explain the overall accumulation pattern of CDKG1 (though there must be additional control mechanisms that prevent continued accumulation during S/M and lead to its elimination in post-mitotic cells). We agree that this point was neglected in the Discussion and have added in a short section on these results (paragraph two).</p></body></sub-article></article>
