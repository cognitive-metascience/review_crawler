Understanding the importance of tissue-specific GR function in physiology and behavior has been hampered by near-ubiquitous localization in brain and body.

To test the impact of cell- and region-specific <italic>GR</italic> knockdown on physiology and behavior, we targeted <italic>GR</italic> knockdown to output neurons of the prelimbic cortex. Prelimbic knockdown of <italic>GR</italic> in females caused deficits in acquisition and extinction of fear memory during auditory fear conditioning, whereas males exhibited enhanced active-coping behavior during forced swim. Our data support the utility of this conditional knockdown rat to afford high-precision knockdown of <italic>GR</italic> across a variety of contexts, ranging from neuronal depletion to circuit-wide manipulations, leveraging the behavioral tractability and enhanced brain size of the rat as a model organism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>Sprague Dawley</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>sex difference</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH049698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herman</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH101729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herman</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD Young Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moloney</surname><given-names>Rachel D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008102</institution-id><institution>University of Cincinnati</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Council Student Faculty Collaboration grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheimann</surname><given-names>Jessie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 DK059803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotella</surname><given-names>Evelin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010327</institution-id><institution>Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yueh-Chiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Development of a conditional glucocorticoid receptor knockdown rat model allows for high resolution anatomical, physiological and behavioral exploration into the role of glucocorticoid receptor signaling in defined cell populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand (glucocorticoid)-activated transcription factor that participates widely in functions related to homeostasis and adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herman, 1993</xref>). Functional properties of GR action have been widely queried, using pharmacological, viral vector and electrophysiological approaches, with most of the literature using rat models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKlveen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKlveen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Solomon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wulsin et al., 2010</xref>). Recent decades have seen an increase in the use of mouse models to provide Cre-driver mediated deletion in specified cell populations (e.g. CaMKIIα neurons of the forebrain, Simpleminde-1 (Sim-1) neurons of the hypothalamus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nahar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Solomon et al., 2015</xref>). While yielding valuable information on cell type-specific GR actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Solomon et al., 2012</xref>), the use of mice has proven problematic with regard to high-resolution behavioral and physiological analyses due to the different behavioral repertoire of mice (high strain and inter-experiment variability in memory tests) and the small size (e.g., prohibits blood sampling of large volumes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Whishaw and Tomie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colacicco et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The emergence of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas 9-mediated gene editing now affords gene targeting in numerous species, including rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). For example, CRISPR/Cas9 methods allow for introduction of exon-flanking LoxP sites to generate conditional knockdown alleles and subsequent gene deletion following exposure to Cre recombinase using either driver lines or viral vector approaches. In this study, we used CRISPR/cas9 to specifically insert LoxP sites to sequences flanking exon 3 of the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> (<italic>GR</italic>) gene in Sprague Dawley rats (an outbred strain commonly used to explore GR function) via homology-directed repair (HDR). Our data provide validation of the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> gene editing in rats, and the use of viral vector-mediated Cre delivery to demonstrate targeting of GR knockdown to specific cell types, brain regions and circuits. Functional efficacy of GR knockdown in the prelimbic division (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) was verified by sex-specific deficits in extinction of conditioned fear in females and a shift to active coping in the forced swim test (FST) in males. Overall, our study shows the utility of this gene editing technique to generate conditional gene deletion models that can leverage the considerable advantage of rats in behavioral and physiological research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We directly manipulated the genome of Sprague Dawley rat zygotes by CRISPR/Cas9 to generate the floxed <italic>Nr3c1</italic> allele. We used a dual sgRNA strategy to delete the sequence containing exon 3 of the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> gene and repaired it with a cutting resistant donor plasmid that contains the deleted sequence, two flanking LoxP sites at the cut location of the sgRNA recognition sites, a right homologous arm at 2.57 kb, and a left homologous arm at 1.95 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Because truncated sgRNAs increase targeting specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), we chose six sgRNAs with various lengths (17–20 nt) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) and validated their editing activity in rat C6 glioma cells by T7E1 assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). We picked two sgRNAs, sg-2 and sg-6, for targeting the 5’ and 3’ sequences of exon 3, respectively. Both sgRNAs were 17nt in length, which is expected to provide high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). The two selected sgRNAs, Cas9 mRNA, and the donor plasmid were microinjected into ~60 rat zygotes, followed by embryo transfer into pseudopregnant female rats. Seventeen pups were born. We identified that one of them (No. #60) was correctly targeted, which was confirmed by PCR with the external primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) paired with the primers partially containing LoxP sequences (P5-P6 and P10-P8 for 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). It was further confirmed by primer pairs P5-P7 and P9-P8, followed by ClaI and BamHI enzyme digestion and Sanger sequencing (data not shown), and by additional Sanger sequencing of the entire targeted area between P5 and P8. This allele contains an A/T base change at chr18:31,744,353, compared to the rn6 reference genome, which is located in a non-conserved intronic region and unlikely to be of functional consequence. We verified copy number and used plasmid backbone PCR to exclude the possibility of random integration of the donor plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).

These constructs were chosen as the best available at the time of running the experiments.

For fear conditioning, rats were exposed to five tone shock pairings on the first day (acquisition), followed by 2 days of 20 tones without a paired shock, (extinction and extinction recall). Data was binned for clarity into five tones per bin. Freezing during the tones was measured as fear behavior. Freezing in female rats with PL-PFC targeted GRKD (SD:nr3c1<sup>fl/fl</sup> plus CaMKIIα Cre) increased in acquisition [GRKD F(1,52) = 5.553; p=0.035], but there was no significant interaction effect [GRKD x tone F(4,52) = 1.292; p=0.285] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We used the FST to investigate remodeling of behavioral coping strategy during an acute stress challenge. There was no effect of PL-PFC-driven GRKD (SD:nr3c1<sup>fl/fl</sup> plus CaMKIIα Cre) on immobility time in the FST on either day 1 or day 2 for male rats [Day 1 immobility T(14) = −1.8.48; p=0.085] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) [Day 2 immobility T(14) = −1.411; p=0.180] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Although there were no changes in total immobility in the FST, increased diving in the males with PL-PFC GRKD suggests GR in CaMKIIα neurons of the PL-PFC may facilitate a shift, selectively in males, to more diverse active escape behaviors than just swimming and climbing alone.</p><p>Our lab has previously shown that GRKD in the PL-PFC increases corticosterone to acute restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKlveen et al., 2013</xref>). We subjected male and female GRKD and control rats to a 30min acute restraint challenge and took tail blood samples at 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min from the start of restraint to measure plasma corticosterone. There was a GRKD x time interaction [F(4,45)=3.020; p=0.027] in females, with post hoc analysis revealing delayed shut-off (120 min time point) of the HPA axis stress response in PL-PFC-GRKD rats [p=0.050] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

The data suggest that female SD:nr3c1<sup>fl/fl</sup> rats with PL-PFC GRKD may have deficits in negative feedback inhibition due to the inability to return to a similar resting level of corticosterone as control rats. The lack of differences after PL-PFC GRKD in the males compared to our previous study may be due to the specificity of our virus to knockdown primarily in CaMKIIα cells, whereas previously a ubiquitous promotor on a lentiviral delivered shRNA was used which targets all neuronal cell types, including inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKlveen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior studies document generation of knockdown and Cre dependent knockdown rat models using CRISPR/Cas9 as a molecular tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2014</xref>) reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al. (2016)</xref>. Here we created a conditional (Cre-recombinase dependent) GR knockdown rat using CRISPR/Cas9. Validation of genome integration was accomplished by PCR, and Cre-dependent knockdown by site and circuit specific viral vector expression of Cre-recombinase. Finally, efficacy and consequences of GR knockdown in the PL-PFC were supported by sex-specific effects in behavior. The CaMKIIα promoter is thought to largely direct Cre expression to cortical projection neurons with over 80% specificity and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wood et al., 2019</xref>) and thus it is likely our manipulations were able to successfully target a cell population composed mostly of excitatory projection neurons.</p><p>Deficits in fear conditioning and alterations in behavioral coping style are a common phenotype in murine GR knockdown models as well as following chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKlveen et al., 2013</xref>). We used site and cell specific knockdown of GR to demonstrate that CaMKIIα cells in the PL-PFC require GR for appropriate fear responses and extinction in females. Conversely, male rats lacking GR in the PL-PFC, shift to an active escape behavior in the FST, suggesting adoption of an active coping strategy. Females (but not males) evidenced deficient shut-off of the HPA axis stress response, consistent with a sex-specific dependence of PL-PFC GR for full feedback inhibition. The data highlight a strong interaction between GR signaling and sex in coordination of prefrontal cortical signaling mechanisms. Moreover, the data provide functional evidence that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to provide high-resolution cell and site specific assessment of GR action in brain, leveraging the advantages of the rat as a model organism.</p><p>Prior studies have used promoter-specific Cre driver mouse lines to generate targeted GR knockdown in mice. Mouse studies demonstrated that CaMKIIα-Cre directed GR deletion in the forebrain (targeting exon 2 or 3) promoted anxiety-related behavior, passive coping, and corticosterone hypersecretion in male, but not female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Solomon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2017</xref>). It is important to note that the mouse CaMKIIα driver line deletes GR in multiple brain regions, including cortex, hippocampus, BLA, caudate, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, many of which interface with stress and emotional behavior. The extensive knockdown makes it impossible to specify circuit-specific roles of stress hormone signaling in behavior and stress physiology. Prior studies have not specified GR-specific deficits in cognitive behaviors, which can be difficult to assess in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Whishaw and Tomie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016</xref>). Here, we show that by using these viral constructs with specific promoters (CaMKIIα) in GR floxed rats, we can not only drive expression of Cre-recombinase in a cell-type specific manner, but also a defined region, allowing precise investigation of the role of GR in behavior.</p><p>There is a possibility of genetic modifications, even with the highly site specific editing of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, when inserting LoxP sites into the genome (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the most likely frameshift insertion and deletion (indel) mutations that could be introduced by unexpected non-homologous end joining or inaccuracies in the sgRNA targeting. We used PCR amplification and sequencing to determine that there were no mismatches in these sequences compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We are thus confident that our LoxP insertion did not cause any genetic mutations that would interfere with in vivo studying of the GR functioning in the rats on a genetic basis. As an additional control, we further investigated physiological and behavioral effects of this targeted insertion. We performed multiple tests of behavior (open field, elevated plus maze, and FST), and observed no effect of gene targeting on any behavioral endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we found no differences in bodyweight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>) or organ weights commonly changed with chronic stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>).</p><p>Our functional studies indicate that female (but not male) rats with knockdown of GR in the PL-PFC have heightened fear response and impaired extinction. Importantly, these data inform prior PL-PFC lesion/inactivation studies, which indicate that the PL-PFC is critical for appropriate encoding and expression of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan and LeDoux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marquis et al., 2007</xref>). The data indicate that GR signaling is an important component of this process in females, but may be less so in males (although the increased freeze times in males may reflect a more ‘intense’ response to the shock, which may result in ceiling effects on subsequent exposure to cues). In the FST, males but not females increased the number of diving events. As diving is considered an active coping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielajew et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujisaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molina et al., 1994</xref>), it is likely that GR in the PL-PFC also interfaces with coping behaviors in a sex-specific manner. In combination, these data indicate that use of enhanced precision methods of gene targeting such as CRISPR/Cas9 in rat reveal substantive new information on the biology of the PL-PFC and its interaction with biological sex.</p><p>Deficits in conditioned fear and glucocorticoid feedback efficacy are associated with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other stress related diseases in human. It is important to consider that these disease states are overrepresented in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKlveen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herman, 1993</xref>), and also involve modification of prefrontal cortical circuitry in neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breslau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breslau and Anthony, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kessler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McLean et al., 2011</xref>). Emergence of behavioral deficits following targeting of GR in the PL-PFC of females may reflect a mechanism underlying selective vulnerability of females to stressful life events, suggesting that appropriate GR signaling is required to mitigate the impact of adversity.</p><p>Overall, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is effective in generating novel tools for bio-behavioral research in a highly tractable model organism with a long and well-documented history. As noted in our functional studies, the SD:nr3c1<sup>fl/fl</sup> line can be of significant value in the context of higher order behavioral assays (cognitive behaviors, goal-directed behaviors, reward behaviors/drug self-administration) that can be often difficult to implement and/or interpret in other rodent organisms, such as mice. With the growing number of viral Cre constructs and the recent surge in development of rat Cre driver lines, the CRISPR/Cas9 method can provide site and cell type gene deletions or manipulations that are vital for our understanding of mechanisms of stress pathologies and stress-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of the floxed <italic>Nr3c1</italic> line</title><p>Six sgRNAs targeting the sequences flanking exon 3 of <italic>Nr3c1</italic> were designed using the CRISPR Design Tool website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome-engineering.org/">http://www.genome-engineering.org/</ext-link>).

Sections were blocked by incubation with 0.1M PBS containing 4% goat serum with 0.4% Triton X-100% and 0.2% BSA for 2 hr, followed by incubation with rabbit polyclonal GR antibody (Invitrogen-Cat# PA-521341) diluted 1:500 [and no GFP antibody label (native virus expression)] in blocking solution overnight at room temperature. After overnight antibody incubation, sections were rinsed in 0.1M PBS 3 × 5 min, then incubated in a cocktail of goat-anti-mouse CY3 conjugated IgG (Invitrogen-Cat#A32727) diluted 1:800 in 0.1M PBS for 45 min, and rinsed 4 × 5 min in 0.1M PBS. All sections were mounted and viewed on a Nikon C2 Plus Confocal Microscope.</p><p>The validation of the GR knockdown was performed by obtaining relative intensity of GR expressing cells in both control and knockdown rats within and outside viral infected cells. This was performed in a semi quantitative manner (non-calibrated to known GR concentration). We used a partially automatized analysis in which the software (ImageJ software -U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) defines a level of background intensity in which GR/GFP is considered positive, and positive nuclei are outlined based on circularity and size which were previously manually validated. Specifically, the total number of GFP expressing cells (virus infected cells) in the PL-PFC was determined on the green channel. Using the outline of the GFP cells, a region of interest (GFP-ROI) was created (see representative image, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). On the red channel (GR), the total number of GR expressing cells was selected and the mean optical density (OD) was obtained (Total GR OD). This reflects the total intensity of GR staining in each image. Subsequently, the GFP-ROI was overlaid on to the red channel image to obtain the uncalibrated OD inside the GFP-ROI, corresponding to GR expression within virus infected cells. Note that subtraction of background optical density was not performed.</p><p>Verification of virus placement for the functional PL-PFC GR knockdown study (AAV9.CamKII.HI.eGFP-Cre.WPRE.SV40) was completed by immunohistochemical analysis of Cre recombinase protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Sections (series of 6) were processed as stated above before immunohistochemistry. Sections were washed 5 × 5 in 0.1M PBS and blocked in 0.2%BSA +0.4% Triton-X 100 + 4% goat serum. Sections were then incubated overnight in block at 4°C in monoclonal mouse cre recombinase antibody (Millipore-Cat# MAB 3120) diluted 1:1000. The following day sections were washed 5 × 5 in 0.1M PBS and incubated in goat-anti-mouse CY3 conjugated IgG (Invitrogen A32727) diluted 1:500 at room temperature for 1 hr. All sections were mounted and viewed on a Nikon C2 Plus Confocal Microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Auditory fear conditioning</title><p>We used the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>) method for auditory fear conditioning. Rats were placed into sound attenuated chambers (Med Associates Fairfax VT) with a 33×28×25 cm interior chamber within a 63×45×58 cm sound attenuating outer box and aluminum walls and aluminum rod floor. The fear conditioning paradigm was controlled by Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technology) and consisted of 3 days. On day one, (acquisition) rats were allowed to habituate to the chamber for 5 min followed by 5 x 30 s tones paired with shock, 0.5mA for 0.5 s, administered with 3 min inter-trial intervals (ITI). Rats were removed to their homecage and returned to the chamber 24 hr later. For day two (extinction), after another 5 min habituation, 20 x 30 s tones, with 3 min ITIs, were played with no shock at termination. Rats were again returned to the homecage for 24 hr. The last day, day three (extinction recall), consisted again of a 5 min habituation and 20 x 30 s tones, with 3 min ITIs. Freezing, the complete cessation of all movement other than respiration was measured by Freezescan software (CleverSys, Inc) during the 30 s tones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Forced swim test (FST)</title><p>The FST was conducted in regular lighting 1–4 hr after the beginning of the light cycle. On day 1, rats were placed in a Plexiglas cylinder measuring 61 cm deep with a 19 cm diameter filled to 40 cm with tap water at 24–26°C for 10 min. On day 2, rats were again placed in the apparatus under the same conditions for 10 min. Sessions were video-recorded and behavior was later analyzed by recording whether the rat was swimming, climbing, diving, or immobile using Kinoscope software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kokras et al., 2017</xref>) by an experimenter blind to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Corticosterone measurements after acute restraint</title><p>Rats were restrained in a well ventilated plastic restrainer for 30 min. Blood samples were collected in EDTA containing microtubes via tail nick (well below the last vertebrae) with a sterile razor blade. Blood samples were taken at the following time points: 0 min – basal before restraint, 15 min and 30 min while in the restrainer, and 60 min and 120 min after being released back into the home cage. Blood was kept on ice through the restraint and then centrifuged to remove plasma. Plasma was kept at −20°C until processed with a I-125 radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit from MP Biomedicals. Duplicates were run for each sample for technical replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). An unpaired t-test was used to analyze GR knockdown in females and males. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze fear conditioning data (parametric) and a general linear model was used for analysis of corticosterone data (non-parametric). Bonferroni was used for post hoc analyses when interactions were significant and also for a priori planned comparisons between genotypes. No data points were excluded as outliers. There were eight data points excluded on female fear conditioning for extinction recall due to software technical error. The forced swim testFST was analyzed using Student’s two-tailed T-test. Behavioral data was scored by a researcher blinded to GRKD condition. Sigmaplot 13.0 (Systat Software) was used to analyze the data. GraphPad Prism 8 (San Diego, CA) and Sigmaplot 13.0 (Systat Software) was used to graphical present the data. For behavioral experiments, sample size was dependent on the outcome of breeding. Target ‘n’ was 10/group, based on previous power analyses performed in our group; however, ‘n’s were decreased due to missed or ineffective viral injections in the GRKD groups. Effect sizes were calculated to assess the strength of our findings in the face of reduced ‘n’s’. Effect sizes were in the in the small to medium (pη2, ANOVA) and medium to large (Cohen’s d, t-tests) range.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>J Herman is supported by NIH grants (R01 MH049698, R01 MH101729).

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Brandon K Harvey (Reviewer #1) and Carmen Sandi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the current study, the authors report the development of a conditional deletion of the GR in rats. They provide credible evidence that their tool works, affects GR conditionally and that this impacts behavior as expected. The reviewers agreed that having such a tool available in rats would be a substantial step forward for the field. There are concerns but they are requests for details or changes in emphasis, none of which should take more than a few months. If the paper is revised with the additional details, the reviewers agreed that it would be acceptable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The essential revisions are targeted at providing additional detail that was thought to be critical to the validity of the tool. Other details requested in the reviews are important, but these are particularly critical as they support the rationale for publishing. There are three:</p><p>1) Correcting the emphasis on CRISPR as raised by reviewer 1.</p><p>2) Immunostaining patterns comparing effects in males and females as raised by reviewer 2.</p><p>3) Sequencing of PCR amplicons for the entire integrated transgene as raised by reviewer 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have developed a conditional knockout rat based on the Cre-loxP system to remove exon 3 of the Nr3c1 gene encoding the glucocorticoid receptor. They employ CRISPR/Cas9 in the development of a conditional knockout rat for the Nr3c1 gene. There is an overemphasis on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 starting with the title which is misleading in its current form. The conditional deletion of GR in rat brain is conditional on Cre not Cas9. Additionally, there is no evidence that CRISPR was required to make the animal. They obtained 1 animal out of 60 with the transgene. This could occur by injecting the targeting plasmid (as was done prior to the now common use of CRISPR for increased targeting). It is likely CRISPR aided in the process but there is no evidence for this (e.g. a plasmid alone was not injected and for good reason). The authors also do no appear to have done any PCR/Sequence/T7 assay/TIDE analysis on any of the 59 negative animals for evidence of CRISPR-induced mutation (which may have provided some possibly interesting GR mutants but this was not the goal). CRISPR should be deemphasized and focus on the fact there is a new Cre-dependent KO for GR and some possibly interesting biological observations using this new resource.</p><p>The authors claim in the first paragraph of the Results section that offspring fecundity is evidence of no random integration. This is not the case. There may be random integration that doesn't affect breeding but disrupts other gene function. A copy number per genome determination is needed. A PCR assay internal to the transgene that uses one of the primers partially overlapping the loxP site to avoid amplification of endogenous locus and a PCR assay to a single copy gene in the genome (2 copies per genome) should be used for QPCR to determine transgene copy number per genome. This assay is becoming a standard practice in transgenic animal development. Also, if the entire plasmid was injected, PCR assays designed to detect other plasmid segments is recommended.</p><p>The authors do not appear to have sequenced PCR amplicons for the entire integrated transgene. This is important to show no mutations or aberrant repair occurred at the single nucleotide level. Years of work may be built on these animals that have a point mutation in exon 3 altering function of GR. Alignment of sequencing data to in silico predicted sequence should be provided as supplement.</p><p>The use pf AAVrg-CAG-GFP as control for AAVrg pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre is not clear. These are different promoters and transgenes (e.g. using a &quot;dead&quot; Cre in the same construct would be preferred). Consistent with other experiments, AAVrg pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre should be injected into WT animals as control.</p><p>Overall, the finding of GR knockout in the prelimbic area affecting behavior is mostly confirmatory with published work while providing some interesting phenomenological observations for future studies. As such, this is a methods paper describing a transgenic rat with much potential and may be better in a specialized journal or methods section of neuroscience journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Scheimann et al. generated a conditional GR knockout in rats using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. They provide evidence of targeted GR deletion in specific cell types, brain regions, and circuits via viral vector-mediated delivery of Cre. They also report that deletion of GR in output neurons of the prelimbic cortex resulted in sex-specific deficits in extinction of conditioned fear in females and a shift to active coping in the forced swim test in males. The manuscript is well-written and development of a conditional GR knockout model in rat is important and will be useful tool for probing GR function in the brain. However, there are several major limitations to the data that should be addressed to strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>1) Given the sex-specific effects on behavior, it is critical to show and evaluate the immunostaining patterns from both male and female rats. Are sex-specific differences observed in the distribution, efficiency, and/or extent of GR knockout in male and female brains?</p><p>2) Does the loss of GR lead to compensatory increases in the expression of the related receptor MR? This is an important consideration given that MR binds corticosterone, is co-expressed with GR in many brain regions, and is known to play a role in stress and emotional behavior.</p><p>3) Several issues should be addressed concerning Figure 2:</p><p>a) Why is the immunostaining pattern for GR in panel C different than in panel A? For the GR knockout cells in panel C, it appears that GR immunostaining is lost in the nucleus but not the cytoplasm. Why is this the case?</p><p>b) The authors use AAVrg-CAG-GFP injection of SD:nr3c1fl/fl rats as a control for the AAVrg pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre injection (panels E and F). Another important control is injection of AAVrg pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre into wild-type rats. Was this control performed?</p><p>c) The images should be enlarged. The small size of the images makes it very difficult to evaluate the staining patterns.</p><p>4) Does knockout of GR in the prelimbic cortex alter locomotor activity of the rats?</p><p>5) The sample size for the GR knockout rats is quite small (n = 5 for females and n = 6 for males) for behavioral studies. In addition, a Fisher's LSD test was employed for post-hoc analyses. Are similar significance results found when statistical tests are utilized that correct for multiple comparisons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is the first study that develops a rat model with the capacity to perform cell- and region-specific deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in rats. In addition to the novel tool development, the authors provided evidence of the behavioral impact of specific deletion of GR in the rat prelimbic CamKII-(glutamatergic) containing neurons. The data indicates differential effects of the knockdown approach on fear conditioning and extinction and behavior in the forced swim test in males and females, with a minor effect on corticosterone recovery in females. The study seems to be well performed and it is clearly written. Rats as model organisms have proved superior to mice for the dissection of stress (neuro)physiology and behavior and the current resource is a major step forward for the interrogation of GR function in this animal species.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Conditional deletion of glucocorticoid receptors in Rat brain results in sex specific deficits in fear&amp;coping behaviors&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We also wanted to clarify that in the first paragraph of the Results section, we described that we obtained 1 <italic>Nr3c1</italic> floxed animal out of 17 pups, as a result of microinjection of 60 fertilized eggs. This <italic>Nr3c1</italic> floxed animal was #60, which may have caused the viewer to think that 1 correctly targeted animal was obtained from 60. Therefore, we changed #60 to No. #60 in the text. In addition, the rest of 16 negative animals carried the alleles, including single loxP, large deletion between two sgRNA target sites, and indels at individual sgRNA target sites. As also mentioned by the reviewer, it was not our goal to study animals with a partially integrated transgene, indels at introns or knockout alleles (which is lethal) for the current study. Therefore, we do not show the genotyping data for the 16 negative animals in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim in the first paragraph of the Results section that offspring fecundity is evidence of no random integration.

We included two additional experiments in the revision. First, we performed a copy number analysis on three regions of the integrated area, including ‘5 to 5’ loxP, 3’ to 3’ loxP and between two loxP sites. We compared two WT and two homozygous <italic>Nrc31</italic> floxed rats and confirmed that there are 2 copies per genome for each of the three regions examined (Appendix 1—figure 2). Secondly, because a circular DNA plasmid was used for microinjection to reduce the random integration, we performed the PCR using the primers encompassing the either end of the plasmid backbone sequence. Both reactions did not detect any signals (Appendix 1—figure 2), consistent with the copy analysis indicating the absence of random integration. In addition, we would like to clarify that we described the fact “the offspring of rat #60 can be bred to homozygosity indicates the correct targeting of loxP sequences to the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> gene, instead of random integration”. We did not mention anywhere in the text that offspring fecundity is evidence of no random integration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not appear to have sequenced PCR amplicons for the entire integrated transgene.

We have performed the long-range PCR using the primers encompassing the entire transgene region and sequenced from end to end. We confirmed that the DNA from two homozygous <italic>Nr3c1</italic> floxed animals showed no mutation in and near the coding sequence. However, we detected an A/T base change at chr18:31,744,353, compared to the rn6 reference genome, which is located in a non-conserved intronic region next to a SINE transposable element. Given that SD rats are an outbred strain and the location of the base change, we do not expect that this particular base difference will cause any significant effect.

The reviewer is correct in that, our lab and others have previously shown behavioral and hormonal consequences of mPFC GR knockdown; however, these studies did not include females, nor did they have a specific promotor driven knockdown (meaning all neurons were affected unlike our CAMKIIα selective neuronal population). Additionally, we and others have also employed Cre-Driver lines to knockout GR but these genetic models are confounded by the developmental and peripheral functions of GR. We believe the current dataset is a more targeted approach in terms of cellular specificity, brain region targeted and time constrained and adds to the growing body of literature. Further, to our knowledge, differences in diving behavior have not been published after GRKD manipulations.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Scheimann et al. generated a conditional GR knockout in rats using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
