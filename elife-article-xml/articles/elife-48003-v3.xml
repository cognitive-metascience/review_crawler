require a pool of quiescent cells. How the quiescent cells are established and maintained is poorly understood. Here, we report that Trpv6, a cation channel responsible for epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption, functions as a key regulator of cellular quiescence. Genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of Trpv6 promoted zebrafish epithelial cells to exit from quiescence and re-enter the cell cycle. Reintroducing Trpv6, but not its channel dead mutant, restored the quiescent state. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that Trpv6 is constitutively open in vivo. Mechanistically, Trpv6-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx maintained the quiescent state by suppressing insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-mediated Akt-Tor and Erk signaling. In zebrafish epithelia and human colon carcinoma cells, Trpv6/TRPV6 elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and activated PP2A, which down-regulated IGF signaling and promoted the quiescent state. Our findings suggest that Trpv6 mediates constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into epithelial cells to continuously suppress growth factor signaling and maintain the quiescent state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IGF1 receptor</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>Tor</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>ca2+ signaling</kwd><kwd>Erk</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1557850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Cunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1755268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Cunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetics, in vivo imaging, and unbiased chemical biology screens reveal that Trpv6 functions as a cellular quiescence regulator and delineates a Trpv6-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway maintaining the quiescent state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quiescence is a non-proliferative cellular state found in many cell types in the body. While non-proliferative, these cells retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle in response to appropriate cell-intrinsic and extrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun and Buttitta, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao, 2014</xref>). Quiescence protects long-lived cells, such as adult stem cells against the accumulation of genomic aberrations and stress. Maintaining a pool of quiescent cells is critical for tissue repair, wound healing, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>). This is particularly important for epithelia which are rapidly and continuously renewed throughout life. The intestinal epithelial cells, for example, are renewed every 4 to 5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van der Flier and Clevers, 2009</xref>). By synchronizing cultured mammalian cells in G0 via serum starvation followed by serum re-stimulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yao et al. (2008)</xref> showed that the Rb proteins (pRb, p107, and p130) and their interactions with E2F proteins are critical in regulating the proliferation-quiescence decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Acting downstream, a bifurcation mechanism controlled by CDK2 activity and p21 regulating the proliferation-quiescence decision has also been demonstrated in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>). While important insights have been learnt from in vitro studies, how the quiescent cell pools are established during development and maintained in vivo is not well understood. The exceptionally high turnover rate implies that cell-type-specific mechanism(s) must exist.</p><p>The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) is expressed in mammalian intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoenderop et al., 2005</xref>). TRPV6 is a conserved calcium channel that constitutes the first and rate-limiting step in the transcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoenderop et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wissenbach et al., 2001</xref>). In zebrafish, <italic>trpv6</italic> is specifically expressed in a population of epithelial cells known as ionocytes or NaR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). NaR cells take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the surrounding habitats into the body to maintain body Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan and Hwang, 2019</xref>). NaR cells are polarized cells that functionally and molecularly similar to human intestinal epithelial cells. While located in the gill filaments and the intestine in the adult stages, these cells are distributed in the yolk sac skin during the embryonic and larval stages, making these easily accessible for experimental observation and perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). When zebrafish are grown in homeostatic normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions, NaR cells are maintained in a quiescent state and the Akt-Tor activity is regulated at low levels. Low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress increases Akt-Tor activity in these cells and promotes their re-entry into the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). This is similar to the proposed role of mTOR signaling in adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meng et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism(s) at work. More recent studies suggest that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5a (Igfbp5a), a secreted protein that binds IGF with high-affinity, plays a critical role in activating Akt-Tor signaling in these cells via the IGF1 receptor under calcium-deficient states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism controlling the quiescent state under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] condition is currently unknown. In a previous study, we found that zebrafish <italic>mus</italic> mutant larvae, a loss-of-function Trpv6 mutant fish line obtained from an ENU mutagenesis screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vanoevelen et al., 2011</xref>), had many proliferating NaR cells and elevated Akt-Tor signaling, suggesting Trpv6 may play a negative role in regulating NaR cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2014</xref>). How does Trpv6 act to inhibit Akt-Tor signaling and whether it involves in cell quiescence regulation are unknown. Because TRPV6/Trpv6 is the primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel responsible for epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a major second messenger involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoenderop et al., 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that Trpv6 regulates the quiescent state by conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into epithelial cells and suppressing IGF1-receptor-mediated signaling. The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Trpv6 action.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trpv6 is crucial for epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in zebrafish</title><p>Three <italic>trpv6</italic> mutant fish lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All three Trpv6 mutant proteins lack the six transmembrane domains and the critical ion pore region and are predicted to be null mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>trpv6Î7</italic> and <italic>trpv6Î8</italic> lines were made in the <italic>Tg(igfbp5a:GFP)</italic> fish background. <italic>Tg(igfbp5a:GFP)</italic> is a transgenic fish line expressing EGFP in the <italic>trpv6</italic>-expressing NaR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), allowing real-time analysis of NaR cell proliferation. The <italic>trpv</italic>6<italic>Î8â2</italic> line was in a non-transgenic fish background and used in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analysis described later. The gross morphology and body size of the mutant fish were similar to their siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). All mutant fish died within 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Alizarin red staining indicated a marked reduction in the calcified bone mass in the <italic>trpv6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating body calcium deficiency. Fura-2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments in HEK293 cells transfected with zebrafish Trpv6 and human TRPV6 were performed. The Trpv6-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> change was similar to that of TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). D542 in mammalian TRPV6 occupies a critical position in the ion pore region and mutation of this residue abolishes its Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakipov et al., 2018</xref>). This residue is conserved in zebrafish Trpv6 at position 539 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We generated and tested Trpv6D539A mutant. The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels in Trpv6D539A mutant transfected cells were low and did not respond to changes in extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx rate was reduced to a negligible level in Trpv6D539A transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments confirmed that the Trpv6 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and this activity was abolished in the Trpv6D539A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These findings support the notion that Trpv6 plays an indispensable role in epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and maintaining body Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance and provided critical reagents for subsequent experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic deletion of the conserved epithelial calcium channel Trpv6 results in calcium deficiency and premature death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing <italic>trpv6</italic> gene (WT) and various mutant sequences.

In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), NaR cells in the wild-type and heterozygous siblings were distributed in the yolk sac region as single cells in a salt-and-pepper pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). NaR cells in the <italic>trpv6Î8</italic> mutant larvae were often observed in clusters of newly divided cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These proliferating NaR cells had enlarged apical opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The NaR cell proliferation rate was significantly elevated in the mutant fish in all stages examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At five dpf, the <italic>trpv6Î8</italic> mutant fish had 3-time more NaR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Essentially same data were obtained with the <italic>trpv6Î7</italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). GdCl<sub>3</sub>, a Trpv6 inhibitor, was used to further test the role of Trpv6. GdCl<sub>3</sub> treatment increased NaR cell proliferation in the wild-type and heterozygous fish, while it did not further increase NaR cell proliferation in the mutant fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Ruthenium red, another Trpv6 inhibitor, had similar effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Trpv6D539A, however, had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We showed that genetic deletion of Trpv6 not only impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and reduced body Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, but also promoted epithelial cells to exit quiescence and proliferate. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of Trpv6 increased epithelial cell quiescence-proliferation transition. While low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] treatment increased epithelial cell proliferation in the siblings, it had no such effect in <italic>trpv6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae, supporting the notion that Trpv6 functions as a major regulator of the quiescent state. Our genetic mosaic analysis results showed that the quiescent state is regulated by Trpv6 in a cell autonomous manner. Reintroduction of Trpv6 in the <italic>trpv6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant fish was sufficient to restore the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels, suppress IGF signaling, and reverse the cells back to the quiescent state. The Trpv6D539A mutant had no such activity, suggesting that this action of Trpv6 requires its Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance activity.</p><p>The impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, reduced body Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, and premature death observed in <italic>trpv6Î7</italic> and <italic>trpv6Î8</italic> mutant fish are in good agreement with a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vanoevelen et al. (2011)</xref> using the <italic>mus</italic> mutant fish, but differ considerable from findings made in the mouse model. Bianco et al. reported that <italic>Trpv6</italic> knockout mice were viable, but had reduced intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, increased urinary Ca<sup>2+</sup> excretion, decreased bone mineral density, and decreased growth and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianco et al., 2007</xref>). Another <italic>Trpv6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant mouse line reported by Chen et al., however, had normal blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and normal bone formation, but with an increased number of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). A third <italic>Trpv6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mouse model showed reduced fertility in male only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weissgerber et al., 2012</xref>). The reason(s) of these discrepancies among these mouse studies is not fully understood, but factors such as dietary Ca<sup>2+</sup> contents may have been critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van der Eerden et al., 2012</xref>). Zebrafish embryos continuously lose Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other ions into the surrounding hypo-osmotic environments and must constantly take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the habitat to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). This may also contribute to the premature phenotypes found in the zebrafish mutants. Another factor to take into consideration is genetic redundancy. In mammals, there is another closely related TRPV sub-family member, TRPV5. TRPV5 plays similar roles in the transcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport pathway, although it is mainly expressed in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoenderop et al., 2005</xref>). It has been shown that TRPV5 expression in the intestine is elevated in <italic>Trpv6</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Woudenberg-Vrenken et al., 2012</xref>). In comparison, zebrafish genome has a single trpv6 gene and lacks this genetic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vanoevelen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The notion that TRPV6 functions as the primary epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is well supported by findings made in mammalian cells over-expressing TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fecher-Trost et al., 2017</xref>) and by measuring endogenous TRPV6-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in cultured Jurkat T cells and rat cauda epidermal principle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kever et al., 2019</xref>). Fura-2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies in cultured mammalian cells transfected with TRPV6 indicated that this channel is constitutively open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vennekens et al., 2000</xref>). Although another study failed to detect spontaneous channel activity by patch-clamp recording in cells transfected with TRPV6, a recent study has provided structural and functional evidence that TRPV6 is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>). Other studies have reported that TRPV6 activity is activated by a reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> concentration, and inactivated by higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nilius et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yue et al., 2001</xref>). How TRPV6/Trpv6 channel activity is regulated in vivo is less clear. In this study, we generated a reporter fish line using the high-performance genetic calcium reporter GCaMP7a to measure intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in vivo. GCaMPs has been used for imaging intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in zebrafish neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muto and Kawakami, 2013</xref>). This approach has alleviated the concern associated with Fura-2 and cell culture systems. Our in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging results showed that the Trpv6 channel is constitutively open in NaR cells in vivo. This conclusion is supported by the facts that genetic deletion of <italic>trpv6</italic> reduced the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to undetectable levels and re-expression of Trpv6 restored the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels in NaR cells. Addition of ionomycin did not result in further increase, indicating the endogenous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels are high in these cells. More direct evidence came from the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics analysis results. Within minutes after the addition of Trpv6 blockers GdCl<sub>3</sub> or Ruthenium red, the levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> were significantly reduced. When these drugs were washed out, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal levels returned to normal levels. It was thought that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting epithelial cells, being continuously challenged by Ca<sup>2+</sup> traffic from the apical side, maintain low levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> using the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoenderop et al., 2005</xref>). The in vivo imaging findings made in this study challenge this conventional view. We postulate that maintaining high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels in these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting cells is likely beneficial to the organism because it keeps these cells in differentiated state and functioning as Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting units. This idea is supported by the fact that treatment of zebrafish with the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM promoted quiescent epithelial cells to proliferate.</p><p>Mechanistically, Trpv6 regulates the quiescent state by mediating constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to continuously down-regulating IGF1-receptor-mediated Akt-Tor and Erk signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is supported by the findings that 1) genetic deletion of Trpv6 or pharmacological inhibition of Trpv6-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake increased Akt-Tor and pErk signaling activity in an IGF1 receptor-dependent manner; 2) re-expression of Trpv6 in the mutant cells suppressed Akt signaling; and 3) inhibition of the IGF1 receptor, PI3 kinase, Tor, and Mek activity abolished or inhibited NaR cell proliferation in <italic>trpv6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant fish. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports that up-regulating of IGF signaling promotes NaR cells to exit the quiescence and re-enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). NaR cells are one of the five types of ionocytes originated from a population of epidermal stem cells, which are specified by the expression of p63 (ÎNp63), a direct target of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">JÃ¤nicke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Kimelman, 2002</xref>). These epidermal stem cells further develop into Foxi3a/b-activated ionocyte progenitor cells and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/keratinocyte">keratinocyte</ext-link> progenitor cells with low Foxi3a/b expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsiao et al., 2007</xref>). KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) plays an important role in maintaining the ionocyte progenitor cell pool by stimulating epidermal cell stem proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, several hormones, including isotocin, cortisol and stanniocalcin 1, have been implicated in the regulation of the ionocyte progenitor cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan and Hwang, 2019</xref>). Foxi3a/3b form a positive regulatory loop and this loop is critical in specifying ionocyte progenitors to give rise to the 5 types of ionocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan and Hwang, 2019</xref>). A hallmark of NaR cells is the expression of Trpv6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). The role of Trpv6 and IGF signaling in NaR cell quiescence regulation unraveled in this study differs from the mechanisms acting in epidermal stem cells and ionocyte progenitor cells, and provides novel insights into the regulation of NaR cell development and function.</p><p>Using unbiased chemical biology screens, we have identified PP2A as a key effector of TRPV6/Trvp6 in regulating NaR cell quiescence. Inhibition of PP2A by two distinct inhibitors led to elevated Akt signaling and increased epithelial cell proliferation. Importantly, an IGF1 receptor inhibitor abolished these changes. Likewise, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transient knockdown of PP2A catalytic subunits increased epithelial cell proliferation and Akt signaling. PP2A can activate Akt and Erk signaling at multiple sites in the IGF signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connor, 2003</xref>). Numerous biochemical studies showing that PP2A can dephosphorylate Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perrotti and Neviani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seshacharyulu et al., 2013</xref>). In several human cancer cell lines, PP2A regulates Shc phosphorylation state and upregulates ERK signaling activity in the IGF1-induced signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yumoto et al., 2006</xref>). Our in vivo findings, together with the in vitro findings indicate that a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-regulated PP2A isoform(s) likely acts downstream of TRPV6/Trpv6 and regulates the quiescent state in epithelial cells. This is in good agreement with a recent study showing that compromising PP2A activity delays cell cycle exit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun and Buttitta, 2015</xref>). The TRPV6-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-PP2A signaling axis appears to be conserved in human colon carcinoma cells because siRNA-mediated knockdown or inhibition of TRPV6 increased LoVo cell proliferation. Likewise, chelating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PP2A activity resulted in elevated cell proliferation rate of LoVo cells. The substrate specificity and intracellular distribution of the PP2A holoenzymes are controlled by the B regulatory subunits, which are encoded by a large set of genes classified into four families, thatÂ is B, Bâ², Bâ³, and Bâ³â² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Virshup and Shenolikar, 2009</xref>). Recent studies suggest that PR72/130 and PR70, 2 members of the Bâ family, possess two conserved EF hand motifs (termed EF1 and EF2) and increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increased the holoenzyme assembly and phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurimchak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magenta et al., 2008</xref>). Another mechanism involves the action of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-dependent m-calpain: m-calpain degrades PR72 and PR130 into a 45 kDa fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssens et al., 2009</xref>). This fragment, termed as PR45, is resistant to further degradation and exhibits enhanced PP2A activity. These two mechanisms may be related because the calpain-mediated proteolytic activation of PP2A depends on the EF hand integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssens et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine whether these mechanisms mediate TRPV6/Trpv6 action in epithelial cells.</p><p>Our findings linking the Trpv6-meiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake to the cellular quiescence regulation have important biomedical implications. Approximately 90% of human cancers arise in epithelial tissues and over-proliferation is one of the cancer hallmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). The IGF signaling pathway is one of the most frequently mutated signaling pathways in epithelial tissue-derived cancers, including colon and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Massoner et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>IGF2</italic> gene and <italic>IRS2</italic> gene are frequently gained in colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>) and have been proposed as a colorectal cancer âdriverâ oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day et al., 2013</xref>).

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pung Pung Hwang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, using zebrafish epithelial cells, the authors provide evidence that Trpv6 mediates constitutive epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to maintain the quiescent state. This is in agreement with the notion that TRPV6 is indispensable for epithelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and maintenance of body Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. By using genetic or pharmacological deletion of the TRpv6 channel, it was established that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance function of TRPV6 serves as a barrier in the quiescence to proliferation transition decision in zebrafish NaK-ATPase-rich ionocytes (NaR cells). Re-introduction of the channel restored quiescence in NaR cells. The study then investigated the mechanisms and proposed that Trpv6-mediated calcium flux acts through suppression of the IGF-1-Akt-Tor signaling pathway via the phosphatase 2A (PP2A). A chemical inhibitor screen was used to identify PP2A), and PP2A inhibition increased NaR cell proliferation as well as the phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, an IGF-1R kinase inhibitor reversed both the quiescence-proliferation transition as well as the phosphorylation of Akt caused by the inhibition of PP2A. The authors also suggest that this mechanism is conserved in in human colon cancer cells where Trpv6-mediated calcium influx was suggested to activate the PP2A phosphatase and thereby down regulate IGF-1 and Akt signaling.</p><p>Overall, this is a novel and well-presented study that greatly benefits from the lack of genetic redundancy within the TRP family in zebrafish.</p><p>The following concerns and suggestions should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should show whether the 2-day long, low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] treatment affects the expression level of TRPV6 in the NaR cells of wild-type or heterozygous TRPV6 fish.</p><p>2) It is stated that &quot;TRPV6-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx or current has not been recorded in vivo or even in primary epithelial cells (Fecher-Trost, Wissenbach, and Weissgerber, 2017).&quot; However, constitutively active Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (endogenous) with characteristics that match the epithelial calcium channel TRPV6 have been previously measured in the epithelial principal cells of the rat epididymis (please see Gao et al., 2016). Endogenous TRPV6 currents have also recently been recorded in Jurkat T cells in another study by Kever et al., 2019.</p><p>3) The third paragraph of the Discussion puts a question mark on the constitutive activity of the TRPV6 channel overexpressed in mammalian cells and rather speaks for the store-depletion based activation of TRPV6. But it has already been well documented by different and more recent patch-clamp and calcium imaging studies that TRPV6 is constitutively active and its activation does not depend on the store content. See for example the study of McGoldrick et al., 2018, where constitutive currents were recorded in the human TRPV6 transfected HEK293 cells. The Discussion text should be updated accordingly to cover the up-to-date published information on TRPV6 constitutive activity.</p><p>4) Several studies have dissected out the molecular pathways of how epithelial cells (including NaR cells) are differentiated from the stem cells and progenitor cells through the regulations by some transcription factors (Foxi3a/b, Gcm2, Klf4, etc.) (Chen et al., 2019; Hsiao et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2009). Some hormones (isotocin, stanniocalain, etc.) were found to positively or negatively regulate the proliferation and differentiation of the mature NaR cells from stem cells and/or progenitor cells (Chou et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2015). I am wondering how much these pathways participate in the epithelial homeostasis. Is there any possible relationship between these pathways and the present proposed signaling in terms of epithelial homeostasis? Can we look at the epithelial homeostasis without considering any effects from the stem cells and/or progenitor cells?</p><p>5) The rationale for linking the TRPV6 phenotype with IGF-1 signaling through the Akt/mTOR pathway in a PP2A-dependent manner is not entirely supported by the data presented on the actions of inhibitors of these pathways.</p><p>6) To establish a more direct link, it would be worthwhile to know whether the presence or absence of TRPV6 in WT, heterozygous or mutant fish has an impact on the expression levels of IGF-1R.</p><p>7) Activation of mitogen activated kinase pathways (MAPK/Erks) by mitogens or growth factor including IGF-1 is generally associated with cell cycle progression. It is surprising that the activation/status of MAPK pathways was not tested or discussed. Demonstration of Akt or TOR activation is not sufficient to conclude that this pathway (activated by IGF-1) is sufficient to drive transition from quiescence to proliferation.</p><p>8) The IGF-1R kinase inhibitor BMS is used in a number of experiments, but it is difficult to appreciate what overall effect it has on fish embryos. In Figure 3C there appears to be no affect in WT embryos while BMS suppresses the increase in pAkt observed in TRP6 mutant embryos. Some inhibition of Akt in WT embryos might be expected if IGF-1R is inhibited in WT embryos. Would it be possible to measure IGF-1R activity (e.g. autophosphorylation) to support the observations in Figure 3? Could other IGF-1R activated pathways (e.g. MAPK as discussed above) be tested to support the conclusions?</p><p>9) It is stated that, &quot;Treatment of the mutant fish with BMS- 754807, an IGF1 receptor inhibitor, abolished the quiescence to proliferation transition (Figure 3I- 3J)&quot;. It would be advisable to explicitly mention here that &quot;However, IGF1 receptor inhibition in heterozygous or WT TRPV6 fish, did not show any significant effect on the NaR cell proliferation.&quot;</p><p>10) The role of PP2A in NaR cell proliferation and of PP2A in regulating IGF-1R-dependent Akt activity is supported by the inhibitory effects of Okadaic acid and Calyculin. However, the effects of PP2A inhibition on cell proliferation could be independent of Akt. PP2A has well-documented functions in adhesion/growth factor signaling and Shc phosphorylation leading to MAPK activation that should be considered.</p><p>11) The experiments with LOVO cells are important to support a role for TRPV6 in human epithelial cells proliferation. But, more data is required to support the data presented in Figure 5F. This includes cell cycle analysis profiles (G1, S, G2/M) as well as some indication of cell viability, cell number/proliferation in the presence and absence of the inhibitors after 48 hours. Moreover, controls showing the on-target effects of the inhibitors under the specific cell culture conditions are necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48003.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should show whether the 2-day long, low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] treatment affects the expression level of TRPV6 in the NaR cells of wild-type or heterozygous TRPV6 fish.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we performed additional experiments.

Can we look at the epithelial homeostasis without considering any effects from the stem cells and/or progenitor cells?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added a paragraph discussing published work on the developmental origin of NaR cells and the roles of p63, Foxi3a/3b, <italic>Gcm2,</italic> Klf4, isotocin, cortisol, and stanniocalcin in regulating epidermal stem cells and ionocyte progenitor cells (Discussion, fourth paragraph). All the above mentioned papers are now cited. We pointed out that the previously reported mechanisms are different from the role of Trpv6-regulated IGF signaling discovered in this study. Trpv6 expression is a hallmark of NaR cells. The Trpv6 acts in NaR cells to maintain cellular quiescent state and prevent NaR cell proliferation (Pan et al., 2005; Dai et al., 2014) (see the aforementioned paragraph). Our findings have added yet another layer of regulation in NaR cell biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The rationale for linking the TRPV6 phenotype with IGF-1 signaling through the Akt/mTOR pathway in a PP2A-dependent manner is not entirely supported by the data presented on the actions of inhibitors of these pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We have obtained additional data linking the TRPV6 phenotype with IGF signaling. Our data showed that i) Akt and Tor signaling activity was activated in <italic>trpv6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae kept in the normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] embryo medium, while the levels of phospho-Akt in the siblings were minimal (Figure 3B, 3C; Figure 3âfigure supplement 2); ii) Blocking Trpv6 channel activity by GdCl<sub>3</sub> and Ruthenium red increased phospho-Akt levels and NaR cell proliferation in the wild-type fish (Figure 3âfigure supplement 3 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, iii) inhibition of IGF1 receptor abolished the quiescence to proliferation transition in mutant larvae, while it did not have such effect in the wild-type and heterozygous siblings (Figure 3F); and iv) Treatment of <italic>trpv6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant fish with PI3 kinase inhibitor Wortmannin and Tor inhibitor Rapamycin abolished NaR cell proliferation transition in mutant larvae, while they had no effects in the siblings (Figure 3G-3I). These data argue strongly that loss of Trpv6 increases NaR cell proliferation via the activation of IGF -Akt-Tor signaling. Our new data also showed that the MAP kinase pathway is also involved (see details in #7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) To establish a more direct link, it would be worthwhile to know whether the presence or absence of TRPV6 in WT, heterozygous or mutant fish has an impact on the expression levels of IGF-1R.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we measured the expression levels of IGF1 receptor genes by RT-qPCR. Zebrafish has two IGF1 receptor genes, i<italic>gf1ra</italic> and <italic>igf1rb</italic>, due to a teleost specific genome wide duplication event (Maures and Duan, 2002; Schlueter et al., 2006). The data, shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B and 1C, showed that the <italic>igfr1a</italic> and <italic>igfr1b</italic> mRNA levels were comparable between <italic>trpv6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae andsiblings. These results are consistent with our conclusion that Trpv6 suppresses IGF signaling by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and activating PP2A in NaR cells. It is in good agreement with the data presented in Figure 4âfigure supplement 4, showing that inhibition of the IGF1 receptor did not change intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in NaR cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Activation of mitogen activated kinase pathways (MAPK/Erks) by mitogens or growth factor including IGF-1 is generally associated with cell cycle progression. It is surprising that the activation/status of MAPK pathways was not tested or discussed. Demonstration of Akt or TOR activation is not sufficient to conclude that this pathway (activated by IGF-1) is sufficient to drive transition from quiescence to proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have carried out additional experiments to address this concern. The new results, presented in Figure 3E, 3I and Figure 3âfigure supplement 4, showed that pErk activity was elevated in <italic>trpv6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae compared with the siblings. The pErk signal was reduced by adding the Mek inhibitor U0126. Furthermore, U0126 treatment significantly decreased NaR cell proliferation in mutant larvae, while it did not have such effect in wild-type and heterozygous siblings. These new data suggest that the MAPK/Erk pathway is also involved in mediating Trpv6 action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The IGF-1R kinase inhibitor BMS is used in a number of experiments, but it is difficult to appreciate what overall effect it has on fish embryos. In Figure 3C there appears to be no affect in WT embryos while BMS suppresses the increase in pAkt observed in TRP6 mutant embryos. Some inhibition of Akt in WT embryos might be expected if IGF-1R is inhibited in WT embryos. Would it be possible to measure IGF-1R activity (e.g. autophosphorylation) to support the observations in Figure 3? Could other IGF-1R activated pathways (e.g. MAPK as discussed above) be tested to support the conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that treatment of zebrafish embryos with IGF1 receptor kinase inhibitors resulted in reduced growth and slower developmental delay and so did morpholino-based knockdown and genetic inhibition of IGF1 receptor by a dominant negative approach (Schluter et al., 2007, Cell Death Diff. 14:1095; Kamei et al., 2011, Development, 138: 777-786). The current study focused on the local action of IGF signaling in NaR cells. Previous studies suggested that when zebrafish embryos are grown in embryo media containing normal concentrations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], NaR cells are maintained in a quiescent state characterized by very low cell division rate and undetectable Akt-Tor activity. Low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress increases the Akt-Tor activity exclusively in an IGF1 receptor-dependent manner in these cells and this in turn promotes quiescent NaR cells to re-enter the cell cycle (Dai et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017). While the IGF1 receptor genes are widely expressed in many cell types, IGF binding protein 5a (Igfbp5a) is specifically expressed in NaR cells (Dai et al., 2010; 2014; Liu et al., 2017). Genetic deletion of <italic>igfbp5a</italic> blunted the low Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress-induce IGF-PI3 kinase-Akt-Tor and NaR cell proliferation. Reintroducing Igfbp5a, but not its ligand bindingâdeficient mutant, restored NaR cell reactivation (Liu et al., 2018).</p><p>In this study, we showed that the pAkt and pErk signaling activity was activated in NaR cells in two independent <italic>trpv6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>lines (but not in their wild-type and heterozygous siblings) when these fish were kept in embryo media containing normal concentrations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (Figure 3B, 3C, and 3E). Addition of the IGF-1R inhibitor BMS abolished pAkt and pErk signaling in NaR cells in <italic>trpv6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish, while they had no effect in siblings (Figure 3B, 3C). These and other evidence have led to the model that Trpv6 suppresses IGF signaling in NaR cells by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and activating PP2A, which down-regulates IGF signaling in the cytosol (Figure 6F). We agree that it would be ideal to directly measure IGF-1R activity in NaR cells. Unfortunately, available mammalian phospho-IGF1R antibodies did not yield specific signals in zebrafish larvae (Dai et al., 2014). Since there are ~ 50 NaR cells in each larva under basal conditions, co-IP with a total IGF1 receptor antibody and an anti-tyrosine antibody is difficult. Our model is consistent with previous biochemical studies showing that PP2A can activate Akt and Erk signaling at multiple sites in the IGF signaling pathway (OâConner, 2003). Our conclusion is also supported by the fact that inhibition of the IGF1 receptor and PP2A did not change intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in NaR cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4; Figure 5âfigure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It is stated that, &quot;Treatment of the mutant fish with BMS- 754807, an IGF1 receptor inhibitor, abolished the quiescence to proliferation transition (Figure 3I- 3J)&quot;. It would be advisable to explicitly mention here that &quot;However, IGF1 receptor inhibition in heterozygous or WT TRPV6 fish, did not show any significant effect on the NaR cell proliferation.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The role of PP2A in NaR cell proliferation and of PP2A in regulating IGF-1R-dependent Akt activity is supported by the inhibitory effects of Okadaic acid and Calyculin. However, the effects of PP2A inhibition on cell proliferation could be independent of Akt. PP2A has well-documented functions in adhesion/growth factor signaling and Shc phosphorylation leading to MAPK activation that should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. The new data on the role of pErk indicate that PP2A may down-regulate IGF signaling via Akt-dependent and independent mechanisms (Figure 5C). In the revised manuscript, we have added discussions on the possibilities that PP2A may affect IGF signaling through regulating Shc phosphorylation state and increasing MAPK activity (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The experiments with LOVO cells are important to support a role for TRPV6 in human epithelial cells proliferation. But, more data is required to support the data presented in Figure 5F. This includes cell cycle analysis profiles (G1, S, G2/M) as well as some indication of cell viability, cell number/proliferation in the presence and absence of the inhibitors after 48 hours. Moreover, controls showing the on-target effects of the inhibitors under the specific cell culture conditions are necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added several lines of new data in the revised manuscript. We showed i) siRNA knockdown of TRPV6 resulted in a significant increase in LoVo cell proliferation (Figure 6A), and ii) expression of PP2A-CÎ±<sup>L199P</sup> and PP2A-CÎ±<sup>H118N</sup>, two dominant-negative PP2A in LoVo cells significantly increased their proliferation (Figures 6C). Representative FCAS profiles are now included in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, 2, 4). The cell viability was assessed by MTT assays. There was no significant change in cell viability in GdCl<sub>3</sub>, BAPTA-AM, and Okadaic acid treated cells but Ruthenium red treatment resulted in a modest but statistically significant decrease in cell viability (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2). These new and genetic data provide further support that the TRPV6-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-PP2A signaling mechanism is functional in human epithelial carcinoma cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
