stem-like cells (GSC) thought to drive progression and recurrence. Diffuse invasion of the brain parenchyma, including along preexisting blood vessels, is a leading cause of therapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that ephrin-B2 mediates GSC perivascular invasion. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in murine GBM models and patient-derived GSC, revealed that endothelial ephrin-B2 compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells. In contrast, upregulation of the same ephrin-B2 ligand in GSC enabled perivascular migration through homotypic forward signalling. Surprisingly, ephrin-B2 reverse signalling also promoted tumourigenesis cell-autonomously, by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis via RhoA. In human GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts, <italic>EFNB2</italic> knock-down blocked tumour initiation and treatment of established tumours with ephrin-B2-blocking antibodies suppressed progression. Thus, our results indicate that targeting ephrin-B2 may be an effective strategy for the simultaneous inhibition of invasion and proliferation in GBM.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14845.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14845.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14845.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly type of brain cancer. On average, patients with glioblastoma only survive 15 months even with aggressive treatment. One of the main reasons that therapy fails is the strong tendency of the tumor cells in this form of cancer to spread into the normal brain tissue. This makes it impossible for surgeons to completely remove the tumor, which means that the disease will almost always recur.</p><p>Within the brain, invading glioblastoma tumor cells spread along pre-existing structures, like blood vessels. When the tumors use blood vessels as a highway to the rest of the brain it is called “perivascular invasion”. Scientists do not know exactly how glioblastoma cells move along the blood vessels. Learning more about this type of tumor cell movement could help scientists develop treatments to stop the tumor cells from spreading.</p><p>Now, Krusche et al. show that the glioblastoma tumor cells highjack the system that normally helps keep brain cells in place. Experiments with mouse and human tumor cells grown in the laboratory and injected in mice to produce glioblastoma tumors showed that a family of proteins called ephrins determines whether perivascular invasion occurs. Ephrins are found on the surface of both tumor cells and blood vessels. Normally, the blood vessels use these proteins to block the spread of normal brain cells. However, tumor cells override this normal anti-tumor mechanism and become able to spread along the blood vessels.</p><p>Specifically, Krusche et al. showed that an increase in the levels of ephrin-B2 in tumor cells allows them to move along the blood vessels. Ephrin-B2 was also found to drive the multiplication of the tumor cells independently of the protein’s interactions with the blood vessels. Using antibodies to block ephrin-B2 in tumors greatly reduced tumor size and extended survival in mice with glioblastoma tumors. The experiments suggest the blocking ephrin-B2 might be a therapy that both stops the glioblastoma cells from spreading and prevents the tumor cells from multiplying.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14845.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14845.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>GBM</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>perivascular invasion</kwd><kwd>Eph/ephrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cell Interactions and Cancer, MC_AS A652 5PZ10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krusche</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Ottone</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Clements</surname><given-names>Melanie P</given-names></name><name><surname>Goetsch</surname><given-names>Katrin</given-names></name><name><surname>Khadayate</surname><given-names>Sanjay</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashraf</surname><given-names>Azhaar</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><name><surname>Parrinello</surname><given-names>Simona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Regional Government of Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Social Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Torrecuadrada</surname><given-names>Jorge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG110360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parrinello</surname><given-names>Simona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>EphrinB2 promotes glioblastoma stem-like cell malignancy through the interplay of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms and its targeting suppresses tumourigenesis in preclinical models of human glioblastoma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumour and one of the most lethal types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012b</xref>). Current therapies consist of maximally safe surgical resection followed by radio and chemotherapy. However, these are largely ineffective and GBM invariably recur following treatment, resulting in a median survival of &lt;15 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weathers and Gilbert, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A leading cause of GBM recurrence is the diffuse infiltration of the tumour cells into the surrounding brain parenchyma, which limits efficacy of surgery and radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lamszus et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, GBM contain subpopulations of cells with stem cell properties termed glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC), which are able to self-renew, differentiate into tumour-bulk cells and reconstitute a phenocopy of the original lesion upon transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venere et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore increasingly recognized that GSC are critical players in tumour initiation and progression. Furthermore, GSC were shown to be intrinsically resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy and more invasive than non-stem tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venere et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sadahiro et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that GSC might be the primary cells within GBM responsible for infiltration and tumour recurrence following therapy and that GSC-targeting therapies should be beneficial for GBM treatment.</p><p>GBM invasion occurs along three main routes: the white matter tracts, the interstitial space of the brain and the perivascular space surrounding blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scherer, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>). Invasion along the perivascular space is a favourable migration route because endothelial cells secrete chemoattractants, which actively recruit tumour cells to the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Montana and Sontheimer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the perivascular space is enriched in migration-promoting ECM components and is fluid-filled, thereby opposing little physical resistance to invading tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gritsenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, within GBM, GSC are particularly prone to perivascular invasion, likely due to their similarities with normal neural progenitors, which preferentially migrate along blood vessels during development and after injury in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watkins et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with this, GSC reside in perivascular niches and the majority of invading cells migrate along the host vasculature in xenograft GSC models of both mouse and human origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zagzag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winkler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watkins et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Besides infiltration, GBM/vascular interactions underlie two additional key tumourigenic mechanisms. First, tumour cell migration along pre-existing normal blood vessels is an important tumour vascularisation mechanism, known as vascular co-option, by which tumours gain access to oxygen and nutrients independent of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donnem et al., 2013</xref>). Vascular co-option plays crucial roles during initial tumour growth, seeding of satellite lesions and tumour recurrence following therapy. Second, association with the perivascular niche provides GSC with important self-renewal and survival signals, which support GSC tumour-propagating abilities and therapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charles and Holland, 2010</xref>). Therefore, interactions with the vasculature, particularly within the GSC compartment, are critical throughout gliomagenesis and were indeed proposed as promising therapeutic targets for GBM treatment, but the mechanisms remain poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vehlow and Cordes, 2013</xref>).</p><p>GSC share many properties with normal neural stem cells (NSC), such as stem cell markers expression (Sox2, Nestin, CD133, ALDH1, etc.) and multilineage differentiation and, importantly, extensive evidence indicates that NSC themselves can be cells of origin in GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venere et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012a</xref>). However, GSC also significantly differ from their normal counterparts, in that they harbour transforming mutations that drive their tumourigenic properties, including deregulated proliferation and increased invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engstrom et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the comparison of GSC carrying known mutations to otherwise genetically matched normal NSC, should inform disease mechanisms, enable genotype-phenotype correlation and may identify new therapeutic targets for GBM.</p><p>In this study, we generated a murine GBM model by sequentially introducing oncogenic lesions relevant to the human disease into normal NSC and compared vascular interactions of the resultant transformed GSC-like cells and immortalised parental cells to interrogate mechanisms of perivascular invasion. Using this system, we identified ephrin-B2 as a critical driver of perivascular invasion. ephrin-B2 is a member of the Eph/ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-bound ligands, a fundamental cell communication system with widespread roles in tissue development, maintenance and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasquale, 2010</xref>). Activation of Eph receptors by ephrin ligands on adjacent cells modulates cell behaviour, including migration, proliferation and stemness, by eliciting forward signalling downstream of Ephs and reverse signalling downstream of ephrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kullander and Klein, 2002</xref>). Deregulation of the Eph/ephrin system contributes to the pathogenesis of many types of cancer, including GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasquale, 2010</xref>). Indeed, EphA2 and EphA3 were shown to drive GSC self-renewal, whereas EphA2, EphA4, EphB2, ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 have all been linked to GBM invasion, through incompletely understood mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Day et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Day et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2011</xref>).</p><p>We found that ephrin-B2 expressed on vascular endothelial cells inhibits the migration of non-tumourigenic cells, resulting in cell confinement. In contrast, transformation to GSC-like cells overrides this tumour-suppressive mechanism to drive perivascular invasion. We show that this is caused by upregulation in GSC-like cells of the same ephrin-B2 ligand, which desensitizes the cells to vascular confinement by constitutively activating Eph forward signalling non-cell-autonomously. Furthermore, we discovered that ephrin-B2 reverse signaling also elicits tumour cell proliferation in the absence of normal anchorage signals by driving Rho-A-dependent cytokinesis in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistent with these important roles, ephrin-B2 overexpression was sufficient to fully transform immortalised NSC to the same extent as oncogenic Ras. In human GBM specimens, high Ephrin-B2 levels were detected in perivascular tumour cells with GSC features at the infiltrative tumour margin, indicative of a role in the GSC compartment in primary tumours. Remarkably, <italic>EFNB2</italic> knock-down in primary human GSC isolated from patient material or treatment of established tumours derived from these GSC with anti-ephrin-B2 single chain blocking antibodies strongly suppressed tumourigenesis, by concomitantly inhibiting vascular association and proliferation. Thus, ephrin-B2 may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of GBM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endothelial ephrin-B2 compartmentalises immortalized, but not transformed, neural stem cells</title><p>To investigate mechanisms of GSC/vascular interactions in the context of syngeneic, immuno-competent brains, we sequentially introduced mutations commonly found in human GBM (RTK activation,p53 and RB inactivation) in primary murine SVZ NSC to generate fully transformed, GSC-like cells and genetically-matched immortalised NSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Network, 2008</xref>). We used two complementary strategies for this.

This approach allowed us to readily test candidate effectors by transforming NSCs isolated from mice carrying the specific mutation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blouw et al., 2003</xref>). In the second approach, we induced transformation by defined genetic changes in the same pathways to rule out artifacts of oncogene overexpression. <italic>Nf1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> NSCs were immortalised with p53 shRNAs and ectopic CDK4 to inactivate p53 and the p16/RB axis, respectively (imNSC2), and transformed by Cre-mediated <italic>Nf1</italic> deletion (herein referred to as GSC2).</p><p>Unlike previously reported for SVZ NSC in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), increased Ras signalling did not cause premature glial differentiation of the NSC in vitro in either model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16-data">2</xref>). In contrast, GSC1 and GSC2 retained stem cell properties in vitro as judged by high clonal efficiency in neurosphere culture and differentiation into glial and neuronal lineages upon mitogen withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Furthermore, both cell types (but not their immortalised controls) formed colonies in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>) and gave rise to highly aggressive tumours upon intracranial transplantation in immunocompromised mice (5/5 animals, 100% penetrance, median survival 24d for GSC1 and 38.5 for GSC2), whereas GSC1 also did so in syngeneic animals (5/9 animals, 56% penetrance, median survival 73d), indicative of a more aggressive phenotype. Consistent with their stem-like properties, clonal dilution experiments revealed that as little as 100 cells of either line was sufficient to generate aggressive tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Importantly, the tumours recapitulated the histopathology and gene expression signatures of human GBM, including presence of necrosis, neovascularization, nestin and Sox2 expression and a strong enrichment in the Verhaak mesenchymal subtype gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kleihues, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verhaak et al., 2010</xref>). The tumours presented diffuse borders with the majority of invading cells migrating along blood vessels and displacing astrocyte endfeet and pericytes to come in direct contact with endothelial cells, as previously reported for both murine and human GSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zagzag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagano et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watkins et al., 2014</xref>).

GFP-labeled GSC1 or imNSC1 were injected at a mimimum depth of 150–200 μm into the cortex of syngeneic recipients under a chronic cranial window and 5–7 days later their migration in relation to Dextran-TxRed-labeled blood vessels was imaged over a period of 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holtmaat et al., 2009</xref>). Although imNSC do not form tumors long-term, the cells were still present, viable and migratory at this time-point, as indicated by morphology and motility outside of the perivascular space. Consistent with previous reports, both cell types readily associated to the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kokovay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagano et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watkins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winkler et al., 2009</xref>). However, while individual GSC1 migrated out of the tumour mass along blood vessels, resulting in cell scattering, imNSC remained in stationary groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). GSC1 perivascular migration was independent of their position relative to the tumour bulk or cell density, with single cells migrating from the main tumour as efficiently and at similar speed as GSC1 migrating at a distance from the tumour margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Similarly, rare sparse imNSC further away from the tumour margin failed to migrate along blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Importantly, this effect was not due to a general impaiment in imNSC migration, as these cells migrated to a similar extent as GSC in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>). This suggests that signals from the vasculature compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells to restrict their migration, whereas transformation overrides these signals to enable perivascular spread.</p><p>To test this more directly and identify potential effectors, we developed an in vitro cell migration assay that mimics the response of infiltrating GBM cells to initial contact with endothelial cells. We seeded both imNSC/GSC models and primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (bmvEC) in separate wells of culture inserts and assessed migration of the two cell types towards each other following insert removal by time-lapse microscopy. Remarkably, this assay closely recapitulated in vivo migratory patterns, in that endothelial cells strongly repelled and compartmentalised imNSC forming a sharp boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Similar effects were observed with normal NSC, indicating that compartmentalisation is not caused by immortalisation, but rather reflects the response of normal cells to the vasculature (not shown). In contrast, GSC1 were refractory to compartmentalisation and migrated over the endothelial monolayer, giving rise to an uneven and longer boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The behavior of GSC2 was identical to GSC1, confirming that it is a general property of transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Eph/ephrin signalling is one of most important mediators of cell-cell contact-dependent boundary formation and we reported that endothelial ephrin-B2, the most abundant ephrin-B2 in the endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1j</xref>), induces cell sorting of normal NSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cayuso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ottone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gale et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore tested the role of ephrin-B2 in endothelial-induced compartmentalisation by assessing imNSC1 migration towards recombinant ephrin-B2-Fc. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>, ephrin-B2-Fc compartmentalised imNSCs, but not GSC, to the same extent as endothelial cells. This effect was highly specific and was not due to general differences in migration between imNSC and GSC cells because imNSC migrated onto Fc peptides, ephrin-A1 or ephrin-A5-Fc ligands to a similar extent as GSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Efnb2</italic> knock-down in endothelial cells disrupted boundary formation against imNSC, indicating that endothelial ephrin-B2 is both necessary and sufficient for compartmentalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1j</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-14845-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14845.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Endothelial cells compartmentalise imNSC.</title><p>Merged fluorescent and phase contrast movie from time-lapse microscopy experiments of cell-tracker labelled imNSC1 (green) migrating towards brain microvascular endothelial cells (bmvEC, unlabelled cells).

In contrast, elevated Ras signalling, triggered by either RasV12 expression or <italic>Nf1</italic> loss, strongly downregulated three Ephs (<italic>Epha4, Ephb1</italic> and <italic>Ephb2</italic>) and upregulated two ephrins (<italic>Efna5</italic> and <italic>Efnb2</italic>) in both models. However, western analysis indicated that of these genes, only <italic>Ephb1</italic>, <italic>Ephb</italic>2 and <italic>Efnb2</italic> changed significantly at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and were thus further assessed in migration assays against ephrin-B2-Fc. Surprisingly, we found that re-introduction of <italic>Ephb1</italic> or <italic>Ephb2</italic> by overexpression in GSC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) did not affect migration towards recombinant ephrin-B2-Fc, indicating that changes in the complement of Eph receptors do not underlie unimpeded migration, as in other systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astin et al., 2010</xref>). Instead, genetic deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> in GSC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>) fully rescued boundary formation in response to ephrin-B2-Fc and endothelial cells in vitro and blocked perivascular migration in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Efnb2</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>) conferred imNSC1 with the ability to migrate over recombinant ephrin-B2 and a cultured endothelium and to escape vascular compartmentalisation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>). Together, these results show that ephrin-B2 upregulation downstream of Ras underlies GSC evasion of ephrin-B2-mediated endothelial repulsion and invasion along the vasculature.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14845.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Upregulation of ephrin-B2 in GSCs enables perivascular invasion (<bold>a</bold>) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of indicated Eph receptors and ephrin ligands.</title><p>Error bars denote s.e.m., p values of differences in expression between imNSC1 and GSC1 are shown.

We noticed that, although all GSC cells eventually migrated over ephrin-B2-Fc, a proportion of the cells (~20%) are repelled on first contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Repelled cells invariably migrated towards ephrin-B2-Fc either as single cells or in small groups (&lt;2 contacts), whereas non-repelled cells migrated in larger groups (&gt;3 contacts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This was not the case in imNSC cultures, where all cells were equally repelled, regardless of the number of homotypic cell-cell interactions at initial contact. This suggested that homotypic cell-cell interactions among GSC, mediated by intrinsic ephrin-B2, might underpin evasion of extrinsic ephrin-B2 repulsion. To test this, we repeated the migration assay under conditions that disrupt GSC cell-cell contacts by inhibiting cadherin-based junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ottone et al., 2014</xref>). Both culture in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> media and dominant-negative N-cadherin overexpression completely disrupted cell-cell junctions without affecting cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) and blocked GSC migration over ephrin-B2 ligands, indicating that homotypic cell-cell interactions are specifically required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14845.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ephrin-B2 upregulation drives perivascular migration by saturating Eph forward signalling through homotypic cell-cell interactions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Quantification of cell behavior upon initial contact with coated ephrin-B2. n = 3, error bars denote s.e.m.

Ectopic expression of a C-terminal truncated form of ephrin-B2 (ΔC<italic>Efnb2</italic>), which lacks reverse signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pfaff et al., 2008</xref>), promoted imNSC migration over ephrin-B2-Fc to the same extent as full-length <italic>Efnb2</italic>, demonstrating that forward signalling between neighboring cells is responsible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Indeed, western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) indicated that while imNSC controls displayed low basal levels of activated Eph receptors (p-Eph), GSC exhinited constitutively high levels of p-Eph, despite their reduced levels of EphB1 and EphB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and no increase in other ephrin-B2 receptors in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and not shown). High basal p-Eph could be mimicked by ephrin-B2 overexpression in imNSC and reduced to basal control levels by culture in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In addition, the high phosphorylation levels of Ephs in GSC appeared to be saturating, as, in contrast to imNSC, co-culture with endothelial cells or treatment with recombinant ephrin-B2 failed to further activate Eph receptors in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Importantly, Eph desensitization was again entirely dependent on endogenous ephrin-B2 because genetic deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> in GSC fully restored Eph stimulation by exogenous ephrin-B2. Consistent with the known ability of Ephs to trigger repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasquale, 2010</xref>), such high basal levels of activated Eph resulted in GSC undergoing much greater scattering and faster migration than imNSC following homotypic collisions in sparse monocultures, in an ephrin-B2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). Thus, high ephrin-B2 levels in GSC result in constitutive activation of Eph forward signalling and desensitization to exogenous stimulation.</p><p>To further test whether this desensitization mechanism underlies the ability of GSC to override ephrin-B2-mediated repulsion, we pre-stimulated imNSC with recombinant ephrin-B2-Fc to stronly activate Eph forward signalling prior to their migration out of the insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and assessed migration towards coated ephrin-B2 in boundary assays. Parallel Fc-treated cultures served as controls. Remarkably, we found that ephrin-B2-Fc (but not Fc) pretreatment enabled migration over the ephrin-B2 boundary, confirming that activation of Eph forward signaling on first contact with exogenous ephrin-B2 is the mechanism involved. In agreement with these findings, immunofluorescence analysis of GSC1-derived orthotopic tumours revealed high pEph levels in cells migrating along blood vessels at the tumour edge, indicating that constitutive forward signaling also contributes to perivascular invasion in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that GSC escape from endothelial compartmentalisation depends on continuous activation of Eph forward signalling elicited by elevated ephrin-B2 through homotypic cell-cell interactions within the tumour cell population. This, in turn, desensitises the receptors to further activation by extrinsic ephrins, thereby overriding the repulsion by endothelial ephrin-B2 and enabling unimpeded perivascular migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ephrin-B2 transforms imNSC</title><p>Given these important roles in invasion, we asked whether ephrin-B2 might also affect tumourigenesis by performing tumourigenicity studies of luciferase-tagged imNSC1, imNSC1-<italic>Efnb2</italic>, GSC1 and GSC1<italic>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implanted orthotopically in nude mice. We used immunocompromised mice for these experiments because the incomplete tumour penetrance of GSC in syngeneic animals precludes rigorous assessment of their tumourigenicity in the syngeneic model. Strikingly, quantitative imaging and survival analysis revealed that, while imNSC1 did not form tumours and GSC1 formed tumours at full penetrance, <italic>Efnb2</italic> deletion strongly suppressed GSC1 tumour growth and, conversely, <italic>Efnb2</italic> overexpression was sufficient to fully transform imNSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). Specifically, imNSC1-<italic>Efnb2</italic> tumours resulted in a similar median survival as GSC1 (28d). In contrast, all imNSC animals survived tumour-free beyond 200 days and 7 out of 9 animals of the GSC1<italic>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>cohort developed lesions with much slower kinetics, while the remaining 2 mice remained tumour-free, as confirmed by post-mortem examination. These effects were not due to a general loss of stem-like properties due to ephrin-B2 deletion, as clonal efficiency remained unaffected in GSC<italic>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, ephrin-B2 can substitute oncogenic Ras for transformation.</p><p>To dissect the mechanisms involved, we performed soft-agar assays, which assess proliferation in the absence of anchorage signals, a property closely linked to in vivo tumourigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freedman and Shin, 1974</xref>). Consistent with our results in vivo , the majority of imNSC1 and GSC1 <italic>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> remained as single cells in soft agar and only less than 5% of the cells generated small colonies, as previously reported for NSC, again indicating that immortalised cells behave like NSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gursel et al., 2011</xref>). Instead, imNSC1-<italic>Efnb2</italic> and GSC1 formed large colonies at similar high efficiency, indicating that ephrin-B2 drives anchorage-independent proliferation. Intriguingly, and in contrast to its role in perivascular invasion, ephrin-B2 effects on proliferation were dependent on reverse signalling and independent of homotypic cell-cell contact. Indeed, imNSC1-ΔC<italic>Efnb2</italic> did not form colonies in suspension and imNSC1-<italic>Efnb2</italic> overexpressing DN-Ncadherin formed colonies at similar efficiency as GFP-controls, demonstrating that Eph forward signalling is dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the transforming ability of ephrin-B2 might be a peculiar feature of the lgT-Ras model, we repeated the soft agar assays with imNSC2, imNSC2-<italic>Efnb2</italic>, imNSC2-ΔC<italic>Efnb2,</italic> GSC2 and GSC2 knock-down for <italic>Efnb2</italic> and obtained identical results, confirming the generality of these findings and the functional equivalence of the two GSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>We next asked how ephrin-B2 overrides anchorage checkpoints by comparing cell cycle progression of immortalised and transformed cells in suspension.

As anticipated, all cells proliferated efficiently in attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). By contrast, their behavior in suspension was very distinct. While GSC1 continued to proliferate in methylcellulose with similar kinetics, suspended imNSC did not. This was not due to cell death as judged by activated caspase3<sup>+</sup> staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

We therefore assessed Src and RhoA in ephrin-B2-mediated anchorage-independent cytokinesis by measuring levels of their activated forms (phosphorylated Src, p-Src, and GTP-bound RhoA) in suspension by western blot and pull-down assays, respectively. p-Src was undetectable in suspended imNSC1, imNSC-<italic>Efnb2</italic> and GSC1 and, similarly, levels of activated FAK, a critical Src substrate, were also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), indicating that Src does not play a role in our system. In stark contrast, levels of active RhoA were low in suspended cells that lacked ephrin-B2 reverse signalling (i.e. imNSC, imNSC1-ΔC<italic>Efnb2</italic> and GSC1<italic>Efnb<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) but greatly increased in cells that express high levels of full-length ephrin-B2 (i.e. imNSC1-<italic>Efnb2</italic> and GSC1), suggesting the involvement of RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

To this end, we first examined Ephrin-B2 levels at the infiltrative margin of 10 GBM patient specimens and correlated them with GSC marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

For this, we took advantage of an Ephrin-B2 blocking scFv antibody fragment (B11) we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abengozar et al., 2012</xref>). Migration and methylcellulose assays in vitro confirmed that B11 effectively inhibits Ephrin-B2 signalling in GSC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). Luciferase-tagged G26 cells were implanted intracranially in immunocompromised mice and 13d later, once sizeable, exponentially growing tumours had formed, but prior to the onset of neoangiogenesis, B11 was administered intravenously for a total of 9 consecutive days, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abengozar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2012</xref>). This treatment regimen enabled us to assess direct effects of B11 on the tumour cells in the absence of confounding anti-angiogenic effects known to result from ephrin-B2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawamiphak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abengozar et al., 2012</xref>). Efficient delivery of the scFv across the blood/tumour barrier to the tumour cells was confirmed in parallel animals using Alexa-680 labelled B11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Remarkably, B11 strongly suppressed tumour growth in all animals without any evidence of toxicity, with three of six animals showing complete regression, as judged by quantitative bioluminescence imaging, survival analysis and post-mortem examination of the injected brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a–c</xref>). Analysis and quantification of the tumours immediately following treatment also revealed that, in contrast to vehicle-treated control tumours, invading tumour cells failed to associate with and coopt the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Furthermore, proliferation was reduced in B11 tumours relative to controls, with B11 samples containing many Ki67<sup>+</sup> multinucleated cells, indicative of a cytokinesis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Therefore, B11 suppresses G26 tumourigenicity through inhibition of ephrin-B2-dependent perivascular invasion and anchorage-independent proliferation, independent of angiogenesis. We conclude that Ephrin-B2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human GBM and its inhibition might be an effective strategy for curtailing GBM progression and recurrence.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14845.036</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Treatment with anti-EphrinB2 ScFv blocking antibodies suppresses progression of established GBMs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>) Representative images (<bold>a</bold>) and quantification (<bold>b</bold>) of bioluminescence radiance of PBS or anti-Ephrin-B2 scFv antibody (B11) injected mice. n = 4 for PBS ctrl and 6 for B11 treatment groups.

Here, using a novel mouse ‘progression series’ that mimics transformation of normal NSC to mesenchymal GSC, we identified ephrin-B2 as a critical driver of GSC perivascular invasion. Interestingly, a role for ephrin-B2 and its phosphorylation in the tumour cells has been previously linked to GBM invasiveness, albeit not in the context of GSC. This suggests that ephrin-B2 might promote invasion both by generally enhancing cell-intrinsic invasive potential through reverse signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tu et al., 2012</xref>) and, also, by specifically enabling perivascular spread through forward signalling as we have shown here.</p><p>We found that ephrin-B2 expressed on vascular endothelial cells compartmentalises non-transformed cells. A similar role for Eph/ephrin signalling in constraining migration of premalignant cells was reported in colorectal cancer, where ephrin-B ligands in the surrounding normal tissue inhibit invasion of incipient lesions through activation of EphB receptors in the tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cortina et al., 2007</xref>). Our study is also consistent with work by Astin et al., which reported that ephrin ligands on stromal cells repel normal and non-metastatic prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astin et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the present work further strengthens the notion that ephrins expressed in normal tissues act as tumour-suppressors during early tumourigenesis by promoting tumour confinement and identifies the vasculature as a critical mediator of these effects. It is tempting to speculate that ephrin-B2-mediated vascular compartmentalisation might be a more general tumour-suppressive mechanism, limiting the spread of premalignant lesions across many cancer types.</p><p>In contrast, malignant transformation overrides vascular compartmentalisation to enable stereotypical GBM invasion along the perivascular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watkins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winkler et al., 2009</xref>). Mechanistically, we found this to be dependent on the upregulation of ephrin-B2 in the GSC themselves, which elicits constitutive activation of Eph forward signalling in the tumour through homotypic cell-cell interactions. Consequently, this promotes perivascular spread in two ways. First, constitutive Eph activation increases repulsion between the tumour cells within the tumour bulk, thereby promoting GSC motility and scattering of single cells away from the tumour, a hallmark of GBM migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vehlow and Cordes, 2013</xref>). Second, it desensitizes the cells to extrinsic ephrin-B2 repulsion, thereby circumventing vascular confinement and permitting cells that have detached from the tumour mass to continue their migration along the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Thus, invasive GSC augment their tumourigenic potential by ‘hijacking’ the same signalling pathway through which the vasculature suppresses tumourigenesis in normal tissues. Intriguingly, the mechanism of invasion we identified here, differs from what has been reported for colorectal and prostate cancer in the studies mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cortina et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, while in those systems tumour spread depended on the downregulation of Eph receptors in a cell-autonomous manner, in our GBM model non-cell-autonomous constitutive activation of Eph forward signalling is responsible, suggesting that the mechanisms that evade ephrin repulsion during tumour progression might be critically dependent on cancer type.</p><p>We further report that ephrin-B2 is also a critical effector of the ‘Ras-transformed phenotype’, capable of both transforming immortalised cells and mediating, at least in part, Ras-dependent transformation. Indeed, lgT-immortalised stem cells overexpressing <italic>Efnb2</italic> formed aggressive tumours with nearly identical kinetics to Ras-transformed cells and genetic deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> in GSCs significantly delayed tumourigenesis. We demonstrate that these effects depend on the surprising and previously unknown ability of ephrin-B2 to drive anchorage-independent proliferation through the activation of cytokinesis in a RhoA-dependent manner. It is of note that, in contrast to perivascular invasion, these ephrin-B2 effects are mediated by reverse signalling and independent of cell-cell contact, indicating that ephrin-B2 drives two key aspects of GBM tumourigenesis through a complex interplay of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Previous studies in endothelial and smooth muscle cells have reported a similar cell-cell contact- and Eph-independent role for ephrin-B2 reverse signalling in driving acto-myosin contractility and cell spread, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bochenek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foo et al., 2006</xref>). We currently do not know how RhoA becomes activated downstream of ephrin-B2. A potential candidate is Dishevelled, which mediates activation of Rho/ROCK by ephrin-B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). It would be interesting to explore the role of Dishevelled in our system in the future.</p><p>Our results in GBM specimens and primary human GSC lines strongly support a critical role for ephrin-B2 in the human disease through the same mechanisms that we identified in the murine models. Indeed, <italic>EFNB2</italic> knock-down prior to implantation abrogated tumour initiation and treatment of pre-existing intracranial tumours with Ephrin-B2 blocking antibodies, under conditions that mimic human therapeutic paradigms, strongly reduced the growth and expansion of pre-formed tumours. Significantly, both approaches curtailed tumour growth by impairing both vascular association and cytokinesis. In patient samples stratified by GBM subtype, <italic>EFNB2</italic> levels were highest in mesenchymal and classical tumours and correlated, inversely, with survival specifically in mesenchymal GBM. This is in agreement with our mesenchymal mouse models and analysis of human GSC lines, which revealed a robust correlation between <italic>EFNB2</italic> and mesenchymal gene expression levels. This recurrent correlation is particularly noteworthy, as <italic>EFNB2</italic> was previously identified as a component of the core mesenchymal gene network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carro et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that convertion to the mesenchymal signature is associated to progression, radioresistance and recurrence and is thus a fundamental driver of GBM malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ozawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>GSCs are thought to be largely responsible for tumour infiltration and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venere et al., 2011</xref>). As our work is based on murine and human GSC models of GBM, and Ephrin-B2 levels are high in the GSC compartment in primary tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), our findings indicate that anti-ephrin-B2-based therapies would target the most critical subset of cells within these lesions. As such, by harnessing the complexity of the Eph/ephrin system, inhibition of ephrin-B2 would in itself be an effective ‘combinatorial therapy’, capable of suppressing two critical GSC-intrinsic properties, namely perivascular invasion and proliferation, and might thus represent an attractive strategy for blocking GBM progression and recurrence. In addition, as ephrin-B2 levels are robustly increased in GSC compared to normal neural stem cells and other tissues, such therapies should be relatively tumour-specific and non-toxic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal work was carried out in accordance with the regulations of the Home Office and the ARRIVE guidelines. <italic>Efnb2</italic><sup>i∆EC</sup> mice and recombination protocols were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ozawa and James, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ottone et al., 2014</xref>).

The RhoA activation assay kit (Millipore) was used according to manufacturers instructions. For immunohistochemical analysis of tumours, mice were perfused with 4% PFA and the brain post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hr, placed in a 30% sucrose solution over night, embedded in OCT and snap frozen. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 30 μm cryostat sections. Tissue sections were stained overnight at 4°C with antibodies diluted in 10% goat serum. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed on 3 μm paraffin embedded sections. The following commercial primary antibodies were used: β-Tubulin (Sigma T8328 1:5000), BrdU (Roche 11170376001 1:400), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9664 1:500), EphA4 (abcam ab641 1:1000), EphB1 (abcam ab129103 1:1000), EphB2 (abcam ab76885 1:1000), EphB3 (abcam ab133742), EphB4 (R&amp;D AF446), ephrinA5 (R&amp;D AF3743 1:500), ephrinB2 (R&amp;D AF496 1:250), CD31 (BD 550274 1:400), GAPDH (abcam ab9483 1:1000), GFAP (abcam54554 1:400), GFP (Invitrogen A-21311 1:400), Nestin (Millipore MAB353 1:400), pan-pEph (abcam ab61791 1:500), pFAK (Cell signalling #3283 1:500), p-Src (Cell Signaling 2101s 1:1000), O4 (R&amp;D MAB1326 1:400), Sox2 (Cell signalling 3728s 1:250), SSEA1 (BD Pharmingen 560079 1:400), Tuj1 (Covance MMS-435P 1:500) and NG2 (Chemicon, 1:250).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Migration assays and quantifications</title><p>For migration assays, endothelial cells and imNSC/GSCs were plated at a density of 2x10<sup>4</sup> cells into adjacent compartments of cell-culture silicon inserts (Ibidi) separated by a 500 μm gap. Alternatively one well of the insert was coated over night with 4 μg/ml of recombinant ephrin-B2-Fc fusion proteins or Fc controls (R&amp;D) clustered at a molar ratio of 1:2 with fluorescently labelled anti-Fc antibody for 1.5 hr at room temperature. After removal of the insert the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 1 % Matrigel (Invitrogen) and live cell imaging was performed in a heated and CO<sub>2</sub> controlled chamber for 60 hr. For stimulation of imNSCs, recombinant ephrinB2-Fc ligands were preclustered with anti-human Fc antibodies as above and added to imNSCs for 24 hr before removal of the insert at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Analysis of ephrinb2-stimulated imNSC migration was terminated at 48 hr to achieve maximal stimulation of forward signaling throughout the experiments. Migration was quantified by tracing the boundary between GFP positive NSCs and non-stained bmvECs in ImageJ. To analyse the number of cell contacts individual frames from the videos of cells making initial contact with the ephrinB2-Fc boundary were analysed. The total number of protrusions per cell that were in contact with other cells at the time of entering the ephrin-B2-coated well were counted. All counting was performed blind. Kymograph analysis was performed using an ImageJ macro. Quantification of the kymographs was performed by measuring pixel intensities 200 μm before and after the ephrinB2-Fc boundary at the last imaged time-point to assess the proportion of cells that migrate over ephrin-B2 upon contact (expressed as relative cell density). To analyse scattering behaviour, cells were seeded sparsely at 10,000 cells/12 well and their migration tracked for 20 hr . Collisions between single cells were quantified over 200 min and a minimum of 50 cells were counted per condition per biological repeat.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Soft-agar and Methylcellulose cultures</title><p>For analysis of anchorage independent proliferation, cells were seeded for up to 72 hr in SVZ culture medium containing 1.8% dissolved Methylcellulose (Sigma) to form a semisolid hydrogel as previously described<sup>47</sup>. To retrieve cells, the suspension was diluted fivefold with DMEM and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. The pellet was then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. For analysis of binucleated cells, all cells were incubated with EdU (Life technology) for 4 hr and placed on PLL-coated coverslips 15 min before fixation and staining. As the metaphase in mammalian cells typically lasts less than an hour this experimental set up enabled us to distinguish between cycling (EdU positive) and cytokinesis arrested (EdU negative) cells. To assess colony formation in soft agar 5x10<sup>3</sup> cells/6 well were seeded into 0.5% agar on top of a bottom layer of 1% agar (Sigma). Total number of colonies formed was counted after 10 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cell pellets retrieved from methylcellulose were resuspended, fixed in 70% EtOH for 4 hr and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma). A minimum of 10,000 cells were counted for each condition using a BD LSR II. The PI profile was then analysed using the cell-cycle module of FlowJo X. Cells from tumours were isolated as follows: The GFP positive tumour tissue was dissected using a fluorescent dissection microscope and digested using papain according to the manufactures recommendation (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Cells were stained with PI as above prior to FACS analysis. All FACS stainings were performed on at least 3 independent cultures/tumours.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA sequencing and Bioinformatic analysis</title><p>GFP-labeled GSC1 and GSC2 tumours were dissected and digested as above. RNA was isolated by using RNAeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNA sequencing libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). RNA-seq data from adult brain of normal mice was obtained from GEO [1] (accession numbers GSM1055111, GSM1055112 and GSM1055113). Sequencing reads from tumour samples were aligned with the Tophat splice junction mapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), version 2.0.11 against GRCm37/ mm9 and transcript annotations. All parameters were set to default except inner distance between mate pairs (r = 100) and library type (fr-firststrand). The normal brain data was also aligned using Tophat with default parameter values except for distance between mature pairs (r = 200). The DESeq2 Bioconductor package (version 1.4.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to perform differential gene expression analysis on read counts obtained with HTSeq-count (version 0.5.3p9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>), and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Genes with adjusted p-value &lt;= 0.05 were deemed to be differentially expressed.</p><p>Sequencing reads for NS and GSC cell lines were aligned to mouse genome build GRCm38/ mm10 with STAR 2.5.2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) using the two-pass method for novel splice detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engstrom et al., 2012</xref>). Read alignment was guided by gene annotation from Ensembl release 84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>) with optimal splice junction donor/acceptor overlap settings. Transcripts were quantified with HTSeq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) based on feature coordinates from Ensembl 84. Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out with the GAGE Bioconductor package (version 2.18.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). Gene sets used corresponded to either biological process (BP) terms from the Gene Ontology, or derived from CNS cell type RNA-seq data described by the Barres group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brainseq2/brainseq2.html">http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brainseq2/brainseq2.html</ext-link>) using mean log2 FPKM values for astrocyte, neuron, OPC and oligodendrocyte classes. The top 500 genes for each class were identified by the ratio of individual class average expression to the maximum non-class average expression values. Log2 fold-change values computed by DESeq2 (version 1.8.2) were used as the input for GSA analysis. Data visualised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref> is derived from log2 FPKM data for the left panel and variance stabilised read counts using the rlog function in DESeq2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>GBM subtype analysis</title><p>Subtype analysis of human GSC lines was completed using methods and microarray data described by Caren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caren et al., 2015</xref>). Sample log2-transformed expression values for the signature centroid genes were produced by taking the mean expression across sample replicates. Centroid genes that could not be assigned to annotated genes were also omitted from further analysis. To ensure the accuracy of subtype expression estimates only subtype genes with high variance across the GNS dataset were carried forward. Subtype scores per sample were computed from mean Z-score transformed levels of overexpressed centroid genes for each subtype. Samples were then classified as belonging to the subtype associated with the highest mean Z-score or mixed subtype when presenting a similarly high expression of another subtype's mean Z-score.</p><p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) was applied to mouse tumor samples to test for Verhaak et al. subtype enrichment using the pre-ranked GSEA tool.

None of patients had radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery or any relevant comorbidities. Patients consent was given for all samples. The project received ethical approval from the Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank committee on behalf of MREC (ICHTB HTA licence: 12275, REC Wales approval: 12/WA/0196). All 8 tumours were wild type for IDH1 and 2 mutations and ATRX status with the exception of case 6, which was a secondary glioblastoma bearing the common G395A amino acid substitution in IDH1 and showing loss of ATRX expression.</p><p>Two additional GBM samples were the original lesions from which G19 and G26 cells have been isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollard et al., 2009</xref>). Preoperative structural MRI was available in all patients; the T2-weighted FLAIR sequences were reviewed to assess the extent of invasion into normal tissue. All patients underwent maximally safe surgical debulking and the isolated tissues were extensively sampled in order to represent the bulk of the tumour along with its infiltrative component in the surrounding grey matter. Specifically, areas representative of the invasive front of the tumour were chosen from each case. The tissues were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 hr and then processed using standard method to produce paraffin sections. Sequential three-micron sections cut from each selected block and were used for immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry. Immunostainings were performed following a standard protocol. Briefly, the sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehyadrated in decreasing alcohols to distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed incubating the sections for 20 min in steam-heated sodium citrate buffer (10 mM Sodium Citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6) at 90°C or 1 mM EDTA at pH 8. Following antigen unmasking, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS at -20°C for 15 min. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with the following primary antibodies: anti-EphrinB2 (clone EFR-163M hybridoma supernatant 1:4, CNIO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abengozar et al., 2012</xref>), anti-ALDH1 (monoclonal, BD Bioscience, dilution 1:500), anti-ALDH1 (mouse, clone 44, BD biosciences). The ephrin-B2 antibody gave robust membrane and cytoplasmic staining and labelled the endothelium, confirming specificity. Nuclear labelling was however detected in some tumour cases, a feature not present in control samples. Only membranous and cytoplasmic staining was scored as positive in the analysis of the tumours. The SuperSentitive IHC detection system from BioGenex (Fremon, CA, USA) was used to visualise antibody binding following the manufacturer’s instructions and counterstained with Mayer’s Haemalum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism statistical analysis software.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We are interested in the paper if you can make text revisions that address the referee concerns. The first concern of Reviewer #1 is particularly important for two reasons: 1) knowing which cell type the transformed cells are is of great importance. One cannot assume that transformed NSCs remain NSCs. 2) it only takes a simple profiling experiment followed by GSEA, which shouldn't take long at all. This small addition would fix a major hole and greatly increase the impact of this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript thoroughly examined the role of ephrin-B2 in GBM stem cells. Using two complementary methods, SV40-T antigen + RasV12; or NF1-KO + p53-KD + CDK4 over-expression, the authors transformed NSCs into GBM stem cells (GSCs). After grafting into syngeneic mice, it was found that while GSCs migrated along blood vessels, control immortalized NSCs (imNSCs) failed to do so. Then it was shown that ephrin-B2 is sufficient and necessary for endothelial cells (EC) to repel imNSCs, using an in vitro compartmentalization assay. To investigate why GSCs were not repelled by vasculature, the expression levels of all Ephs and ephrins were examined in GSCs vs. imNSCs. It was found that ephrin-B2 is over-expressed in GSCs, and knockout of which led to repulsion by endothelial cells in vitro and loss of perivascular migration in vivo. Furthermore, over-expression of ephrin-B2 in imNSCs conferred them migratory activity over ECs in vitro and in vivo. Next it was shown that homotypic cell-cell interactions among GSCs helped them overcome the repulsion by endothelial cells, through constitutively elevated forward signaling to desensitize Eph receptors to exogenous stimulation. Pre-stimulation of imNSCs with ephrin-B2-Fc allowed them to overcome EC repulsion, further supporting this notion. Next it was shown that reverse signaling of ephrin-B2 also plays an important role in malignancy. Mechanistic studies showed that ephrin-B2 over expression led to anchorage-independent cytokinesis through RhoA-mediated reverse signaling. Finally, the human relevance of the study was demonstrated with data showing that both ephrin B2 knockdown and anti-ephrin-B2-scFv antibody treatment suppressed human GSC tumorigenesis in grafted mice.</p><p>Overall the experiments in this manuscript are meticulously designed with ample n number and proper controls. Most conclusions are supported with both gain-of-function and loss-of-function evidences. The most impressive part is the careful dissection of the roles of forward and reverse signaling of ephrin-B2 in perivascular migration of glioma cells and the G2/M cell cycle progression, respectively. The data with human glioma cells are very impressive as well.</p><p>The main concern is the rigor in glioma model establishment.</p><p>1) It has been shown in the literature that NF1-mutated NSCs could divert their fates into glial cells [PMID 22901811]. Therefore, it would be important to thoroughly examine the gene expression profile in comparison to all glial cell types (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, aka NG2 cells), rather than to call them stem cells based on a few marker genes (nestin, sox2, CD133, and SSEA1).</p><p>2) The methods to generate &quot;GBM stem cells&quot; by in vitro introduction of multiple mutations into NSCs are less than ideal. These cells could lose homeostatic contact inhibition thus proliferate uncontrollably rather than bona fide tumor cells. Since the premise of the paper is based on these cells, all the beautiful data could be artificial rather than biological. Of course, data with human GBM cells greatly alleviate this concern. Still, it would be wise for authors to tone down the glioma claim with these in vitro transformed mouse NSCs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript presented Krusche et al. examine the mechanisms which lead to tumorigenesis by glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). To accomplish this the authors use two models in which they can generate GSCs by RTK activation and p53/RB inactivation, and compared the properties of these cells to similar neural stem cells. Interestingly, they demonstrate that the GSCs, but not NSCs, are able to drive tumorigenesis, and they show that upregulation of ephrinb2 in these cells causes this tumorigenesis by two distinct processes: increase in cell proliferation and increasing perivascular invasion. Remarkably, these two processes are regulated by distinct ephrin-B2 mediated molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation is mediated by reverse ephrin-B2 signaling by activation of RhoA whereas perivascular invasion is regulated by forward ephrin-B2 signaling onto neighboring cells causing desensitization to this pathway. This manuscript represents a tour de force in our understanding of both cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of malignant cell progression. The authors use elegant in vitro and in vivo models and demonstrate both the necessity and the sufficiency of overexpression of ephrin-B2 in the ability of these cells to proliferate and invade. This provides a significant advancement in our understanding of how tumor cells proliferate and interact with their surroundings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14845.052</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We performed RNA-seq profiling experiments of cultured GSC1 and GSC2, as requested.

These experiments strongly indicate that the in vitro transformed NSC have GSC-like properties. Similar models have been previously developed by others and are accepted GBM models (Bachoo et al., Cancer Cell 2002, Blouw et al., Cancer Cell 2003). Nonetheless, as suggested by the reviewer we have toned down the claim that they are bona fide GSC cells throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
