Here we experimentally dissect the functions of two pairs of ancient paralogs of the <italic>GAL</italic>actose sugar utilization network in two yeast species. We show that the <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic> network is more active, even as over-induction is prevented by a second co-repressor that the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> lacks. Surprisingly, removal of this repression system leads to a strong growth arrest, likely due to overly rapid galactose catabolism and metabolic overload. Alternative sugars, such as fructose, circumvent metabolic control systems and exacerbate this phenotype. We further show that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> experiences homologous metabolic constraints that are subtler due to how the paralogs have diversified. These results show how the functional differentiation of paralogs continues to shape regulatory network architectures and metabolic strategies long after initial preservation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19027.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19027.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19027.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genetic information is organized into units called genes, which encode sets of instructions needed to make proteins and other molecules in cells. When an organism reproduces, it passes on some or all of its genes to its offspring. Over many generations, individual genes may acquire changes known as mutations. Some mutations may improve the ability of the individual to survive and reproduce, but most are harmful and may even lead to death.</p><p>Organisms can bypass these constraints by creating extra copies of genes so that if one copy acquires a harmful mutation the other copy still works normally. Duplicate genes are crucial to evolution because they offer opportunities to evolve new characteristics, but most duplicated genes are quickly inactivated, in part because the organism does not need them. Decades of research have focused on how some duplicate genes manage to remain active, often by specializing or acquiring new roles. However, relatively little attention has been paid to what happens to duplicates after they have been retained.</p><p>Bakerâs yeast â also known as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae â</italic> is a single-celled organism that is often used to study genetics. Kuang et al. investigated whether yeast genes that were duplicated millions of years ago are still actively evolving and whether they have achieved different evolutionary outcomes in bakerâs yeast and a closely related yeast called <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic>. The experiments examined two pairs of genes that help to break down a sugar called galactose. Even though these genes were duplicated around 100 million years ago, they have continued to evolve in these yeasts.</p><p>In the last ten million years, these duplicate genes have taken on different roles so that bakerâs yeast and <italic>S. uvarum</italic> have evolved different strategies for consuming galactose. <italic>S. uvarum</italic> breaks down galactose more aggressively than baker's yeast, but it also has a better system in place to prevent it from breaking down more galactose than it needs.</p><p>The findings of Kuang et al. suggest that the new roles that duplicated genes adopt in organisms might have a bigger effect on the evolution of organisms in the long run than is currently appreciated. Future work will test this idea by studying other duplicated genes in different species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19027.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19027.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces bayanus</italic></kwd><kwd>galactose</kwd><kwd>gene network</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd><kwd>sugar metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coon</surname><given-names>Joshua J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOE Office of Science BER DE-FC02-07ER64494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hittinger</surname><given-names>Chris Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1253634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hittinger</surname><given-names>Chris Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hatch Project 1003258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hittinger</surname><given-names>Chris Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hittinger</surname><given-names>Chris Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alfred Toepfer Faculty Fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hittinger</surname><given-names>Chris Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1442148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hittinger</surname><given-names>Chris Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Recent functional changes in ancient duplicate genes led to the evolution of divergent regulatory and metabolic strategies by the <italic>GAL</italic>actose gene networks of two yeast species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene duplication provides raw material for evolution to act upon. Even so, most duplicate genes are inactivated and become pseudogenes before fixation. The molecular mechanisms behind paralog retention and differentiation have attracted considerable attention, and several general models have been proposed, including neofunctionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), gene dosage selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conant and Wolfe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conant et al., 2014</xref>), subfunctionalization by duplication-degeneration-complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Force et al., 1999</xref>), and subfunctionalization by escape from adaptive conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</xref>). Theoretical studies have proposed that the fates of duplicate genes are rapidly determined after gene duplication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moore and Purugganan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>). These models generally treat the preservation of duplicate genes as a race to distinguish their functions prior to the complete inactivation of one of the redundant paralogs, either through neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lynch et al., 2001</xref>) or adaptive changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lynch et al., 2001</xref>). Regardless of the initial functional changes or dosage effects facilitating the fixation of paralogs, retention is not the end of their evolutionary paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gordon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conant et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Duplicate genes continue to diverge in different lineages, providing additional evolutionary opportunities for organisms to diversify. Previously fixed copies of duplicate genes can alter their expression timing and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Huminiecki and Wolfe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">TÃ¼mpel et al., 2006</xref>), change substrate affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>), and switch between regulatory modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>). In several cases, paralogs encoding enzymes have been recruited to perform regulatory functions, such as <italic>S. cerevisiae HXK2</italic>, <italic>GAL3</italic>, and <italic>ARG82</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gancedo and Flores, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gancedo et al., 2014</xref>). Previously differentiated developmental roles can even be transferred from one paralog to another during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">UreÃ±a et al., 2016</xref>). Perhaps more significantly, long-preserved paralogs can be lost in lineage-specific manners, a common phenomenon observed across the tree of life, including in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">GÃ³mez-Valero et al., 2007</xref>), yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Scannell et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aury et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McGrath et al., 2014</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Smet et al., 2013</xref>), fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amores et al., 2004</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amores et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blomme et al., 2006</xref>). Although pervasive, the importance of ongoing paralog diversification to the evolution of organismal traits and phenotypes remains underappreciated.</p><p>Duplicate gene differentiation has heavily impacted the evolution of regulatory and metabolic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Voordeckers et al., 2015</xref>). Paralogs have contributed to the expansion of regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Teichmann and Babu, 2004</xref>), the derivation of novel networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conant and Wolfe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wapinski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">PÃ©rez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>), the specialization of network regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lin andÂ Li, 2011</xref>), and the robustness of networks to perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Papp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deutscher et al., 2006</xref>). The WGD has even been proposed to have facilitated the evolution of an aerobic glucose fermentation strategy called Crabtree-Warburg Effect in the lineage of yeasts that includes <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conant and Wolfe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>). Gene regulation and metabolism are heavily intertwined biological processes, but there are few eukaryotic models that allow for an integrated study of the ongoing differentiation of paralogous genes with regulatory and metabolic diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yamada and Bork, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conant et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL</italic>actose sugar utilization network is one of the most extensively studied eukaryotic regulatory and metabolic networks, and its homologous networks are evolutionarily dynamic in yeasts. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it includes the three enzymes of the Leloir pathway (Gal1, Gal7, and Gal10) that catabolize galactose, the galactose transporter Gal2, and three regulators. In the absence of galactose, the transcription factor Gal4 is inhibited by the co-repressor Gal80. When galactose is present, Gal80 is sequestered by the co-inducer Gal3, allowing Gal4 to activate the expression of the <italic>GAL</italic> network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Johnston, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhat and Murthy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Egriboz et al., 2013</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that the <italic>GAL</italic> networks of various yeast lineages vary in gene content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hittinger et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wolfe et al., 2015</xref>) and gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roop et al., 2016</xref>). Despite these findings, the impacts of variable network architectures on the evolution of gene regulation and metabolism are not well understood.</p><p>As a model for how duplicate gene divergence creates variable network architectures, we functionally characterized the <italic>GAL</italic> network of <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Saccharomyces bayanus</italic> var. <italic>uvarum</italic>) and compared it to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Here we show that two <italic>GAL</italic> network paralog pairs in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> have diverged to different degrees and states than their <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologs. We further show that, unlike <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S. uvarum</italic> deploys a second co-repressor that prevents over-induction of the network. <italic>S. uvarum</italic> mutants lacking both co-repressors revealed surprising constraints on the rapid utilization of galactose; specifically, they arrested their growth, and metabolomic investigations suggested that they experienced metabolic overload. We show that homologous constraints exist in a milder form in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and the degree of metabolic constraint is affected by how <italic>GAL</italic> network paralogs have diversified between the species. These results show how, after a hundred of million of years of preservation, two pairs of interacting duplicate genes have continued to diverge functionally in ways that broadly impact metabolism, regulatory network structures, and the future evolutionary trajectories available.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>GAL</italic> gene content and sequence differences</title><p><italic>S. uvarum</italic> has orthologs encoding all regulatory and structural genes that are present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, but it has duplicate copies of two additional genes.

Surprisingly, the <italic>S. uvarum gal3</italic> null mutant did not show the classic Long-Term Adaptation (LTA) phenotype of the <italic>S. cerevisiae gal3</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tsuyumu and Adams, 1973</xref>). Instead of a growth delay of multiple days, we observed a delay of only a few hours in <italic>S. uvarum gal3â</italic> relative to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that other genes in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> may be able to partially compensate for the deletion of <italic>SuvaGAL3</italic>, such as its paralog, <italic>SuvaGAL1</italic>. To determine whether <italic>GAL1</italic> differences between <italic>S. uvarum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> might be responsible for the different <italic>gal3</italic> null phenotypes, we replaced the <italic>SuvaGAL1</italic> coding sequence or promoter sequence with their <italic>ScerGAL1</italic> counterparts in the background of <italic>S. uvarum gal3â</italic>. The <italic>ScerGAL1</italic> promoter swap in <italic>S. uvarum gal3â</italic> largely recapitulated LTA, while the <italic>ScerGAL1</italic> coding sequence swap extended the delay to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since the <italic>GAL1-GAL10</italic> promoter is a divergent promoter, genetic modifications (evolved or engineered) inevitably impact both genes, as well as perhaps a lncRNA previously described in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cloutier et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest that differences at the <italic>GAL1</italic> locus, especially within this promoter, are primarily responsible for the lack of LTA in the <italic>S. uvarum gal3â</italic> mutant. Overall, the data suggest that <italic>SuvaGAL1</italic> is functionally redundant with <italic>SuvaGAL3</italic> to a much greater extent than are <italic>ScerGAL1</italic> and <italic>ScerGAL3</italic>. Thus, it is likely that the homologs in the common ancestor of <italic>S. uvarum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were more functionally redundant than in modern <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and considerable subfunctionalization between <italic>ScerGAL1</italic> and <italic>ScerGAL3</italic> happened after the divergence of <italic>S. uvarum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>S. uvarum</italic> has two co-repressors with partially overlapping functions</title><p>Next, we examined the functional divergence of the other pair of paralogous regulatory genes, <italic>SuvaGAL80</italic> and <italic>SuvaGAL80B</italic>, which are homologous to the <italic>ScerGAL80</italic> gene that encodes the sole <italic>GAL</italic> gene co-repressor in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

After the mutant resumed growth in galactose, the vast majority (78%, 783 of 1006 genes) of these genes returned to expression levels indistinguishable from wild-type, and Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis showed that most of the biological processes affected during the TGA phase returned to normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The TGA phase gene expression profile was not consistent with a global environmental stress response (e.g. nuclear ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing were up-regulated) but instead suggested a complex and incoherent integration of the regulatory signals that govern metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggested that this mis-regulation might be caused by overly rapid galactose catabolism immediately prior to the TGA phase. First, the optical density of the co-repressor double mutant initially increased faster than the wild-type in galactose and only plateaued after about 1.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, during this early growth in galactose, the co-repressor double mutant produced more ethanol than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Third, <italic>GAL1</italic> was also strongly overexpressed in the mutant early during growth in galactose, but <italic>GAL1</italic> expression gradually converged with the wild-type strain as the cells transitioned into the TGA phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, the severity of the TGA phenotype depended strongly on galactose concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and growth defects were not seen in other carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize how overly rapid galactose catabolism might lead to the TGA phenotype, we performed metabolomic analyses using mass spectrometry on co-repressor double mutant and wild-type strains cultured in 2% galactose. Prior to the TGA phase, the co-repressor double mutant accumulated galactose-1-phosphate, a known toxic intermediate of galactose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Petry and Reichardt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jongh et al., 2008</xref>), but this two-fold accumulation (relative to wild-type) seemed unlikely to be sufficient to explain the TGA phenotype. The level of galactose-1-phosphate in <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> returned to normal during the TGA phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>) and was not nearly as strong as in <italic>S. cerevisiae gal7â</italic> or <italic>gal10â</italic> controls (seven- to 11-fold relative to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> wild-type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe gene expression signatures consistent with the previously described responses to galactose-1-phosphate toxicity (e.g., environmental stress response, unfolded protein response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Slepak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De-Souza et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Instead, both transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed broad metabolic defects as bottlenecks developed downstream of the Leloir pathway. During the growth arrest, we observed increased expression of genes that encode glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). Key metabolic intermediates also accumulated in <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> strains before and during growth arrest, especially in upper glycolysis and interacting pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>). In particular, fructose-1,6-biphosphate accumulated significantly prior to the TGA phase (12.6-fold of wild-type levels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>), a bottleneck that frequently occurs when upper glycolysis outpaces lower glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). Under these conditions, inorganic phosphate becomes a limiting factor for growth as the âinvestmentâ steps in upper glycolysis deplete the cells of ATP and phosphate to form sugar phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Teusink et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>).

The trehalose cycle temporarily reroutes upper glycolysis to store sugars as trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>), while glycerol biosynthesis offers an early exit from glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luyten et al., 1995</xref>). Disrupting the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> trehalose cycle leads to the accumulation of fructose-1,6-biphosphate, decreased ATP levels, and ultimately growth arrest due to a metabolically unbalanced state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gibney et al., 2015</xref>), metabolic changes similar to the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> TGA phenotype. Strikingly, both pathways experienced dramatic bottlenecks in <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> strains before and during the TGA phase. Specifically, <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> cells accumulated 79- to 231-fold more trehalose-6-phosphate before and during the TGA phase, while they accumulated 225-fold more glycerol-3-phosphate before the TGA phase, the latter of which lessened to some extent during the TGA phase (3- to 16-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the trehalose cycle and the glycerol biosynthesis pathway are unable to handle the metabolic overload when galactose is catabolized too rapidly in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains lacking the <italic>GAL</italic> network repression system.</p><p>The metabolic effects of the TGA phenotype also reverberated downstream, leading to the transcriptional down-regulation of the lower part of the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Reduced respiratory activity has been shown to increase the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barros et al., 2004</xref>), and the co-repressor double mutant had strong signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction. GO terms related to mitochondrial structural components, mitochondrial translation, and respiration were among the most strongly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Indeed, we observed significantly higher accumulation of ROS in <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> during the TGA phase by using the general ROS indicator dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCF-DA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We conclude that disconnecting <italic>S. uvarum</italic> galactose metabolism from the negative feedback loops normally provided by the co-repressors Gal80 and Gal80b likely allows galactose to enter the Leloir pathway and glycolysis too rapidly, leading to metabolic defects far beyond the mild accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate and deep into central metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Specific sugars can exacerbate metabolic overload</title><p>To determine whether the TGA phenotype reflected a more general metabolic constraint imposed by the interplay between glycolysis and interacting metabolic pathways, we grew <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> in mixtures of galactose with fructose, mannose, or glucose. Fructose, mannose, and glucose are all primarily catabolized through glycolysis, but only glucose generates glycolytic intermediates that are upstream of the trehalose cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, fructose and mannose are expected to contribute directly to metabolic overload with minimal offsetting effects from the trehalose cycle. If the interaction between glycolytic load and the trehalose cycle were important to the TGA phenotype, growing the double mutant in mixtures of galactose with fructose or mannose would exacerbate the growth arrest. In contrast, if the TGA phenotype were caused by galactose-specific metabolism, the addition of these more preferred sugars would have no effect, or perhaps mitigate the TGA phenotype. Consistent with the TGA phenotype being caused by a general overloading of upper glycolysis, both fructose and mannose strongly exacerbated the TGA phenotype in <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic>, while glucose partially rescued the TGA phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, mixing fructose or mannose with galactose had much stronger defects than the identical amounts of galactose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Co-culturing wild-type <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains in galactose with these sugars was not inherently toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), so the presence of the co-repressors allows cells to cope with this challenge. Growing <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> in fructose, mannose, or glucose alone also did not cause growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Moreover, deleting <italic>GAL1</italic> completely rescued the TGA phenotype in the co-repressor double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), while mixtures of mannose and galactose dramatically increased the levels of ROS in <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), implying that the phenotypic enhancement caused by this sugar mixture acts through the same mechanism observed in galactose alone. Collectively, these results suggest that overly rapid catabolism of sugars can lead to general metabolic and growth defects when the appropriate futile metabolic cycles and negative feedback regulatory loops are not able to slow down catabolism.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19027.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The addition of sugars downstream of the trehalose cycle exacerbated metabolic overload.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fructose and mannose exacerbated the TGA phenotype in the <italic>S. uvarum gal80â gal80bâ</italic> background, whereas glucose partially rescued the TGA phenotype.

Next, a single colony of each strain was cultured in synthetic complete (SC) medium plus 0.2% glucose (1.72 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, 2 g/L complete dropout mix, 2 g/L glucose) for 2â3 days, a condition that does not induce and only minimally represses the <italic>GAL</italic> network. There were at least two biological replicates for each genotype, generally from independent transformants. These pre-cultures were washed with water and inoculated into the desired growth media in a 96 well plate. No explicit power analyses were performed to determine sample sizes or the number of replicates. Instead, each experiment was independently performed at least twice on separate days; details can be found in each legend. Biological replicates were defined as independent isogenic colonies on agar plates, which were used for subsequent precultures and growth assays; technical replicates were defined as independent growth assays from the same preculture. The absorbance of each well was read by an unshaken BMG FLUOstar Omega plate reader every 10 min at 595 nm. The number of cell divisions for each time point was calculated as log<sub>2</sub>[(OD<sub>strainâ</sub>OD<sub>media</sub>)/(OD<sub>startâ</sub>OD<sub>media</sub>), an equation that normalized each optical density time point to its starting optical density and the optical density of the medium. The times to first doubling were calculated as the times for the optical densities to double from their normalized starting points. Specific growth rates were calculated using the Growth Curve Analysis Tool (GCAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bukhman et al., 2015</xref>). Replicates that failed to grow as precultures or during growth assays were considered as outliers and were excluded from subsequent analyses; no other data were excluded. For <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum gal1</italic> mutant growth assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), strains were pre-cultured in SC plus 0.67% fructose for 2 days and inoculated at a 1:1000 ratio into supplemented minimal medium (1.72 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, 85.6 mg/L uracil, 85.6 mg/L lysine, 20 g/L galactose) plus 2% galactose or no carbon source. The growth properties of these strains were determined by subtracting the optical densities of cultures in media without a carbon source from media with galactose; differences less than 0.05 were considered as 'no growth.' In each case, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were cultured at 30ËC, while <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains were cultured at 24ËC, except when they were cultured in the same 96 well plate.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Justin Fay (Reviewer #1), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that no additional experiments are required for the main message of the manuscript, although if data is available that addresses some of the questions raised by the reviewers, the authors should include it. The full reviews are included below as they note a number of points where clarification or modification of claims would help the reader and increase the precision with which the results and conclusions is communicated. In particular, please clarify the nature of the strains used (point #2 of reviewer #3) and address the relationship between the metabolic changes and the growth phenotypes (end of second paragraph of reviewer #2: what is the evidence that metabolic overload is causal? Does this inference need to be toned down?)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes differences in divergence of two yeast species in their <italic>GAL</italic> network. Their primary finding is that <italic>S. uvarum</italic> has higher activity but also better repression of <italic>GAL</italic> genes compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The repressive component of this difference is shown to be mediated by an ancestral <italic>GAL80b</italic> retained in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> but lost in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Part of the higher activation is derived from differences in <italic>GAL1</italic>. The work represents a significance advance by dissecting differences in duplicated gene evolution and how they contribute to evolution of the <italic>GAL</italic> network. At a time when we are paying more attention to strain and species-level differences in genetic perturbations, the manuscript exemplifies the kinds of differences we will have to contend with and how we might take advantage of them.</p><p>Two sets of experiments make use of precise allele replacements of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. These precise replacements are commendable since they avoid certain issues, however they have the disadvantage of <italic>GAL10</italic> being driven from the same promoter. Can the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter swaps be attributed to <italic>GAL1</italic> or <italic>GAL10</italic> activity? While the main message of the work does not hinge on the answer, is there data that can address this or can you point this out to the reader. Replacement of the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding region should not be affect by this issue, although there is an interesting lncRNA that covers the <italic>GAL</italic> cluster and is involved in regulation (PMID: 26833086).</p><p>The reduced activity of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is striking. However, whenever <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is found to have loss of function I always wonder whether this is a defect specific to the lab strain. The lab strain has been found to a have a particularly long lag phase in glucose/galactose mixtures compared to other <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains which also show less <italic>GAL</italic> repression as glucose levels fall (PMID: 25626068). While this concern does not require repeating the experiments in another strain background, it should be addressed in the manuscript, preferably through a single experiment: e.g. <italic>gal80</italic> deletion.</p><p>The evidence that <italic>SuvaGAL3</italic> encodes a functional galactokinase needs more support for the strength of the statements made: &quot;<italic>SuvaGAL3</italic> does indeed encode a functional galactokinase&quot;. The <italic>Suva gal1</italic> null did not grow on galactose consistent with <italic>Suva GAL3</italic> lacking galactokinase activity. However, when <italic>ScerGAL1</italic> was replaced with <italic>SuvaGAL3</italic> there was growth, indicating sufficient activity for growth because <italic>ScerGAL1</italic>-promoter is strong. Either biochemical evidence is needed that <italic>SuvaGAL3</italic> and <italic>ScerGAL3</italic> differ in their activity or the control is needed where <italic>ScerGAL3</italic> is also overexpressed by the <italic>Scer GAL1</italic> promoter. A last option would be to temper this finding, since it is not essential to the main message.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes differences between two budding yeast species in the effects of mutations in the galactose metabolic pathway. The experiments are carefully done and together make up a sizeable body of work. The conclusions are for the most part justified, although I note some exceptions below.</p><p>The bulk of the manuscript deals with the discovery of a transient growth arrest in galactose medium in an <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strain in which the two paralogs of the <italic>GAL80</italic> repressor are deleted. This stands in contrast to the growth advantage in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> upon deletion of its one <italic>GAL80</italic> copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments show that in this <italic>S. uvarum</italic> double mutant in galactose, during a short burst of rapid growth followed by arrest, glycolysis is upregulated and the TCA cycle is repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Deleting <italic>GAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or replacing the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) was sufficient to rescue the transient growth arrest phenotype of the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> double <italic>GAL80</italic> mutant, at least in conditions when galactose was mixed with other sugars. Thus the <italic>S. uvarum GAL1</italic> promoter, seemingly by virtue of its high activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), is a driver of the transient growth arrest of the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> double <italic>GAL80</italic> mutant, at least in mixed sugar media. The hyperactivity of the <italic>S. uvarum GAL1</italic> promoter is further underlined by the finding that only it, and not the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> allele of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, can compensate for the loss of <italic>GAL3</italic> in an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> background during growth in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The authors' model is that the transient growth arrest phenotype of the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> double <italic>GAL80</italic> mutant accrues from overzealous galactose metabolism leading to a broader &quot;metabolic overload.&quot; Strictly speaking, any mechanistic role for the suite of expression and metabolite changes seen in this double mutant is not shown.</p><p>The authors make the interesting argument that the second paralog of <italic>GAL80, GAL80b</italic>, may have evolved in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> as a necessary brake on its highly active galactose metabolic program. Indeed, they show that <italic>GAL80b</italic> in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> is a stronger repressor of <italic>GAL1</italic> than is <italic>GAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). More support for fitness-relevant functions of <italic>GAL80b</italic> could strengthen the manuscript. Since <italic>GAL80</italic> alone is sufficient to prevent the transient growth arrest that otherwise manifests in the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> double <italic>GAL80</italic> mutant in pure galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), any benefit of <italic>GAL80b</italic> wouldn't be in this condition. Rather, the <italic>GAL80b</italic> mutant in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> has a slight growth defect in a mixed sugar environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; it would be good to show the <italic>GAL80</italic> mutant also in this figure). The mechanism of the latter phenotype would be of interest here, particularly in relation to <italic>S. uvarum's</italic> hyperactive galactose metabolic program which is the theme of the work.</p><p>A first part of the manuscript, of relatively modest scope, focuses on <italic>GAL3</italic>, which is a regulator in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can't grow in galactose when <italic>GAL1</italic> is deleted (an <italic>S. uvarum GAL1</italic> mutant is not reported). This defect can be rescued by the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> allele of <italic>GAL3</italic>, indicating a gain of metabolic function by the latter which the authors infer to be galactokinase activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I found this paper to be interesting and illuminating, as it captures a dynamic picture or evolution in action. We usually portray a schematic, frozen picture of evolution, focusing on the starting point (e.g. a species that diverged before the yeast WGD) and endpoint (e.g. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). However, as shown here, analysis of multiple species that evolved in parallel shows that evolution is an ongoing process, and that divergence may take different paths, and/or occur to different levels. For example, compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>S. uvarum GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL3</italic> genes diverged to lesser extent. However, in <italic>S. uvarum, Gal80</italic> duplicated, and one parallel (<italic>GAL80B</italic>) has diverged further towards galactose triggered expression.</p><p>The paper is clearly written, and despite technical complexity and detail-richness, makes an interesting read. The conclusions are in my view well supported, and with adequate controls that use dot be a standard but are now missing in many studies (e.g. reintroduction of the knocked out gene in a different locus to ensure the phenotype is related to this gene missing and not some other genomic perturbation). The study addressed multiple aspects including changes in transcriptome and metabolomics (including the identification of galactose-1-phosphate as the origins of toxicity). While I could imagine (and could not resist suggesting) interesting experiments that may provide further insights, I am impressed by the breadth of the data and there is no need in my view to demand additional experiments.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) <italic>GAL</italic> gene content and sequence differences:</p><p>Reading the next section one wonders if the <italic>S. uvarum Gal1/3</italic> the products of the WGD? But then, the authors state: that divergence of &quot;<italic>ScerGAL1</italic> and <italic>ScerGAL3</italic> happened after the divergence of <italic>S. uvarum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. I suggest to explicitly discuss <italic>Gal1/3</italic> in this section. Further, although these are not the results of this study, still, a schematic phylogenetic tree(s) for the species and genes addressed here would really help the reader who is not familiar with yeast phylogeny and/or the <italic>Gal</italic> system.</p><p>2) &quot;The less active <italic>S. cerevisiae GAL</italic> network is less susceptible to metabolic overload&quot; The data in this section relates to the <italic>GAL80</italic> knockouts of both species. Wouldn't the right comparison be the wild-types?</p><p>3) Related to the above: Galactose catabolism in <italic>S. uvarum</italic> can be highly activated compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This is clearly demonstrated by the individual growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Still, one wonders if, when mixed, these two species will show growth dynamics that are consistent with <italic>S. uvarum</italic> winning the competition at high galactose, but may be <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> winning at low galactose plus glucose (or mannose, fructose)? Or maybe, <italic>S. uvarum's GAL</italic> network is superior across the board (I'd expect tradeoffs, but still)? In general, direct competition may reveal a bit more about the evolutionary contexts under which the <italic>GAL</italic> networks diverged differently in various species, but this just a suggestion, not a request for additional data.</p><p>4) In the subsection â<italic>S. uvarum</italic> has two co-repressors with partially overlapping functionsâ, at the start of the second paragraph: why &quot;although&quot;, maybe âbecauseâ?</p><p>5) Inevitably, jargon and acronyms are used massively, and to some readers (this reviewer, for example) this comprises a hurdle. May be at least add one word to make it easier, e.g. TGA phenotype, or PGM gene.</p><p>6) Discussion (subsection âThe non-equivalence of sugars in contributing to metabolic overloadâ, last paragraph): I'm not sure that human metabolic defects are so relevant.</p><p>7) Concluding paragraph: I can imagine situations where paralogue loss may also relief clashes (no immediate reference comes to mind, except that in domesticated strains prologue inactivation is quite common, as are WGDs of course).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19027.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that no additional experiments are required for the main message of the manuscript, although if data is available that addresses some of the questions raised by the reviewers, the authors should include it.

In one case, we performed additional experiments so that the strains being compared were grown and analyzed together.

We presented several orthogonal forms of evidence that rule out many trivial explanations, and we hope this study will lead to more detailed mechanistic studies in the future. Some claims were overstated in the original manuscript, so we have carefully gone through the entire text to tone down the strength of this inference. Examples are cited in the response to Reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Two sets of experiments make use of precise allele replacements of the GAL1 promoter. These precise replacements are commendable since they avoid certain issues, however they have the disadvantage of GAL10 being driven from the same promoter. Can the GAL1 promoter swaps be attributed to GAL1 or GAL10 activity? While the main message of the work does not hinge on the answer, is there data that can address this or can you point this out to the reader. Replacement of the GAL1 coding region should not be affect by this issue, although there is an interesting lncRNA that covers the GAL cluster and is involved in regulation (PMID: 26833086).</italic> </p><p>We completely agree that our <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter swaps also affected the shared <italic>GAL10</italic> divergent promoter, a relevant fact not clearly stated in the original manuscript. We have added a sentence discussing this molecular constraint and the lncRNA, &quot;Since the <italic>GAL1-GAL10</italic> promoter is a divergent promoter, genetic modifications (evolved or engineered) inevitably impact both genes, as well as perhaps a lncRNA previously described in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Cloutier et al. 2016).&quot; We also modified the Methods, subsection âStrain constructionâ. Interestingly, evolution has also been constrained by this divergent promoter architecture, and many mutations are expected to have jointly affected <italic>GAL1, GAL10</italic>, and potentially lncRNA expression. It might be an interesting mechanistic or synthetic biology question to ask whether changing <italic>GAL1</italic> expression would be sufficient without affecting <italic>GAL10</italic> or the lncRNA (e.g. by moving it to another locus), but we feel direct manipulation of the locus is the most appropriate test in this case.</p><p>Several other types of data specifically report expression from the <italic>GAL1</italic> side of the divergent promoter, showing that <italic>GAL1</italic> expression is affected, even if it is not necessarily the complete story: the previous gene expression results of Caudy et al. 2013 and Roop et al. 2016, our reporter construct data, and our RNA-Seq data.</p><p><italic>The reduced activity of the GAL genes in S. cerevisiae is striking. However, whenever S. cerevisiae is found to have loss of function I always wonder whether this is a defect specific to the lab strain. The lab strain has been found to a have a particularly long lag phase in glucose/galactose mixtures compared to other S. cerevisiae strains which also show less GAL repression as glucose levels fall (PMID: 25626068). While this concern does not require repeating the experiments in another strain background, it should be addressed in the manuscript, preferably through a single experiment: e.g. gal80 deletion.</italic> </p><p>The specific experiments suggested (i.e. <italic>gal80</italic> deletions in additional strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) could conceivably find that some strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> had a slightly stronger TGA phenotype than the barely detectable one we report here for the first time. Even so, previously published data and the present data suggest that multiple <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains grow faster in galactose when the co-repressor is removed. Specifically, here we report the <italic>gal80</italic> mutant phenotype of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the RM11-1a background, a derivative of a vineyard strain (a fact now made explicit in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, rather than just being buried in the supplement). Previous observations were made in S288c (Hittinger at al. 2010), W303 (Segre et al. 2006), and 21R (Torchia et al. 1984), a background from Jim Hopper's lab mainly comprised mainly of S288c. Thus, at least four studies and four (partially overlapping) genetic backgrounds have made the observation that <italic>S. cerevisiae gal80</italic> mutants grow faster than wild-type in galactose. <italic>S. kudriavzevii</italic> also shares this <italic>gal80</italic> mutant phenotype (Hittinger et al. 2010), which further suggests that the key difference is not specific to lab strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, but is rather a difference between <italic>S. uvarum</italic> and yeasts that diverged later, including at least the <italic>S. kudriavzevii-S. cerevisiae</italic> clade. In the revised manuscript, we explicitly describe the evidence of these additional genetic backgrounds in the first paragraph of the subsection âStrains lacking the co-repressors arrest their growthâ.</p><p>There is also considerable evidence that the differences in <italic>GAL</italic> network activity and diauxic shift being examined in our study reflect strong species-level differences, rather than the apparently subtler differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains. The Wang et al. 2015 study referenced did indeed observe a range of diauxic shifts among <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, especially in 0.25% glucose + 0.25% galactose, conditions fairly far from the higher concentration conditions tested in our study. Our conditions were much closer to the conditions of Roop et al. 2016 (1% glucose + 1% galactose) who also observed substantial differences between <italic>S. uvarum</italic> (called <italic>S. bayanus</italic> by these authors) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In contrast to Wang et al. 2015, Roop et al. 2016 observed that all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains examined underwent diauxic shift. Most of the examined strains by these two studies did not overlap, but strain BC187 was examined by both authors and seems highly informative about the differences between their observations. Wang et al. 2015 found BC187 to have a very limited diauxic shift in their conditions, while Roop et al. 2016 found it had a strong diauxic shift in their conditions, conditions where <italic>S. uvarum</italic> still had essentially no diauxic shift. It is not clear whether either condition is ecologically relevant, but each condition is clearly better tuned to revealing quantitative variation at a specific scale.</p><p>In summary, we do not doubt that there are experimental conditions where the subtler genetic variation between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains results in reproducible diauxic shifts, nor that future studies may uncover quantitative variation in their <italic>gal80</italic> mutant phenotypes. Nevertheless, we feel there is sufficient evidence that our key findings (and those of Roop et al. 2016 and Caudy et al. 2013) represent species-level divergence that differs in degree, if not kind, from the variation segregating within <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p><italic>The evidence that SuvaGAL3 encodes a functional galactokinase needs more support for the strength of the statements made: &quot;SuvaGAL3 does indeed encode a functional galactokinase&quot;. The Suva gal1 null did not grow on galactose consistent with Suva GAL3 lacking galactokinase activity. However, when ScerGAL1 was replaced with SuvaGAL3 there was growth, indicating sufficient activity for growth because ScerGAL1-promoter is strong. Either biochemical evidence is needed that SuvaGAL3 and ScerGAL3 differ in their activity or the control is needed where ScerGAL3 is also overexpressed by the Scer GAL1 promoter. A last option would be to temper this finding, since it is not essential to the main message.</italic> </p><p>We agree that we have not directly tested biochemical activity and have removed the cited sentence making this claim. We have also added &quot;likely&quot; to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> legend subtitle.</p><p>The suggested control was originally done in Hittinger and Carroll 2007, previous findings not explicitly discussed in the original manuscript. We considered making a table to summarize our prior and current findings, but we felt that the clarity of the manuscript would be substantially strengthened if we redid all the relevant experiments in parallel, as well as ensuring that comparisons were not affected by being performed in different labs a decade apart. This new experiment yielded the expected results and is reported in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p>In addition to adding this experiment and eliminating the direct claim of biochemical activity, we also reordered this section (subsection âLess partitioned galactokinase and co-induction functionsâ, first paragraph) to more clearly present the genetic evidence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript describes differences between two budding yeast species in the effects of mutations in the galactose metabolic pathway. The experiments are carefully done and together make up a sizeable body of work. The conclusions are for the most part justified, although I note some exceptions below.</italic> </p><p><italic>The bulk of the manuscript deals with the discovery of a transient growth arrest in galactose medium in an S. uvarum strain in which the two paralogs of the GAL80 repressor are deleted. This stands in contrast to the growth advantage in S. cerevisiae upon deletion of its one GAL80 copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments show that in this S. uvarum double mutant in galactose, during a short burst of rapid growth followed by arrest, glycolysis is upregulated and the TCA cycle is repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Deleting GAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or replacing the GAL1 promoter with the S. cerevisiae allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) was sufficient to rescue the transient growth arrest phenotype of the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant, at least in conditions when galactose was mixed with other sugars. Thus the S. uvarum GAL1 promoter, seemingly by virtue of its high activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), is a driver of the transient growth arrest of the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant, at least in mixed sugar media. The hyperactivity of the S. uvarum GAL1 promoter is further underlined by the finding that only it, and not the S. cerevisiae allele of the GAL1 promoter, can compensate for the loss of GAL3 in an S. cerevisiae background during growth in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The authors' model is that the transient growth arrest phenotype of the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant accrues from overzealous galactose metabolism leading to a broader &quot;metabolic overload.&quot; Strictly speaking, any mechanistic role for the suite of expression and metabolite changes seen in this double mutant is not shown.</italic> </p><p>As noted above in the response to the editor, we agree that we have not made a firm mechanistic link between the TGA phenotype and the suite of expression and metabolic changes. We have carefully gone through the entire manuscript and softened conclusions where needed, including the following:</p><p>1) We changed the subheading title &quot;Overactive galactose catabolism causes widespread metabolic and regulatory defects&quot; to &quot;Overactive galactose catabolism precedes widespread metabolic and regulatory defects&quot;.</p><p>2) In the Abstract, we changed âdue to overly rapid galactose catabolismâ to âlikely due to overly rapid galactose catabolismâ</p><p>3) In the third paragraph of the subsection âOveractive galactose catabolism precedes widespread metabolic and regulatory defectsâ, we changed &quot;was insufficient to explain TGA&quot; to &quot;seemed unlikely to be sufficient to explain the TGA phenotype.&quot;</p><p>4) At the end of the subsection âSpecific sugars can exacerbate metabolic overloadâ, we changed &quot;show&quot; to &quot;suggest&quot;.</p><p>5) In the subsection âBiodiversity offers a panoramic window to molecular biologyâ, we removed âMetabolic overload led to the accumulation of [â¦] decoupled from gene regulationâ, rephrasing this to â[â¦] likely due to metabolic overload [â¦]â.</p><p>6) In the last paragraph of the subsection âStrains lacking the co-repressors arrest their growthâ, we changed &quot;caused by&quot; to &quot;associated with&quot;</p><p>7) In the third paragraph of the subsection âOveractive galactose catabolism precedes widespread metabolic and regulatory defectsâ, we changed &quot;To further test the hypothesis that overly rapid galactose catabolism caused TGAâ to &quot; To further characterize how overly rapid galactose catabolism might lead to the TGA phenotype, [â¦]&quot;.</p><p>8) At the end of the subsection âOveractive galactose catabolism precedes widespread metabolic and regulatory defectsâ, we added &quot;likely&quot;.</p><p><italic>The authors make the interesting argument that the second paralog of GAL80, GAL80b, may have evolved in S. uvarum as a necessary brake on its highly active galactose metabolic program. Indeed, they show that GAL80b in S. uvarum is a stronger repressor of GAL1 than is GAL80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). More support for fitness-relevant functions of GAL80b could strengthen the manuscript. Since GAL80 alone is sufficient to prevent the transient growth arrest that otherwise manifests in the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant in pure galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), any benefit of GAL80b wouldn't be in this condition. Rather, the GAL80b mutant in S. uvarum has a slight growth defect in a mixed sugar environment</italic> </p><p>First, we note that our evidence shows <italic>GAL80B</italic> is playing a more important role in repression in specific mixed sugar conditions. Arriving at conditions sensitive enough to detect a defect was challenging, and previous researchers were not successful (Caudy et al. 2013). The fact that we can only detect a growth defect in some conditions does not necessarily mean that it is not playing an evolutionarily important role in other conditions. Laboratory experiments lack the precision and sensitivity of natural selection, which can select against mutations whose growth defects are approximately the inverse of the effective population size.</p><p><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; it would be good to show the GAL80 mutant also in this figure).</italic> </p><p>The key finding is that <italic>GAL80B</italic> is required for a wild-type growth rate in at least one condition, a condition where a second braking mechanism is beneficial. If <italic>gal80</italic> mutants also had a quantitative effect in this condition, it is not clear that this result would change this conclusion (unfortunately, for this reason, that potentially interesting experiment has not been done). We note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows that <italic>gal80b</italic> mutants have more of an effect on <italic>GAL1</italic> reporter expression than <italic>gal80</italic> mutants in mixed sugar conditions.</p><p><italic>The mechanism of the latter phenotype would be of interest here, particularly in relation to S. uvarum's hyperactive galactose metabolic program which is the theme of the work.</italic> </p><p>Our working hypothesis is that the prominence of <italic>GAL80B</italic> in these conditions is largely due to its higher expression in the presence of galactose, rather than stronger protein activity per se. We have rephrased the last paragraph of the subsection â<italic>S. uvarum</italic> has two co-repressors with partially overlapping functionsâ to help highlight this view, &quot;Perhaps because of its dynamic expression, the deletion mutant phenotype of <italic>S. uvarum gal80bâ</italic> proved condition dependent.&quot; We agree that it is too preliminary to firmly conclude anything about this mechanism, but it would make for an interesting future study.</p><p><italic>A first part of the manuscript, of relatively modest scope, focuses on GAL3, which is a regulator in S. cerevisiae. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that S. cerevisiae can't grow in galactose when GAL1 is deleted (an S. uvarum GAL1 mutant is not reported).</italic> </p><p>As in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>S. uvarum gal1</italic> mutant does not grow on galactose. This data is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> and discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection âLess partitioned galactokinase and co-induction functionsâ, which has been rewritten to improve clarity.</p><p><italic>This defect can be rescued by the S. uvarum allele of GAL3, indicating a gain of metabolic function by the latter which the authors infer to be galactokinase activity.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above in the response to Justin Fay, we have added additional experiments to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and removed the conclusion that galactokinase activity was demonstrated directly. Based on prior work in <italic>K. lactis</italic>, we also note that <italic>S. cerevisiae GAL3</italic> probably lost metabolic function, rather than it being gained by <italic>S. uvarum GAL3</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper is clearly written, and despite technical complexity and detail-richness, makes an interesting read. The conclusions are in my view well supported, and with adequate controls that use dot be a standard but are now missing in many studies (e.g. reintroduction of the knocked out gene in a different locus to ensure the phenotype is related to this gene missing and not some other genomic perturbation). The study addressed multiple aspects including changes in transcriptome and metabolomics (including the identification of galactose-1-phosphate as the origins of toxicity). While I could imagine (and could not resist suggesting) interesting experiments that may provide further insights, I am impressed by the breadth of the data and there is no need in my view to demand additional experiments.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their supportive comments and appreciation of this work. We note that, although galactose-1-phosphate toxicity could be playing a minor role, metabolic defects downstream of this step are much more substantial.</p><p><italic>Comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) GAL gene content and sequence differences:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reading the next section one wonders if the S. uvarum Gal1/3 the products of the WGD? But then, the authors state: that divergence of &quot;ScerGAL1 and ScerGAL3 happened after the divergence of S. uvarum and S. cerevisiae. I suggest to explicitly discuss Gal1/3 in this section. Further, although these are not the results of this study, still, a schematic phylogenetic tree(s) for the species and genes addressed here would really help the reader who is not familiar with yeast phylogeny and/or the Gal system.</italic> </p><p>In the subsection âGAL gene content and sequence differencesâ it now clearly states that <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL3</italic> are paralogs generated by the WGD. We have also included the explanation for the inference at end of the next section, âThus, it is likely that the homologs in the common ancestor of <italic>S. uvarum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were more functionally redundant than in modern <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [â¦]â Since these genes started to functionally diverge well before the origin of the genus <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, we have softened the conclusion about <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL3</italic> divergence, so that it reads, &quot;considerable subfunctionalization&quot;, instead of &quot;much of the subfunctionalization&quot; We considered moving <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which contains the schematic phylogenetic trees, to earlier in the study; unfortunately, the main purpose of this figure is to summarize and discuss the results of the study. We hope that the added text clarifying the relationships of <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL3</italic> and the final layout of the manuscript will make the information sufficiently accessible to readers.</p><p><italic>2) &quot;The less active S. cerevisiae GAL network is less susceptible to metabolic overload&quot; The data in this section relates to the GAL80 knockouts of both species. Wouldn't the right comparison be the wild-types?</italic> </p><p>As discussed in the response to the editor, we have changed the title of this section by adding &quot;when derepressed&quot; to better reflect the results. We have only observed the TGA phenotype and metabolic overload in mutants; it is likely that the wild-type gene networks of both species do a decent job of preventing metabolic overload under normal conditions. The means by which the species achieve this regulation is what differs: <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a low-activity network and less robust repression, while <italic>S. uvarum</italic> has a high-activity network and more robust repression.</p><p><italic>3) Related to the above: Galactose catabolism in S. uvarum can be highly activated compared to S. cerevisiae. This is clearly demonstrated by the individual growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Still, one wonders if, when mixed, these two species will show growth dynamics that are consistent with S. uvarum winning the competition at high galactose, but may be S. cerevisiae winning at low galactose plus glucose (or mannose, fructose)? Or maybe, S. uvarum's GAL network is superior across the board (I'd expect tradeoffs, but still)? In general, direct competition may reveal a bit more about the evolutionary contexts under which the GAL networks diverged differently in various species, but this just a suggestion, not a request for additional data.</italic> </p><p>Direct competition experiments could prove much more sensitive for detecting some of the tradeoffs that the reviewer hypothesizes, and we agree it may be worth exploring this system further in that context. Growth curve analyses are a much less sensitive technique, so the differences that we do report are quite large indeed. Thus, the conclusions we have reached are well supported, even if there might be additional differences that we lacked sensitivity to detect. Even with this limitation, growth curves have the added benefit of being able to study the culture dynamics of an individual strain, which was key to characterizing the previously overlooked TGA phenotype.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection âS. uvarum has two co-repressors with partially overlapping functionsâ, at the start of the second paragraph: why &quot;although&quot;, maybe âbecauseâ?</italic> </p><p>We agree that &quot;Although&quot; did not quite convey our meaning, and we have rephrased this to explicitly focus on the gene expression differences between the paralogs: &quot; Perhaps because of its dynamic expression, [â¦]&quot;.</p><p><italic>5) Inevitably, jargon and acronyms are used massively, and to some readers (this reviewer, for example) this comprises a hurdle. May be at least add one word to make it easier, e.g. TGA phenotype, or PGM gene.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we have added &quot;phenotype&quot; or &quot;phase&quot; after each reference to TGA. We have also added &quot;gene&quot; to uses of <italic>PGM1</italic> where it might have been unclear from context. Most of the genes (e.g. <italic>GAL1, GAL3, GAL80, GAL80B</italic>) or the proteins they encode were referred to often enough in the study that we trust the readers will be able to follow it, but we welcome any other specific suggestions.</p><p><italic>6) Discussion (subsection âThe non-equivalence of sugars in contributing to metabolic overloadâ, last paragraph): I'm not sure that human metabolic defects are so relevant.</italic></p><p>We have deleted most of this paragraph. We also shortened the previous paragraph to make room for a very brief mention of the reported link between fructose overconsumption and cancer and diabetes (subsection âThe non-equivalence of sugars in contributing to metabolic overloadâ).</p><p><italic>7) Concluding paragraph: I can imagine situations where paralogue loss may also relief clashes (no immediate reference comes to mind, except that in domesticated strains prologue inactivation is quite common, as are WGDs of course).</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is a very interesting idea worthy of further investigation. We could not think of a precise example either, and we do not think our system meets the criteria, at least with current data. To at least advertise this hypothesis, we now refer to the recently proposed idea of &quot;paralog interference&quot; in the last paragraph of the subsection âOngoing functional diversification of paralogs and their gene networksâ. We reference a study from Sandy Johnson's lab that proposed specific amino acid substitutions as a way of relieving paralog interference, but one could imagine paralog loss as being another way of accomplishing this relief in certain circumstances.</p></body></sub-article></article>
