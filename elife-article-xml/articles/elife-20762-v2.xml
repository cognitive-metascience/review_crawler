The ligand-receptor pair, Netrin (Net) and Frazzled (Fra) (DCC, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer, in vertebrates), is recognized as the prototypical effector of chemoattraction, with roles in both long- and short-range guidance. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, R8 photoreceptor growth cones were shown to require Net-Fra to reach their target, the peak of a Net gradient. Using live imaging, we show, however, that R8 growth cones reach and recognize their target without Net, Fra, or Trim9, a conserved binding partner of Fra, but do not remain attached to it. Thus, despite the graded ligand distribution along the guidance path, Net-Fra is not used for chemoattraction. Based on findings in other systems, we propose that adhesion to substrate-bound Net underlies both long- and short-range Net-Fra-dependent guidance <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby eroding the distinction between them.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20762.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20762.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20762.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain of the fruit fly contains hundreds of thousands of neurons, while the human brain contains more than 80 billion. Each of these consists of a cell body that bears an array of branches called dendrites, plus a single cable-like axon. During development, the neurons organize themselves into complex networks by forming connections with one another via their axons and dendrites. But it is not clear exactly how the correct connections form in the correct places.</p><p>As they grow out, axons rely on specialized moving structures at their tips – known as growth cones – to probe their environment in search of attractive and repulsive chemical signals released by other cells. When sensors on the surface of growth cones detect a target signal, they initiate processes that cause the growth cone to expand or collapse. This enables the axons to move towards or away from the signal, as appropriate. In all animals studied, proteins called DCC and Netrin form one of the best-known sensor-signal pairs. Growth cones bearing DCC sensors are thought to detect ‘wafting plumes’ or gradients of Netrin and then grow towards the Netrin source.</p><p>However, nobody had directly watched neurons respond to Netrin in a living intact animal. Using a type of microscope that can look deep into the developing fly brain, Akin and Zipursky have now followed the movement of growth cones on cells called R8 neurons in fruit fly pupae. Unexpectedly, Akin and Zipursky found that the growth cones of mutant flies that lack Netrin or Frazzled (the fruit fly version of DCC) navigate successfully to their intended destinations. Once there, however, the mutant growth cones were unable to attach to their targets.</p><p>Akin and Zipursky’s work is consistent with other observations in a number of animal and insect systems that suggest that Netrin may not attract growth cones via wafting plumes of signal. Instead, Netrin may form a sticky trail that helps growth cones to gain traction as they crawl towards or stick to their destinations. Further experiments are now needed to test whether other neurons in fruit flies and in different animals use Netrin in this way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20762.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20762.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd><kwd>axon guidance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zipursky</surname><given-names>S Lawrence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akin</surname><given-names>Orkun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct observation in the developing fly brain indicates that the response of a growth cone in a gradient of a guidance cue is adhesion to the source of the cue rather than attraction by the gradient.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Net, a secreted protein, and its receptor DCC together play a critical role in wiring the brain in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Net-DCC mediated axon guidance has been well characterized in the developing vertebrate spinal cord. In brief, Net expressed at the floor plate is proposed to diffuse to establish a decreasing ventral-to-dorsal gradient within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennedy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>). This gradient, in turn, is proposed to promote the guidance of commissural neuron growth cones ventrally to the floor plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fazeli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>). Classic <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using purified proteins and explant cultures also support a role for Net as a chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Torre et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Net-DCC based axon guidance to the midline is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in nervous system development. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, loss of UNC-6 - UNC-40 (the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of Net-DCC) signaling leads to dorsal displacement of axon tracts that are positioned ventrally in wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishii et al., 1992</xref>). And in <italic>Drosophila, Net</italic> and <italic>Frazzled</italic> (<italic>Fra</italic>, the Drosophila homolog of DCC) are required for axons to cross the midline of the embryonic ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolodziej et al., 1996</xref>). Here, a number of neurons from each side of the midline send their axons contralaterally, creating the commissures of the ventral nerve cord. Net is expressed at the midline by glia and Net protein is found as a gradient that peaks at the midline. In <italic>Net</italic> or <italic>fra</italic> mutants, the commissures of the ventral nerve cord are missing or severely reduced, consistent with a loss of chemoattraction to the ligand source.</p><p>The spatial relationship between a Net-responsive growth cone and the source of Net in the fly visual system is similar to both the fly midline and vertebrate spinal cord. The fly visual system is modular, comprising some 750 columns. Different neuronal cell types, including R8, extend axons within each column, where they terminate in different layers. R8 growth cones reach their target, the M3 layer of the medulla neuropil, in two steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ting et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). They ‘park’ at a temporary target at the outer surface of the medulla, referred to as M0, and then, after a delay, extend to and terminate within the M3 layer. Salecker and colleagues demonstrated that R8 targeting to M3 requires <italic>Net-Fra</italic> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). R8s express <italic>Fra; Net</italic> is expressed by L3 growth cones within the M3 layer and is seen as a shallow gradient that stretches from M0 to M3, peaking sharply at M3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). R8 growth cones extend from M0 to M3 within a dense neuropil containing the processes of many different cell types. Without <italic>Fra</italic> or <italic>Net</italic>, many R8 terminals remain in M0 while others are stranded between M0 and M3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20762.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live imaging of R8 growth cones in the developing fly brain.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of R8 targeting.

However, a different interpretation was favored, one that proposed a local function for Net-DCC at M3 in target layer recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). Central to this conclusion was the observation that a membrane-tethered variant of Net, expressed from the endogenous locus, can support wild-type targeting. The same molecular strategy had been used in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic midline to establish that diffusible Net is not required for the <italic>Fra</italic>-dependent guidance of commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006</xref>). This seminal work solidified the short-range paradigm of Net-DCC mediated axon guidance in which a soluble gradient of the ligand is not required for function.</p><p>Notably, at both the embryonic midline and visual system, tethered Net is expressed in a graded fashion comparable to the secreted form. At the midline, the boundaries of Net expression largely reflect the extended lateral morphology of cells expressing Net, the midline glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006</xref>). Similarly, although Net is prominently expressed in L3 growth cones within the M3 layer, it is also visible as a gradient along the R8 targeting path between M0 and M3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus, while these studies are consistent with a Net requirement that is limited to the extent of the source cells, it is not known whether the observed graded distributions are important for axon guidance to the target—the peak of the Net signal.</p><p>Given the penetrance and expressivity of the <italic>fra</italic> and <italic>Net</italic> phenotypes in R8 (see below) and the genetic tools available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to explore mechanisms of axon guidance, we used live imaging to explore R8 targeting to M3 in more detail. Here we report, through detailed quantitative analysis of hundreds of mutant and wild type growth cones in intact developing animals that R8 growth cones in <italic>Net</italic> mutants or R8 growth cones lacking <italic>Fra</italic> target from M0 to M3 in a fashion indistinguishable from wild type. That is, Net does not act as a chemoattractant nor does <italic>Fra</italic> act as a chemoattractant receptor. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that R8 growth cones can recognize the target layer without <italic>Net-Fra</italic>. Instead, Netrin, DCC, and TRIM9, a signaling component directly downstream from DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morikawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2014</xref>), are essential for attachment of a single leading process extended from R8 growth cones to the target layer. We propose that R8 growth cones reach and recognize the target layer independent of Fra, adhere to the target layer in a Fra-dependent step, and this adhesion is consolidated by a TRIM9-dependent step. These findings favor the notion that in <italic>Drosophila Net</italic> mediates adhesion to neuronal processes or the extracellular matrix (ECM) at the target layer rather than promoting directed outgrowth to or recognition of the target layer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Live imaging reveals that R8 targeting occurs via discrete steps</title><p>To compare wild-type and mutant R8 targeting, we devised a live imaging protocol to follow growth cones in intact pupae as they extend from M0 to M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Alternatively, R8s could be increasing their lengths in concert with the growing medulla. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the reach of R8 projections to a fiducial marker for an outer medulla layer, the Dm3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the adult, Dm3 processes project across columns to weave a meshwork at the M2/M3 layer boundary, a position that corresponds to 67 ± 5% of the depth of R8 projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Between 45 and 60 hAPF, the Dm3-defined layer is gradually displaced from M0 at an average rate of 0.9 μm/hr (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Since the projections of these neurons extend orthogonally to medulla columns, the measured movement captures the expansion of the neuropil. During <italic>elongation</italic>, the ratio of the distance between M0 and the Dm3 layer and the reach of individual R8 projections is 61 ± 4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the R8s are increasing in length in concert with the growing neuropil. This result indicates that the target layer is reached at <italic>stabilization</italic>. It is possible that R8 axons actively and independently <italic>elongate</italic> to match the growth of the tissue. However, both <italic>elongation</italic> and medulla expansion continue through pre-synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref> and below), arguing that the concerted growth is supported by attachments to neighboring cells and the target layer.

At the onset of <italic>transformation</italic>, the original growth cone volume at M0 shrinks while the thin process fills out. The progress of <italic>transformation</italic> is not purely anterograde. In many cases, the apparent flow of material from the growth cone into the proximal length of the process and the expansion at the distal tip are distinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In the following ~5 hr, the R8 terminal takes on its mature form, which will eventually contain ~50 en passant synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>).

In genetically mosaic animals where <italic>fra</italic> is removed specifically from R8s, ~90% fail to reach the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>).

To clarify the interpretation of the live imaging data in the context of this ambiguity, we re-visited the mutant analysis through quantitative comparison of adult phenotypes.</p><p>In the adult brain, wild-type R8 projections reach 16.9 ± 1.7 μm into the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, top graph). The spread in this distribution is partly due to the 3D organization of this tissue; the absolute distance between layers changes along the two principal axes of the neuropil. Wild-type R8 projections, when expressed as a fraction of the distance between M0 and M6, reveal a more narrowly defined (0.75 ± 0.05) target layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, bottom graph). In addition to reducing variation within one brain, this normalization approach also enables more reliable quantitative comparisons to be made between R8s from different animals and different genetic backgrounds. For <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> R8 terminals, the normalized depth is well-described as a mixture of three distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and see Materials and methods).

However, the normalized depth for R8s in this genetic background can also be described as a mixture of three distributions, and the deepest reaching component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, graph and table) is nearly identical to that found in <italic>fra</italic> R8s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, graph and table) in terms of mean and standard deviation. In other words, the R8 depth distribution in the <italic>Net</italic> null background is well-described without a wild-type component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, bottom graph). To directly measure the distance between the R8 tips and the M3 layer in <italic>Net</italic> null animals, we used a <italic>Net</italic>-insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>) M3 marker, the Dm4 neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). In wildtype, 95% of R8 tips reach past the Dm4 midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). In contrast, only 19% of R8s in <italic>Net</italic> null animals extend this far. The majority of this 19% would belong to a sub-population distinct from wild type (i.e. tail of a mutant distribution); a much smaller fraction would be drawn from a purely wild-type component.</p><p>We conclude that the penetrance of the <italic>Net</italic> mutation for R8 targeting is much higher than originally reported and that the difference between <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> and <italic>Net</italic> R8 targeting defects is one of expressivity.</p><p>To study the <italic>fra-Net</italic> genetic interaction, we performed epistasis analysis by reducing Fra levels in R8 cells with RNAi in the <italic>Net</italic> null background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The phenotype of the double mutant was indistinguishable from <italic>Net</italic> null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). This result indicates that <italic>Fra</italic> and <italic>Net,</italic> as expected from a receptor-ligand pair, act in the same genetic pathway for R8 targeting. It also rules out the possibility of a second Fra ligand, acting in parallel with Net. However, the epistasis analysis does not rule out possible cell-autonomous contribution of other Net receptors. Indeed, the activity of such receptors in R8s would be consistent with the expressivity difference observed between the <italic>Net</italic> and <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> genetic backgrounds.</p><p>We assessed this possibility for Dscam1 and UNC-5 with genetic mosaic analysis and did not find any obvious defects in R8 targeting. These results are consistent with the findings of a recent a cell-type specific RNA sequencing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), which showed that, at the onset of targeting, Fra is the only Net receptor expressed in R8 above 1–2 RPKM, the common threshold for noise in these types of studies.</p><p>Together, the epistasis analysis and the lack of evidence for the R8-specific activity of other Net receptors indicate that the difference in expressivity between the <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> and <italic>Net</italic> phenotypes is due to a non-cell autonomous, pleiotropic effect of the <italic>Net</italic> mutation. Consistent with this finding, we found two other cell types with altered morphologies in the <italic>Net</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>).</p><p>Why is the expressivity of the <italic>Net</italic> whole animal phenotype on R8 growth cones less severe than the removal of <italic>Fra</italic> selectively from R8s in mosaic animals? What is surprising is not that they are different, but rather that the pleiotropy is associated with weaker R8 expressivity. Removing <italic>Net</italic> from the whole animal alters the development of multiple neuronal classes in the medulla. Some, like R8, may be affected through the <italic>Fra</italic> pathway, while loss of Net signaling through the UNC-5 receptor may be important in other cases. We suspect that some aspect of the micro-environment in which R8 growth cones develop becomes more permissive to the progress of <italic>transformation</italic> in the absence of <italic>Net</italic> (see below). Regardless of the specific causes of pleitropy, the altered medulla environment in <italic>Net</italic> animals confounds mechanistic interpretation of R8 growth cone defects.</p><p>For a more refined approach to studying the role of <italic>Net</italic> in R8 targeting, we pursued two strategies involving genetic manipulation of the L3 lamina monopolar neuron, the principal source of Net in the target layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). First, we ablated L3s through cell-type specific RNAi-mediated knock-down of a neurotrophic receptor. This experiment was originally published by our group where we showed that removal of all L3s led to a loss of Net from the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>). To compare the development of R8s with and without a home-column L3 in the same brain, we reduced the efficiency of the knock-down to achieve a partial ablation of the L3 array (~80% loss with ~20% surviving through eclosion). In this setup, all R8s with an L3 in the home column target as wild type. With R8s lacking a home column L3, we did observe targeting defects, but the phenotype was too variable to discern general patterns of growth cone behavior and draw mechanistic conclusions. We suspect that ablating L3, a major resident of the M3 layer, is too blunt a perturbation with pleiotropic consequences that go beyond removing a single secreted ligand.</p><p>As a second approach, we followed the targeting of wild-type R8s in columns with <italic>Net</italic> null L3s in genetic mosaics (i.e. MARCM) using live imaging. We did not observe any overt R8 phenotypes in this genetic background. The principal caveat here is that with MARCM in the lamina, mutant neurons appear as singlets or in small patches in an array of wild-type cells. We could not achieve mutant L3 patches large enough to ensure that any R8 sharing a column with a <italic>Net</italic> null L3 did not also neighbor at least one wildtype L3. Indeed, at 40 hAPF, L3 growth cones are very large along the dorso-ventral axis and extend into adjacent columns. Thus, it is likely that Net is contributed from wild-type L3 growth cones in neighboring columns.</p><p>In summary, the quantitative re-assessment of the mutant phenotypes and the epistasis analysis establishes that, for R8 targeting, removing either <italic>Net</italic> or <italic>Fra</italic> are equivalent perturbations. Thus, while it has not been possible to directly study the cell-type specific effect of removing <italic>Net</italic> on R8 targeting, we sidestepped the complications of <italic>Net</italic> genetics by focusing our efforts to characterize the role of Net-Fra signaling on comparing the dynamics of wild-type and <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic>-mutant growth cones in genetically mosaic animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Net-Fra signaling is not required for chemoattraction but promotes adhesion to the target layer</title><p>To study the role of <italic>Fra</italic> in R8 targeting, we combined live imaging with MARCM, a genetic strategy that relies on mitotic recombination to generate positively marked mutant cells in otherwise wild type tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>).

At ~48 hr, the tip of the thin process from these growth cones stalls at ~10 μm from M0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>), the approximate position of the target layer recognized by wild-type growth cones. At this point, <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> development diverges from wild type in two respects. First, the distal tips of <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> processes do not expand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). That is, while subtle dilations or other distinct structures may appear at this active site, these are invariably transient and are remodeled within 20–30 min to restore the thin morphology of the targeting process. Second, mutant processes do not stably adhere to the target layer. Instead, for the next ~10 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>), as wild-type R8s passively elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>), <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s actively follow a slowly advancing front in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), before they ultimately retract. That is, mutant R8s continue to extend and retract their thin processes, as their reach into the medulla increases over time. We term this behavior <italic>tracking</italic>.</p><p>We sought to assess whether <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> growth cones track the moving target layer. For each wild type and <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> growth cone in mosaic brains, we calculated the trendlines followed by the advancing R8 projections during <italic>elongation</italic> and <italic>tracking</italic> (see Materials and methods). Greater than 95% of <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s yielded <italic>tracking</italic> trendlines that are consistent with target layer trendlines of their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). Thus, <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s track the target layer. This indicates that mutant R8 growth cones recognize one or more determinant of target layer specificity. The observation of <italic>tracking</italic> uncouples target layer recognition and attachment. In R8s, target layer recognition does not require the <italic>Net-Fra</italic> pathway.</p><p>The onset of <italic>transformation</italic> occurs on schedule in <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>); however, in the absence of tip expansion, the progress of this morphological change is now only anterograde. As in wild type, Brp puncta enter mutant R8 projections following this anterograde expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). The progress of <italic>transformation</italic> is slow and fails to reach the target layer in the vast majority of <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> growth cones before the final retraction after <italic>tracking</italic> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). That is, while synaptogenesis is affected in <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> mutants, this is a downstream consequence of the earliest observable phenotypes—lack of tip expansion and stable attachment. The penetrance of the loss of target layer adhesion in <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> growth cones is complete, consistent with our quantitative analysis of the adult phenotype. Live imaging of R8 targeting in <italic>Net</italic> null animals revealed similar behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In summary, the <italic>Fra-Net</italic> pathway is required for the attachment of the R8 terminal to M3 (Figure 8a). The marked expansion at the tip in wild type is consistent with Net-Fra signaling coupling a cytoskeletal response to substrate adhesion.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20762-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20762.024</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Aligned <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic>Growth Cones</title><p>R8 growth cones are aligned through the time series and extracted from the full image volumes. myr::tdTOM expressing <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic>growth cones from one brain are shown.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20762.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20762.024</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20762.025</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>R8 targeting in <italic>Net</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Four growth cones from the same <italic>Net</italic> null mutant brain.

The last class, elongating <italic>Trim9<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s (40%), appear to complete <italic>transformation</italic> and <italic>elongate</italic> along with their wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>, bottom panel). As virtually none of the mutant R8s are found at the appropriate target depth in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and tip collapse was observed in 78% of the terminals during development, this last class of <italic>Trim9<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s must retract from the target layer sometime between 65 hAPF and eclosion (100 hAPF). We note that, similar to what is seen in the <italic>Net</italic> null background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), the efficiency of anterograde progression of <italic>transformation</italic> correlates with the three classes—that is, retracting <italic>Trim9<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s show minimal <italic>transformation</italic> while in all elongating <italic>Trim9<sup>null</sup></italic> R8s the process appears complete.

Second Column: In the alternate model, the Net source is detected independent of the gradient (gray), through filopodial search and capture (t1-t3) or directed extension of a targeting filopodia guided by a separate mechanism (not depicted). Net-DCC signaling at the ligand peak promotes attachment to the target (t4); the growth cone proper then reaches the target with the aid of this initial anchor (t5-t6).

The onset of synaptogenesis is also Net-Fra independent, and while standard genetic analysis cannot rule out a subsequent role for Net-Fra in this process, the attachment function precedes synaptogenesis. Each R8 growth cone in all three mutant backgrounds studied—<italic>Net</italic>, <italic>fra</italic>, and <italic>Trim9</italic>—extends a single process which reaches the M3 layer as in wild type. The targeting defects observed in the adult arise from retraction from M3 as a consequence of the lack of the stable association and morphological transformation of the tip of the R8 growth cone at the peak of the Net gradient. We note that given the cellular and molecular complexity of the medulla neuropil, retraction may also reflect the presence of repulsive factors in M3 uncovered through loss of Net-based attachment. This, however, is not consistent with the <italic>tracking</italic> behavior of mutant R8s; the persistent association of the tip of R8 growth cones with the target layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) is difficult to reconcile with a repulsive cue at M3. Despite this and other possible contributions to the terminal phenotype, the simplest interpretation of our data is that the Net-DCC interaction promotes adhesion. For the remainder of the discussion, we use this term to describe the role of Net-DCC signaling in R8 targeting.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Importance of live imaging to explore mechanisms of axon guidance</title><p>Live imaging coupled with the unique features of R8 targeting and comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant growth cones in mosaic animals were essential to pinpoint the requirement for the Net-Fra ligand receptor pair for target adhesion. Specifically, the identification and analysis of the <italic>tracking</italic> behavior of mutant R8s would not have been possible in fixed preparations. Standard fixation techniques do not preserve <italic>tracking</italic> filopodia at their full lengths; the shortcomings of fixation have been highlighted previously for cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>) in the context of the response of cells to morphogens. In addition, the continuous, extended observation of individual growth cones was critical to recognizing general trends over transient dynamics.

The simplest interpretation of such data would support the erroneous conclusion that half the R8 population required Net-Fra for chemoattraction. Thus, live imaging allowed us to discriminate between chemoattraction, target recognition, and retraction after reaching the target.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Net-DCC mediated adhesion in neuronal development</title><p>The canonical role of Net-DCC in neuronal development is axon guidance through chemoattraction: a gradient of soluble Net steers DCC-expressing growth cones to their targets. Adhesion is also a recognized output of Net signaling, particularly in non-neuronal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yebra et al., 2003</xref>). Biochemical and cell biological studies using dissociated vertebrate neurons or neural explants suggest that these different functions may share a fundamental mechanistic similarity. Structurally, Net can be described in three domains. The two N-terminal domains interact with cognate receptors, including DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</xref>). The C-terminal domain of Net is highly charged and mediates non-specific adsorption to cell surfaces, ECM components, and to tissue culture substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kappler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yebra et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, substrate-bound Net promotes adsorption of DCC-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shekarabi et al., 2005</xref>) and the Net-DCC interaction can withstand measurable pulling forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moore et al., 2009</xref>). Net’s ‘stickiness’ can be reduced by masking the charge with heparin or removing the C-terminal domain altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2012</xref>). These manipulations do not alter the ligand’s interaction with DCC, but significantly reduce the neuronal response to Net in classic <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of Net-DCC function, including growth cone expansion, axon outgrowth, and turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in the explant turning assay, a cluster of Net-secreting cells abutting a dissected embryonic spinal cord can attract extending commissural axons over a distance of some 200 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>). Without the C-terminal domain, the range over which Net can attract axons is markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with the importance of substrate binding to the function of externally supplied Net, most of the endogenous Net in the developing mouse spinal cord is cell- or ECM-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennedy et al., 2006</xref>). Together, these observations support the notion that “growth cones pull directly on the cues that guide them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2012</xref>), thereby unifying the chemoattraction and adhesion roles of Net-DCC in the concept of haptotaxis, or motility through traction.</p><p>The adhesion function of Net-DCC <italic>in vivo</italic> is well characterized in the anchor cell (AC), a non-neuronal cell in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> During development, the AC polarizes toward and invades the basement membrane, initiating the attachment of the uterus to the vulva. UNC-6 – UNC-40 signaling is required for the efficient completion of this process. In a series of studies using live imaging, Sherwood and colleagues demonstrated that UNC-6 localized to the basement membrane stabilizes UNC-40 clustering in the AC, which, in turn, directs polarized F-actin production to the basal surface of this cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hagedorn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ziel et al., 2009</xref>). Without UNC-6, UNC-40 can still form clusters and promote actin assembly, but these patches of activity are transient and randomly positioned around the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). MADD-2, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of Trim9, is also required in the AC to maintain stable and appropriately polarized F-actin patches; without MADD-2, basal patches can be transient, mis-localized actin assembly is observed, and, ultimately, basement membrane invasion is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The parallels between the use of Net-DCC-Trim9 in development by R8 and the non-neuronal AC—to effect a spatially constrained adhesion or polarization response at an acute presentation of Net (i.e. gradient peak for R8 and basement membrane enrichment for the AC)—raises the possibility that adhesion may be a widely conserved cell biological output of this signaling module.</p><p>In this context, R8 targeting and midline crossing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may function in a fundamentally similar way through an adhesion-based mechanism. Brankatschk and Dickson demonstrated that the growth cones of commissural neurons, like those of R8, respond to a membrane-tethered form of Net in a fashion indistinguishable from the secreted form of Net (2006). If commissural axons can, indeed, reach the midline without this signaling module—that is, if the mutant phenotypes, as in the R8 system, arise due to retraction rather than a lack of attraction, the role of Net-Fra would be better described as enabling the axons to traverse the dense midline neuropil. Alternatively, commissural growth cones may extend towards the midline via haptotaxis, growth via traction (and hence adhesion) along a pathway of increasing levels of Net bound to the surface of midline glia or associated ECM. Thus, given our current state of knowledge of midline crossing, it is possible that Net-Fra act through an adhesive mechanism in this system.</p><p>Evidence consistent with this view comes from the work of Emoto and colleagues, who carried out a detailed analysis of Trim9 function in the C4da neurons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morikawa et al., 2011</xref>). The branched axon terminals of these sensory neurons send projections that cross the midline of the ventral nerve cord (VNC), the larval counterpart of the embryonic midline. In <italic>Net</italic>, <italic>fra</italic>, and <italic>Trim9</italic> mutants, these projections are severely reduced or missing. There are three different sub-classes of C4da neurons and each subclass elaborates a characteristic number of contralateral projections. Neurons with more contralateral projections express higher levels of Trim9. Furthermore, overexpression of Trim9 produces ectopic projections in a dose-dependent manner. This overexpression phenotype is completely suppressed in a <italic>fra<sup>null</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morikawa et al., 2011</xref>). Given what we know of Trim9 function in stabilizing adhesion downstream of Net-Fra in R8s and polarization in the AC, the C4da results are consistent with Trim9 controlling the fine-tuning of midline crossing probability. The Net-Fra initiated midline contacts would then be either stabilized or lost depending on Trim9 levels, resulting in successful or retracted contralateral projections, respectively.</p><p>These observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with vertebrate growth cones raise the interesting possibility that Net-DCC-mediated adhesion may be a common mechanism used by growth cones in developing invertebrate and vertebrate brains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Circuit assembly through contact dependent processes</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman (1996)</xref> divided guidance signals into four categories. Short-range signals would act through direct contact between growth cones and cells or growth cones and the ECM to attract or repel growth cones. Conversely, long-range signals, secreted by cells, were proposed to act at a distance in a graded fashion to attract or repel growth cones.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both at the midline and in the visual system, a membrane-tethered form of Net is sufficient to rescue guidance phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). These results have been interpreted as evidence for a local or short-range function for Net-DCC. This is by contrast to the diffusible gradient view supported by the original conception of long-range chemoattraction and the results of turning assays of vertebrate growth cones <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, both at the midline and in the medulla, tethered Net is present as a gradient that peaks at the targets of guidance, and in the absence of studies testing the relevance of this cell-bound gradient to guidance, the distinction between the short- and long- range functions of Net-DCC remained unclear. Net is a secreted molecule of the laminin superfamily and, in principle, can diffuse to form a gradient. As noted above, however, data from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies argue in favor of the relevance of immobilized Net over that of a soluble form. Together, these results raise the possibility that Net-DCC guidance relies principally on immobilized Net, thereby eroding the mechanistic distinction between the short- and long-range guidance in a gradient.</p><p>In the R8 system, the gradient is not required. Our results show that the R8 growth cone can reach and recognize its target without the ligand gradient, or the receptor, in a fashion indistinguishable from wild type, and that Net-DCC act to promote adhesion at the source of Netrin. Despite the presence of Net along the path to M3, we cannot detect an effect of the ligand-receptor interaction while the tip of the R8 growth cone is moving up the Net gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Such spatial specificity in signaling output may be achieved through fine-tuning the response of the system to the ligand concentration, or by inhibiting the activity of the receptor until the target is reached.</p><p>How R8 uses Net-DCC may be idiosyncratic to this neuron. That is, the evidence against gradient-based chemoattraction in R8 targeting does not rule out a role for this mechanism in other <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts. If Net does act in a graded fashion in other systems, we suggest, in agreement with the work from the Sheetz lab, that it does so not as a soluble factor, but rather as a substrate-bound molecule that influences growth cone behavior through contact. The distribution of the ligand may be determined by localized expression at a single source followed by diffusion and adsorption. Alternatively, a track of cells may form a gradient by expressing and presenting different levels of Net on their surfaces. Thus at a mechanistic level, we propose that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, DCC responds to immobilized, not soluble, Net. This initial adhesive interaction may stabilize attachment as in the case of R8 or, alternatively, this may promote traction for growth cone motility along a surface (i.e. haptotaxis).</p><p>This and other studies of Net-DCC signaling in invertebrates and vertebrates raise the possibility that Net and other secreted signals within the developing CNS may act principally in close proximity to the source cells, either associated with the surface of cells or the ECM, to elicit discrete and localized responses. In the absence of action at a distance, neural circuit assembly would proceed in a stepwise fashion where neuronal processes sample a complex environment through direct contact (i.e. via ‘touch’ rather than ‘smell’), integrate these signals and transform them into morphological and biochemical specification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Histology and confocal microscopy</title><p>Histology was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) with minor modifications.

A typical multi-channel confocal stack of the medulla measures 150 x 150 x 180 µm and has voxel dimensions of 0.29 x 0.29 x 0.4 µm. In a pre-processing step, all channels are scaled in the z-dimension to achieve unit voxel aspect ratio. The Mab24B10 channel (i.e. all R cells) is used in the deconstruction. R7 axon terminals are the deepest-reaching visible features; a mask of the R7 axon tips is generated by manually cleaning up the image. Local intensity maxima in the original image are selected with this mask and the resulting point cloud is used to define the continuous 3D surface of the M6 layer. The bundles of R cell axons that stretch across the outer medulla surface increases the complexity of the image at M0; a more involved approach is required to define this layer. The area bounding the footprint of the R7 projections in M6 is divided into 50–72 regions, and, for each region, columnar volumes orthogonal to the M6 surface are extracted from the image. Intensity profiles along the column axis of these volumes are used to find local peaks, which are classified according to magnitude and their distance from the M6 surface. These two parameters are used to identify the peaks that reside in the M0 layer; the M0 surface is built from a point cloud derived from the selected peaks. A similar approach is used to compute the Dm4 surface. To define the medulla columns, a sequence of masks laminating the space between the M0 and M6 surfaces are used to generate maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of the Mab24B10 image. The cross-sections of R7-R8 projections are identified as local intensity maxima in these MIPs. Across the MIP sequence, the intensity maxima are grouped into individual tracks that define the position and orientation of the medulla columns. This information is used to create single panel MIPs of individual R8 axons from the R8 channel. The tips of R8 projections are marked manually on the MIPs and the input is used to calculate 3D distances to the M0 and M6 surfaces. Up to 500 R8s per medulla were scored with this approach.

Up to 18 animals can fit on a sample slide making it possible to image multiple flies in a single session. To provide sufficient immersion liquid for the long imaging sessions, a water reservoir is constructed on the opposite surface of the cover glass.

The cleaned stack is used as a mask to select local intensity maxima in R8 growth cones. The resulting point cloud, which is a sparse representation of the outer medulla surface, is fit to an oblate ellipsoid, yielding the rotation matrix that brings the medulla into alignment with the image axes (i.e. top-down view.) The point cloud itself is aligned to the image axes and used to define the continuous 3D surface of the outer medulla. A mask that contains the R8 growth cones, the shell mask, is built as a slab centered around this surface. Through an iterative cross-correlation search in the rest of the time series, coordinates that most closely match a region-of-interest (ROI) near the center of the R8 array in the anchor stack are identified. An ellipsoidal mask is used to extract volumes-of-interest (VOIs) centered on these coordinates in each stack.

Masked target VOIs are extracted from the next stack in the series, using 3D coordinates from the tracking step and vectors corrected with the medulla transformation matrix. Target VOIs are aligned to template VOIs with rigid body transformations and the aligned target VOIs are re-cast as the templates for the next iteration of the operation (i.e. next stack). This process has two principal outputs: (1) Refined 4D positions and orientations of R8 growth cones, and (2) Masked MIP series of individually aligned growth cones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

All three reviewers are enthusiastic about the work, appreciating the quantitative nature of the data and the novelty of the findings. As such, all three reviewers are enthusiastic about future publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, all three reviewers recommend greater caution with respect to data interpretation. The reviewers are not entirely convinced by the argument that these data over-turn existing models of chemo-attraction, in favor of target-dependent adhesion, particularly as adhesion is not directly assessed in the current paper. All three reviewers recommend revision of the text to reflect a more careful approach to data interpretation. In this context, the authors could consider the importance and caveats of existing data in greater depth (see specific comments of reviewers #2 and #3). There is also room for alternative interpretations that are not currently considered (see specific comments of reviewer #1). Clearly, the authors need not cite the examples or ideas proposed by the reviewers, but they should take full advantage of the fact that <italic>eLife</italic> does not impose strict limits on the length of the text. The title must be adjusted to be reflective of the novel ideas contained in the manuscript, without the definitive statement that Netrin acts through adhesion. Then, in generating a more thorough and even argument, the authors are free to favor their existing argument, but it should be done in the context of broader discussion.</p><p>Reviews:</p><p>The reviews from each of the individual reviewers are included here since they are in complete agreement and present a unified view of the work and make a unified set of recommendations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The work from the Zipursky laboratory is a beautiful example of applying detailed imaging analysis to the questions of axon guidance and target recognition in an intact organism. The authors examine the effects of loss of a well-studied axon guidance molecule and, by examining the time-resolved response underlying failed guidance, arrive at a striking new observation. Essentially, the authors observed that the growth cones reach their target before retracting.</p><p>The significance of the claims made in the manuscript is based on the observation that a growth cone retracts only when it reaches the target cell, in mutations that delete Netrin signaling. The authors argue that this refutes gradient-based chemoattractive signaling by Netrin since the phenotype is only observed upon target contact. The counter model, provided by the authors, is that Netrin mediates target-dependent adhesion. In the absence of target-dependent adhesion, the growth cone collapses. This is the basis for a proposed over-turning the chemotactic gradient model. However, there is no direct evidence for this adhesive model in this system, only reference to the potential adhesive properties of Netrin in other systems. The authors adamantly support their model without excluding or entertaining other equally plausible ideas. This is where the authors should be more circumspect.</p><p>Growth cone retraction necessitates a counteracting force. A lack of a single adhesive interaction would not necessarily cause growth cone retraction. Indeed, it might be expected to cause a bypass of the target or cause increased growth cone elaboration, as it searched for the correct target. In essence, the growth cone collapse that the authors observe could equally be caused by unveiling a prominent contact-dependent repulsive cue that is normally overcome by the presence Netrin. If so, the observation of target-dependent growth cone collapse in the absence of Netrin is not evidence for a lack of a gradient of Netrin. Thus, in my view, this paper is an important addition to the literature, but does not effectively refute the existing model of Netrin function. Indeed, it is difficult to completely argue against early work in vitro showing secretion of Netrin acting at a distance in cell explants. Thus, it would be appropriate to consider models, such as the one suggested above – or others – that would also be consistent with the fundamental observation In essence, the absence of causal evidence is not evidence in favor their model.</p><p>Beyond this, I have little criticism of the data acquisition or analysis. The experiments are nicely performed, the genetics are solid and the image analysis is quite nice. I am enthusiastic about publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study made valuable contributions to the axon guidance literature by carefully observing and quantifying the behavior of wild-type and DCC mutant R8 growth cones before and at their medulla targeting M3 zone. The authors found that DCC mutant R8 growth cones reach the M3 zone, but fail to stabilize and eventually retract. Based on these observations, the authors conclude that Netrin/DCC do not act as long-range chemoattraction, but short-range adhesion to stabilize the contact. Overall the technical quality of the data is high and I support its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In their interesting discussion of the Netrin literature, the authors set up two alternative models for Netrin's action: 1) acting locally to promote adhesion (as in the case of R8 axon targeting to the M3 zone); 2) acting at a long-range attractive molecule (as was proposed in the classic case of midline guidance). While I agree with the authors that the evidence for netrin acting as a diffusible long-range signal in vivo remains to be proven, due to technical limitations, its long-range action in in vitro explants is quite strong. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the Kennedy et al. paper (Cell, 78:425, 1994), floor plate tissues or Cos cells transfected with Netrin, when placed on the side of the dorsal spinal cord explants, can cause commissural axons that otherwise grow ventrally to turn towards the side. Axons as far as 250 micrometers away from the source of netrin-expressing cells can be induced to turn. It is possible that secreted netrin is deposited on the substrate in the dorsal spinal cord explant and not freely diffusible, and axon turning is caused by preferring ever stronger force of adhesion to higher concentration of netrin. In this regard, adhesion and chemoattraction is not mutually exclusive. Adhesion may be a specific mechanism by which axons are attracted to its target. The authors may consider incorporating this in their Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This careful study by Akin and Zipursky examines how the Net/<italic>fra</italic> system works in <italic>Drosophila</italic> R8 growth cone morphogenesis. Although originally proposed to be a long range chemoattractant, numerous works, first in vertebrates and then in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, have indicated that Netrin/DCC can function in cell adhesion. Akin and Zipursky use live cell imaging to examine whether in R8s, net acts as a chemotaxic agent via <italic>fra</italic>. Using several germline and mosaic genetic approaches, the authors demonstrate that the initial extension of the R8 filopodial process towards the net-producing cell is not affected in these mutants. Instead, it is the stabilization of that extension that requires net and <italic>fra</italic>. While adhesion itself is not addressed by any of the experiments, the observations are consistent with a role for Net/<italic>fra</italic> in, not chemotaxis, but stabilization of the R8 projection.</p><p>The re-examination of the phenotype, and reevaluation of the penetrance of the Net mutation for R8 targeting is of interest, but the crux of the paper is clearly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which describes the correct targeting of the initial R8 process in the absence of <italic>fra</italic>.</p><p>This work builds on work on Netrin as well as in other fields, such as the recent work by JP Vincent, to argue that many cues thought to function at a distance may in fact work in direct cell-cell communication. This work also builds on work such as that of Heiman and Shaham indicating that anchoring of a neuronal projection can be an important aspect of neuronal morphogenesis and function.</p><p>A few points of clarification: Dm3 is used to define the edge of M3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Was there a reason to switch from using Dm3 as a fiduciary mark to using all R neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</p><p>Also, the authors state that the third, deepest component of the R8 distribution for <italic>net</italic> and <italic>fra</italic> mutant cells are &quot;nearly identical&quot; (subsection “Revisiting the <italic>Net-fra</italic> phenotypes”, third paragraph). However, the contribution of the deepest reaching component in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> seems much more substantial than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, arguing that they are not nearly identical. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and 4D</xref> appear more similar (although not in the first, most superficial component).</p><p>A distinction is made between <italic>fra</italic> and Trim9, in that the former is absolutely required for tip expansion, but the latter is not. On this point, Net is glossed over, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> appears to show at least one example of tip expansion in the absence of Net. If true, this may also argue for Net-independent functions of <italic>fra</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20762.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The work from the Zipursky laboratory has combined quantitative imaging in the intact Drosophila visual system with genetic manipulation of key axon guidance genes to investigate the rules and logic governing the axon guidance and target selection process.

In this revised version, we do not directly compare R8 targeting to other examples of Net-DCC dependent axon guidance. We do, however, note that there is a gradient of Net along the path of the R8 growth cone and that neither this ligand gradient, nor the receptor, DCC, are required for reaching or recognizing the target of guidance, the M3 layer. As such, the gradient based chemoattraction model does not apply to R8 targeting. This is a strong conclusion; however, it is limited to the context of R8 targeting and the revised manuscript reflects this scope.</p><p><italic>However, there is no direct evidence for this adhesive model in this system, only reference to the potential adhesive properties of Netrin in other systems.

Our argument for an adhesive function for Net-DCC signaling at M3 rests on two observations:</p><p>1) During the <italic>elongation</italic> stage, R8 axons grow at a rate proportional to the growth of the medulla. The data for this result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The slow and coordinated growth of R8 projections during <italic>elongation</italic> stand in sharp contrast to the fast and individualized dynamics of the <italic>extension</italic> stage. It is possible that the apparently coordinated growth is indeed due to active extension by each R8 projection. However, this extension happens while the growth cones are transforming into nascent axon terminals with pre-synaptic components assembling at future sites of synaptic contacts. This suggests that the R8 projection is no longer a motile growth cone and supports the notion that <italic>elongation</italic> represents passive lengthening in response to the expansion of the surrounding tissue. From this, we infer that R8 projections become attached to the target layer at the onset of <italic>elongation</italic>, i.e. at the <italic>stabilization</italic> step. In the interest of a streamlined main text, much of this detailed account was provided in Supplementary Discussion; it is now part of the main text (subsection “Live imaging reveals that R8 targeting occurs via discrete steps”, third paragraph).</p><p>2) In the absence of Net-DCC signaling, the <italic>stabilization</italic> step is lost and <italic>elongation</italic> is replaced by a behavior we described as <italic>tracking</italic>. Briefly, mutant R8 processes continue to extend and retract while they follow a moving position in the medulla that is consistent with the target layer. R8s growth cones exhibit this <italic>tracking</italic> behavior for an average of 10 hours before they ultimately retreat from the target layer. The retractions seen during and after <italic>tracking</italic> indicate that in contrast to wildtype, mutant R8s are not stably attached to the target layer. In addition to this dynamic phenotype, there is a morphological correlate to the loss of <italic>stabilization</italic>: the tips of mutant R8 processes do not expand. We note that there is an interesting parallel between Net-DCC dependent tip expansion in the R8 system and Net-dependent growth cone expansion observed with vertebrate neurons in vitro.</p><p>In summary, we interpret the data described above to conclude that wildtype R8s become attached to the target layer at the <italic>stabilization</italic> step and that DCC-Net signaling mediates this attachment.</p><p><italic>In essence, the growth cone collapse that the authors observe could equally be caused by unveiling a prominent contact-dependent repulsive cue that is normally overcome by the presence Netrin.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s caution that growth cone dynamics, particularly in the native environment of the developing CNS, is a very complex process under the influence of many factors and forces. In the manuscript submitted we did note that retraction could, as the reviewer suggested, be a consequence of uncovering of a repulsive factor in the absence of Net. We have now expanded on this (Discussion, third paragraph) to underscore the complexity of phenotypic analysis in the complex environment in the developing CNS. It does seem unlikely that retraction is a consequence of repulsion, however, as it is difficult to reconcile the persistent association of the R8 tip in mutants with the target layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) with a contact-dependent repulsive cue. That is, in the absence of DCC <italic>tracking</italic> growth cones often remain associated with target layer for hours. We note that this observation could only be appreciated through live imaging.</p><p><italic>If so, the observation of target-dependent growth cone collapse in the absence of Netrin is not evidence for a lack of a gradient of Netrin. Thus, in my view, this paper is an important addition to the literature, but does not effectively refute the existing model of Netrin function.</italic> </p><p>The argument against the relevance of the Net gradient in R8 targeting does not depend on the role of Net-DCC at the target layer. As the reviewer notes, R8s can reach the target layer without the gradient – that is, the terminal mutant phenotype arises from retraction and not a lack of attraction. This is the evidence that argues against chemoattraction in this system.</p><p><italic>Indeed, it is difficult to completely argue against early work in vitro showing secretion of Netrin acting at a distance in cell explants. Thus, it would be appropriate to consider models, such as the one suggested above – or others – that would also be consistent with the fundamental observation In essence, the absence of causal evidence is not evidence in favor their model.</italic> </p><p><italic>Beyond this, I have little criticism of the data acquisition or analysis. The experiments are nicely performed, the genetics are solid and the image analysis is quite nice. I am enthusiastic about publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p>We expanded our discussion of the work of Moore and colleagues (Moore et al., 2012) in the revised manuscript (subsection “Net-DCC mediated adhesion in neuronal development”, first paragraph). This study shows that substrate adsorption of Net is important to the neuronal response to Net in many classic in vitro assays, including growth cone expansion, axon outgrowth, and axon turning in embryonic spinal cord explants. While their results do not argue against the diffusibility of Net, they do suggest that the biological output of Net-DCC depends on immobilized ligand. As such, the classic view of chemoattraction by Net-DCC may be better thought of as haptotaxis, or motility through traction, rather than chemotaxis. From this perspective, the adhesion function we infer for Net-DCC in R8s is wholly consistent with the recognized role of Net-DCC in axon guidance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] In their interesting discussion of the Netrin literature, the authors set up two alternative models for Netrin's action: 1) acting locally to promote adhesion (as in the case of R8 axon targeting to the M3 zone); 2) acting at a long-range attractive molecule (as was proposed in the classic case of midline guidance). While I agree with the authors that the evidence for netrin acting as a diffusible long-range signal in vivo remains to be proven, due to technical limitations, its long-range action in in vitro explants is quite strong. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the Kennedy et al. paper (Cell, 78:425, 1994), floor plate tissues or Cos cells transfected with Netrin, when placed on the side of the dorsal spinal cord explants, can cause commissural axons that otherwise grow ventrally to turn towards the side. Axons as far as 250 micrometers away from the source of netrin-expressing cells can be induced to turn. It is possible that secreted netrin is deposited on the substrate in the dorsal spinal cord explant and not freely diffusible, and axon turning is caused by preferring ever stronger force of adhesion to higher concentration of netrin. In this regard, adhesion and chemoattraction is not mutually exclusive. Adhesion may be a specific mechanism by which axons are attracted to its target. The authors may consider incorporating this in their Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that adhesion and chemoattraction are not mutually exclusive and we have included this point in the revised manuscript (subsection “Net-DCC mediated adhesion in neuronal development”, first paragraph and subsection “Circuit assembly through contact dependent processes”, fourth paragraph). We also included a discussion of the turning assay the reviewer describes (subsection “Net-DCC mediated adhesion in neuronal development”, first paragraph) – please see also our last response to Reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] A few points of clarification: Dm3 is used to define the edge of M3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Was there a reason to switch from using Dm3 as a fiduciary mark to using all R neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</italic> </p><p>The Dm3 cell elaborates its processes at the M2/3 boundary and is used in this study as fiducial layer marker in the distal medulla. In theory, the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could have been carried out with this marker. In practice, it would have been technically challenging to incorporate two additional transgenes into all of the different genetic backgrounds studied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The monoclonal antibody 24B10 specifically labels R cells in all genetic backgrounds, which eliminates the need to incorporate further transgenic elements.</p><p><italic>Also, the authors state that the third, deepest component of the R8 distribution for net and fra mutant cells are &quot;nearly identical&quot; (subsection “Revisiting the Net-fra phenotypes”, third paragraph). However, the contribution of the deepest reaching component in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> seems much more substantial than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, arguing that they are not nearly identical. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and 4D</xref> appear more similar (although not in the first, most superficial component).</italic> </p><p>The means and standard deviations of the C3 components for <italic>fra</italic> and Net are nearly identical. While it is true that C3 has twice the contribution to the composite distribution in Net as it does in <italic>fra</italic>, the salient point here is that the Net distribution is well-described without a component that is similar to wildtype – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. This point is clarified in the revised manuscript (subsection “Re-visiting the Net-<italic>fra</italic> phenotypes”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>A distinction is made between fra and Trim9, in that the former is absolutely required for tip expansion, but the latter is not. On this point, Net is glossed over, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> appears to show at least one example of tip expansion in the absence of Net. If true, this may also argue for Net-independent functions of fra.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to detail. The experiments presented on role of Net in R8 targeting were carried out in whole animal mutants by contrast to the cell type specific MARCM approach taken for <italic>fra</italic> and Trim9. In addition to <italic>fra</italic>, Net is a ligand for other receptors such as Unc-5 and Dscam and many cell types in addition to R8 are likely to be using this ligand during development. Indeed, we did report two additional cell types whose morphologies were altered in the whole animal Net null background. As such, we do not expect the observed R8 phenotypes to arise solely due to the absence of Net-Fra signaling in R8; pleitropy was expected and observed due to what is likely to be an altered and inhomogeneous medulla environment. In this context, the quantitative re-assessment of the mutant phenotypes and the epistasis analysis were critical in establishing that for R8 targeting removing either the ligand or the receptor were equivalent perturbations. These results justified our focus on the component with the cleaner genetics, <italic>fra</italic>, when identifying patterns of cell behavior and drawing mechanistic conclusions. The mutant phenotypes in the Net null background are broadly similar but there are more exceptions to each pattern. The example the reviewer noted is one such exception. As we note in the text, we do see transient dilations and other elaborations at the R8 tip in <italic>fra</italic> mutants as well; however, these differ from wildtype tip expansion in that they do not last. To us, the features noted by the reviewer look more like these transient dynamics than true tip expansion. The salient point is that, given the genetic background, it is not possible to ascribe such specific morphologies solely to a cell autonomous effect of the Net null mutation on R8 development. We did try a number of other approaches for a more ‘surgical’ removal of Net from the distal medulla; these are detailed in the Discussion. Unfortunately, these alternatives were not free from their own technical difficulties and caveats.</p></body></sub-article></article>
