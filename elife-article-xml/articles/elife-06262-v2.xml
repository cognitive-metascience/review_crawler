The cerebellum is composed of a cortex and several nuclei. The nuclei are thought to ‘compute’ the signals that are sent from the cerebellum to other parts of the brain to control posture and movement. They do this under the supervision of the cortex. The main interaction between the cortex and the nuclei involves cortical neurons called Purkinje cells inhibiting the activity of the nuclei.</p><p>Ankri, Husson et al. have now used various genetic techniques and mutant mice to identify a new population of neurons in the nuclei of the cerebellum and to express fluorescent markers into these cells. This approach reveals that the axons of these neurons ‘climb’ from the nuclei to the cortex to form a new circuit called the inhibitory nucleo-cortical (iNC) pathway. Moreover, activating the iNC axons with light reveals that they selectively target and silence a population of neurons called the Golgi cells, which control the transmission of information in the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>Ankri, Husson et al. go on to show that the Golgi cells silenced by the iNC pathway differ from other Golgi cells in a number of ways: in particular, these Golgi cells use a chemical called GABA to communicate with neurons. The next challenge is to explore how the iNC pathway fine-tunes how sensory inputs are processed in the cerebellum, and to better understand its role in the execution of complex movements, including in people with conditions that affect motor function, such as ataxias.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

control of posture and movements as well as in cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ito, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leiner et al., 1993</xref>). Current cerebellar theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jacobson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dean and Porrill, 2011</xref>) mainly discuss cerebellar computation from the point of view of its cortical circuitry, where both pre-cerebellar mossy fibers (MFs) and inferior olive (IO)-originating climbing fibers (CFs) modulate Purkinje neuron (PN) spiking. Sensory-motor signal processing in the main cerebellar output structure, the cerebellar nuclei (CN), has received less attention. Modulation of spike frequency and timing in the CN projection neurons is considered to be mostly determined by the massive inhibitory cortico-nuclear projection of PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan-Palay, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Zeeuw and Berrebi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pedroarena and Schwarz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Telgkamp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Najac and Raman, 2015</xref>). However, certain aspects of cerebellar function persist even when the cerebellar cortex is selectively inactivated or damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thompson and Steinmetz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clopath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Longley and Yeo, 2014</xref>). Thus, a better understanding of the information processing in the CN as well as its influence on cerebellar cortical computation is needed.</p><p>Currently, the cerebellar cortex and the CN are known to interact through two circuits. The best known is the nucleo-olivary (NO) circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chaumont et al., 2013</xref>), where the small GABAergic CN cells, subject to PN inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Najac and Raman, 2015</xref>), project to the contralateral IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fredette and Mugnaini, 1991</xref>). This pathway regulates olivary activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chaumont et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>) and thereby complex spike activity in the PNs and cerebellar cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bengtsson and Hesslow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>). A less-known nucleo-cortical circuit is formed by the glutamatergic neurons of the CN which, in addition to projecting to various premotor and associative regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsukahara and Bando, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asanuma et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angaut et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sultan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruigrok and Teune, 2014</xref>), send axonal collaterals to the cerebellar granule cell layer (GrCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Houck and Person, 2015</xref>). These collateral fibers form MF-like terminals contacting granule cell (GrC) and Golgi cell dendrites (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tolbert et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hámori et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Payne, 1983</xref>). The functional significance of this excitatory nucleo-cortical (eNC) pathway, loosely following the modular arrangement of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dietrichs and Walberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gould, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haines and Pearson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tolbert and Bantli, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buisseret-Delmas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Provini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruigrok, 2010</xref> ; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Houck and Person, 2013</xref>), is likely related to efference copying of motor commands to the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sommer and Wurtz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Houck and Person, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the pathways linking the CN with the cerebellar cortex mentioned above, evidence has occasionally emerged for an inhibitory nucleo-cortical (iNC) pathway. GABAergic neurons have been shown to be labeled in the CN by retrograde tracing from the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Batini et al., 1989</xref>), and nucleo-cortical terminals with non-glutamatergic ultrastructural features have been found to contact putative Golgi cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tolbert et al., 1980</xref>). More recently, it was demonstrated that GlyT2-expressing CN neurons extend axons toward the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uusisaari and Knöpfel, 2010</xref>), suggesting that the iNC pathway might be identifiable by its glycinergic phenotype. While the iNC projection is likely to have significant impact on cerebellar computation, its postsynaptic targets and its functional organization remain unknown.</p><p>To establish the existence and prevalence of an inhibitory connection between the CN and the cerebellar cortex, we employed specific viral targeting of GABAergic and glycinergic neurons in the CN of GAD-cre and GlyT2-cre transgenic mouse lines, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>). We found that the GABA-glycinergic CN neurons form an extensive plexus of iNC axons, which contact Golgi cells in the cerebellar granular and molecular layers. Specific optogenetic activation of the iNC axons inhibited spikes in a distinct subpopulation of Golgi cells, characterized by their spontaneous firing, high neurogranin immunoreactivity, and negligible GlyT2 expression. As the functional significance of the iNC pathway is likely to be amplified by the high divergence of Golgi cells, which target thousands of GrCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hámori and Somogyi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jakab and Hamori, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Korbo et al., 1993</xref>), as well as the remarkable mediolateral extent of the iNC axons, the CN might play a key role in the regulation of the information flow through the GrCL.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nucleo-cortical projection neurons have a mixed GABA-glycine phenotype</title><p>In order to identify the iNC projection neurons, we specifically labeled the GABAergic and glycinergic CN neurons by injecting floxed adeno-associated virus (AAV) in the CN of GAD-cre and GlyT2-cre transgenic mouse lines, respectively.

These anatomical similarities imply that the axons labeled in the two transfection models represent the projections of a specific population of CN neurons with a mixed GABA-glycinergic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>).

First, we performed voltage-clamp whole-cell recordings from Golgi cells surrounded by transfected iNC fibers in GlyT2-cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). With the use of small collimated beams of light (see ‘Materials and methods’), we stimulated locations near Golgi cell dendrites with a single, short (5 ms) pulses. Inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were evoked in 9 out of 38 recorded Golgi cells (23.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C1</xref>) with a mean amplitude of 40 ± 28 pA. Given the ionic composition of our experimental solutions, the estimated reversal potential of −74 mV with the permeabilities of bicarbonate and chloride taken into account and the holding potential of −50 mV, the chord synaptic conductance was 1.7 ± 1.2 nS and the slope conductance was 1.9 ± 1.3 nS according to the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) equation. We calculated that the equivalent peak conductance of the iNC synapse measured in symmetrical chloride conditions would have been of 8.5 ± 5.9 nS.

While 64 out of 85 recorded Golgi cells fired spontaneously at low rates (mean frequency: 9.0 ± 6.5 Hz), the other 21 Golgi cells were quiescent and had a resting membrane potential negative to the spiking threshold (resting potential −55 ± 2.4 mV, spike threshold −43 ± 1 mV, n = 13 cells). When evaluating iNC effects in Golgi cells, it became obvious that only the spontaneously active Golgi cells (‘s-Golgi cells’) were responsive to iNC stimulation. Specifically, 24 out of 64 (37.5%) s-Golgi cells were inhibited by iNC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>; blue), whereas none of the 21 not-spontaneously spiking Golgi cells (‘ns-Golgi cells’; green) were affected by the stimulation. Repeating these stimulations during depolarizing current injections that drove the ns-Golgi cells to continuous spiking also failed to reveal iNC effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top right). These findings suggested that iNC fibers inhibit preferentially s-Golgi cells. It should be noted that our virus injections were unlikely to result in transfection of the entire iNC population, hence the observed fraction of inhibited s-Golgi cells is bound to be underestimated.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06262.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Golgi cell subtypes differ in their sensitivity to iNC input and have different intrinsic properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: a spontaneously active GoC (s-GoC) is inhibited by optogenetic iNC activation (light-blue bars above traces).

However, a few of the iNC-contacted Golgi cells exhibited a low level of eGFP staining in their somata (examples are indicated by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). To distinguish between the eGFP positive and negative Golgi cell subpopulations in a more objective manner, we quantified the normalized mean GlyT2-eGFP and neurogranin staining intensities at the somata of Golgi cells (n = 317 cells, n = 13 stacks n = 4 animals; see ‘Materials and methods’). The 2D distribution of the two staining intensities was separated into two populations based on k-means statistical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; green population: n = 238 Golgi cells (75%); blue population: n = 79 Golgi cells (25%); see ‘Materials and methods’). Golgi cells in the two groups differed mainly in their eGFP staining, as illustrated by the bimodal distribution of the mean eGFP intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The normalized neurogranin intensities were approximately 50% higher in the low-eGFP population (Wilcoxon test p &lt; 0.00001), even though distributions overlapped extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We, thus, consider that the blue population of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> constituting of Golgi cells expressing neurogranin and none or low levels of GlyT2-eGFP corresponds to the population of Golgi cells releasing principally or exclusively GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aubrey et al., 2007</xref>).

At saturating illumination intensity (1.3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), stereotypical high-frequency bursts of spikes were evoked with short light durations (10 ms), resembling the extracellular recordings in the GlyT2-cre slices. These bursts were riding on a depolarized plateau, which outlasted the illumination period, and were often followed by a prolonged depolarized after-potential and low-frequency firing. Increasing the duration of the light pulse extended the burst duration without affecting the intra-burst frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B2</xref>).

Based on our in vitro calibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), single 25-ms long light pulses are expected to evoke short bursts of firing in the iNC neurons. This illumination protocol suppressed spiking in 18 out of 86 recorded Golgi cells (21%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C2</xref>, left).

The variability of the inhibitory effect can be explained by the variability in iNC spike-burst duration that depends on the distance from the optic fiber and thereby stimulation light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Regardless of this variability, Golgi cells’ firing was robustly suppressed (frequency decreased to 1.58 ± 1.46 Hz from a baseline of 10.9 ± 3.9 Hz, n = 18 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D3</xref>).

Thus, the GABAergic rosette-like terminals found in GrCL glomeruli described in earlier works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan-Palay et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hámori and Takács, 1988</xref>) must arise from extracerebellar sources. The morphology and spread of the iNC axons as well as the axonal bouton size was also different from both the Golgi and Lugaro axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dieudonné, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dumoulin et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our study discards the suggestion that iNC axons would emerge as collaterals of GABAergic NO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tolbert et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haines, 1988</xref>). The neurons transfected in the GlyT2-cre animals do not include NO cells, as evidenced by the lack of labeling in the IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Zeeuw et al., 1994</xref>) and the clear difference in cell body size between GlyT2-cre and NO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).

Also, as the purely glycinergic neurons of the medial CN nucleus projecting to the vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall et al., 2009</xref>) are not found in the main targets of viral transfections in the present study (interpositus and lateral CN), they are unlikely to be the source of the iNC axons.</p><p>The nucleo-cortical axons in both GlyT2-cre and GAD-cre models were very similar in shape and function and co-stained for GAD and GlyT2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The small differences observed are likely to originate from variability in fixation procedures and wavelength dependence of optical resolution. Therefore, iNC fibers undoubtedly represent the axons of a single mixed CN neuron type. The density of nucleo-cortical fibers in the GAD-cre model was somewhat higher than in the GlyT2-cre model (compare panels 2A1 and 2B1), most likely due to the mosaic expression of cre in only 50% of mixed neurons in the GlyT2-cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>) as well as the stronger expression levels obtained with the AAV9 serotype virus used in the GAD-cre model.</p><p>The iNC neurons described in the present work show clear morphological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2</xref>) and electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) resemblances to the CN glycinergic neurons described in two recent studies as spontaneously inactive, mixed GABA-glycinergic neurons (compare the present results with Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uusisaari and Knöpfel, 2010</xref> and Figure 7Ab in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the iNC neurons, the ‘Gly-I’ neurons, and the mixed GABA-glycinergic neurons are the same cells. While these neurons also have local axon collaterals within in the CN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>), their projection to the cortex is their most distinguishing feature.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that Golgi cells can be divided into different groups based on their neurotransmitter content (GABA, glycine or both; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ottersen et al., 1988</xref>) as well as specific molecular marker expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Simat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pietrajtis and Dieudonné, 2013</xref>).

Here, we show that spontaneously spiking Golgi cells (s-Golgi cells), unlike the not-spontaneously spiking Golgi cells (ns-Golgi cells), receive functional synaptic contacts from the iNC fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). s-Golgi cells had relatively uniform properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), confirming their identification as a distinctive functional group.

The most common effect was a short-latency inhibition of spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>). In vivo inhibition of spiking could last for tens of milliseconds, most likely due to the iNC neurons’ propensity for high-frequency burst firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and to the slow kinetics of the relatively large synaptic conductances at iNC to Golgi cell synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Although the iNC axons may represent less than 5% of the afferent fibers in the GrCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hámori et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Legendre and Courville, 1986</xref>), the ramification of iNC axons, the high divergence of the Golgi cell axon, and the electrical coupling between Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>) will amplify the potency of the iNC effects on the GrCL network. The anatomical and electrophysiological evidence presented here suggests that the iNC pathway is likely to induce a period of disinhibition in the GrCs. This disinhibition could influence the time-window for MF input integration in GrCs, enhancing GrC excitability and thereby facilitate the activation of PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kanichay and Silver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D’Angelo and De Zeeuw, 2009</xref>). Confirmation of this functional significance will require experimentation in awake animals, as the MF/parallel fiber (PF) pathway is known to be quiescent in anaesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bengtsson and Jörntell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>) and no modulation of PN spiking is thus expected by the disinhibition of GrCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C2</xref>).</p><p>No iNC axons were found outside the cerebellar structures in the GlyT2-cre model, and no evidence for iNC contacts on cerebellar GrCs was seen, excluding the possibility of extracerebellar or PF effects on Golgi spiking. However, the glutamatergic projection neurons of the CN collateralising as an ‘eNC’ pathway that contact the neurogranin-positive Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tolbert et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hámori et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Payne, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Houck and Person, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2015</xref>) may be contacted by local iNC axons. The iNC synapses on the eNC neurons constitute only of a tiny fraction of their synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>), but we cannot completely exclude that some facet of the iNC-mediated depression of Golgi cell spiking in vivo may reflect a decrease in excitatory synaptic drive from CN-originating MFs. However, it is unlikely that the short bursts of iNC spikes evoked by our stimulation protocol would result in a long pause in spiking of CN projection neurons as they are extremely resistant to inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chaumont et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Najac and Raman, 2015</xref>). A short delay in eNC spikes is unlikely to be the principal source of the observed Golgi cell inhibition, unless the Golgi cell activity would be to a large extent determined by CN. Thus, while further work elucidating the functional role of the eNC projection to the cerebellar GrC layer is sorely needed, we conclude here that the inhibition of Golgi cell spiking observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is mainly caused by a direct inhibition by the iNC axon terminals impinging on Golgi cell dendrites and cell bodies.</p><p>A major feature of the iNC projection to the cortex is its divergence: upon relatively localized viral injection in the CN entire lobules may be innervated. Furthermore, single iNC axons traverse long distances along the medio-lateral plane, similarly to the PFs, making numerous contacts on individual Golgi cell dendrites. Such an arrangement could partly explain the synchronization of Golgi cell activity observed along the axis of the lobules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vos et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, disinhibition of GrCs by iNC axons could enhance and synchronize MF-PF transmission specifically along medio-lateral stripes, possibly contributing to on-beam synchronization of PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heck and Thach, 2007</xref>). iNC neurons may thus implement refined temporal binding of parasagittal cerebellar modules within a lobule. Intriguingly, while the iNC neurons, like all other CN neurons examined so far, are contacted by PN axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall et al., 2009</xref>), their intrinsic quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uusisaari and Knöpfel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) calls for identification of the sources of synaptic excitation, as they will determine the context within which Golgi cells would be inhibited. Possible candidates include the collaterals of CFs, MFs, and the local axons of CN neurons. While there is no direct evidence either for or against any of these sources, a few earlier works have described inhibition of Golgi cells in response to electrical stimulation of the IO or to sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schulman and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu and Edgley, 2008</xref>), suggesting that the IO might be the source of excitatory drive for iNC neurons.</p><p>Cerebellar GrC layer gating by Golgi cell network has been postulated for a long time to play a critical role in cerebellar function; however, the absence of experimental tools allowing specific control of the Golgi network during behavior has prevented investigation of this hypothesis. The novel, inhibitory pathway from the CN to the Golgi cells revealed in our present work opens a way for targeted manipulation and analysis of the information gating in the cerebellar granule layer. Furthermore, it is now reasonable to assert that through iNC neurons as well as the collateralization of glutamatergic projection neurons to the GrCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Houck and Person, 2015</xref>), the CN hold a key position to control the activity of the cerebellar cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed on adult mice (p &gt; 30 days; both males and females) of two mouse lines: the GAD-ires-cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>) and the GlyT2-cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition to the precautions taken during the stereotaxic injection procedures, during acute experiments, the slices were carefully and systematically examined before being used for electrophysiological experiments; if unintended labeling was present, the slices were discarded. Finally, before patch-clamping a Golgi cell, the morphology and location of the fibers was carefully examined in order to exclude the possibility of activating parasagittal long-range Lugaro axons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro data analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Igor Pro 6.1 (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR) and MATLAB R2009b (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Statistical analysis was performed using R GNU and MATLAB R2009b or R2012b. Data are presented in the text as mean ± S.D, unless otherwise specified. For statistical significance, Wilcoxon rank-sum, two-tailed Student's t-test (paired or unpaired), F-test, K-S test, and signed-rank tests were used, as applicable, taking into account possible assumptions of normality as mentioned in the results. Spike delay analysis was performed by aligning the last spikes before light stimulation in each trace for each cell and measuring the time to the next spike after light stimulation; the measurements were normalized to the cell's average ISI. For comparing electrophysiological properties of different types of Golgi cells, grand average AP waveforms were generated for each cell by averaging peak-aligned APs obtained during 1-s voltage sweeps while adjusting the firing frequency to ∼25 Hz with current injection as necessary, and then by averaging these peak-aligned mean waveforms across experiments. C<sub>m</sub> was defined as the ratio of membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) and time constant (τ), estimated from voltage responses (&lt;5 mV) to small hyperpolarizing current steps that did not activate voltage-gated conductances (evidenced by the good single-exponential fits to the voltage responses). AP threshold was defined as the voltage at the time of the main peak in the second derivative of the voltage trace; AP amplitude was measured as the voltage difference between the spike threshold and peak voltage. Spike half-width was measured spike duration at half-amplitude. Spike AHP voltage was measured at the post-spike minimum voltage. AHP time was measured as the time of AHP voltage after threshold, and AHP amplitude was measured as the difference of the AHP voltage and spike threshold voltage. For fair comparison of current-to-firing frequency ratios in different sized cells, the current injection values were normalized to the C<sub>m</sub> of each cell. Spike frequency adaptation index was quantified as the relative decrease in instantaneous firing frequency during a 1-s long depolarizing current step (from −65 mV holding level) during which the mean firing frequency was ∼25 Hz. In the pharmacological voltage-clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the responses were recorded after at least 6 min from the beginning of the perfusion of the drug into the recording chamber to provide the time for the steady-state effect. Time-locking of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) was quantified as the decrease in the normalized V<sub>m</sub> variability between subsequent stimulation trials. Decrease in variability, as an index of spike-time locking, was considered statistically significant at the level of 3*SD (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo electrophysiological recordings and data analysis</title><p>Animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Harvard Apparatus, Halliston, MA). A scalp incision was made along the midline; the skull was cleaned by scraping and by application of hydrogen peroxide. Crus I and II were exposed with a craniotomy, but the dura was not removed to enhance mechanical stability. Commercial tetrodes embedded in a quartz tube (Thomas Recording, Giessen, Germany), gold-plated to reach a 100–200 kΩ impedance, were lowered into the CN. Signals were referenced against a tungsten electrode positioned in saline at the surface of the cerebellar cortex. The light was delivered immediately above the CN via an optical fiber (diameter 200-μm core) connected to CrystaLaser at 473 nm and inserted in a cannula placed above the injection sites in the CN (see ‘Stereotaxic injections’ paragraph for coordinates). 25- to 50-ms light pulses (45 mW) were delivered at 4 Hz in 3-s bouts separated by 7-s recovery periods; post hoc inspection showed no indication of decreased inhibition during the 3-s bouts, suggesting that these stimulation parameters did not induce cumulative ChR2 inactivation. Signals were acquired using a custom-made headstage and amplifier and a custom-written LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) allowing real-time monitoring of cellular activity. To isolate spikes, continuous wide-band extracellular recordings were filtered off-line with a Butterworth 1 kHz high-pass filter. Spikes were then extracted by thresholding the filtered trace and the main parameters of their waveform extracted (width and amplitude on the 4 channels). The data were hand-clustered by polygon-cutting in 2-dimensional projections of the parameter space using Xclust (Matt Wilson, MIT). The quality of clustering was evaluated by inspecting the auto-correlograms of the units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). Golgi cells and Purkinje cells were identified according to most recently published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Van Dijck et al., 2013</xref>). These criteria provide a simple approach to classify cerebellar units using only a few statistical parameters describing the firing frequency and irregularity of discharge: the mean spike frequency (MSF), the coefficient of variation of the log of the ISI (LCV), and entropy of the ISIs (ENT). We used the boundary values on these parameters defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Van Dijck et al. (2013)</xref> to identify Golgi cells (MSF&lt;20 Hz, 0.5&lt;ENT&lt;7.5 and 0.02&lt;LCV&lt;0.25). Golgi cells exhibited an average firing rate (FR) of 8.7 ± 4.2 Hz. To assess the presence of a response to optogenetic stimulations, peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) were constructed. Each PSTH was normalized by subtracting the average baseline spike count (before stimulation) and dividing by the baseline standard deviation yielding a Z-score. A modulation of FR in response to optogenetic stimulation was considered significant when the absolute Z-score of a 3-ms bin was higher than 2.5 in at least two time bins in the 50-ms time window following the stimulus. The total time during which the Z-score was significant defined the duration of the inhibition. The latencies (onset and peak) were calculated starting from the beginning of the light-pulse, the peak latency being the point where the Z-score was maximal and the onset latency being defined as the first time point with a significant Z-score.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Anatomical examination and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Animals were deeply anesthetized with intra-peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and perfused through the aorta with ice-cold solution of phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.4; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) followed by 50–75 ml of 4% wt/vol paraformaldehyde (PFA; VWR International, Radnor, PA) in PBS. The entire brain was then dissected and post-fixated (3 hr for immunohistochemistry, overnight for anatomical examination) in 4% PFA at 4°C before rinsing in PBS. For anatomical confocal imaging, 80-µm sections were cut with a Leica 1000 TS vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), placed on objective glass, mounted with Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and coverslipped with #1.5 glass. For immunohistochemistry experiments, the brains were cryoprotected by equilibration in 30% sucrose wt/vol PBS at 4°C and then cut at −20°C with a Leica CM3050S cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Free-floating 80-µm thick parasagittal sections were rinsed in PBS and permeabilized 2 hr at room temperature in 0.4% vol/vol Triton 100-X (Sigma) in PBS. Non-specific sites were saturated by incubation in 0.4% Triton 100-X—1.5% cold fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS at room temperature for 3 hr. Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C in a PBS solution containing 0.1% Triton 100-X—1.5% fish gelatin (mouse GAD65-67 antibody mAB 9A6 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) at 1/500 final dilution; chicken GFP antibody (Avès, Oregon, USA) at 1/1000 final dilution; guinea pig VIAAT antibody (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany) at 1/1500 final dilution; guinea pig GlyT2 antibody (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) at 1/1500 final dilution, rabbit Neurogranin antibody (Millipore) at 1/500 final dilution). After rinsing in 0.1% Triton 100-X in PBS, slices were incubated overnight at 4°C with secondary antibodies coupled to 488, 549, or 649 DyLight fluorophores (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or Alexa Fluor 555 IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 1/500 final dilution in PBS—0.1% Triton 100-X −1.5% cold fish skin gelatin. Slices were finally rinsed with PBS and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Sigma). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, immunostaining against GFP and VIAAT (same antibodies as above) was performed on paraffin-embedded sections as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Confocal stacks from immunolabeled cerebellar slices were acquired using an inverted confocal microscope (Leica, SP8) using a 63× oil-immersion objective (NA 1.3). Confocal stacks for anatomical visualizations were acquired with Leica SP5 microscope using 40× (NA 1.25) and 63× (NA 1.5) oil-immersion objectives, with 8- or 12-bit color depth, and with 0.1 μm z-step. The images were acquired for mCherry, EYFP, and GFP fluorescence with excitation lasers and emission filters set to: 561 DPSS laser, 587–655 nm; 488 argon laser, 520–580 nm; GFP, 500–550 nm. Wide-view images (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A1,B1</xref>) were composed by merging tiles of confocal stacks (with 10% overlap and 1 μm z-step). The grayscale background images in 2A1 and B1 were obtained from autofluorescence signals acquired at the same time as the specific fluorescence signals. Morphological features (NC cell body sizes, iNC axonal bouton sizes) were measured using the Fiji image analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The soma sizes are given as the major length axis; for axon bouton sizes, as the area of the cross section of each bouton in maximal projection image. To quantify neurogranin and GlyT2-eGFP staining intensities at Golgi cell bodies, z-stacks containing the somata were projected and averaged (z-projection thickness: 6.8 µm). Intensities for each channel were normalized according to the slope of the fit to the logarithmic distribution of their pixel intensity before being retrieved and the ratios were calculated. As the neuropil in cerebellar granule layer is densely labeled in the GlyT2-eGFP mice preventing backtracking individual distal dendrites to their somata in order to attribute them a ratio value, the iNC varicosities in the granular cell layer were included in the statistics only when contacting proximal dendrites and cell bodies. Using GNU R, K-means 2D clustering was performed on mean GlyT2-eGFP vs mean neurogranin data set to cluster the GoC subpopulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the Yarom laboratory, and especially Avi Libster and Vitaly Lerner, for helpful discussions and support with technical issues; and Dr Naomi Melamed-Book (ELSC Bio-Imaging unit) for assistance with confocal imaging.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study uses an extensive range of histochemical, electrophysiological and optogenetic techniques, both in vitro and in vivo, to describe the anatomical and functional properties of an inhibitory projection from the cerebellar nuclei to the cerebellar cortex. The main finding is that a specific subpopulation of GlyT2+/GAD+ neurons located in the cerebellar nuclei, innervate a distinct subpopulation of Golgi cells. The axons of the CN neurons co-release GABA and Glycine and can either pause or drive the firing of the Golgi cells. Both mixed GABAergic/Glycinergic and pure GABAergic Golgi cells are targeted by the feedback projection, while pure glycinergic Golgi cells are not.</p><p>The referees agreed that the study is of high quality, and that the results are important because they establish the presence of nucleo-cortico feedback, which is likely to have significant functional implications for certain regions of the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>However, there were some concerns about the experimental procedures used, which will require additional experiments and/or clarification. These include more details about the specificity of transfection protocols; the potentially weak effect on circuit function; missing details about the inputs to iNCs and their outputs to Golgi cells, paying attention to potential local circuit explanations for the observed effects on GC excitability; and missing details about the inputs to iNCs and their outputs to Golgi cells/ and potentially other inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Furthermore, throughout the manuscript the impact of the findings is overstated, and the level of scholarship should be improved, particularly with regard to citations. Below is an outline of the concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Is this really a disinhibition circuit? Although the authors provide a nice description of the synaptic contacts onto Golgi cells, it remains unclear whether excitatory cells are also contacted, either in the cerebellar cortex or elsewhere. The authors may or may not have some data already that could address this. In any case, this issue should be discussed.</p><p>2) A major assumption in the manuscript is that the identified iNCs receive Purkinje cell inhibitory input. This is critical to demonstrate, as an alternative interpretation to that presented in this manuscript is that iNC cells are essentially ectopic Golgi cells, receiving mossy fiber collateral input but no descending PC input.</p><p>3) This appears to be a sparse and weak pathway and it is not clear how significant the functional impact could be, for two reasons:</p><p>A) Although optogenetic stimulation is very powerful for stimulating all synapses of a specific input simultaneously, the responses still appear rather weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, it would be useful to know what the holding potential was in the voltage clamp experiments, and what the driving force for Cl- was. That would allow an estimate of the total evoked synaptic inhibitory conductance. These parameters do not seem to be provided in the manuscript. In addition, the measured inhibitory responses in Golgi cells are an overestimate of their functional impact because it is unlikely that all these inhibitory inputs are active simultaneously during behavior.</p><p>B) The in-vivo electrophysiology experiments show a strong inhibitory effect on Golgi cell firing. It is not clear however, whether this is due to a direct inhibition of Golgi cells, or an indirect effect by inhibition of excitatory input that contributes to driving the Golgi cells (see also point 1 above).</p><p>Additional experiments to address these comments are not essential but would be potentially welcome. In any case the authors should discuss the functional importance of this pathway in a balanced way, and in particular the caveats of the in vivo experiments.</p><p>4) How can the authors be sure that the inhibitory currents evoked by ChR2 arise solely from iNC and not from other inhibitory interneurons? It is possible that the injection pipette released some virus on its way down to the cerebellar nuclei and infected other cell types (e.g. Golgi cells or Lugaro cells), which could be the source of the inhibition. The specificity and extent of the ChR2 expression needs to be verified, to rule out this possibility. In particular, were Purkinje neurons ever labeled in the GAD-cre mice? If not, why not? If so, how was this dealt with? And given that pipettes used for viral injection must pass through the granule cell layer when targeting CN, were Golgi cells ever transfected in either GAD-cre or GlyT2-cre lines? It should be possible to tell whether Golgi cells or Lugaro cells are infected: their axonal arbors are morphologically distinct, and they are also distinct from the iNC projections. It should also be possible to record far away from the injection site. It is likely that the authors have done this but they should clarify their injection/recording strategy.</p><p>5) The section relating to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is problematic in places. The term “associated” used to link Neurogranin expression with GABAergic neurons is somewhat misleading. In the Simat paper, some mixed neurons do not express Neurogranin (type 2 and 3, respectively 3-5% and 10%), although they release GABA (GAD67+). Thus, a significant proportion of the neurons classified as pure glycinergic could be mixed. While it is possible that these neurons match 3% of “pure glycinergic” neurons contacted by iCN projections, based on the Simat estimates, the proportion should be higher than 3%. Moreover, the ratio of Neurogranin/eGFP-GlyT2 is rather an indirect way of assessing the identity of a cell given the level of fluorescence is influenced by many experimental parameters. Indeed, the cells expressing Neurogranin at 2x higher levels than the level of GlyT2-eGFP, which are classified as GlyT2 negative, could still secrete a substantial amount of Glycine. This makes the conclusion that “these results demonstrate that iNC fibres contact almost exclusively the purely GABAergic Golgi cells” uncertain. The wording should be altered to reflect these limitations.</p><p>6) The method used to measure synchrony is unusual and indirect. Please use a more conventional measure of synchrony.</p><p>7) Understanding the impact of this new feedback connection is limited without a basic characterization of its short-term plasticity. Does it depress or does it facilitate? The short-term plasticity would add significant functional insight. If the authors already have this data they should provide it.</p><p>8) As it is a key finding in the study, it is critical to provide quantification for the double labeling experiments in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Nucleo‐cortical projection neurons have a mixed GABA‐glycine phenotype” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>.</p><p>9) The differences in spontaneously firing and silent Golgi cells described in the subsection headed “iNC fibers inhibit a subpopulation of Golgi cells with different electrophysiological properties” seem out of place in this manuscript given that the iNC responsive Golgi cells amount to only 35% of the spontaneously firing population. Either this should be removed, or better justified.</p><p>10) The Abstract and beginning of the Introduction should be rewritten. The authors refer to an “orthodox view” that information flows predominantly from cortex to nucleus within the cerebellum. This statement is then immediately contradicted by numerous (although incomplete, see below) citations, many 30-40 years old (e.g., Tolbert, Hamori, Batini).</p><p>11) Given that the in vivo tetrode recording experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> showed no modulation of Purkinje cell activity, many of the prominent claims of the manuscript (e.g. “… the iNC pathway places the CN in a position to control the signal transmission between the MFs and PNs and thereby to modulate activity in the cerebellar cortex in response to sensory‐motor information” and “Our data strongly suggest that the CN contributes to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by disinhibiting the mossy fiber-parallel fiber pathway via the iNC projection”, etc.) seem overstated.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>A) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2</xref> and in the first paragraph of the Results, “arrow” and “arrowhead” seem to be switched. B2 is also not mentioned in the figure legend.</p><p>B) Distributions were compared using an F-test. However, this test is sensitive to non-normality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the red distribution is possibly not normal). A non-parametric test such as the Kolmogorov Smirnov test would be more appropriate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>.</p><p>C) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>1 indicates a significant difference between the two distributions, but the text (legend and main text) states that “The swelling labelled in the two mouse lines were identical in size”. Could the very small difference between the two distributions (around 200nm) be simply due to the different wavelengths used to image mCherry or YFP signals? Bin sizes (and bin centres) also look different between the two distributions.</p><p>D) In the Results, it is stated that the immunostaining revealed unequivocally that inhibitory NC projections have a dual neurotransmitter phenotype. However, given there is only one example of each, and no quantification, this statement seems too strong.</p><p>E) The firing phenotype observed here (silent GoC versus firing GoC) could be discussed in relation to the Hull et al. paper, 2013. In this paper, hyperpolarization of GoC resulted in a long term increase in the firing rate. Could the hyperpolarizing connection from iCN have induced a long lasting, more depolarized state observed here as the firing phenotype (while cells receiving no inhibitory inputs do not present this phenotype)?</p><p>F) In the subsection headed “iNC fibers inhibit a subpopulation of Golgi cells with different electrophysiological properties”, the authors state: “ns-Golgi cells showed significantly larger variability in the values than the s-Golgi cells”. Which values?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06262.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Is this really a disinhibition circuit?

The authors may or may not have some data already that could address this. In any case, this issue should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the significance of the main finding of our work—that the iNC axons target the GABAergic Golgi cells in a profuse and strong manner—may have led to the lack of discussion regarding other possible targets of the iNC axons. We have now included in the manuscript our considerations regarding this issue as follows:</p><p>First, no labeled axons were ever seen projecting outside the cerebellum in GlyT2-cre mouse injected in the cerebellar nuclei, ruling out extracerebellar targets of the iNC axons. Second, the granule cells (GrCs) do not seem to be targeted by the iNC projections, as we do not find evidence of iNC fibers entering the glomeruli. Furthermore, the density of fibers and varicosities is much lower than would be expected for a pathway targeting granule cells (compared with Golgi axon density in GrCL), and thus, if iNC-GrC contacts existed, they would be found on a minority of the GrCs. These possibilities are now mentioned in the Discussion (in the subsection headed “Bursting activity in iNC neurons and their inhibitory effect on Golgi cell activity in vivo”).</p><p>It should be mentioned that while the vast majority of iNC axonal varicosities were found in apposition to neurogranin-positive Golgi cells, very rarely some of them appeared to face unlabeled cellular targets. Unfortunately, we cannot make strong claims regarding the identity of the possible postsynaptic targets of these “orphan” terminals, as we cannot exclude the existence of Golgi cells negative for both GlyT2-eGFP and neurogranin (or expressing them at levels that were too weak to be detected; see also our answer #5).</p><p>Finally, we have previously shown that the local axons of iNC cells contact the glutamatergic projection neurons of the CN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al 2014</xref>); we will discuss the possible significance of this pathway to the Golgi cell inhibition with our response to 3B.</p><p><italic>2) A major assumption in the manuscript is that the identified iNCs receive Purkinje cell inhibitory input. This is critical to demonstrate, as an alternative interpretation to that presented in this manuscript is that iNC cells are essentially ectopic Golgi cells, receiving mossy fiber collateral input but no descending PC input</italic>.</p><p>First, we do not see PN inhibition onto iNC cells as a major assumption in the paper, and we were not dealing with this question at all in the text. PNs have been proposed to innervate all CN cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Teune et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Chan-Palay, 1973</xref>) including glycine-containing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Zeeuw and Berrebi, 1995</xref>). We now provide direct optogenetic evidence for a functional inhibitory connection from PN onto iNC neurons in a supplementary figure (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> and Results).</p><p>As for the possibility that iNC neurons were “ectopic Golgi cells”, the described iNC cells constitute about one third of the CN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, iNC neurons do not appear to share any physiological or morphological characteristics with Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uusisaari and Knöpfel, 2010</xref>), except maybe their dual neurotransmitter content. Demonstration of a contact by PN axons confirms the distinction, as Golgi cells do not receive Purkinje cell inputs in the cortex.</p><p><italic>3) This appears to be a sparse and weak pathway and it is not clear how significant the functional impact could be, for two reasons</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) Although optogenetic stimulation is very powerful for stimulating all synapses of a specific input simultaneously, the responses still appear rather weak (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>). Therefore, it would be useful to know what the holding potential was in the voltage clamp experiments, and what the driving force for Cl- was. That would allow an estimate of the total evoked synaptic inhibitory conductance. These parameters do not seem to be provided in the manuscript. In addition, the measured inhibitory responses in Golgi cells are an overestimate of their functional impact because it is unlikely that all these inhibitory inputs are active simultaneously during behavior</italic>.</p><p>First, we apologize for the lack of description of the experimental conditions for the recordings of iNC IPSCs in Golgi cells. Recordings were performed in physiological chloride conditions and at a holding potential of -50 mV, as now mentioned in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Second, even though the IPSPs seen in response to stimulation are not very large in amplitude, they seem to be strong enough. The most likely reason is large conductance activated by iNCs, resulting in shunting inhibition (rather than inhibition by hyperpolarization). While we have not experimented on the synaptic properties in detail, employing GHK-based calculations of peak slope conductance, including Cl/HCO<sub>3</sub> permeability ratios give 1.9 ± 1.3 nS (corresponding to 8.5 ± 5.9 nS in symmetrical chloride conditions; Houston CM et al., J.Neurosci. 2009). This is 6 times the value for Golgi-Golgi connections (0.33 nS; Hull &amp; Regehr, 2012) and amounts to the simultaneous activation of about 300 GABA<sub>A</sub>R-associated channels. The effectiveness of the iNC inhibition on blocking Golgi cell spiking is enhanced by the long time course of the inhibitory conductance. These calculations are now added to the manuscript (in the subsection headed “Nucleo-cortical fibers inhibit Golgi cell activity“).</p><p>Third, the reviewers suggest that we might stimulate a large number of iNC axons synchronously, hence overestimating the weight of unitary connections. This is not likely for the following two reasons. First, in the voltage-clamp experiments, stimulation was targeted at a single identified fiber by illuminating a very small area (order of 2 µm<sup>2</sup>), making it unlikely that great many individual axons were activated.</p><p>Furthermore, as is evident in the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>, each Golgi cell seems to be innervated only by one or at most two individual axons in our material, each of the axons making numerous boutons while climbing along the Golgi dendrites. Thus, even wide-field illumination should not activate more than a few axons, excluding gross exaggeration of the iNC effect in slices.</p><p><italic>B) The in-vivo electrophysiology experiments show a strong inhibitory effect on Golgi cell firing. It is not clear however, whether this is due to a direct inhibition of Golgi cells, or an indirect effect by inhibition of excitatory input that contributes to driving the Golgi cells (see also point 1 above).</italic></p><p><italic>Additional experiments to address these comments are not essential but would be potentially welcome. In any case the authors should discuss the functional importance of this pathway in a balanced way, and in particular the caveats of the in vivo experiments</italic>.</p><p>These issues were also discussed in relation to question 1. First, the inhibitory effect observed during in-vivo experiments was not qualitatively different from what was seen in acute slices, suggesting that additional, long-range circuit mechanisms are not necessary to presume in order to explain the results.</p><p>Second, as was mentioned earlier, the iNC cells do not project outside the cerebellum, and strong connections between iNC axons and granule cells are highly unlikely. Thus, iNC activation should not have any effect on Golgi cell spiking, neither via extracerebellar mossy fibers nor via the parallel fibers.</p><p>Third, iNC neurons have been shown to project onto CN glutamatergic principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Husson et al., 2014</xref>), and indeed, during the time we were working on the revision, Houck and Person published anatomical work describing that at least some of the glutamatergic projection neurons of the CN collateralize into the cerebellar cortex, where they form rosette-like terminals that contact both Golgi and granule cells. Thus it could be conceivable that inhibition of spiking in these excitatory CN neurons would result in decrease in Golgi cell spiking. However, the glutamatergic projection neurons are extremely strong pacemakers and resistant to even the massive, tonic PN inhibition (Person &amp; Raman, Nature 2012; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The iNC inhibition of these cells is however expected to be significantly weaker than the PN-originating inhibition. Thus, while in principle possible, it seems unlikely that the short burst of iNC IPSPs on glutamatergic CN neurons would reduce the excitatory drive to Golgi cell to result in the observed pauses in Golgi cell spiking in vivo. Notably, this possibility would mean that the Golgi cell activity would have to be to a large extent determined by CN activity.</p><p>Furthermore, in 8/18 (44%) of the Golgi cells inhibited in the in vivo experiments, the pause in spiking was followed by a rebound increase in spiking probability in the 100ms following the end of the light pulse (starting 47.6 ± 15.3 ms after the end of the light pulse lasting 9.8 ± 6.6 ms; considered significant at z=2.5 level). Such an increase is likely to result from delayed Golgi cell firing following the direct afferent inhibition, and is not expected to occur if the Golgi cell pause was produced by a decrease in incoming excitation. Overall, while it is impossible to exclude presently uncharacterized circuit mechanisms influencing Golgi cell spiking in the in vivo experiments, our observations are most easily explained (and experimentally supported) by a direct iNC input rather than an indirect effect on Golgi cells excitatory drive. As mentioned earlier, we have now added discussion of these possibilities in the subsection headed “Physiological significance of the iNC pathway” of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) How can the authors be sure that the inhibitory currents evoked by ChR2 arise solely from iNC and not from other inhibitory interneurons? It is possible that the injection pipette released some virus on its way down to the cerebellar nuclei and infected other cell types (e.g. Golgi cells or Lugaro cells), which could be the source of the inhibition. The specificity and extent of the ChR2 expression needs to be verified, to rule out this possibility. In particular, were Purkinje neurons ever labeled in the GAD-cre mice? If not, why not? If so, how was this dealt with? And given that pipettes used for viral injection must pass through the granule cell layer when targeting CN, were Golgi cells ever transfected in either GAD-cre or GlyT2-cre lines? It should be possible to tell whether Golgi cells or Lugaro cells are infected: their axonal arbors are morphologically distinct, and they are also distinct from the iNC projections. It should also be possible to record far away from the injection site. It is likely that the authors have done this but they should clarify their injection/recording strategy</italic>.</p><p>This is indeed a critical issue, and we have spent a lot of effort since the early stages of the work to ascertain that unspecific stimulations did not occur. Most importantly, throughout the work, we have taken special care to avoid inadvertent transfection of other inhibitory cerebellar neurons. We injected only very small amounts of viral suspension to restrict the transfected volume and the injection pipettes were removed slowly 10-15 minutes after the injection was finished to avoid backflow along the pipette tract. Furthermore, we aimed for a ventral locus of injection in the CN to increase the distance to the cortex. During acute experiments, the slices were carefully and systematically examined before being used for electrophysiological experiments; if unintended labeling was present, the slices were discarded. Also, the recordings were never performed in the parts of the cerebellar cortex adjacent to the CN.</p><p>In vivo recordings were performed in the hemispheric dorsal Crus lobules, while injections were being performed in the interposed nucleus through the vermis/paravermis. The optic fiber was placed just above the injection site, in the cerebellar nuclei. This configuration would prevent any unspecific optogenetic stimulation.</p><p>Importantly, as was noted by the reviewers, the morphology of Lugaro and Golgi axons is very different from what we have now described for the iNC axons. While not within the scope of the present study, to illustrate the difference, we measured the axonal bouton areas of Golgi and Lugaro cells (from material outside this study where the virus was directly injected into the cortex; n = 100 boutons for both Lugaro and Golgi axons). As evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>, the iNC terminals can clearly be differentiated from both Lugaro and Golgi terminals. Thus, before the patch-clamp experiments, the morphology and location of labeled fibers was carefully examined in order to exclude the possibility of activating parasagittal long-range Lugaro axons or nearby Golgi axons.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06262.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the axonal swelling size between Lugaro, Golgi and iNC axons reveals that the iNC boutons are significantly larger, allowing reliable differentiation between the different axons even in acute slices.

However, in line with the fact that retrograde transfection is much less effective than transfection through somatic membranes, we nearly never saw such retrogradely labeled PNs with our limited-range injections (and only after very long transfection times). In any case, such inadvertent transfections do not pose a problem as PNs do not contact Golgi cells. As for the significance of the possibility of accidentally activating PN axons that would inhibit the glutamatergic CN projection neurons possibly sending collaterals to the cortex and driving Golgi cells, we ask the reviewers to refer to our answers to questions 1 and 3B. Finally, transfection of PN was never observed in the GlyT2-cre background, which was used for in-vivo experiments.</p><p>By combining all these precautions, we are confident about the reliability of the data we present, as it is highly consistent and uniform among the experiments and between the two laboratories, despite some differences in our experimental procedures.</p><p>The meticulous examination of putative contaminations and precautions we have undertaken are now stressed more in details in the revised manuscript (Methods section).</p><p><italic>5) The section relating to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>is problematic in places. The term “associated” used to link Neurogranin expression with GABAergic neurons is somewhat misleading. In the Simat paper, some mixed neurons do not express Neurogranin (type 2 and 3, respectively 3-5% and 10%), although they release GABA (GAD67+). Thus, a significant proportion of the neurons classified as pure glycinergic could be mixed. While it is possible that these neurons match 3% of “pure glycinergic” neurons contacted by iCN projections, based on the Simat estimates, the proportion should be higher than 3%. Moreover, the ratio of Neurogranin/eGFP-GlyT2 is rather an indirect way of assessing the identity of a cell given the level of fluorescence is influenced by many experimental parameters. Indeed, the cells expressing Neurogranin at 2x higher levels than the level of GlyT2-eGFP, which are classified as GlyT2 negative, could still secrete a substantial amount of Glycine. This makes the conclusion that “these results demonstrate that iNC fibres contact almost exclusively the purely GABAergic Golgi cells” uncertain. The wording should be altered to reflect these limitations</italic>.</p><p>First of all, we do not claim that 3% of the iNCs form synapses on “pure glycinergic” neurons, but that 3% of the iNC were seen to contact neurons which expressed some level of GFP in the GlyT2-GFP mice, and therefore probably are not “pure GABAergic” Golgi cells. Regarding Golgi cell subtypes as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Simat et al. (2007)</xref>, it should be noted that all neurogranin-positive Golgi cells express GAD67 (while the opposite is not true). Thus, the statement that neurogranin is “associated” with GAD expression is in our opinion fully justified. The neurogranin-positive cells that carry 97% of detected iNC contacts can therefore belong to either the purely GABAergic neurons (Simat’s type 4, 15% of all cells) or the mixed GABA-glycinergic Golgi cells (Type 1, 65%). The remaining 3% of iNC axons could contact either Simat’s types 2, 3 or 5. Notably, we cannot distinguish between these “Simat” classes in our method.</p><p>In any case, we thank the reviewers for their comments, which prompted us to clarify the analysis of our data and to improve their presentation. Thus, we now classify the GoCs based on the GlyT2-GFP only, and not the ratio. Unlike the classification of Golgi cells done by Simat, we are not differentiating Golgi cells to strict classes. Instead we are showing preferential targeting of cells residing on the extreme end of a continuum. The Golgi cell population can be divided into at least two groups as attested by the bimodal distribution of GFP expression. The larger cluster (labeled green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F, G, I</xref>) of cells displays strong GFP expression while the second cluster (blue) displays low to background levels of GFP expression. All the cells which are strongly contacted by iNC axons (i.e., have more than 1-4 contacts) fall in the second cluster of low-GFP neurons. Importantly, the most strongly contacted cells in this group (labeled with darker reds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) have relatively high neurogranin expression. This group most likely corresponds to Simat’s type 4 and can reasonably be called “GABAergic Golgi cells”, although some of them do seem to be stained for GFP. As expected, many cells of the blue cluster were not found to receive iNC contacts in our experiments, since we transfected only a small fraction of all iNC neurons in the CN.</p><p>We also found a few iNC contacts on a small number of Golgi cells belonging to the first cluster, displaying high GlyT2-eGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, yellow markers at the top left corner, 8 out of 40 iNC-contacted Golgi cells). However, iNC fibers never formed an extensive articulation with these cells, that also always displayed only weak neurogranin expression.</p><p>To clarify the conclusions we have reached based on our data, we have added a schematic drawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) to the paper.</p><p><italic>6) The method used to measure synchrony is unusual and indirect. Please use a more conventional measure of synchrony</italic>.</p><p>The word “synchrony” is rather confusing in this context, since the results are not showing synchronicity of several cells, but a time-lock of the spikes in one cell. The index analysis we utilized is not that novel as it has been used in previous literature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). However, these results were found post-hoc in 7 Golgi cells, after we had completed the data acquisition, and thus the experiments were not designed to address this issue. Therefore, we unfortunately have too few repetitions to conduct a detailed phase-response analysis. As it is not critical for the paper, we decided to remove this panel from the figure and only mention it as a supplementary figure (please see the subsection headed “Nucleo-cortical fibers inhibit Golgi cell activity” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Understanding the impact of this new feedback connection is limited without a basic characterization of its short-term plasticity. Does it depress or does it facilitate? The short-term plasticity would add significant functional insight. If the authors already have this data they should provide it</italic>.</p><p>While we do agree that this information would be of interest, we have unfortunately not performed the experiment.</p><p><italic>8) As it is a key finding in the study, it is critical to provide quantification for the double labeling experiments in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Nucleo‐cortical projection neurons have a mixed GABA‐glycine phenotype” and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D, E</italic></xref>.</p><p>Quantification of the double labeling experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were performed and results are now included in the text.</p><p><italic>9) The differences in spontaneously firing and silent Golgi cells described in the subsection headed “iNC fibers inhibit a subpopulation of Golgi cells with different electrophysiological properties” seem out of place in this manuscript given that the iNC responsive Golgi cells amount to only 35% of the spontaneously firing population. Either this should be removed, or better justified</italic>.</p><p>Most importantly for the justification of the division into two Golgi groups, the iNC-originating inhibition was never seen in the ns-Golgi cells that clearly differ in their electrophysiological signature from the s-Golgi cells. Combining this observation of connectivity difference with electrophysiological differences is strengthening the notion that the Golgi cells are composed of several distinct cell groups. While not the main focus of this study, because of the common view in current literature is of Golgi cells as a homogenous group of cells, we believe that it is highly relevant to stress the differences found in the present work.</p><p>The relatively small percentage of patched s-Golgi cells where we could demonstrate an inhibitory effect of the iNCs is mostly due to experimental limitations, as a small fraction of all iNC cells in a given animal are transfected in our conditions. Indeed, the injections were as restricted as possible to prevent transfection of cortical interneurons (see above). Such partial transfection will result in a large number of false negative s-Golgi cells. We believe that in ideal conditions, in which all iNC cells would be transfected, 100% of the s-Golgi cells would be contacted.</p><p><italic>10) The Abstract and beginning of the Introduction should be rewritten. The authors refer to an “orthodox view” that information flows predominantly from cortex to nucleus within the cerebellum. This statement is then immediately contradicted by numerous (although incomplete, see below) citations, many 30-40 years old (e.g., Tolbert, Hamori, Batini)</italic>.</p><p>The Abstract and Introduction were rewritten in a more logical and appropriate manner. We apologize for having submitted an inconsistent text.</p><p><italic>11) Given that the in vivo tetrode recording experiments of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>showed no modulation of Purkinje cell activity, many of the prominent claims of the manuscript (e.g. “… the iNC pathway places the CN in a position to control the signal transmission between the MFs and PNs and thereby to modulate activity in the cerebellar cortex in response to sensory‐motor information” and “Our data strongly suggest that the CN contributes to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by disinhibiting the mossy fiber–parallel fiber pathway via the iNC projection”, etc.) seem overstated</italic>.</p><p>As the in vivo experiments were performed under anesthesia, we expected no modulation of the Purkinje cells firing, as granule cells are not active under such conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Holtzman et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilms &amp; Häusser 2015</xref>). However, we agree with the reviewers that we perhaps overstated the impact of iNC activity on mossy fiber integration in the granule cell layer, as we do not provide direct evidence on this issue. We have revised the relevant parts of the Discussion.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>A) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B2</italic></xref> <italic>and in the first paragraph of the Results, “arrow” and “arrowhead” seem to be switched. B2 is also not mentioned in the figure legend</italic>.</p><p>Appropriate modifications were made in the text and in the figure.</p><p><italic>B) Distributions were compared using an F-test. However, this test is sensitive to non-normality (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>, the red distribution is possibly not normal). A non-parametric test such as the Kolmogorov Smirnov test would be more appropriate in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2"><italic>Figures 1 and 2</italic></xref>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the correction. We conducted the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the current results are: GAD vs. NO: p = 0.0082; GAD vs. Gly: p &lt; 0.0001; NO vs Gly: p &lt; 0.0001 (in the subsection headed “Nucleo-cortical projection neurons have a mixed GABA-glycine phenotype”).</p><p><italic>C)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C1</italic></xref> <italic>indicates a significant difference between the two distributions, but the text (legend and main text) states that “The swelling labelled in the two mouse lines were identical in size”. Could the very small difference between the two distributions (around 200nm) be simply due to the different wavelengths used to image mCherry or YFP signals? Bin sizes (and bin centres) also look different between the two distributions</italic>.</p><p>Due to the large number of measurements used for the statistical analysis, we observed a statistical difference even though the difference between the two distributions is very small. As noticed by the reviewer, this small difference could be indeed explained by the two different fluorophores used for imaging with different wavelengths.</p><p>After reconsidering the issues, we have decided to replace the histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> by cumulative probability plots, which in our view give more accurate and clear view on the distributions. The midpoints of GAD and GlyT2 populations are at 1.95 and 1.77 µm<sup>2</sup>, and for GrCL and ML populations, 1.77 and 2.0 µm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to approximately 250 nm<sup>2</sup> or 50 nm diameter difference in measurements. The attached Q-Q plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>) comparing the distributions between GAD and GlyT2, and GrCL and ML boutons, show very little deviation from unity line (slopes 0.86 and 0.97) and should be sufficient as a demonstration that this tiny difference is unlikely of having profound significance.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06262.017</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the quantiles of cu- mulative distributions of iNC axon swellings obtained with GAD-cre vs. GlyT-cre models (top) and from granule cell layer vs. molecular layer (bottom; GAD-cre and GlyT2-cre models pooled).

However, given there is only one example of each, and no quantification, this statement seems too strong</italic>.</p><p>Percentages of co-labelled varicosities in both GAD-cre and GlyT2-cre were calculated and added in the text (in the subsection headed “Nucleo-cortical projection neurons have a mixed GABA-glycine phenotype”).

In this paper, hyperpolarization of GoC resulted in a long term increase in the firing rate.

(2013)</xref> revolves around tonic hyperpolarization. A long-lasting (at least 20 s) inhibitory activity is needed in order to affect baseline firing frequency. However, the iNC -mediated inhibition we describe here is most definitively of a phasic kind, due to the bursting nature of the iNC cells, and thus unlikely to be related.</p><p>The simplest explanation for the difference in spontaneous spiking between s-Golgi cells and ns-Golgi cells is that they are different in their intrinsic electrical properties, a fact also corroborated by our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, in the Hull et al. work (2013), it was explicitly stated that the shift in excitability is not associated with AP waveform changes whereas in our work, one of the clear difference between the s-Golgi cells and ns-Golgi cells is the AP half-width.</p><p><italic>F) In the subsection headed “iNC fibers inhibit a subpopulation of Golgi cells with different electrophysiological properties”, the authors state: “ns-Golgi cells showed significantly larger variability in the values than the s-Golgi cells”</italic>. <italic>Which values?</italic></p><p>This section has been significantly revised.</p></body></sub-article></article>
