Using a tone-signaled, platform-mediated avoidance task, we observed that pharmacological inactivation of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) delayed avoidance. Surprisingly, optogenetic silencing of PL glutamatergic neurons did not delay avoidance. Consistent with this, inhibitory but not excitatory responses of rostral PL neurons were associated with avoidance training. To test the importance of these inhibitory responses, we optogenetically stimulated PL neurons to counteract the tone-elicited reduction in firing rate. Photoactivation of rostral (but not caudal) PL neurons at 4 Hz impaired avoidance. These findings suggest that inhibitory responses of rostral PL neurons signal the avoidability of a potential threat and underscore the importance of designing behavioral optogenetic studies based on neuronal firing responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>channelrhodopsin</kwd><kwd>archaerhodopsin</kwd><kwd>single unit recordings</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-MH105185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diehl</surname><given-names>Maria M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Puerto Rico President's Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quirk</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R36-MH102968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bravo-Rivera</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R36-MH105039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Romaguera</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-MH058883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quirk</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-MH106435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quirk</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Avoiding danger requires inhibitory signaling in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex, as evidenced by optogenetic manipulations based on neuronal firing patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Core symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders include excessive fear and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). The neural mechanisms of excessive fear have been well-characterized in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giustino and Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Do Monte et al., 2016</xref>), yet the mechanisms of active avoidance are just beginning to emerge. Previous work in rats has shown that the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and striatum are all necessary for the expression of active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). Using a tone-signaled, platform-mediated avoidance task, we observed that pharmacological inactivation of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) impaired the expression of avoidance without affecting freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, avoidance that persisted following extinction was correlated with excessive PL activity, as indicated by the immediate early gene cFos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that PL activity may drive the expression of active avoidance.</p><p>Important questions remain, however, regarding the role of PL in avoidance. First, how do PL neurons signal avoidance? Fear conditioning mainly induces excitatory responses to conditioned tones in PL that correlate with freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Isogawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pendyam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2010</xref>), but the firing properties of PL neurons in active avoidance have not been studied. In platform-mediated avoidance, PL signaling of avoidance may differ from PL signaling of freezing or foraging for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgos-Robles et al., 2013</xref>), both of which can interfere with platform avoidance. Second, does avoidance involve all of PL or only specific subregions?</p><p>We addressed these questions by recording PL neurons during tone-signaled, platform-mediated avoidance. We then optogenetically silenced or activated PL neurons based on the observed firing patterns. We found that inhibitory (rather than excitatory) tone responses of rostral PL neurons were associated with avoidance. Opposing these inhibitory responses with photoactivation delayed or prevented active avoidance, suggesting that prefrontal inhibition signals the âavoidabilityâ of danger.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pharmacological inactivation of PL delays avoidance</title><p>We first replicated our prior findings that pharmacological inactivation of PL with the GABA-A agonist muscimol (MUS) impaired avoidance in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2014</xref>), with two modifications: (1) we used fluorescently labeled MUS to assess spread to adjacent regions, and (2) we analyzed the time course of avoidance behavior across the 30 s tone. Because the 2 s shock co-terminates with the tone, the rat has 28 s to stop pressing the lever for food and step onto the platform to escape the shock. Furthermore, in this task, avoidance comes at a cost, as it competes with access to food. Thus, the involvement of PL could vary with changes in the cost and/or urgency of avoidance as the tone progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeeb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hosking et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Histological analysis showed that MUS was confined to PL in its mid rostral-caudal extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rats with substantial spread to adjacent infralimbic cortex were excluded (nÂ =Â 3). In some cases, MUS reached the ventral half of cingulate cortex (Cg1), and these cases were included due to similar functions of Cg1 and PL in conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>) and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orona and Gabriel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freeman et al., 1996</xref>).

OnÂ Test 1 (Day 11), we infused MUS into PL at the same concentration as our prior studies using fluorescent MUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Do-Monte et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2016</xref>) and waited 45 min before commencing a 2-tone test of avoidance expression (without shock). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that MUS inactivation significantly reduced the time spent on the platform during the tone, as compared to saline (SAL) infused controls (SAL 92% vs. MUS 57%, t<sub>(28)</sub> = â4.019, p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni corrected). An analysis of avoidance across the tone in 3 s bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) indicated that MUS-infused rats were significantly delayed in their initiation of avoidance (repeated measures ANOVA, F<sub>(1,9)</sub> = 4.076, p&lt;0.001; post hoc, 0â15 s **p&lt;0.01, 15â21 s *p&lt;0.05), and 2/13 rats never avoided (Mann Whitney U Test, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). MUS also increased tone-induced freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> top inset; SALÂ =Â 36% vs. MUSÂ =Â 55% freezing, t<sub>(28)</sub> = 2.460, p=0.020) but had no effect on suppression of bar pressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> bottom inset; SALÂ =Â 0.922 vs. MUSÂ =Â 0.984 suppression ratio, t<sub>(28)</sub> = 0.194, p=0.848).

Photosilencing also had no effect on the time course of avoidance in rPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> left) or cPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> left).

The lack of impairment of avoidance may suggest that we failed to sufficiently inhibit PL activity via ArchT photosilencing.

Inhibition latency was defined as the start of the first inter-spike interval (ISI) that was significantly longer than the average pre-tone ISI (ZÂ &gt;Â 1.65; p&lt;0.05). 133/205 neurons showed at least one ISI that satisfied this criterion. The latency of inhibition showed no correlation with the latency of platform entry (rÂ =Â 0.022, Pearson correlation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). For each cell, we averaged its inhibitory latency across all the trials in which successful avoidance was observed (out of nine trials in each session, nÂ =Â 284 trials), as well as the avoidance latency on those trials. The inhibitory response in most cells preceded platform entry (88/133 cells) but was not correlated with the latency of platform entry (rÂ =Â 0.078, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). In fact, similar inhibition was observed in trials where the rat chose not to avoid (nÂ =Â 107 trials, dashed orange line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). The latency of headturn, which was the first movement the rat made before proceeding to the platform, also did not correlate with the latency of inhibitory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Rather than signaling avoidance behavior, therefore, inhibitory responses in PL appear to signal that shock can be avoided (an avoidance option), regardless of whether the rat chose to avoid on that trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Opposing inhibition within rostral PL delays or prevents avoidance</title><p>Further analysis revealed that all neurons showing inhibition to the tone were located in rPL (blue, nÂ =Â 22), with none in cPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3IâJ</xref>).

Photoactivation at 2 Hz had no effect on avoidance expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, shifting the 4 Hz photoactivation to the inter-tone interval did not impair avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, the photoactivation-induced impairment of avoidance showed specificity with respect to location, time, and frequency. Finally, reducing the duration of 4 Hz photoactivation to the first 15 s of the tone delayed, but did not prevent, avoidance as indicated by time on platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> left; Mann Whitney U test, pâsÂ &lt;0.05 at 9â15 s) and avoidance latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> right, t<sub>(17)</sub> = 3.363, p=0.004). 4 Hz photoactivation of rPL had no effect on locomotion, as indicated by distance traveled in an open field (eYFP-control nÂ =Â 11, 2.71 m vs. ChR2-eYFP, nÂ =Â 15, 2.25 m, t<sub>(24)</sub> = 0.941, p=0.356, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Whereas pharmacological inactivation of PL delayed avoidance, optogenetic silencing of rostral PL accelerated avoidance. Single-unit recordings revealed that avoidance training was associated with inhibitory, rather than excitatory, tone responses in rostral PL neurons. Consistent with this, opposing tone-induced inhibition by optogenetically activating rPL neurons delayed or prevented avoidance. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that inhibition within PL is key for conditioned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ehrlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sparta et al., 2014</xref>) and highlight the importance of using in vivo recordings to guide optogenetic behavioral manipulations.</p><p>Previous work has shown that lesions or inactivation of PL reduces freezing in Pavlovian fear conditioning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vidal-Gonzalez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>). In our platform-mediated avoidance task, however, there was no reduction in freezing following pharmacological or optogenetic inhibition of PL (present study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, PL activity is no longer necessary for freezing following avoidance training. It is therefore unlikely that inhibitory responses in PL promote avoidance by decreasing freezing. In fact, freezing levels increased following MUS inactivation, consistent with loss of avoidance as a possible response to the tone. It is well-established that early stages of avoidance training depend on Pavlovian conditioning (acquisition of tone-shock association), whereas later stages of training shift to instrumental learning (platform entry; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mowrer and Lamoreaux, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kamin et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement with this shift, we did, in fact, observe a decrease in freezing following optogenetic silencing of PL early in avoidance training.</p><p>We observed both excitatory and inhibitory signaling in PL during avoidance. Excitatory responses to platform entry are consistent with prior cFos studies showing that active avoidance is correlated with increased PL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibitory responses to the tone were observed following avoidance training, but not fear conditioning, suggesting that inhibition is specific to avoidance. However, inhibitory tone responses were not correlated with platform entry and persisted in trials in which the rat did not avoid. Instead of signaling avoidance behavior, we suggest that rPL inhibition is a training-induced property of the tone, indicating that shock is avoidable and that the rat has the option to avoid. âAvoidabilityâ in this task resembles âcontrollabilityâ when rats learn that they can terminate a shock by running in a wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier and Seligman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maier, 2015</xref>). In that task, ratsâ control of shock reduced the activation of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe, a phenomenon blocked by PL inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amat et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, inhibition in PL may reduce its effects on target structures such as the raphe, thereby signaling avoidability/controllability in a variety of contexts.</p><p>We impaired avoidance by photostimulating at 4 Hz, which clamped PL glutamatergic neurons to their basal firing rate and prevented tone-induced inhibition. This rate of stimulation is much lower than the 20Â Hz used in most behavioral studies employing channelrhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Villaruel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warlow et al., 2017</xref>). This impairment in avoidance with 4 Hz stimulation was surprising given that photoactivation of the adjacent infralimbic cortex required stimulation ratesÂ â¥Â 10 Hz to reduce conditioned freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Do-Monte et al., 2015a</xref>). As 4 Hz approximates the average firing rate of mPFC putative projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>), the impairment in avoidance was likely due to abolishment of inhibitoryÂ responses. Excitatory responses coupled with the loss of inhibitory responses to the tone would cause PL responses in avoidance-trained rats to resemble those in fear conditioned rats, indicating that the shock is not avoidable. An important caveat, however, is that CaMKIIÎ±-expressing neurons were activated by ChR2 indiscriminately and were not limited to neurons showing inhibitory responses to the tone. Thus, in addition to reducing inhibitory responses in one population of cells, we likely induced some degree of excitation in a separate population of cells. Both mechanisms would have the effect of increasing tone-induced activity at rPL targets, but ChR2 photoactivation would be expected to have a greater effect (as we observed). Whereas MUS inactivation would non-specifically inhibit all neuronal types, it may resemble our 4 Hz photoactivation by preventing any further inhibition at tone onset.</p><p>Neurons in PL project to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral striatum (VS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sesack et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vertes, 2004</xref>), both necessary for active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darvas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramirez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hormigo et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of excitatory inputs from rPL to VS may be permissive for avoidance behavior, which would resemble inhibition of VS during food seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rada et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saulskaya and Mikhailova, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Do-Monte et al., 2017</xref>). rPL activity may also modulate avoidance via projections to BLA, thereby activating BLA projections to VS, which have been shown to drive shuttle avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramirez et al., 2015</xref>). One possibility is that inputs to VS from PL and BLA drive different aspects of avoidance: rPL for avoidance early in the tone when it is less urgent, and BLA for avoidance later in the tone when it is more urgent. In support of this, PL inhibition often delayed but did not block avoidance, revealing the effect of other inputs to VS later in the tone.</p><p>Excessive avoidance is clinically relevant for PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Rodent PL is considered toÂ beÂ homologous to the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heilbronner et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, active avoidance is correlated with functional coupling of the rostral dACC with the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins et al., 2014</xref>), and the ability to control aversive stimuli is associated with decreased activity in the rostral dACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with the rPL inhibition we observed. Furthermore, excessive avoidance in PTSD patients is correlated with increased activity in rostral dACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marin et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, reduced inhibition in rostral dACC and its striatal targets may bias individuals toward avoidance, despite behavioral costs and a low probability of danger.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 155 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) aged 3â5 months and weighing 320â420 g were housed and handled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2014</xref>).

An injector extending 2 mm beyond the tip of each cannula was used to infuse 0.5 Î¼l of virus at a rate of 0.05 Î¼l/min.

The injector was then removed and an optical fiber (0.22 NA, 200 nm core, constructed with products from Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) with 1 mm of projection beyond the tip of each cannula was inserted for PL illumination. The guide cannula and the optical fiber were cemented to the skull (C and B metabond, Parkell, Brentwood, NY; Ortho Acrylic, BayamÃ³n, PR).

Briefly, rats were conditioned with a pure tone (30 s, 4 kHz, 75 dB) co-terminating with a scrambled shock delivered through the floor grids (2 s, 0.4 mA). The inter-trial interval was variable, averaging 3 min. An acrylic square platform (14.0 cm each side, 0.33 cm tall) located in the opposite corner of the sucrose pelletâdelivering bar protected rats from the shock. The platform was fixed to the floor and was present during all stages of training (including bar-press training). Rats were conditioned for 10 days, with nine tone-shock pairings per day with a VI-30 schedule maintained across all training and test sessions. The availability of food on the side opposite to the platform motivated rats to leave the platform during the inter-trial interval, facilitating trial-by-trial assessment of avoidance. Once rats learned platform-mediated avoidance, rats underwent a 2-tone expression test (two tones with no shock). Tone 2 served as an unstimulated within-subject control and was included in the experimental design to identify any persistent effects of the laser activation. In all optogenetic experiments, the response to Tone 1 was statistically compared to the eYFP control group at Tone 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Drug infusions</title><p>The GABA-A agonist muscimol (fluorescent muscimol, BODIPY TMR-X conjugate, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to enhance GABA-A receptor activity, thereby inactivating target structures.

Extracellular waveforms that exceeded a voltage threshold were digitized at 40 kHz and stored on a computer. Waveforms were then sorted offline using three-dimensional plots of principal component and voltage vectors (Offline Sorter; Plexon, Dallas, TX) and clusters formed by individual neurons were tracked. Timestamps of neural spiking and flags for the occurrence of tones and shocks were imported to NeuroExplorer for analysis (NEX Technologies, Madison, AL). Because we used a high impedance electrode in the current study (~750â1000 kOhm), we were unable to sample interneurons. Single units were recorded across the extent of Cg1, Cg2, and PL. We excluded any units in Cg2 based on histological verification. Portions of Cg1 dorsal to rPL were grouped together for analyses, and portions of Cg1 dorsal to cPL were grouped together for analyses, ensuring that the proportion of Cg1 units was similar across both PL regions. Data was recorded during the entire session except during the 2 s shock. After conditioning, rats were tested for avoidance expression.</p><p>For avoidance assessment, rats received full conditioning sessions (with shocks) across days. Inclusion of the shock prevented extinction of avoidance. After each day, electrodes were lowered 150 ÂµM to isolate new neurons for the following session the next day. To detect tone-elicited changes in PL activity, we assessed whether neurons changed their firing rate significantly during the first 500â1000 ms after tone onset across the first five trials. A Z-score for each 500 ms bin was calculated relative to 20 pre-tone bins of equal duration (10 s pretone). PL neurons were classified as showing excitatory tone responses if the initial bins exceeded 2.58 zâs (p&lt;0.01, two-tailed). PL neurons were classified as showing inhibitory tone responses across time if any of the initial two tone bins exceeded â1.96 Zâs (p&lt;0.05, two-tailed).

Statistical significance was determined with Studentâs two-tailed t-tests, Fisher Exact tests, Chi Square tests, Pearsonâs correlation, Mann Whitney U tests, or repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey analyses, and Bonferroni corrections, where appropriate using STATISTICA (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) and Prism (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-34657-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34657.016</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>4 Hz photoactivation of rostral PL neurons during the tone impairs avoidance.</title><p>Video of an individual rat with ChR2 infused into rPL showing avoidance behavior on the last day of avoidance training (Day 10) at Tone 1, followed by the ratâs behavior at Test (Day 11) with the laser on during the tone (4 Hz, 30 s duration, 5 ms pulse width, 8â10 mW light intensity).</p></caption></media></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by NIH grants F32-MH105185 to MMD, R36-MH102968 to CBR, R36-MH105039 to JRR, R37-MH058883 and P50-MH106435 to GJQ, and the University of Puerto Rico Presidentâs Office.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Geoffrey Schoenbaum, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. Michael McDannald has agreed to reveal his identity as one of the other reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the role of the prelimibic cortex (PL) in active avoidance. The authors use fluorescent-tagged muscimol to extend a previous finding that PL inhibition delays already established active avoidance. To the author's surprise, optogenetic PL inhibition at the time of cue in this same task had no effect on avoidance â or even sped avoidance initiation when the rostral PL was photo-inhibited. Using single-unit recording they uncovered a novel, inhibitory signal in rostral PL neurons that only emerged during tone presentation in avoidance rats. Accounting for the magnitude of firing decrease observed by these neurons, the authors show that 4 Hz photo-stimulation via channelrhodopsin at only the time of the tone â cancelling out the observed inhibitory â delayed inhibitory avoidance. Collectively the results point to an unappreciated role of inhibition in PL in controlling the initiation of the decision to avoid. The topic is timely, the results are quite novel, and technically these experiments are excellent. Further, using neural activity to calibrate the optogenetic manipulation is smart and would be a good practice for the field. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript, mostly requiring just some clarifying analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In our discussion, the reviewers identified three key areas that some additional information would be helpful. I have left the comments below intact, but these three revisions are the ones that are most important to us. The first is to provide additional detail on what behavior the rats do instead of avoiding when PL is manipulated. This is interesting in its own right and also will help to identify the role of PL â for example what happens might be different depending on whether PL is actually involved in triggering the decision versus evoking fear. All three reviewers agreed this was useful, though it is described by R1. In addition, we also thought additional detail on the single unit data would be helpful. R2 would like more information regarding the excitatory correlates and their relation or lack thereof to behavior, since they are presumably affected by the inhibitory tone. R3 is interested in developing stronger correlative relationships between firing activity and the actual decision. In part, the question here is whether there is any better metric than is provided and/or if not to discuss in more detail what is meant here, given that the actual decision to avoid is so hard to define experimentally â how can you say this is really what the neurons are doing?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors examine the roles of rostral and caudal PL in active avoidance. Rats were trained to avoid a cue-signaled shock by interrupting their ongoing responding for food and stepping onto a platform. Prior work had shown that inactivating PL disrupted this behavior without affecting the cue-induced freezing. The current study replicated this effect with muscimol and then explored the neural correlates and effects of more temporally specific optogenetic manipulations. Contrary to expectations, they found that optogenetic inhibition of PL had minimal effects on expression of the active avoidance response. Subsequent recording work suggested that this was because the activity in rPL correlated with the response was inhibitory rather than excitatory. Based on this, the authors optogenetically activated PL during the cue, modestly to counteract the normal inhibition. Activation of rPL (but not cPL) impaired avoidance selectively and completely.</p><p>This is a remarkable set of studies. The authors do an excellent job of exploring a puzzling initial result, showing as they note the importance of linking optogenetic manipulations to known firing patterns in areas of interest in relevant behaviors. A particular strength of the study is the match between the effect of the effective activation on unit activity and the size of the suppression, as well as the remarkable specificity of the findings to rostral but not caudal PL, which provides a very effective control for general effects. I was a bit confused as to what the precise role of the PL contribution was to avoidance and how this related to its role in fear/freezing, which led to the following suggestions.</p><p>1) Probably the most important one is that I'd like to see the alternative behaviors plotted in detail similar to the one of interest â platform time. While I do not doubt the specificity of the role of rPL, it remains a question from the current data whether disrupting this function makes the rats no longer fearful or fearful but just incapable of organizing the escape response. There is an increase in freezing in one experiment but no effect I think in a later experimentâ¦â¦ but the freezing is very low. Does this mean that the rats continue to barpress for food? This question can be resolved simply by comparing the different behaviors across time â freezing, barpressing, platform. As they can be defined to be mutually exclusive, this more complete analysis may be quite interesting.</p><p>2) A second related minor suggestion â which I understand may not be worth doing â is that it would be interesting to see what happens to the response if the rPL is activated later in the cue, when the rat is on the platform. That is, in the final experiment, the rPL was activated from the start of the cue, and the escape response was essentially put on hold until the stimulation was terminated. This suggests that the area is triggering the response to avoid. But does it have an ongoing role? This could be addressed by waiting until a platform response was executed and then activating the rPL â do the rats leave the platform? And what do they do â resume barpressing? Freeze?</p><p>3) Lastly, I think the authors might provide a bit more overview as to how these results fit with the existing data regarding how PL is involved in simple fear conditioning. They seem to suggest that the entire network has been altered by the avoidance training. And yet there are still neurons that seem to signal the fear. How does the lack of effect here fit with effects in experiments lacking avoidance. Some integration with the simpler picture would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Diehl and colleagues performed a set of experiments examining the role of the prelimibic cortex (PL) in active avoidance. The authors use fluorescent-tagged muscimol to extend a previous finding that PL inhibition delays already established active avoidance. To the author's surprise, optogenetic PL inhibition at the time of cue in this same task had no effect on avoidance â or even sped avoidance initiation when the rostral PL was photo-inhibited. Using single-unit recording they uncovered a novel, inhibitory signal in rostral PL neurons that only emerged during tone presentation in avoidance rats. Accounting for the magnitude of firing decrease observed by these neurons, the authors show that 4 Hz photo-stimulation via channelrhodopsin at only the time of the tone â cancelling out the observed inhibitory â delayed inhibitory avoidance. By contrast, 4 Hz stimulation outside of cue presentation and 2 Hz photo-stimulation during the same cue period had no effect on avoidance. Collectively, the results reveal a new role for the rostral PL in active avoidance that is underpinned by inhibition of firing by presumptive output neurons.</p><p>The topic is timely, and avoidance is severely understudied compared to fear conditioning. This might be due to the notorious difficulty in establishing avoidance behavior in the lab. The procedure used here is very clever and looks to produce robust avoidance behavior. Technically these experiments are excellent. Further, using neural activity to calibrate the optogenetic manipulation is smart and would be a good practice for the field. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript. My primary concern is the single-unit recording results. Actually, I am not so much concerned as I am convinced that there is a lot more information in the firing than is presented. The manuscript would be greatly improved by digging into this a bit more. Specific comments are below.</p><p>1) The authors convincingly show that the proportion of excitatory neurons recruited by tone onset does not differ between avoidance, naÃ¯ve and fear groups. However, the authors do not directly compare neural activity over tone presentation between these three groups. This is a major oversight. In Figure 3D (bottom left) it is clear that while Avoidance and NaÃ¯ve rats show similar proportions on at tone onset, neuron # falls off dramatically for Avoidance but not NaÃ¯ve. It would be most informative to plot Z firing (as in Figure 3H) for entirety of tone presentation for the excitatory neurons of the three groups (Avoidance, NaÃ¯ve and Fear). This is critical not only for understanding what these neurons are doing in the task, but for interpreting the optogenetic stimulation results. As the authors point out, the optogenetic manipulation affects both the excitatory and inhibitory populations. For this reason, it is essential to see the full 28-s excitatory response (as is shown for the inhibitory response in Figure 4A). ANOVA with factors of time and group would be capable of revealing differential firing (main effect of group or group x time interaction) or supporting the author's claim of no differential firing by revealing only a main effect of time.</p><p>2) A recurring claim (e.g. subsection âInhibitory responses in rostral PL neurons correlate with the initiation of avoidanceâ, subsection âCountering inhibitory responses in rostral PL neurons delays or prevents avoidanceâ and the Discussion section) is that initiation of avoidance is correlated with inhibitory tone responses of rostral PL neurons. This claim is based on of the observation that a significantly greater proportion of inhibitory neurons are observed in the Avoidance group, compared to NaÃ¯ve and Fear. It is further shown that within this population, the majority of neurons show inhibition linked to cue onset (20/25) whereas a smaller population maintains inhibition for the cue duration (5/25). However, given the analyses performed, it would be more accurate to say that inhibitory tone responses are a correlate observed only in Avoidance rats. If the authors wish to claim that avoidance is correlated with activity, then they need to perform an analysis that directly addresses this. For example, showing that the magnitude of the firing decrease (or some other aspect of firing) predicts the latency of platform entry â percent time on platform â on a trial-by-trial basis. Finding a significant correlation would support the author's claim. However, failing to observe a significant correlation would provide more information about this signal. For that matter, failing to observe a correlation would not dampen my enthusiasm for this manuscript. Inhibitory PL neurons may signal that, within a given context, shock can be avoided. If this were the case, one would expect the population activity observed in Figure 4A, but would not necessarily expect PL activity to predict avoidance on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>3) The analysis and visualization methods used to show that neural activity to the tone and platform entry were not optimal. The population data shown in Figure 3H are a good start, but this is only a small part of the story. For example, the authors do not show the corresponding population activity for the platform entry responsive neurons. Even further, it is clear from Figure 4H that there was variability in the platform response by tone neurons, indicating that some when responsive to platform entry. It could be that the magnitude of the tone response predicts the magnitude of the platform response, but that the tone response was higher across the board. The authors note that activity to platform entry could simply result from a continuing response to tone. A simple way to address this would be to compare differential tone firing (tone onset â baseline) against differential platform entry firing (platform entry onset vs last 10 s of tone). This would provide a more thorough description of the relationship between these two signals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Diehl et al. is an interesting, well-designed, appropriately-controlled study that uses electrophysiology and optogenetics to provide compelling evidence for the importance of PL inhibitory activity during active avoidance.

Please clarify. On a related note, it is difficult to confidently assign the inhibitory responses to avoidance initiation, since it's not clear what that behavior would look like- the first movement to the platform? a mental decision with no observable behavioral correlate? cessation of lever pressing? are we looking at the correlate of one of these other behaviors, instead of avoidance initiation?

I have left the comments below intact, but these three revisions are the ones that are most important to us. The first is to provide additional detail on what behavior the rats do instead of avoiding when PL is manipulated. This is interesting in its own right and also will help to identify the role of PL â for example what happens might be different depending on whether PL is actually involved in triggering the decision versus evoking fear. All three reviewers agreed this was useful, though it is described by R1. In addition, we also thought additional detail on the single unit data would be helpful. R2 would like more information regarding the excitatory correlates and their relation or lack thereof to behavior, since they are presumably affected by the inhibitory tone. R3 is interested in developing stronger correlative relationships between firing activity and the actual decision. In part, the question here is whether there is any better metric than is provided and/or if not to discuss in more detail what is meant here, given that the actual decision to avoid is so hard to define experimentally â how can you say this is really what the neurons are doing?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] This is a remarkable set of studies. The authors do an excellent job of exploring a puzzling initial result, showing as they note the importance of linking optogenetic manipulations to known firing patterns in areas of interest in relevant behaviors. A particular strength of the study is the match between the effect of the effective activation on unit activity and the size of the suppression, as well as the remarkable specificity of the findings to rostral but not caudal PL, which provides a very effective control for general effects. I was a bit confused as to what the precise role of the PL contribution was to avoidance and how this related to its role in fear/freezing, which led to the following suggestions.</p><p>1) Probably the most important one is that I'd like to see the alternative behaviors plotted in detail similar to the one of interest â platform time. While I do not doubt the specificity of the role of rPL, it remains a question from the current data whether disrupting this function makes the rats no longer fearful or fearful but just incapable of organizing the escape response. There is an increase in freezing in one experiment but no effect I think in a later experimentâ¦â¦ but the freezing is very low. Does this mean that the rats continue to barpress for food? This question can be resolved simply by comparing the different behaviors across time â freezing, barpressing, platform. As they can be defined to be mutually exclusive, this more complete analysis may be quite interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer logically asks, âwhat is the rat doing if it is not avoiding?â when rPL is manipulated. To address this, we further assessed freezing and suppression of bar pressing when PL was manipulated with MUS, ARCH, or ChR2. Neither freezing nor suppression were significantly reduced by any of the manipulations, indicating that the reduction in avoidance was not accompanied by a reduction in fear. We have added insets to all the behavioral figures (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 6) showing freezing and suppression of bar pressing. As we had originally reported, MUS in PL actually increased freezing during the tone (see inset to Figure1). Analysis of 3-second bins revealed that this effect reached significance only at seconds 18-21 (repeated measures ANOVA, post hoc Tukey, panel A below), making it unlikely that the reduction in avoidance early in the tone was due to increased freezing. A similar 3-second bin analysis of freezing for ARCH (B- rostral PL, C- caudal PL) or ChR2 (D- rostral PL, E- caudal PL) is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34657.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34657-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second related minor suggestion â which I understand may not be worth doing â is that it would be interesting to see what happens to the response if the rPL is activated later in the cue, when the rat is on the platform. That is, in the final experiment, the rPL was activated from the start of the cue, and the escape response was essentially put on hold until the stimulation was terminated. This suggests that the area is triggering the response to avoid. But does it have an ongoing role? This could be addressed by waiting until a platform response was executed and then activating the rPL â do the rats leave the platform? And what do they do â resume barpressing? Freeze?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that would tell us if PL signaling is needed for the maintenance of avoidance behavior. Our single-unit data demonstrate that most of the inhibitory responses at platform entry terminated soon after entry (see Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C), suggesting that sustained inhibition may not be necessary for maintaining avoidance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lastly, I think the authors might provide a bit more overview as to how these results fit with the existing data regarding how PL is involved in simple fear conditioning. They seem to suggest that the entire network has been altered by the avoidance training. And yet there are still neurons that seem to signal the fear. How does the lack of effect here fit with effects in experiments lacking avoidance. Some integration with the simpler picture would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer wants to know how the current findings, that manipulations of PL have little effect on freezing, can be reconciled with previous studies of ours and others demonstrating PLâs critical role in expression of Pavlovian conditioned freezing. It is well-established that early in avoidance training, rats use Pavlovian conditioning to learn that the tone signals shock, and then switch to instrumental avoidance learning as training continues. We suggest, therefore, that PL was serving the well-established role of supporting freezing in the early stages of training. In fact, we observed that silencing rPL during the second day of avoidance conditioning significantly reduced freezing (see subsection âPhotosilencing of PL glutamatergic neurons does not delay avoidanceâ). However, as rats learn the avoidance response, freezing decreases and is no longer susceptible to PL manipulations. We initially reported this in our 2014 MUS study (Bravo-Rivera, et al., 2014) and observed it again here with MUS and ARCH inhibition of PL. Thus, the circuit for conditioned freezing changes dramatically with avoidance training. We now emphasize this in the Discussion section.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] The topic is timely, and avoidance is severely understudied compared to fear conditioning.

To address this issue, we examined the z-scores of the excitatory tone responses in each group across the entire tone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Using a repeated measures ANOVA, there was no main effect of Group (F<sub>(2,55)</sub>=1.17, p=0.316), but a main effect of time (p&lt;0.001), and an interaction of Group x Time (F<sub>(2,110)</sub>=1.245, p=0.0443), which revealed that the fear conditioned group was significantly higher than the avoidance group at the first 500 ms time point (post hoc Tukey, p&lt;0.001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Because the differences in Figure 3D (bottom left) do not reflect changes in magnitude of firing, we have added Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-B: a heat map of the average Z-scores across the entire tone of both excitatory and inhibitory tone responses as well as a graph of the average Z-score activity of all responses to tone onset recorded from the avoidance-trained rats. The heat maps show that some cells have sustained elevated firing (see top rows of excitatory tone responsive cells in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A). The group differences in proportions of excitatory responses later in the tone (Figure 3D, bottom left) may be due to signaling of other avoidance-related behaviors that are not present in naÃ¯ve rats (anticipation of shock, waiting to exit the platform to continue seeking food, etc.).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34657.020</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34657-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A recurring claim (e.g. subsection âInhibitory responses in rostral PL neurons correlate with the initiation of avoidanceâ, subsection âCountering inhibitory responses in rostral PL neurons delays or prevents avoidanceâ and the Discussion section) is that initiation of avoidance is correlated with inhibitory tone responses of rostral PL neurons.

To address this, we performed a new analysis comparing the latency of inhibition with the latency of platform entry, on a trial-by-trial basis. For a given cell on a given trial, the latency of the inhibitory response to the tone was identified as the start of the first interspike interval (ISI) that was significantly longer than the average ISI in 30 seconds of pre-tone activity (Z&gt;1.65; p&lt;0.05). 133/205 neurons showed at least one ISI that satisfied this criterion. For 133 neurons, the correlation between the latency of inhibition and latency of platform entry was only r=0.022 (not correlated). We then computed for each cell the average latency of inhibition and platform entry. For each cell, we averaged its inhibitory latency across all the trials in which successful avoidance was observed (n=284 trials; 9 trials in each session). We also averaged the avoidance latency on those trials. The correlation between these two averages across cells was r=0.078 (also no correlation). This result is plotted in new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E-F.

For trials in which the rat did not avoid (n=107 trials), there was a similar latency of inhibition (see dashed line in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F). Thus, these new analyses do not support our original hypothesis that PL inhibition initiates avoidance and is more consistent with the reviewerâs suggested hypothesis: that PL inhibitory responses signal that, within a given context, footshocks can be avoided (regardless of whether the rat chooses to avoid on that trial).

However, the inhibitory responses show more overlap between tone onset and platform entry responses: out of 22 inhibitory tone responsive and 16 inhibitory entry responsive, 9 cells were responsive to both events. The suggestion by the reviewer of comparing platform entry responses to activity during the last 10 seconds of the tone may not reveal any differences because PL activity at the end of the tone may reflect other factors such as tone duration, anticipation of shock, anticipation of platform exit to resume food-seeking, and is therefore not a reliable baseline.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Diehl et al. is an interesting, well-designed, appropriately-controlled study that uses electrophysiology and optogenetics to provide compelling evidence for the importance of PL inhibitory activity during active avoidance.

We therefore searched for behavioral correlates that might precede platform entry, focusing on the first headturn after tone onset â which is the first movement the rat makes before proceeding to the platform. We compared the average inhibition latency with average the time of headturn for each cell showing inhibition, shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E-F.

While this has been shown in fear conditioning (Courtin et al., 2014), it has not been examined in active avoidance.

Previous studies in rabbits have found that neuronal firing in both the anterior cingulate cortex and PL correlate with avoidance learning, in which rabbits must activate a running wheel to prevent a tone-signaled footshock (Orona and Gabriel, 1983; Freeman and Gabriel, 1996). Regarding our single units, we re-assessed our histology and found that one of the cPL rats had all its units located in Cg1. Removing this rat reduced the number of Cg1 units in cPL, so that the percentage of Cg1 units is now more similar in rPL and cPL (~36%). We now state this in the Materials and methods section. With this rat removed, all cells showing inhibitory responses were located in rPL, with none in cPL (see revised Figure 3I-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors optogenetically stimulate or inhibit PL neurons during the first of two extinction tones, but the rationale is not discussed.

In terms of confounding factors, rebound excitation is unlikely as Tone 2 was presented 3 minutes after Tone 1. Short-term plasticity may have affected the behavioral response to Tone 2; however, in both ARCH and ChR2 experiments, the response to Tone 1 was statistically compared to the eYFP control group at Tone 1. Tone 2 is simply added to identify any persistent effects of the laser activation (none were observed). The rationale of Tone 2 is now discussed in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Rationale for stimulating at 4Hz instead of 6Hz isn't clear. Is there evidence to indicate optogenetic stimulation at a certain frequency has an additive effect on a cell's current frequency, rather than causing entrainment at the stimulation frequency?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, our intention was that naturally-occurring and optogenetically-induced spikes would sum, so that 4 Hz stimulation would cause a neuron normally firing at 2 Hz to fire at 6 Hz. However, as shown in Figure 4C, this was not the case. In anesthetized rats, cells firing at an average of 1.5 Hz baseline rate only increased to 3.3 Hz with 4 Hz optogenetic stimulation. This may be due to entrainment, as the reviewer suggests, or poor frequency following at the current levels we used. Prior studies have reported that entrainment tends to occur at low levels of ChR2 stimulation (Warden, et al., 2012). It is therefore difficult to predict exactly how cortical neurons will respond to ChR2 stimulation. Suffice it to say that our 4Hz stimulation significantly increased the rate of the PL neurons expressing ChR2 (see figure 4C). We now discuss this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should discuss differences between rPL and cPL further and provide a stronger rationale for analyzing them independently.

We investigated anatomical differences in projections of rPL and cPL within broader anatomical studies on prelimbic prefrontal cortex, which show that rPL projects less densely to ventral striatum compared to cPL (Sesack, 1989). With respect to midbrain structures, rPL projects more densely to vlPAG whereas cPL projects more densely to dlPAG (Floyd, et al., 2000), which could be a factor in selecting freezing vs. flight. Although our previous Fos studies have not differentiated rPL from cPL, we are currently examining our cFos findings in light of the new differences we have observed in rPL and cPL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) One of the major reasons for selecting the brief post-tone latency for analysis was to ensure PL neuron activity is limited to tone, and not subsequent behavior.

However, in only 25/284 (9%) trials did avoidance occur prior to 1000ms. Below is an expanded view of the Figure 3C showing the times of platform entry (black dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Because 91% of avoidance trials occurred after 1000ms, we believe it is the best criteria we can use to identify both excitatory (500ms) and inhibitory (up to 1000ms) tone responses. Some overlap may have occurred, and it is possible that these are the cells that showed responses to both tone onset and platform entry (see new Venn diagram in Figure 3H).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34657.021</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34657-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
