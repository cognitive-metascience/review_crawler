Whether planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins, which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics and appear necessary for some axon guidance, also mediate interactions with membrane adhesion is still unclear. Here we show that Vangl2 controls growth cone velocity by regulating the internal retrograde actin flow in an N-cadherin-dependent fashion. Single molecule tracking experiments show that the loss of <italic>Vangl2</italic> decreased fast-diffusing N-cadherin membrane molecules and increased confined N-cadherin trajectories. Using optically manipulated N-cadherin-coated microspheres, we correlated this behavior to a stronger mechanical coupling of N-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton. Lastly, we show that the spatial distribution of Vangl2 within the growth cone is selectively affected by an N-cadherin-coated substrate. Altogether, our data show that Vangl2 acts as a negative regulator of axonal outgrowth by regulating the strength of the molecular clutch between N-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PCP</kwd><kwd>adhesion</kwd><kwd>vangl2</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>super-resolution</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe FRM DEQ20160334899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montcouquiol</surname><given-names>Mireille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant ANR-12-BSV4-0016-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sans</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship ENC H2020 Neurasmus</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dos-Santos Carvalho</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ph.D. fellowship fourth year</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dos-Santos Carvalho</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conseil Régional d'Aquitaine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant Neurocampus Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sans</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name><name><surname>Montcouquiol</surname><given-names>Mireille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant PG/11/76/29108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Deborah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant Labex BRAIN ANR-10-LABX-43</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Studer</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><name><surname>Thoumine</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Montcouquiol</surname><given-names>Mireille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The core PCP protein acts as a internal brake to neuronal outgrowth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Core planar cell polarity (PCP) is a conserved signaling pathway known to regulate cytoskeleton dynamics in a large variety of cell types. PCP signaling has multiple roles in morphogenesis and patterning at both the single-cell and tissue levels, although the precise downstream effectors are still ill-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ezan and Montcouquiol, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tissir and Goffinet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walck-Shannon and Hardin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). The original core PCP signaling cascade is composed of three transmembrane proteins called van gogh/strabismus (vang/stbm), flamingo/starry night (fmi/stan), frizzled (fz) and their mammalian orthologs Van gogh-like 1 and 2 (Vangl1/2); Cadherin/EGF/LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, 2, and 3 (Celsr1/2/3) and Frizzled 3 and 6 (Fzd3/6). Together with three other cytosolic proteins known as Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl), Prickle and Diego (Dgo) as well as their mammalian orthologs Dishevelled 1, 2, and 3 (Dvl1/2/3); Prickle 1 and 2 (Pk1/2) and Diversin/Ankrd6, these proteins define a conserved PCP signaling cassette in epithelia from invertebrates to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein and Mlodzik, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>). In mammals, including humans, mutations in these genes can lead to neural tube defects, which are sometimes associated with neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Torban et al., 2012</xref>). Such severe defects have been reported in mice with single or double deletion of genes such as <italic>Frizzled3/6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Vangl1</italic> and/or <italic>Vangl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Dvl1</italic> and <italic>Dvl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamblet et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>Celsr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>). Careful analysis of the brains of <italic>Fzd3</italic> and <italic>Celsr3</italic> single-mutant mice revealed strikingly similar defects in axonal tract formation, such as in the anterior commissure and the thalamocortical and corticothalamic tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tissir et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tissir and Goffinet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Both genes are also required for the guidance of monoaminergic axons along the anterior-posterior axis and in the anterior turning of commissural axons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenstermaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>). Overall, these studies suggested that <italic>Celsr3</italic> and <italic>Fzd3</italic> deletion disrupts the ability of the growth cones to respond to guidance cues but not outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2010</xref>). This axonal guidance function of Celsr3 and Fzd3 was extended to Vangl2 when some studies also reported apparent axonal guidance deficits in a mouse model carrying a spontaneous missense mutation for <italic>Vangl2</italic> (called Loop-tail or Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenstermaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onishi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shafer et al., 2011</xref>). However, more recent papers using a conditional mutant for both the <italic>Vangl1</italic> and <italic>Vangl2</italic> genes failed to report such deficits, suggesting that Vangl2 might not share the same global molecular properties as Celsr3 and Fzd3 in young neurons of the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Core PCP proteins are critical during the intense developmental periods of tissues’ growth and remodelling as illustrated during posterior body formation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrington et al., 2007</xref>) or germband extension in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zallen, 2007</xref>). In both cases, there is a strong interplay between core PCP proteins, the dynamics of the cytoskeleton and the spatial regulation of adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Classen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dohn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller and Fuchs, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jessen and Jessen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warrington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). It was in fact suggested that PCP signaling controlled the assembly/disassembly of adherens junctions during Drosophila wing epithelium growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Classen et al., 2005</xref>). More recently it was demonstrated that deletion of core PCP genes increases both the amount and the stable fraction of E-cadherin, notably through a decrease in the efficiency of E-cadherin recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warrington et al., 2013</xref>). This is believed to occur through the formation of puncta and signalosome-like structures of core PCP proteins at epithelial cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warrington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warrington et al., 2017</xref>). In the developing brain, the dynamic assembly/disassembly of adhesion complexes is also necessary for neuronal outgrowth. In essence, the entire adhesion apparatus is recycled/reused to fit the moment-by-moment demands as well as to adapt to the environment encountered during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vitriol and Zheng, 2012</xref>). Adhesion complexes at the growth cone membrane can serve as a link between the substrate and the internal retrograde F-actin flow, leading to neuronal outgrowth via a mechanism known as the ‘molecular clutch’ which postulates that increased adhesion attenuates retrograde actin flow, resulting in net protrusion and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin and Forscher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suter and Forscher, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Here, we postulated that Vangl2 participates in neuronal outgrowth in the developing brain by affecting adhesion molecules and cytoskeleton dynamics within the growth cone. Using a combination of biophysical methods and live imaging approaches, we show that Vangl2 regulates the dynamics of N-cadherin at the plasma membrane, thereby negatively controlling the engagement of N-cadherin adhesions with the retrograde actin flow and, as a result, slowing down neuronal outgrowth. Overall, our study highlights a novel molecular function of Vangl2 in early hippocampal development and defines Vangl2 as a neuronal molecular brake in young neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion leads to partial corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure agenesis</title><p>To evaluate the impact of Vangl2 deletion in the forebrain, we generated Emx1-Cre*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO conditional mutants, efficiently deleting <italic>Vangl2</italic> in the early dorsal telencephalon (V<italic>angl2</italic> cKO mice). As expected, Vangl2 expression did not vary in the cerebellum or spinal cord, where Emx1 is not expressed, but was significantly decreased in the telencephalon as early as E13.5, including the hippocampus and cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In these early stages, we did not observe a significant disruption of the internal capsule fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Analysis of brain sections from <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO mice confirmed the agenesis of both the corpus callosum (cc, magenta outline) and the hippocampal commissure (hc, cyan outline) in the dorso-caudal region of the forebrain, while other major commissures appeared intact, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qu et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). To further validate the hc deficit, we injected AAV9 viruses coding for GFP in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and processed the brain 4 weeks later. The results showed that in control mice, commissural colossal and hippocampal fibers cross the cerebral midline, while in <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO mice they did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Three-D rendering representation of the hippocampus and cc created from coronal stack images stained with cresyl violet demonstrated the matching deficit of cc crossing above the hippocampus in <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The observed deficit in cc was not due to a decrease in upper-layer neurons, as the thickness of the somato-sensory region of the cortex, or the number of Cux1-positive neurons and the thickness of the layer they define, were unchanged between controls and <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Alltogether our data suggest that an early deletion of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in the telencephalon leads to cc and hc commissural deficits restricted to the dorso-caudal region. We next sought to evaluate if such a phenotype could be the result of abnormal axonal outgrowth in the absence of Vangl2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Vangl2 affects commissural tracts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining with FluoroMyelin of coronal sections from P21 control (upper panel) and <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO (lower panel) brains in a rostral (left) and more caudal (right) location.

Thus, in the absence of Vangl2, the diffusion of Ncad-mEos2 molecules is reduced, and the domain size of the slow/confined trajectories decreases.

For this purpose, we monitored mEos2-Vangl2 molecules on Ncad-Fc or laminin substrates using sptPALM coupled to TIRF, as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

Plots of the MSDs of mEos2-Vangl2 molecules over time show a clear reduction in the area covered by Vangl2 molecules at the periphery on both substrates, with a more pronounced difference on Ncad-Fc than on laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,H</xref>). If the average size of the mEos2-Vangl2 domains (nanometric confinement domains) was not different between the two types of substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), the domain size distribution revealed a slight shift towards a larger domain size on Ncad-Fc substrates compared with laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). The density of Vangl2 domains was higher on Ncad-Fc substrate than on laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K,L</xref>), a difference that can be explained by the larger surface area of the growth cones grown on laminin-coated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

After proper calibration, we estimated a minimal escape force of 2.3 pN at a distance equal to the bead radius,that is R = 0.5 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkin, 1992</xref>). This value lies in the lower range of forces measured by optical tweezers at the growth cone periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thoumine et al., 2006</xref>). As a control for the specificity of microsphere binding to endogenous N-cadherin at the growth cone surface, we compared the movement of beads coated with Ncad-Fc and Fc alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Fc-coated beads rarely escaped the optical trap within the 2 min recording, thereby exhibiting a greatly reduced escape probability (8% for Fc alone vs 70% for Ncad-Fc on control growth cones). Significantly, the velocity of Ncad-Fc beads after escape (V = 0.12 ± 0.01 µm/s, 50 beads) was very similar to the actin flow speed measured earlier by sptPALM on actin-mEos2, strengthening the idea of a direct transmembrane coupling.

When permissive substrates such as N-cadherin or laminin are present in the environment they bind to corresponding cell surface receptors at the plasma membrane, which recruit specific adhesion complexes, creating a molecular link between the adhesion proteins and F-actin filaments within the growth cone. This ‘molecular clutch’ leads to the local engagement of the actin flow, causing a decrease in its speed and a proportional increase in neuronal outgrowth, due to the ongoing actin polymerization. The presence of Vangl2 at the membrane participates in the regulation of this outgrowth by controlling the number of N-cadherin molecules engaged in the clutch. If no permissive substrate is present, the link is absent, and the outgrowth is slow, while the retrograde flow is fast.

For a growth cone to advance, it must not only be able to stick to the substrate but also be able to dynamically disassemble and reassemble adhesion complexes quickly. In fact, comparative studies have shown that neuronal growth cones generate significantly lower traction forces than non-neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore et al., 2010</xref>) but also that hippocampal neurons do not adhere to the substrate as strongly as other neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch et al., 2012</xref>). One important difference between the cells with strong, stable, and mature focal adhesions and neuronal growth cones is that in the latter, substrate coupling and adhesions are transient and rapidly evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch et al., 2012</xref>). Our data strongly suggest that Vangl2 participates in this dynamic junctional remodeling role, allowing the hippocampal neurons to adapt to the environment encountered while navigating. In a study on commissural motor neurons, <italic>Shafer</italic> et al. showed that downregulation of <italic>Vangl2</italic> levels via shRNAs prevented Wnt5a-stimulated axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shafer et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, our results in hippocampal neurons show that neurite outgrowth is increased in the absence of Vangl2 but that Wnt5a-stimuated axonal outgrowth is not affected in <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO neurons. We may envision that hippocampal and motor neurons respond differently to defects in Vangl2 signaling. This has been illustrated for <italic>Fzd3</italic> mutants both in terms of axonal growth and guidance, possibly because of distinct responses to a specific diffusible cue (secreted or extracellular matrix - ECM) encountered as the axon grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At a molecular level, it is tempting to conclude that Vangl2 is a regulator of endocytosis in the context of junctional remodeling during tissue growth, including cell movement. Vangl2 has been shown to interact with a large variety of proteins, many of which still await characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailly et al., 2018</xref>). Within these interactors, there is now accumulating evidence in various species and tissues that E-cadherin and N-cadherin turnover is modulated by Vangl2 and its orthologues, through direct or indirect interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Classen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warrington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagaoka et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagaoka et al., 2014b</xref>).

But the in vivo phenotype observed in the Emx1-Cre*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO is more realistically the result of a combination of the disruption of both autonomous and non-autonomous Vangl2-dependant mechanisms. Vangl2 is broadly expressed in the cortex and hippocampus early in development and notably at the time of intense neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tissir and Goffinet, 2006</xref><italic>, this manuscript</italic>) and its deletion could affect various mechanisms, in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The environment explored by the growth cone as it moves might be affected by <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion, in terms for example of guideposts location/maturity, secretion of diffusible molecules, fasciculation or gene expression, including ECM proteins expression levels. Our data on the redistribution of Vangl2 at the periphery of the growth cone on the N-cadherin substrate suggest that the composition of the ECM could reciprocally modulate the distribution of Vangl2 molecules in the growth cone and then modulate its behavior. It seems reasonable to think that this effect could be mediated via homophilic N-cadherin interactions in trans transmitted via direct or indirect interaction with Vangl2. In vivo, we could imagine that guidance is regulated by the interplay between Vangl2 and the ratio of N-cadherin and laminin (ECM composition) present along the growth cone path as it grows. When the growth cone encounters an N-cadherin-rich environment, Vangl2 could control the number of pauses (for example), allowing better exploration, and possibly influencing the orientation of the growth cone. But if this is the case, most of the forebrain neurons appear to be able to compensate for the absence of such a Vangl2 control of guidance in vivo. Thus, we believe that the clear differences in neuronal behavior and in the corresponding in vivo phenotypes, similar for Fzd3 and Celsr3 but different from Vangl2, suggest that the N-cadherin/Vangl2 relationship identified here in hippocampal neurons mostly pertains to outgrowth regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hua et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Though mechanistically different, these results expand a growing body of literature highlighting some links between Vangl2 and components of the ECM during cell migration, notably during convergent extension in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dohn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jessen and Jessen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Love et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the Emx1-Cre*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO conditional model used in this study, the agenesis of the cc is restricted to the posterior portion which is typical of a developmental deficit, as formation of the cc starts from the anterior part and progresses to the rear. In this same caudal region, it is suggested that cc crossing may be facilitated by hc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Livy and Wahlsten, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozaki and Wahlsten, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wahlsten, 1981</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that cortical neurons might also react abnormally to the absence of Vangl2, we propose that in the <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO the cc deficit is, to a large extent, a secondary consequence of the faulty formation of the hc. In our mutant, the cc deficit is not associated with a significant disruption of upper-layer neurons or cortical thickness reduction, as observed in the Loop-tail mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lake and Sokol, 2009</xref>). We believe this discrepancy can be partially explained by the absence of severe neural tube defects in the Emx1-Cre*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO, or in a double <italic>Vangl1<sup>−/−</sup>;</italic>Foxg1<sup>Cre</sup><italic>;Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> compound cKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qu et al., 2014</xref>), as compared to mice with germline mutation/deletion such as the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> mutant or the null <italic>Vangl2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2010</xref>), which present with craniorachischisis. As such, some of the central nervous system defects seen in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> or in <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> embryos brains could be a secondary consequence of the severe disruptions in tissue morphogenesis as observed in these mutants. Finally, a compounding factor in the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> embryo could be the existence of dominant-negative or gain-of-function properties of the Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup> protein, as shown in other systems or suggested in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore probable that at least some of the severe phenotype in cortical thickness observed by Lake and Sokol are not entirely due to a disruption in the neurogenesis process.

The microscope is linked through an optical fiber to a four-color laser bench (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 642 nm; 100 mW each). Photoactivation was done at 405 nm, while the images were taken using the 561 nm laser. Illumination was done under Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) to focus on molecules localized in a narrow optical section (100 nm) close to the substrate. For actin-mEos2, sequences of 360 images were acquired using 250 ms exposure time and at 2 Hz frequency (1 images every 0.5 s). This ensures that fast-diffusing actin monomers which contribute to a blur in the images are eliminated from subsequent analysis and that only slowly moving actin molecules incorporated in actin filaments are retained. Our sptPALM experiments were performed on genetically modified mice while our methodological model study used rat growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). We noted numerous quantitative and qualitative differences that we attribute mostly to the difference between species. Notably, we had to be more rigorous in defining what we considered to be the peripheral region of the growth cone in order to avoid contamination by actin molecules that are located more centrally, because the growth cone are smaller in mouse hippocampal neurons. Also, we observed a lower activation of actin-mEos2 molecules in mice growth cones compared to rat, with an overall lower number of trajectories. This is confirmed also when comparing the number of N-cadherin-mEos2 molecules activated in mice growth cones vs mEos2-Vangl2 molecules in rat growth cones. Indeed, for mEos2-Vangl2 we were able to photoactivate and detect molecules with only 20 ms exposure time during 4000 acquisitions while for N-cadherin-mEos2 molecules we had to increase the exposure time (50 ms) and no molecules were photoactivated/detected after 2000 acquisitions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Speed, trajectories and nanodomain analysis</title><p>Actin, Vangl2, and N-cadherin trajectories recorded by sptPALM were computed and analyzed using custom-made algorithms written as a MetaMorph plug-in (PALMTracer) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al.

Single-molecule localization was performed using a wavelet-based algorithm, and trajectories were computed using a simulated annealing algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izeddin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kechkar et al., 2013</xref>). The trajectory duration, which corresponds to the time during which single mEos2 fluorophores emit red light upon 561 nm laser illumination, follows an exponential distribution strongly shifted to short values. Only trajectories longer than seven frames in regions of interest were considered for analysis, which yielded a median of around nine frames for actin-mEos2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), 10 frames for N-cadherin-mEos2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and 11 frames for mEos2-Vangl2 on both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The proportion of trajectories with more than seven time points is 63% in control and 61% in <italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO growth cones respectively. For slow actin-mEos2 trajectories, the mean squared displacement (MSD) function was computed for each trajectory over time, and fit by the power law MSD = 4Dt<sup>α</sup>, where t is the time, D is the diffusion coefficient, and the exponent α (values between 0 and 2) reflects the curvature of the MSD function and the type of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saxton, 1994</xref>). For highly directed trajectories, the MSD is a quadratic function of time, thus α is close to 2. To classify the α exponent of actin-mEos2 trajectories, computer simulations were ran (see below in Materials and methods) in order to determine the thresholds for both confined and directed motions, which were set to α = 0.5 and 1.5, respectively. For mEos2-Vangl2 and N-cadherin-mEos2 trajectories, the Diffusion values calculated by the PALM-TRACER plugin were converted onto a logarithmic scale and then pooled for comparison. Trajectories were sorted into two groups: confined and mobile. Confined trajectories were defined as trajectories with D &lt; 0.015 µm²*s<sup>−1</sup> (for N-cadherin-mEos2) or D &lt; 0.022 µm²*s<sup>−1</sup> (for mEos2-Vangl2), corresponding to molecules that explored an area inferior to the one defined by the image spatial resolution ∼ (0.11 µm)² for N-cadherin-mEos2 or (0.084 μm)² for mEos-Vangl2) during the time used to fit the initial slope of the MSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kechkar et al., 2013</xref>) (4points = 80 ms): For example, the N-cadherin-mEos2 D<sub>threshold</sub> = (0.11 μm)<sup>2</sup>/(4 × 4 × 0.02 s)∼0.015 µm²*s<sup>−1</sup>. Confined trajectories with negative MSD slopes were arbitrarily assigned D = 10<sup>−5</sup> µm²*s<sup>−1</sup>. To analyze confinement domains, we used PALM-TRACER plugin to create super-resolved images of the intensity of mEos2 molecules (Vangl2 and N-cadherin) to obtain a fluorescent intensity map of the proteins of interest. The domains were isolated from the surrounding signal using a fluorescence threshold. The fluorescence profile of each domain is then fitted in a 2D sigmoidal function to extract information about the size of the fluorescent area (x and y coordinates) as well as pixel intensity. Growth cone surface was calculated with Metamorph to yield the number of domains/µm². For EB3-eGFP, the velocity (V) of EB3-eGFP particles was calculated by fitting the individual MSDs with the function 4Dt + V²t². The lifetime (T) of each EB3-eGFP particle was also calculated by dividing the number of time points displayed by each particle by 2 (to take in account the 2 Hz frequency acquisition), giving then a quantification of the number of seconds in which the EB3-eGFP particle was tracked.</p><p>For kymograph analysis, we first made an image of the projection of the maximal fluorescence of each image composing the stack acquired with actin-mEos2 (sptPALM-TIRF). Metamorph was used to perform kymograph analysis at the periphery (~5 µm width) of the imaged growth cones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>FRAP</title><p>FRAP experiments were done as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al. (2015)</xref>. Briefly, hippocampal neurons were nucleofected with 1 μg of C-terminally GFP-tagged WT chicken N-cadherin and plated on N-cadherin-Fc-coated coverslips at a density of 100,000 cells per coverslip. Experiments were run under the same setup used for sptPALM. The laser bench has a second optical fiber output connected to an illumination device containing galvanometric mirrors (iLas; Roper Scientific), allowing scanning of the beam onto regions of interest defined on the images. Switching between the two fibers for alternating between imaging and bleaching is performed in the millisecond range using a mirror. After acquiring a 10 s baseline at a frame rate of 1 Hz, rapid photobleaching of a peripheral region of a growth cone was achieved at higher laser power (6 mW output at the objective focal plane) during 200–300 ms. Fluorescence recovery was further recorded for 200 s at a frame rate of 0.5–2 Hz. The data were fitted by a diffusion/reaction model that uses three parameters: the fraction of free receptors <italic>φ</italic>, the diffusion rate taken from freely moving N-cadherin-GFP receptors k<sub>diff</sub>, and the turnover rate of N-cadherin-GFP adhesive interactions k<sub>reac</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Microsphere preparation and optical tweezers experiments</title><p>Twenty microliters of 1 µm latex microspheres (19404 Polysciences) were rinsed three times with 0.2 M boric acid (pH 8.4) and then resuspended with 100 µl boric acid. To 50 µl of this suspension, we added 10 µl of AffiniPure goat anti-human Fc<sub>γ</sub> Fragment specific, (109-005-098, Jackson Immunoresearch) and then added boric acid to reach a final volume of 100 µl. After incubation ON at 4°C, we rinsed the beads three times with the boric acid solution containing 1% BSA (A7638 Sigma). The final pellet was then suspended with 60 µl boric acid containing 1% BSA. This suspension was then split in half: one part was incubated for 3–4 hr at room temperature with 4 µg of recombinant human N-cadherin-Fc chimera protein (1388-NC-050, R and D Systems) while the other half was incubated with 4 µg of ChromPure Human IgG, Fc fragment (009-000-008 Jackson ImmunoResearch) alone (control experiment to test adhesion specificity). Beads were rinsed again 3 times and suspended in 50 µl of a solution similar to the one in which the neurons are cultivated (PM solution), containing also 1% BSA and 20 mM Hepes. The beads were kept on ice during the experiments.</p><p>An inverted microscope Nikon Ti Eclipse (Nikon France S.A.S., Champigny-sur-Marne, France) was fed through its epifluorescence port by a 1064 nm/1 W laser beam (LCS-DTL-322 LASER 2000, Pessac, France) reflected by dichroic mirror (FF700-SDi01, SemROCK). Microsphere trapping was achieved with a laser power of 300 mW at the back focal plane of a 100x/1.49 N.A. oil immersion objective. Microspheres captured using a motorized stage were placed at the periphery of growth cones and the trap was then left ON for the total duration of the experiment. The microsphere movement in DIC illumination was recorded for 2 min at 5 Hz. We quantified the stiffness of the optical trap by imposing fluid flow of known velocity (V) around trapped microspheres, and measuring the bead displacement δ at steady state. This was done by keeping the bead in the optical trap several microns above the substrate, and moving the motorized 2D stage at constant speed. The flow velocity around the bead is thus equal to the stage speed and was calculated from the displacements of beads stuck at the surface of the coverslip. The displacement of the bead from the trap center was calculated by image subtraction (with versus without force). This procedure was performed for varying 1064 nm laser power, to make sure we were in the regime of a linear dependence of trap force versus laser power. We then applied Stokes formula giving the drag force around a spherical object: F = 6πRηV, where R is the bead radius (R = 0.5 µm), η = 10<sup>−3</sup> Pa.s is the fluid viscosity, and V is the flow velocity (60 µm/s). This provides us with a lower estimate of the escaping force of N-cadherin coated beads on growth cones, which occurs when the bead reaches a displacement δ roughly equal to the bead radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkin, 1992</xref>). At maximal laser power, we measured a trap stiffness of 4.7 pN/µm and thus an escape force of 2.3 pN at an escape distance of R = 0.5 µm. The trajectories described by the beads were tracked using Metamorph. To analyze the time needed for the bead to escape the trap, only the beads that eventually escaped the trap were accounted for. The escape probability (P<sub>e</sub>) was defined as the frequency of beads that escaped the optical trap (over the total amount of beads recorded) during the first half of the recordings (i.e. after 1 min).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Western blotting</title><p>The cortex, hippocampi, cerebellum and spinal cord from at least three P0/1 or P14 (hippocampus only) mice were dissected, pooled and weighted. A buffer solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (Gibco) and a mix of proteases inhibitors (Roche) was added to the tissues according to their weight. Samples were homogenized and sonicated and protein concentration was evaluated through BCA analysis (BCA protein Assay Kit from Thermo Scientific). Protein concentration was adjusted for each sample and diluted with 4X SDS loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mauriac et al., 2017</xref>). Proteins were loaded on a 10% acrylamide gels and ran at 125 V for 1 hr 30. The proteins are then transferred for 2 hr 30 to a PVDF Immobilon membrane (Millipore) or to a Nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes are saturated with a TBS (25 mM Tris, pH7.5; 137 mM NaCl; KCl 3 mM; bidistilled water up to 2 L) solution containing 8% milk or 5% BSA for ON at 4°C. The following day membranes were rinsed and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Vangl2 antibody at 1/2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montcouquiol et al., 2006</xref>) or a mouse monoclonal anti-N-cadherin at 1/2000 (clone 32, BD Biosciences) or a mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin at 1/2000 (clone 14, BD Biosciences) and a mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH at 1/5000 (AB 2302, Millipore) antibodies followed by secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, GE Healthcare UK) incubations. The membranes were processed with chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Scientific). The optic density (OD)*mm<sup>−2</sup> was analyzed for each detected band. These values were then normalized by taking into account the GADPH OD*mm<sup>−2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Actin polymerization assay</title><p>The amount of F-actin and G-actin was evaluated according to the Cytoskeleton Actin Polymerization Assay Kit (BK037, Cytoskeleton) protocol.

To separate F-actin (pellet) from G-actin (supernatant) a 1 hr centrifugation at 100.000 x g was performed on the lysate, then the pellet was re-suspended in a volume equivalent to the supernatant using F-actin depolymerizing buffer. Actin levels were quantified by immunoblot using a rabbit polyclonal anti-pan actin antibody (Cytoskeleton). For each condition we pooled three petri dishes. The expression levels were determined using a Bio-Rad Quantity One system with a GS800 calibrated densitometer, and represented as a percentage of control band intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Computer simulations of actin dynamics in virtual growth cones</title><p>The program to simulate actin dynamics in growth cones is based on previous work (Garcia et a., 2015). The algorithm to compute the successive positions of individual actin molecules was written with the Mathematica software (4.1 version, Wolfram Research). The geometry is chosen as a 2D conical structure, in accordance with the flat nature of growth cones, with radius 12 µm and half angle 45°, based on experimental measurements. A single molecule is characterized by its spatial coordinates (x, y) over time (t). The total length of the trajectories (160 s) is based on the durations of sptPALM recordings, and the time step of the simulations is set to ∆t = 50 ms, corresponding to a typical camera frame rate (total of 3200 frames). The initial molecule position was defined in cylindrical coordinates as r(0) = r<sub>0</sub> and θ(0) = θ<sub>0</sub>, chosen randomly between 0 and 12 µm and −45° and +45°, respectively. At each time step t, the (x, y) coordinates of the molecule are incremented by the distances (Δx, Δy), depending on whether the molecule is freely diffusing, bound to the retrograde flow, or interacting with transmembrane adhesions. In the diffusive regime, x(t) and y(t) coordinates are incremented by (2D∆t)<sup>1/2</sup> n<sub>1</sub> and (2D∆t)<sup>1/2</sup> n<sub>2</sub>, respectively, where n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> were random numbers generated from a normal distribution, to account for the stochastic nature of diffusion. Free cytosolic actin monomers are considered to display fast random diffusion (D = 3 µm²*s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGrath et al., 1998</xref>). When actin monomers reach a 0.5 µm distance to the leading edge of the growth cone, they are allowed to assemble into filaments with a polymerization rate 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup>, and slowly move rearward with a velocity V = 0.05–0.15 µm*s<sup>−1</sup>, as measured in sptPALM experiments. In that regime, the radial coordinate r(t) = [x(t)² + y(t)²]<sup>1/2</sup> is then incremented by -V∆t, and the x and y rectangular coordinates are calculated as x(t)=r(t) cos[θ(t)] and y(t)=r(t) sin[θ(t)], plus slow diffusive terms (2D’∆t)<sup>1/2</sup> n<sub>1</sub> and (2D’∆t)<sup>1/2</sup> n<sub>2</sub>, respectively, accounting for short range lateral motion (D’=0.003 µm²*s<sup>−1</sup>) matching that measured experimentally. During rearward motion, actin filaments are allowed to transiently couple to substrate-immobilized adhesion complexes (in particular N-cadherin) at the substrate, with adjustable kinetic parameters k<sub>c</sub> and k<sub>u</sub> (in units of s<sup>−1</sup>). Actin molecules can bind only if the probability of coupling in this time interval, k<sub>c</sub>∆t, is greater than a random number n between 0 and 1 generated from a uniform distribution. The coupling rate k<sub>c</sub> is taken as the average frequency of the pauses made by actin molecules on N-cadherin coated substrates (k<sub>c</sub> = 0.2 s<sup>−1</sup>), and the uncoupling rate is varied between 0.001 s<sup>−1</sup> (reflecting high coupling), and 0.8 s<sup>−1</sup> (reflecting low coupling). These values represent the two extreme types of interactions observed experimentally on N-cadherin coated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bard et al., 2008</xref>). The ratio k<sub>c</sub>/k<sub>u</sub> which we call ‘coupling strength’, represents the binding affinity between filamentous actin and immobilized adhesion complexes. In this trapping mode, bound actin molecules are set to diffuse with a low diffusion coefficient (D’’=0.001 µm² s<sup>−1</sup>), that is the positions are incremented by (2D’∆t)<sup>1/2</sup> n<sub>1</sub> and (2D’∆t)<sup>1/2</sup> n<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Actin molecules stay bound until the probability for detachment k<sub>c</sub> ∆t, exceeds another random number n’. When actin molecules detach from N-cadherin adhesions, they are set to move rearward again, until they couple to N-cadherin again, or escape the flow area. Actin filaments are allowed to spontaneously depolymerize into monomers within the peripheral region at a rate of k<sub>d</sub> = 0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>, in agreement with measurements based on fluorescent speckle microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Goor et al., 2012</xref>). Actin filaments reaching the base of the growth cone (4 µm lower region) without depolymerizing are forced to disassemble and randomly diffuse again. For simplicity, we do not allow free actin monomers to bind adhesion complexes.</p><p>The output text file (x, y, t) is processed in the custom-made program PALM-Tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kechkar et al., 2013</xref>) run under the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices), and allowing the construction of stacks of images representing actin motion over time, as described previously. A zoom factor determines the pixel size of the reconstructed image (typically 25 nm), similar to the one used in sptPALM analysis. Four hundred trajectories per condition were generated. To mimic fluorophore photophysics, molecules are allowed to be fluorescent for a limited number of planes along their trajectory, before photobleaching. Molecules are thus turned on at a random time (between 0 and 150 s), then switched off after a random time chosen in an exponential distribution reproducing the experimental trajectory lengths. To reproduce the experimental conditions of a 2 Hz time lapse movie with camera exposure time of 250 ms, simulated images are summed by groups of 5 (5 × 50 ms=250 ms), then one image out of two is kept. This procedure ensures that freely diffusing actin monomers which contribute to a blur in the images are eliminated from subsequent analysis and that only slowly moving actin molecules incorporated in filaments are retained. This yields a stack of 320 frames, from which trajectories of more than seven frames are selected, as in the experiments. The mean squared displacement (MSD) is computed for each trajectory, and fitted with the power function MSD = 4Dt<sup>α</sup>, where D is a diffusion coefficient and the exponent α (values between 0 and 2) reflects the type of trajectory (directed for α close to 2, Brownian for α around 1, and confined for α &lt;1). The fact that α coefficient can be less than 1, thereby deviating from random diffusion, is a result of the slow sampling mode. For directed trajectories, fitting the MSD with the function 4D’t + V²t² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qian et al., 1991</xref>) gave a velocity component in good agreement with the one entered in the simulations, thus validating the overall approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Code availability</title><p>The Mathematica code used for the modelisation model is available as a source code file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>) provided in the Supplementary Material.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>For each experiment, sample sizes were chosen on the basis of initial pilot experiments.

(PCP) is important for morphogenesis and involves a polarized distribution of protein complexes that act on the cytoskeleton. In the context of axon outgrowth in mammals, the PCP components Fzd3 and Celsr3 play key functions in response to axon guidance cues and the formation of major axonal tracts, whereas the role of Vangl2 has remained unclear.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors employed a sophisticated array of live imaging and molecular diffusion assays as well as a cortex-specific Vangl2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice to evaluate the regulation of actin treadmilling, N-cadherin dynamics, and growth cone behavior. These approaches yielded a compelling argument for a molecular mechanism by which Vangl2 regulates the growth cone velocity, without impairing the response to guidance cues, by acting as a molecular clutch that links actin treadmilling within the growth cone to the external growth substrate. Vangl2 is important for the retrograde actin flow and Ncadherin-coupling to the actin cytoskeleton; and in turn, the localization of Vangl2 in the growth cone relies on extracellular N-cadherin. They also provide evidence that the function of Vangl2 in actin and N-cadherin dynamics is required for the formation of the hippocampal commissure and corpus callosum.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vangl2 acts at the interface between actin and N-cadherin to control mammalian neuronal outgrowth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Fadel Tissir as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an impressive and technically elegant study explores in depth the underlying mechanisms by which the core PCP protein Vangl2 regulates the axonal outgrowth. It is extremely well quantified and analyzed and should be of great interest for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.

The most significant omission from the Discussion is a manuscript by Love et al., 2018 which discusses Vangl2 mediated regulation of protrusions and cell migration which is analogous to growth cone outgrowth. However in this context Vangl2 function is fibronectin dependent and may not require N-Cadherin. How do these findings relate to each other and does this reflect a broader function for Vangl2 and cell adhesion molecules? Vangl2 also regulates growth cone migration through a non-autonomous mechanism (Ghimire, 2018). How could the cell-autonomous and non-autonomous functions for Vangl2 function to each other? Is this a common mechanism or multiple?</p><p>2) It is not clear whether the authors view this mechanism as a unique function for Vangl2, acting independent of other Core PCP factors, or whether N-Cadherin stabilization is an output of PCP signaling. This would be worth discussing as the authors imply that 'PCP signaling effects' this process (Discussion) but do not demonstrate a role for other PCP proteins such as Frizzled or CELSR that contribute to intercellular PCP signaling.</p><p>3) Related to point #2, could the authors discuss whether the presence of Vangl2 and possibly PCP polarization of the growth cone is contributing to an N-Cadherin mediated axon guidance (turning) events? Or is this just outgrowth?</p><p>4) The series of experiments carried out in vitro, including FRET experiments, single molecule tracking and their in-depth analyses/modeling set a new state-of-the art and understanding of the phenotypes. This is in sharp contrast with the very limited description of the in vivo conditional mutant phenotype presented in Figure 1. While it is clear that this is not the core of the article, it would be important to present a more precise description of the phenotype, and discuss how it might be related to an enhanced axonal outgrowth. To this aim, the authors could show horizontal sections through the corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure to assess the severity of the deficit along the rostrocaudal axis. In addition, they should explore or discuss whether cortical axons of the internal capsule, which progress during embryogenesis, show an accelerated outgrowth in Vangl2 conditional mutants using either classical immunostaining or axonal tracing.</p><p>5) Given the effect of the Loop-tail (Lp) mutation on cortical neurogenesis (precocious differentiation of neural progenitors into early-born neurons at the expense of late-born neurons; Lake and Sokol, 2009), and that the fact this might affect the size of the corpus callosum, the authors should test the effect of the loss of Vangl2 on cortical histogenesis, in particular on the production of upper-layer neurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51822.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors fail to reference or discuss several papers that appear relevant to Vangl2 function in axon guidance or outgrowth.

How do these findings relate to each other and does this reflect a broader function for Vangl2 and cell adhesion molecules?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this remark that gives us the opportunity to clarify our view.</p><p>We are familiar with the work of J.R. Jessen and we agree that the work of that group highlight a link between core PCP signaling and specifically Vangl2, and ECM components in migrating cells, and as such should be mentioned. But we also believe there are many important mechanistic differences between the ectodermal cells of the zebrafish embryo during gastrulation and hippocampal neurons in the mouse, and we should be cautious in drawing direct mechanistic comparison between different systems and species.</p><p>The work of the Jessen’s group over the years demonstrated that Vangl2 can modulate the remodeling of the ECM during the gastrulation of zebrafish embryos, by regulating the endocytosis of the metalloproteinase MMP14 (matrix‐metalloproteinase). They showed that the loss of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in trilobite mutants leads to an increase in cell surface amounts of MMP14 and increased MMP14 proteolysis of fibronectin leading to a decrease in fibronectin levels, which is correlated to reduced cell–matrix adhesion and an increase in membrane protrusive activity. This was associated with disrupted polarized cell behavior (=PCP) and convergent extension defects (Williams et al., 2012). In 2013, the same group showed that cadherin levels were decreased at the plasma membrane in <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant embryos (Dohn et al., 2013), and in 2017 that a loss of human VANGL2 reduced cell adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin in a cell line (Jessen and Jessen, 2017). The specific work mentioned by the reviewer (Love et al., 2018) suggests that fibronectin is necessary for Vangl2 recruitment at the plasma membrane of zebrafish ectodermal cells and that Vangl2 promotes protrusion in these cells. While the overall idea that core PCP proteins, and notably Vangl2, regulate plasma membrane proteins that will interfere with ECM molecules to modulate migratory behavior is common to both our systems (and others), they are very different in terms of mechanisms, including the regulation of cadherin levels, and the resulting adhesive and migratory properties.</p><p>In contrast with Jessen’s findings, we observe that a deletion of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in hippocampal neurons results in increased adhesion due to a reduced turnover of N-cadherin and in a resulting N-Cadherin-dependent (but not integrin/laminin dependent) regulation of axonal outgrowth via an increased physical link between the N-cadherin present in the substrate, the N-cadherin at the growth cone membrane and the cytoskeleton.</p><p>We believe these differences between systems emphasize the need to study the function of each core PCP gene individually in a specific cellular context, and that if these genes are evolutionary conserved, they may have developed new functions. Alternatively, they may have conserved similar function but with a different molecular basis through new binding partners, to adapt to a specific cellular context.</p><p>On the other hand, we believe that a common molecular theme to both systems (and others) could be a Vangl2-dependent regulation of endocytosis of proteins involved in adhesion remodeling, a point we develop more in response to question 2 below and that we now discuss in the Discussion.</p><p>The work of Jessen, including the Love et al., 2018, study as well as the Dohn et al., 2013, and the Jessen and Jessen, 2017, is now cited in the Introduction with other related citations, and in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Vangl2 also regulates growth cone migration through a non-autonomous mechanism (Ghimire, 2018). How could the cell-autonomous and non-autonomous functions for Vangl2 function to each other? Is this a common mechanism or multiple?</p></disp-quote><p>While our in vitro data, in a very controlled environment, allowed the identification of a clear cell autonomous deficit due to the absence of Vangl2 in the neuron, in the absence of any other interfering bias, the in vivo phenotype observed in the Emx1*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO is most probably the result of a combination of the disruption of both autonomous and non-autonomous Vangl2-dependent mechanisms. Vangl2 is broadly expressed in the cortex and hippocampus early in development, notably at the time of intense neurogenesis (Tissir et al., 2006) and its deletion could affect various mechanisms, in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. So, the environment explored by the growth cone as it moves might also be affected by <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion, in terms, for example, of guideposts location/maturity, secretion of diffusible molecules, fasciculation or gene expression, including ECM expression levels. Our data on the redistribution of Vangl2 at the periphery of the growth cone on the N-cadherin substrate support the hypothesis that the composition of the ECM could reciprocally modulate Vangl2 molecules in the neuron. This highly dynamic interplay would allow the neuron to react to the ECM composition present along its path as it grows. We further discussed this in response to question 4, in the text below. This is further discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear whether the authors view this mechanism as a unique function for Vangl2, acting independent of other Core PCP factors, or whether N-Cadherin stabilization is an output of PCP signaling. This would be worth discussing as the authors imply that 'PCP signaling effects' this process (Discussion) but do not demonstrate a role for other PCP proteins such as Frizzled or CELSR that contribute to intercellular PCP signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fundamental question that goes back to some extent to our statement in the Discussion that “These results suggest that core PCP genes do not share a similar signaling cassette in young neurons as they do in epithelial cells, at least for axon guidance” (already present in the previous manuscript). We do believe that core PCP proteins can activate signaling pathways independent from each other. We believe this is the case for axonal guidance, where it was clearly shown that <italic>Celsr3</italic> and <italic>Frizzled3</italic> mutants have massive axonal bundle disruption in the forebrain while <italic>Vangl2</italic> and <italic>Vangl1/Vangl2</italic> double mutants do not.</p><p>Even in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where all 6 core PCP genes are needed to control PCP in various epithelia, there are examples of neuronal signaling pathways that do not require all core PCP proteins. For example, one study suggests that during <italic>Drosophila</italic> midline guidance, Fmi and Fz act independently of the other classical PCP components, including Vang (Organisti et al., 2014). Also, a work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> on Vang‐1 and Prkl‐1 (<italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologous of Vang and Prickle proteins respectively) demonstrated that both proteins cooperated to negatively regulate neurite formation, without involvement of the other core PCP proteins (Sanchez‐Alvarez et al., 2011).</p><p>One the other hand, at the molecular level, it is tempting to conclude that Vangl2 has a global role as a regulator of endocytosis in the context of junctional remodeling. Vangl2 has been shown to interact with a large variety of proteins, many of which still await characterization (Bailly et al., 2018). Within these interactors, there is now accumulating evidence, in various species and tissues, that E-cadherin and N-cadherin turnover is modulated by Vangl2 and its orthologues, through direct or indirect interaction (Classen et al., 2005; Warrington et al., 2013; Nagaoka 2014a, b). Vangl2 has also been shown to regulate the endocytosis of other molecules including Frizzled 3 (Shafer et al., 2011), nephrin (Babayeva et al., 2013) or the matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 (Williams et al., 2012). Therefore, Vangl2-mediated membrane protein endocytosis might represent an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which tissue morphogenesis (including neuronal tissue) is controlled in both vertebrates and invertebrates. This is now discussed in the revised Discussion section.</p><p>Also, the sentence referring globally to “PCP signaling effects” in the previous manuscript has been amended to “In summary, this work offers an original and dynamic view of the role of Vangl2 in neuronal cells and gives us insight into how a specific core PCP gene can affects the development and the morphogenesis of neuronal tissue.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to point #2, could the authors discuss whether the presence of Vangl2 and possibly PCP polarization of the growth cone is contributing to an N-Cadherin mediated axon guidance (turning) events? Or is this just outgrowth?</p></disp-quote><p>It is not possible at this point to definitively conclude that Vangl2 is not at all involved in axonal guidance as defined here, as a turning event, at least in vivo. The response of one type of neuron, to one specific signal, is hard to predict in terms of integration of cues in a complex and changing environment. Our in vitro data, in a very controlled environment, allowed the identification of a clear cell autonomous deficit due to the absence of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in the neuron, in the absence of any other interfering bias. But even in vitro, there is an inherent complexity to the response of a neuron to many cues. For example, microfluidic analysis of hippocampal neurons in response to Slit1 showed that the diffusible molecule can be repulsive or attractive, depending if it is used alone, or in combination with a gradient of netrin-1, but also depending on the substrate (Dupin et al., 2015). A similar complexity was demonstrated regarding the response of retinal axons to netrin in the presence or absence of laminin (Hopker et al., 1999). One could imagine that in vivo, and in a subset of hippocampal neurons, guidance is regulated by the interplay between Vangl2 and the ratio of N-cadherin and laminin in the environment. When the growth cone encounters an N-cadherin-rich environment, Vangl2 could control the number of pauses (for example), allowing better exploration, and maybe influencing the orientation of the growth cone. But if this is the case, most of the forebrain neurons appear to be able to compensate for the absence of such a Vangl2 control of guidance since there is not a massive disruption of axonal guidance in the cKO.</p><p>Our in vivo results show that hippocampal neurons are still able to answer correctly to diffusible factors such as netrin-1 and Wnt5a in terms of axonal outgrowth when deprived of Vangl2. Based on these results, we suggest that given the correct cellular context, they might also turn correctly in response to these factors. Supporting this hypothesis, our in vivoresults show that axon guidance as a whole is not affected by <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion, as we (and others) did not observe major abnormalities in the main forebrain axonal tracts, except for the absence of the hippocampal commissures (HC) and of the corpus callosum (CC) in the dorso-caudal area. This is in contrast to what was reported for Frizzled 3- and Celsr3-deficient neurons that seem to have normal outgrowth but do not respond to turning (Chai et al., 2014; Hua et al., 2014) and whose mutant brains display major forebrain axonal tract deficits. We believe that these differences in neuronal behavior and in the corresponding in vivo phenotypes, similar for Fzd3 and Celsr3 but different from Vangl2, suggest that the N-cadherin/Vangl2 relationship identified in our manuscript with hippocampal neurons mostly pertains to outgrowth. These points are now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The series of experiments carried out in vitro, including FRET experiments, single molecule tracking and their in-depth analyses/modeling set a new state-of-the art and understanding of the phenotypes. This is in sharp contrast with the very limited description of the in vivo conditional mutant phenotype presented in Figure 1. While it is clear that this is not the core of the article, it would be important to present a more precise description of the phenotype, and discuss how it might be related to an enhanced axonal outgrowth. To this aim, the authors could show horizontal sections through the corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure to assess the severity of the deficit along the rostrocaudal axis. In addition, they should explore or discuss whether cortical axons of the internal capsule, which progress during embryogenesis, show an accelerated outgrowth in Vangl2 conditional mutants using either classical immunostaining or axonal tracing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her appreciation of our work and interest in further characterizing the Vangl2-dependent phenotype. It is true that the focus of this manuscript was to identify a molecular basis for the specific and restricted connectivity problems resulting from <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion that are in contrast to what was reported for two other core PCP genes, <italic>Frizzled3</italic> and <italic>Celsr3</italic> (Wang et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2014, Chai et al., 2014, Hua et al., 2014).</p><p>To better illustrate the corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure deficits, we generated, as suggested by the reviewer, horizontal sections of 3-week-old mouse controls and mutants, showing in a single plane the presence of both the commissures in a ventral position and their absence in a more dorsal position. Some sections were processed for neurofilament staining, and other were stained with cresyl violet (new Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). We also processed coronal sections from controls and mutants for cresyl violet stain and compiled them to generate a 3D rendering of corpus callosum and hippocampal structure + commissures in the dorsal region (new Figure 1D). This representation clearly illustrates that the CC deficit matches exactly that of the HC.</p><p>We also generated and illustrated a more rostral coronal section with fluoromyelin staining, illustrating the presence of the CC and HC in that location, in addition to the more caudal section that was presented in the previous manuscript where both commissures are missing (new Figure 1A). These new illustrations can be found in the new Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Regarding a potential difference in the growth of cortical axons from the internal capsule, we compared the growth of axons in embryos from E12.5, E13.5 and E14.5 control and cKO embryos after neurofilament staining. We did not observe a significant difference between controls and mutants. An illustration of E13.5 coronal sections from controls and cKOs labeled with neurofilament is now present in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding how the partial CC and HC agenesis might be related to an enhanced axonal outgrowth, it is obviously complicated to answer this without a more thorough in vivo analysis (including the deletion of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in specific neuronal population) that would be beyond the scope of this study. We can however make a few suggestions/comments.</p><p>Certainly, the in vivo phenotype observed in the Emx1*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO is the result of a combination of the disruption of both autonomous and non-autonomous Vangl2-dependent mechanisms, as mentioned in response to question 3. Vangl2 is broadly expressed in the cortex and hippocampus early in development, notably at the time of intense neurogenesis (Tissir et al., 2006), and its deletion could affect various mechanisms in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. So, the environment explored by the growth cone as it moves might also be affected by <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion, in terms for example of guideposts location/maturity, secretion of diffusible molecules and fasciculation or gene expression, including ECM expression levels. Our data on the redistribution of Vangl2 at the periphery of the growth cone on the N-cadherin substrate suggest that the composition of the ECM could reciprocally modulate Vangl2 molecules in the neuron. This highly dynamic interplay would allow the neuron to react to the ECM composition present along its path as it grows.</p><p>In this study, we have focused our analysis on hippocampal neurons in vitro, and we further suggest that the observed dorso-caudal CC deficit may be a consequence of the HC deficit. The CC crossing above the HC and the matching deficit are now clearly illustrated in the new Figure 1D. However, we cannot exclude that cortical neurons might also react abnormally to the absence of Vangl2, as <italic>Vangl2</italic> deletion might differentially affect different population of neurons as they encounter distinct environments. This has been illustrated for Fzd3 mutants both in terms of axonal growth and guidance, probably because of distinct responses to a specific diffusible cue (secreted or ECM) encountered as the axon grows (Hua et al., 2014).</p><p>All of these points are now discussed in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the effect of the Loop-tail (Lp) mutation on cortical neurogenesis (precocious differentiation of neural progenitors into early-born neurons at the expense of late-born neurons; Lake and Sokol, 2009), and that the fact this might affect the size of the corpus callosum, the authors should test the effect of the loss of Vangl2 on cortical histogenesis, in particular on the production of upper-layer neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The additional data we generated following the reviewer’s comments show that despite an absence of Vangl2 protein in the dorsal telencephalon as early as E13.5 in Emx1*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO (illustrated now in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), no clear disruption of cortical thickness or of Cux1-positive cells (illustrated now Figure 1E-G) was observed, suggesting that the embryonic absence of Vangl2 in the dorsal telencephalon does not severely affect neuronal cell fate or migration. This is in sharp contrast with what was observed by Lake and Sokol, 2009, in a <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Lp/Lp</sup> brain. In that study, the authors observed a massive reduction of neocortex thickness that they linked to a disruption of oriented cell division in the progenitor pool of the ventricular zone. Such a discrepancy could be due to at least 3 reasons:</p><p>1) the Loop-tail mutation is a germline mutation and often these result in a stronger phenotype compared to conditional deletion. The severe neural tube defect (NTD) phenotype (craniorachischisis) (Kibar et al., 2010) observed in <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Lp/Lp</sup> or in a null <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> embryos (Song et al., 2010) is not observed in the Emx1*<italic>Vangl2</italic> cKO (this manuscript) or in the double Vangl1<sup>−/−</sup>;<italic>Foxg1Cre;Vangl2</italic><sup>f/f</sup> cKO generated by Qu et al., 2014.</p><p>2) some of the central nervous system defects seen in <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Lp/Lp</sup> or in <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> embryos brains could also be a secondary consequence of these severe disruption of tissue morphogenesis as observed in the <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Lp/Lp</sup> or in a <italic>Vangl2<sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup></italic> embryos but not in the neuronal-specific conditional mutant.</p><p>3) a final compounding reason of such a severe phenotype in <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Lp/Lp</sup> embryo could be the existence of a dominant-negative or a gain-of-function property of the Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup> protein.</p><p>It is therefore probable that at least some of the severe phenotypes observed by Lake and Sokol is due to a deficit in very early mechanisms of neural tube closure (before E9.5) and involving mesenchymal and/or ectodermal cell movements required for closing of the neural tube. This does not disprove a role for Vangl2 in asymmetric cell division, but strongly suggests that the severity of the brain phenotype as observed in the <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>Lp/Lp</sup> is probably not due solely to this process. This emphasizes again the caution necessary when drawing mechanistic conclusions on the role of Vangl2 (or Vangl1) when using the Loop-tail model.</p><p>These results have been added to Figure 1, and the corresponding discussion regarding the Lake and Sokol article can be found in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additional references:</p><p>Dupin I, Lokmane L, Dahan M, Garel S, Studer V.
