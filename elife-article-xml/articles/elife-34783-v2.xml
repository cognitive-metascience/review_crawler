An important question is the impact of mild myelin disruption. In the absence of the myelin protein proteolipid protein (PLP1), myelin is generated but with age, axonal function/maintenance is disrupted. Axon disruption occurs in <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice as early as 2 months in cortical projection neurons. High-volume cellular quantification techniques revealed a region-specific increase in oligodendrocyte density in the olfactory bulb and rostral corpus callosum that increased during adulthood. A distinct proliferative response of progenitor cells was observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), while the number and proliferation of parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells was unchanged. This SVZ proliferative response occurred prior to evidence of axonal disruption. Thus, a novel SVZ response contributes to the region-specific increase in oligodendrocytes in <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice. Young adult <italic>Plp1-</italic>null mice exhibited subtle but substantial behavioral alterations, indicative of an early impact of mild myelin disruption.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oligodendrocyte</kwd><kwd>demyelination</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>sub ventricular zone</kwd><kwd>motor coordination</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS25304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macklin</surname><given-names>Wendy B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macklin</surname><given-names>Wendy B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC00566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Restrepo</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Restrepo</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG053690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Douglas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC012280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS099042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mild myelin disruption leads to early axonal pathology, a novel pathological response in neural stem cells, regionally increased oligodendrocytes and altered behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelin-producing cells of the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes, facilitate normal neuronal function. While myelin acts as an insulator, it has additional roles crucial for axonal activity. Myelin disruption contributes to a growing list of neurological diseases, including the most common neurological disease in young adults, multiple sclerosis (MS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browne et al., 2014</xref>). Patients with extensive demyelination, such as in MS, exhibit severe motor deficits, as well as psychiatric symptoms, including a higher incidence of cognitive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feinstein et al., 2013</xref>). While psychiatric diseases are not typically associated with overt demyelination, subtle white matter abnormalities have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mighdoll et al., 2015</xref>), and it is proposed that mild myelin alterations reduce conduction velocity, which alters timing within neural circuits, including oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filley and Fields, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pajevic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida and Lyons, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Proteolipid protein (PLP1) is a major structural component of myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>) and mutations in the <italic>Plp1</italic> gene are deleterious in humans. <italic>Plp1</italic> point mutations or gene duplications lead to the dysmyelinating diseases, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and spastic paraplegia type 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Torii et al., 2014</xref>). Patients with mutations resulting in complete deletion of the PLP1 protein exhibit mild early impairments that progress to spastic quadriplegia, ataxia, and cognitive impairments in adolescence. Genetic deletion of PLP1 in mice does not impair myelination and induces subtle alterations in myelin structure that correlate with a slight reduction in spinal cord conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klugmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petit et al., 2014</xref>).

To observe region-specific cellular alterations, we used high throughput methods to generate unbiased regional analysis. These analyses revealed previously unidentified cellular responses to mild myelin disruption. We provide evidence that enhanced proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) leads to a progressive accumulation of new oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum (CC) and olfactory bulb (OB). Recent studies of different mouse models suggest that mild myelin deficits eventually lead to cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poggi et al., 2016</xref>), but our studies are the first to demonstrate mild myelin disruption resulting in specific behavioral alterations in young adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased oligodendrocyte density in <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice</title><p>To quantify oligodendrocytes, we studied <italic>Plp1</italic>-eGFP mice that express eGFP under the PLP1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mallon et al., 2002</xref>).

The mean stride length for <italic>Plp1</italic>-null animals was 4 cm with a standard deviation of 0.15 cm. Mean stride length for wild-type animals was 3.92 cm with a standard deviation of 0.3 cm. Front-hind paw offset for <italic>Plp1</italic>-null animals was 0.2 cm with a standard deviation of 0.08 cm. Wild-type animals front-hind paw offset was 0.21 cm with a standard deviation of 0.2 cm. These values were not significantly different (Wilcoxon rank-sum p=0.67 for stride length and p=0.78 for paw offset). However, 3M- and 9M-old <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice overstepped forelimbs with respect to hindlimbs and displayed longer stride length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâD</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34783.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Motor deficits in <italic>Plp1-</italic>null mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rotarod performance was not altered in 3 and 9M <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice.

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amboni et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that these mice could have a broader deficit in information processing leading to cognitive deficits. In order to evaluate cognition/executive function, we tested <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice in the Puzzle Box, a comprehensive test of learning, memory and problem-solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Abdallah et al., 2011</xref>). In the Puzzle Box, mice must reach a dark goal box to escape a brightly lit arena, and access to the goal box is made progressively more difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The time of entry to the dark goal box in each stage of this task depends on problem solving of novel entry constraints within each stage using skills learned in previous stages. Progressive difficulty is reflected by longer time to enter in the latter stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice (3M and 9M) took longer to enter in stage three when the entry-way was filled with saw dust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), and 9M-old <italic>Plp1</italic>-null mice took longer to enter in the fourth stage when the entry was covered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

The cellular response is not a response to oligodendrocyte death and appears earlier than measurable signs of axonal disruption, e.g. swellings and reduced conduction velocity. One hypothesis is that the absence of PLP1 during embryonic development alters the proliferative capacity and fate of SVZ cells into adulthood. Alternatively, axonal alterations and their downstream response, which are not observable through these methods, could signal for the enhanced proliferation. This hypothesis seems more likely as increased oligodendrogenesis occurs throughout early adulthood and it is likely these signals persist and perpetuate oligodendrogenesis.

It is hypothesized that myelin disruption will lead to alterations in timing of action potential transmission resulting in altered neural oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pajevic et al., 2014</xref>). Oscillations are important for transmission of information in neural systems because they provide a syntactical framework for packaging information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BuzsÃ¡ki and Watson, 2012</xref>). Here, we find that the myelin/axonal pathology is accompanied by increases in the power of oscillations in the theta and beta frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similar increases in the power of oscillations are observed in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, optogenetic activation in the beta frequency promotes oligodendrogenesis and adaptive myelination accompanied by behavioral motor improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>), and recent studies show that optogenetic activation of gamma oscillations attenuates amyloid load in an animal model of Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref>), a pathology accompanied by defects in myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartzokis, 2011</xref>). We propose that SVZ production of new oligodendrocytes and the accompanying increase in oscillatory power is a protective response reducing behavioral effects of the absence of PLP1 in myelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). How a protective increase in oscillatory power is generated is an open question in disorders such as early MS and Alzheimerâs.

Three tiled sections were analyzed per mouse with at least three mice/genotype. The scale of the images is 0.8 Î¼m/pixel. The acquired z-stack was rendered 2D through a maximum intensity projection using the Leica software. Images were analyzed using a MATLAB (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) script run by a user who was blind to the genotype during the entire analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gould, 2018</xref>). First, background subtraction was performed to render the background more homogenous. For <italic>Plp1</italic>-eGFP+Â cells, the background detection eliminated signal from the <italic>Plp1</italic>-eGFP+Â oligodendrocyte processes and allowed for better detection of the signal from the cell bodies. To perform background subtraction the function imopen was used to erode then dilate the image with a disk size determined by the blinded user (average disk size: WTÂ =Â 8.72Â Â± 3.61 pixels; <italic>Plp1-</italic>nullÂ =Â 5.26Â Â± 0.88 pixels). Next, positive pixels were determined using a user-defined threshold value. The threshold value was determined by observing the overlap of the thresholded image and the original image. The average threshold value was 0.14 (Â±0.02) for WT and 0.15 (Â±0.03) for <italic>Plp1-</italic>null (in an intensity scale of 0 to 1). Connected objects were identified within the positive pixels using the function bwconncomp. Small objects (&lt;5 pixels) were removed from the analysis since they are too small to be a cell. The percentage of large connected objects over 50 pixels was 2.9% (Â±1.5) for WT and 0.5% (Â±0.7) for <italic>Plp1-</italic>null. Therefore, connected objects containing multiple cells comprised only a small percentage of the cells identified. To split the connected objects containing multiple cells, erosion was performed using the function imerode with a disk size of 1 pixel. The erosion splits the connected object into smaller objects that reflect the number of cells within the larger connected object. These smaller objects do not cover the entire cell body; however, the smaller objects created do not have an impact on the overall cell size determined since they comprise a small percentage of the objects quantified. Data was collected in a structural array and exported as a. csv file. To determine the validity this MATLAB algorithm cell counts in a representative area (200 pixels<sup>2</sup>) from each region examined were manually quantified and then quantified using the MATLAB algorithm. The average percent difference of MATLAB counts relative to manual counts was 4.9% (Â±4.4%) for WT and 6.4% (Â±2.5%) for <italic>Plp1-</italic>null.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Digital image acquisition and analysis of cleared tissue sections</title><p>To visualize cleared <italic>Plp1</italic>-eGFP tissue sections, z-stacks were acquired on a homebuilt light-sheet fluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryan et al., 2017</xref>). The light-sheet was generated using a 4x NA 0.14 objective and the Rayleigh length was adjusted using a pinhole to match the sample size. Both 4x NA 0.14 and 10x NA 0.28 air immersion detection objectives were utilized for detection. The axial spacing for each objective was 3.5 Î¼m for the 4x and 1 Î¼m for the 10x objective. This yielded voxel sizes of 1.625 Ã 1.625 Ã 3.5 Î¼m for the 4x objective and 0.65 Ã 0.65 Ã 1.0 Î¼m for the 10x objective. The laser power was linearly increased through the entire stack through user-defined settings to account for a loss in signal-to-noise as imaging depth increased. At each image plane, an image was captured using both a uniform excitation pattern and sinusoidal excitation pattern with a user defined frequency. These images were used for HiLo image reconstruction to remove effects due to incomplete clearing and scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mertz and Kim, 2010</xref>). HiLo processed image stacks were then processed such that the mean and standard deviation of each image plane were equalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phair et al., 2004</xref>). Intensity normalized HiLo processed image stacks were then filtered using multiscale adaptive image enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Plp1</italic>-eGFP cells were quantified in the final processed image stacks using both the above custom MATLAB code and Vaa3D cell-counting plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng et al., 2014</xref>).

The stimulating electrode was then moved toward the recording electrode to the closest distance of 0.5 mm in 0.5 mm steps. For analysis of the compound action potential (CAP), the peak latency for N1, where observed, and N2 were measured with four successive data acquisition sweeps per distance and the average of the four sweeps was recorded as the latency for that distance. Linear regression was then performed for each component to yield a slope that is the inverse of the velocity and the slopes were analyzed for statistical comparison using GraphPad.</p><p>The amplitude of the N2 component was determined at increasing current steps from 0 to 4.0 mA in 0.25 mA increments.

The pyramidal cells are represented by 15 equivalent cylinders describing the electrotonic properties of the real pyramidal cells. Each interneuron is modeled as a single compartment. Ion channels were described using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism and channel densities were adjusted to achieve the firing patterns observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanier and Bower, 1999</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editorsâ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Mild Myelin Disruption Elicits Early Alteration in Behavior and Proliferation in the Subventricular Zone&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that your manuscript will not be considered further.</p><p>Specifically, while we agree that the model presents an interesting means to detect early deficits in myelination that may later lead to behavioral problems, the reviewers felt that more work would be needed to link the cellular changes and observations with the behavioral phenotypes. In addition, it was felt that more in depth analyses were needed to demonstrate that new oligodendrocytes are being generated.

High-volume cellular quantification showed region-specific increase in oligodendrocyte cell density in the olfactory bulb and rostral corpus callosum in adult age.

Even mild disruption can build to major cognitive and motor deficits later in life. In this study, Gould et al. demonstrate that in a genetic mouse model of mild myelin disruption, mice lacking proteolipid protein (PLP) exhibit a distinct proliferative response in progenitor cells specifically within the subventricular zone (SVZ), and increased oligodendrocyte density in corpus callosum and olfactory bulb. These abnormalities occur prior to axonal disruption (commonly seen in PLP models) and results in later cognitive and motor behavior deficits. PLP is a major structural component of myelin, and in this study Gould et al. use a <italic>Plp</italic>null mouse model to identify that well before late life myelin disruption, mice lacking PLP exhibit a significant increase in proliferation of precursor cells within the SVZ, and these cells preferentially become oligodendrocytes.</p><p>The authors demonstrated clearly the very exciting phenomenon of SVZ-specific proliferation of progenitor cells histologically. The authors use an interesting technique for high volume cell counting and support this with cell tracking data using timed EdU injections. However the effect this has on behavior is less clear.

Can you explain this difference? Why do the WT animals appear to have also struggled at this portion of the task specifically in this timepoint?</p><p>3) How were animals divided for this study? Were the same animals run on all tests, and tested at 3M and again at 9M? Or is this different sets of animals at each timepoint? What is the order in which the tests were run?

At the behavioral timepoints measured, these mice are already exhibiting massive axonal disruption. Is this behavior due specifically to axonal disruption and long term myelin deficits? Do these animals exhibit any of these motor deficits earlier due to developmental loss of PLP? Can behavior be run at an earlier timepoint (maybe at P18, to match with the cell counting data) to verify the specificity of behavior to later myelin disruption, rather than an effect of the genetic background?</p><p>5) Why was EM not run to verify myelin disruption at the timepoints measured?</p><p>6) In the Discussion, please expand upon the role of SVZ-derived progenitor cells in this model and its contribution in disease models.
