homeostasis. Mammalian cell function is dynamically regulated by the interaction of cell surface galectins with branched N-glycans. Here we report that N-glycan branching deficiency triggers the Golgi to generate bioequivalent N-glycans that preserve galectin-glycoprotein interactions and cellular homeostasis. Galectins bind N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units within N-glycans initiated from UDP-GlcNAc by the <italic>medial</italic>-Golgi branching enzymes as well as the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi poly-LacNAc extension enzyme β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT). Marginally reducing LacNAc content by limiting N-glycans to three branches results in T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity; yet further restricting branching does not produce a more hyperactive state. Rather, new poly-LacNAc extension by B3GNT maintains galectin binding and immune homeostasis. Poly-LacNAc extension is triggered by redistribution of unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <italic>medial</italic> to <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules. These data demonstrate the functional equivalency of structurally dissimilar N-glycans and suggest a self-correcting feature of the Golgi that sustains cellular homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14814.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14814.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14814.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most proteins that are released from cells are modified with sugar molecules that allow the proteins to carry out their role properly. These modifications are called glycans, and are made from sugar subunits joined into chains or branched structures. Investigating how the structure of glycans is linked to their role is complicated by the fact that many different glycans exist, made up of different sugars and arranged into different structures.</p><p>Enzymes located in cell compartments known as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi help to build the glycans. For example, the MGAT family of enzymes found in the Golgi generates branched glycans made up of sugar subunits called N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc). These glycans form part of a molecular mesh on the surface of cells that controls how certain proteins embedded in the cell membrane behave. This is particularly important in immune cells: reducing the number of branches in the glycans weakens the mesh and causes the cells and their membrane proteins to behave inappropriately.</p><p>Mkhikian et al. have studied mice that lack specific MGAT enzymes, and so produce LacNAc glycans with drastically fewer branches than normal. Immune cells in these mice had glycans on their surface formed of LacNAc arranged in chains, rather than in short branched structures. These chains turned out to be biologically equivalent to branched LacNAc glycans, containing the same sugar subunits and allowing the immune cells to behave as normal. This suggests that the composition of glycans, rather than their structure, primarily determines their role.</p><p>Mkhikian et al. also found that the organization of the enzymes inside the Golgi is likely to be responsible for producing these equivalent glycans. A glycan is built up as it passes through the Golgi, with the branching enzymes located earlier in the Golgi than the extending enzymes. Therefore, if the branching enzymes fail to add LacNAc subunits to the glycan, the extending enzymes can step in later to add the missing components.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Mkhikian et al. indicate that the large number of structurally diverse glycans may be reduced to a much smaller number of glycans with similar roles, based on subunit composition. This will simplify future studies on LacNAc glycans, and further work could focus on defining which other glycan structures share similar roles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14814.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14814.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>N-glycosylation</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>galectin</kwd><kwd>self-correction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30HL108451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mkhikian</surname><given-names>Haik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K016164/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haslam</surname><given-names>Stuart M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dell</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dell</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI053331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AT007452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI108917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structurally dissimilar N-glycans can be functionally equivalent, and are produced via a self-correcting feature of the Golgi.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Self-correcting mechanisms have evolved to maintain the integrity of critical biological pathways in the face of disruptive insults and stochastic uncertainty. Such mechanisms range from proofreading in DNA replication to functional redundancy of important cellular apparatuses. The galectin-glycoprotein lattice is a dynamic cell surface structure that globally regulates receptor localization and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Partridge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigorian et al., 2009</xref>). Its importance is underscored by its role in basic cellular processes such as signaling, apoptosis, endocytosis, differentiation, and cell growth, as well as its association with a wide range of diseases including immunity/autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mkhikian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou, 2014</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dennis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beheshti Zavareh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Croci et al., 2014</xref>), and Type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohtsubo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johswich et al., 2014</xref>). However, a mechanism that homeostatically sustains the lattice is not known.</p><p>The lattice forms due to the multivalent interactions between extracellular galectins, a family of sugar binding proteins, and the disaccharide N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) present on Asn (N)-linked glycans attached to cell surface glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirabayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brewer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2004</xref>). The vast majority of secreted and cell surface proteins are co- or post-translationally modified by the addition of sugars in the ER. As these proteins transit through the ER and Golgi, their glycans undergo dramatic remodeling, generating a vast and heterogeneous array of glycoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schachter, 1991</xref>). In the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi a group of enzymes, MGAT1, 2, 4, and 5, act to produce N-glycans with one, two, three, or four N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schachter, 1986</xref>). The subsequent addition of galactose by a family of galactosyl transferase enzymes produces the galectin substrate LacNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The number of branches depends on the relative activity of the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi branching enzymes MGAT1, 2, 4, and 5 and the availability of their shared donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grigorian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2011</xref>). Alternating action of β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT) and galactosyl transferase enzymes can generate a linear polymer of LacNAc (poly-LacNAc) at any given branch. Although the affinity of galectin binding to a LacNAc monomer is relatively weak, increased LacNAc valency through branching and poly-LacNAc extension can dramatically increase galectin avidity leading to a major impact on cell surface dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirabayashi et al., 2002</xref>). In T cells for example, galectin - T cell receptor (TCR) interactions directly oppose ligand induced TCR clustering and signaling, thereby negatively regulating T cell development, antigen-dependent T cell growth, and autoimmunity risk.</p><p>Glycan analysis of tissues from glycosylation pathway deficient mice has revealed the presence of minor but unusual structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takamatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ismail et al., 2011</xref>). The function of these changes is unclear, but some have suggested that the observed structural alterations may reflect production of bioequivalent glycans that are induced by communication between the cell surface and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takamatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dam and Brewer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dennis and Brewer, 2013</xref>). However, direct evidence supporting this possibility is lacking. Deficiency in the branching enzyme β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5) reduces avidity for galectin, enhancing antigen dependent and independent TCR clustering/signaling, leading to development of spontaneous autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Based on the current model of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice, more severe reductions in branching should weaken the lattice further and result in greater T cell hyperactivity. Surprisingly, further limiting branching revealed that the Golgi apparatus has a remarkable capacity to buffer challenges to the strength of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice. Our analysis reveals a homeostatic mechanism built into the architecture of the Golgi apparatus that induces bioequivalent poly-LacNAc glycans that act to maintain the function of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice in the face of dysregulated Golgi branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mgat2</italic> deficiency does not increase T cell hyperactivity beyond <italic>Mgat5</italic> deficiency</title><p>To further investigate the role of branching in T cells, we generated T cell specific <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient mice (<italic>Mgat2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>::<italic>Lck-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ye and Marth, 2004</xref>). Loss of <italic>Mgat2</italic> is expected to limit N-glycans to a single branch, producing hybrid structures; although a second branch via MGAT4 activity is possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As the branching pathway declines in enzymatic efficiency going from MGAT1 to MGAT5, <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficiency also impacts a much greater percentage of cell surface glycans than <italic>Mgat5</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Examination of peripheral T cells from <italic>Mgat2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>::<italic>Lck-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> mice indicated loss of <italic>Mgat2</italic> in most but not all T cells as assayed by flow cytometry with the plant lectin L-PHA (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris,</italic> leukoagglutinin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans produced by MGAT5 specifically bind L-PHA, structures that are also lost following <italic>Mgat2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>Mgat5</italic> and <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed a similar degree of activation and proliferation in response to anti-CD3 (an antibody which induces TCR clustering and signaling) despite the more dramatic reduction in LacNAc branching in <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,D and E</xref>). This suggested that either the β1,6GlcNAc branch produced by the MGAT5 enzyme is uniquely important for regulating T cell activation or that a compensatory mechanism maintains galectin binding when the number of LacNAc branches is reduced. To evaluate for potential differences in total surface LacNAc content between <italic>Mgat2</italic> and <italic>Mgat5</italic> deficient T cells, galectin-3 binding at the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry. <italic>Mgat5</italic> deletion resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to bind galectin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>), consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>). However, <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficiency produced no additional decrease in galectin-3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>), suggesting comparable LacNAc content at the cell surface despite a marked reduction in LacNAc branches in <italic>Mgat2</italic> relative to <italic>Mgat5</italic> deficient T cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14814.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Compensation limits hyperactivity of <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) T cells were activated with plate bound anti-CD3 for 24 (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) or 72 (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) hours.

SW treated Jurkat cells, rather than T cells from <italic>Mgat2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>::<italic>Lck-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> mice, were used for this purpose to provide a sufficient amount of starting material for accurate analysis. MALDI-TOF-MS of N-glycans derived from SW treated Jurkat T cells confirmed the presence of hybrid N-glycans with up to two poly-LacNAc extended branches (m/z 2897, 3102, 3347, 3551, and 4000 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This was qualitatively consistent with the presence of poly-LacNAc following SW treatment, but likely under-represents the length of poly-LacNAc extension due to the limited sensitivity of MALDI-TOF-MS for large poly-LacNAc structures. To better quantitate the change in poly-LacNAc, endo-β-galactosidase digestion was used. This enzyme cuts all internal Galβ1,4 linkages in poly-LacNAc structures, unless the GlcNAc on its reducing side is modified by fucose. Endo-β-galactosidase digestion produced GlcNAcβ1,3Gal (m/z 518) from internal linear poly-LacNAc antennae, together with Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Gal (m/z 722) and NeuAc-Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Gal (m/z 1084) from their non-reducing termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The ratio of the internal and terminal glycans examines the relative length of linear poly-LacNAc structures, with a higher ratio signifying longer chains. The non-treated cells had a ratio of 0.5, which increased to 1.1 in the SW treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), confirming the presence of longer poly-LacNAc chains after SW treatment. <italic>Mgat2 </italic>deficient T cells are expected to have a greater increase, given the ~100 fold increase in LEA binding compared to the ~20 fold increase in SW treated Jurkat cells.

Such a mechanism, which depends on a cell surface sensor of Golgi activity/branching implies a temporal lag phase during which a defect is detected, a signal is sent, and then the Golgi generates the proper response. With this prediction in mind, Jurkat T cells were treated with SW for various times and analyzed for changes in cell surface glycosylation by L-PHA, LEA, and Concanavalin A (ConA), the latter a plant lectin that binds high-mannose structures increased by SW treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Although the increase in LEA binding trailed slightly behind an increase in ConA binding, it began to increase within ~1.5 hr of SW treatment, indicating an almost immediate compensatory response. Loss of L-PHA staining exhibited the smallest slope, possibly reflecting the preferential cell surface retention of highly branched glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since the increase in LEA staining exhibited some delay, the role of TCR signaling in driving poly-LacNAc induction was assessed. Blocking TCR signaling genetically, with TCRβ and Lck deficient Jurkat lines, or pharmacologically, with MAP kinase inhibitors, only partially reduced the magnitude of the poly-LacNAc response induced by SW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). More importantly, directly activating downstream TCR signaling with PMA and ionomycin did not induce poly-LacNAc up-regulation, although it further enhanced poly-LacNAc triggered by SW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, TCR signaling appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the homeostatic poly-LacNAc response, but does contribute to its magnitude in the context of deficient branching.</p><p>Since most surface receptors are glycosylated, there are a large number of possible additional cell surface sensors that may alter signaling to drive compensation. However, we reasoned that regardless of the upstream components, a mechanism that acts to increase poly-LacNAc production must do so by either increasing the activity of responsible enzymes or increasing substrate supply (UDP-GlcNAc or glycoprotein) for the reaction.

Thus, much like TCR signaling, increased cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels are neither necessary nor sufficient to induce homeostatic up-regulation of poly-LacNAc.

The branching enzymes (i.e. MGAT1, 2, 4 and 5) are localized to the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi, while the galactosyl transferase and B3GNT enzymes reside in the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi. The CMP-sialic acid transporter has a relatively restricted localization within the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that sugar-nucleotide donors may be preferentially supplied to specific Golgi compartments. We hypothesized that UDP-GlcNAc supply and associated transporters may be restricted to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi compartment, thus preferentially driving branching over extension. Consistent with this hypothesis, raising total cellular UDP-GlcNAc increases branching by the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mkhikian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grigorian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>), but does not induce significant up-regulation of poly-LacNAc extension by <italic>trans</italic> Golgi B3GNT enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This suggests that cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc lacks direct access to the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi compartment. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the subcellular localization of the three UDP-GlcNAc Golgi transporters (SLC35A3, SLC35B4, and SLC35D2) and B3GNT2. Jurkat T cells were transfected with DDK or HA tagged versions of these proteins and examined for intra-Golgi localization using confocal microscopy-based line scan analysis. Intra-Golgi localization was determined by co-staining transfected cells with the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> markers GM130 and TGN46, respectively, and determining the peak intensity of fluorescence along a line scan relative to these markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejgaard et al., 2007</xref>). All three UDP-GlcNAc transporters localized to the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>medial</italic> Golgi compartments while B3GNT2 localized to a later Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). In addition, overexpression of the UDP-GlcNAc transporters did not drive poly-LacNAc production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggest that the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi is comparatively deficient in UDP-GlcNAc, thereby limiting B3GNT activity and poly-LacNAc extension under steady state conditions.</p><p>As B3GNT requires UDP-GlcNAc to generate poly-LacNAc, we reasoned that these two factors must co-localize to drive homeostatic up-regulation of poly-LacNAc following disruption of branching activity. Co-localization may arise from movement of UDP-GlcNAc transporters to the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi and/or movement of B3GNT to the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi. However, SW treatment did not alter the Golgi localization of the three UDP-GlcNAc transporters or B3GNT2, arguing against this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Alternatively, UDP-GlcNAc may directly shift from the <italic>medial</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> Golgi via the inter-cisternal transport system. Significant loss of activity of <italic>medial</italic> Golgi branching enzymes should acutely raise UDP-GlcNAc levels within the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi, with excess UDP-GlcNAc subsequently moving forward to the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi via inter-cisternal diffusion. Measuring UDP-GlcNAc by LC-MS/MS in a whole cell vesicular fraction isolated from post nuclear supernatant revealed significant levels of UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). To ensure that UDP-GlcNAc was indeed within the vesicles as opposed to merely associated with the outer membrane, the post nuclear supernatant (PNS) was treated with either 0.1% Triton-X or 50 mM uridine monophosphate (UMP) for 15 min prior to isolation of the vesicular fraction by ultra-centrifugation. Both treatments significantly reduced the amount of UDP-GlcNAc in the vesicular fraction, confirming UDP-GlcNAc was located in vesicles containing UDP-GlcNAc/UMP anti-porters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the effects of reduced branching activity in the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi, we compared Jurkat T cells treated with and without kifunensine. Consistent with our hypothesis, UDP-GlcNAc levels were elevated in the vesicular but not the cytosolic fractions of kifunensine treated Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To examine the Golgi directly, we used antibodies to the <italic>trans</italic> marker TGN46 to immuno-isolate a Golgi enriched fraction from Jurkat T cell PNS. As expected from the physical connections between Golgi cisterna, western blotting for <italic>cis, medial,</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> Golgi markers confirmed that all three cisternal compartments were recovered with anti-TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). UDP-GlcNAc was elevated in the Golgi of kifunensine treated Jurkat T cells despite no difference in total cellular or cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A,C</xref>). Finally, we isolated a fraction enriched for <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles from Jurkat T cells by pretreating with Brefeldin A prior to pull down with anti-TGN46. Brefeldin A separates the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network from the rest of the Golgi by fusing the latter with the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Alonso et al., 2013</xref>).

However, this model has recently been expanded by data suggesting that small cargo transits the Golgi by diffusion via inter-cisternal tubules that vertically connect the <italic>cis, medial,</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Alonso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beznoussenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, at least in CHO cells, there is evidence for functional continuity throughout sub-compartments of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). Golgi stacks, consisting of the <italic>cis, medial,</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments, are also connected longitudinally to other Golgi stacks by tubules. Nocodazole, which interrupts longitudinal but not vertical Golgi tubules, had no effect on poly-LacNAc induction by SW in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, pyrrophenone disrupts both longitudinal and inter-cisternal vertical tubules via inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">San Pietro et al., 2009</xref>). Pyrrophenone significantly blocked SW induced up-regulation of poly-LacNAc in Jurkat T cells in a dose dependent manner, as indicated by comparing its effects on LEA and ConA staining; the latter controlling for any changes in Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, pyrrophenone had no effect on ConA, LEA, or L-PHA levels in control Jurkat T cells lacking SW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—supplement figure 1F–H</xref>). We conclude that when branching enzymes under-utilize UDP-GlcNAc in the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi, UDP-GlcNAc accumulates and then shifts by diffusion to the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules, thereby increasing substrate supply to B3GNT and triggering poly-LacNAc extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, our data do not exclude additional transfer of UDP-GlcNAc via vesicles or by cisternal maturation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14814.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of an inherent Golgi self-correcting mechanism to maintain LacNAc homeostasis.</title><p>The majority of UDP-GlcNAc entering the Golgi is supplied to its early compartments by the UDP-GlcNAc/UMP antiporters, which are preferentially localized to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi.

The resulting array of N-glycans produced thus contains more LacNAc branches than linear LacNAc polymers (<bold>A</bold>). When the branching pathway is disrupted (<bold>B</bold>), or presumably the Golgi is otherwise stressed, leading to reduced UDP-GlcNAc usage in the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi, UDP-GlcNAc is driven forward (at least partially through intercisternal tubules) and promotes production of bioequivalent poly-LacNAc containing glycans by the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi-resident B3GNT family of enzymes. Under this scenario, loss of LacNAc branches is balanced by increased production of linear LacNAc polymers, a self-correcting ability that serves to maintain cell surface LacNAc density and thus the galectin-glycoprotein lattice (<bold>A</bold>).

The complexity of glycan structures provides tremendous challenges for discerning the functional role of glycans in biology. Although N-glycan structures are highly diverse, redundancy of structural motifs within individual glycans has previously received little consideration as a means to collapse complexity and decipher glycan information. Deficiency of glycosylation pathway genes often give rise to new and unusual structures, triggering some to suggest that these may represent compensatory structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takamatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ismail et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dam and Brewer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dennis and Brewer, 2013</xref>). However, proof of functional equivalency has largely been lacking. The similar degree of hyperactivity between <italic>Mgat5</italic> and <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient T cells indicates that poly-LacNAc extended hybrid structures are functionally equivalent to complex tri-antennary structures. Importantly, blockade of mannosidase II and <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficiency produced a similar phenotype, which was blocked/reversed by both mannosidase I inhibition and <italic>Mgat1</italic> deficiency, despite each targeting distinct biochemical steps and resulting in distinct structures. Thus, our data demonstrate that structurally diverse glycans are biologically equivalent if they share a similar amount of LacNAc. The overall glycan structure sets the total LacNAc content, thereby largely determining avidity of binding for galectins. It should be noted however, that although these differing glycoforms are clearly overlapping, they might not be strictly identical due to distinct geometries of LacNAc presentation or modification by fucose or sialic acid.</p><p>Our data support a model of N-glycosylation that emphasizes the significance of functional units within an N-glycan, such as LacNAc groups, rather than uniqueness of the overall glycan structure in determining biological function. The National Academy of Sciences position paper on Glycoscience has proposed a major focus on glycan structural determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">National Academy of Sciences, 2012</xref>). Our data suggests that glycan diversity may be collapsed into a much smaller group of bioequivalent structures based on the number of structural subunits within the overall glycan that bind to a given animal lectin. Indeed, it may be possible that through further studies exploring bioequivalence among glycans, a glycan code can be deciphered based on interaction with animal lectins. Such an approach may greatly alleviate the complexity in determining structure-function relationships and relevance to human health.</p><p>Essential biological systems employ homeostatic mechanisms to maintain cellular integrity. N-glycosylation is an essential biosynthetic pathway necessary for cellular homeostasis and mammalian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>), yet lacks a known self-correcting mechanism. Our data suggest that homeostatic control of LacNAc content does not result from changes in enzyme levels/activity or metabolic production of UDP-GlcNAc substrate; but rather appears to arise from the structure of the Golgi. A defining feature of the Golgi is its polarized compartmentalization, with a <italic>cis</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> organization. Glycosylation enzymes are arranged along the Golgi roughly in the order in which they act. Why the Golgi has evolved this organization remains an open question. Our data indicate that the UDP-GlcNAc transporters preferentially supply UDP-GlcNAc to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> over <italic>trans</italic> Golgi, thus prioritizing branching over extension. Despite the presence of continuities between Golgi cisterna and previous work arguing that the Golgi is functionally interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2001</xref>), our data suggest that the segmented organization of enzymes and transporters allows for local depletion of substrate prior to diffusion to other compartments. In this manner, the evolutionary placement of the B3GNT poly-LacNAc extension enzymes in the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi provides a backup mechanism that captures unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi shunted via inter-cisternal tubules. This backup system may also explain the lack of evolutionary pressure to produce genetic redundancy in the Golgi branching enzymes in mammals and the dramatically more severe phenotype seen with <italic>Mgat1</italic> deficiency, which blocks all production of N-glycan LacNAc, compared to other <italic>Mgat</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ioffe and Stanley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metzler et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>The Golgi is charged with maintaining the integrity of the glycome/lattice or risking disease. Thus, fidelity of glycan biosynthesis must be maintained under a variety of cellular states and be active virtually at all times. High protein transit rates present a significant challenge to the Golgi and have the potential to reduce the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi branching efficiency by decreasing the time available for branching reactions. Under this scenario, having a back-up system that provides poly-LacNAc extension in the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi by capturing unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi would be critical for the maintenance of the lattice at a minimal essential level. Even in an unstressed system, a second step in the assembly line would act to counteract the moment to moment variability and stochastic uncertainty of glycan synthesis. Severe branching deficiency (induced by SW treatment or <italic>Mgat2</italic> deletion) uncovers this continual process. Such a mechanism is akin to DNA repair, which is occurring all of the time but made more apparent in the context of physiological or external stress.</p><p>A clear understanding of the network of interacting factors that coalesce to determine the state of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice is required for the successful exploitation of its therapeutic potential. Interventions must be able to overcome or at least take into account the homeostatic cellular response to the initial disturbance. For example, the effectiveness of SW as an anti-cancer therapeutic is likely limited by compensatory poly-LacNAc production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goss et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1997</xref>). Thus, therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the lattice should block branching and extension simultaneously, or target a more proximal regulator such as UDP-GlcNAc metabolism or transport. In light of these considerations, the lattice approach to cancer treatment may merit re-visitation. Conversely, a deeper knowledge of the central regulatory machinery that determines total LacNAc content will also be required for therapeutic approaches that seek to strengthen the lattice.</p><p>The presence of functional groups (LacNAc) as subcomponents of glycans, combined with our current understanding of Golgi transport, may also explain the curious use of three different nucleotides to charge the array of sugars used as substrate donors for glycosylation. These sugar-nucleotides are transported into the Golgi via an anti-port mechanism where cytosolic sugar-nucleotides are exchanged for Golgi nucleotides generated by the action of glycosyltransferase enzymes. Increased availability and use of UDP-GlcNAc in the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi would increase uridine-monophosphate (UMP) levels, thereby driving anti-port of UDP-Galactose into the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi to promote further extension with poly-LacNAc rather than capping by sialic acid. Were sialic acid also charged with UDP rather than cytidine-monophosphate (CMP), UDP-GlcNAc usage in the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi would drive import of UDP-Sialic acid and capping equally with UDP-Galactose and extension.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Galectin-3 binding</title><p>Recombinant mouse galectin-3 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was labeled using an Alexa Fluor 488 protein labeling kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

The lysate was cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation and dialyzed overnight in an identical solution to remove cellular phosphate. Enzyme activity was measured following the instructions of the kit. Briefly, 25 μl of lysate was mixed with 25 μl of reaction mixture to give a final concentration of 6 mM N-acetyllactosamine, 5 mM UDP-GlcNAc, and 6 ng/μl coupling phosphatase. The reaction was allowed to proceed for two hours at 37°C, followed by visualization of released phosphate by a malachite green reagent as indicated in the kit. Absorbance at 620 nm was determined using a plate reader and converted using a phosphate standard run in parallel. Background was determined and subtracted by parallel reactions that lacked the specific acceptor N-acetyllactosamine but contained UDP-GlcNAc and coupling phosphatase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title><p>EAE was induced by subcutaneous immunization of randomly selected female mice at days 0 with 100 μg of bovine MOG35-55 (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) emulsified in Complete Freund’s Adjuvant containing 4 mg/ml heat-inactivated <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (H37RA; Difco). On days 0 and 2, mice received 150 ng of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) by intraperitoneal injection.

Briefly, Jurkat cells were grown in various conditions, washed thoroughly with PBS and pelleted at 50 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per 1.5 ml tube. Cells were lysed by addition of 200 μl of chloroform/water (1:1), vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and 10 μl of 1 N HCl was added to hydrolyze UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc. After heating for 20 min at 80°C, the sample was neutralized with 10 μl 1 N KOH. Next, 50 μl of 200 mM potassium tetraborate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the sample was heated at 80°C for 25 min and then cooled on ice for 5 min. 150 μl of Ehrlich's reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) (diluted 1:2 in acetic acid) was added to the sample, mixed, and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, 200 μl were added to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm.

After normalizing for cell number, cells were pelleted in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes by centrifuging at 350 g for 7 min at 4°C. Metabolites were extracted from the pellets by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold solution of 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, and 20% water. The tubes were vortexed for 1 hr at 4°C and spun down at 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes and evaporated to dryness in an Eppendorf Vacufuge at 30°C (Eppendorf). The dry samples were stored at -80°C until analysis at which point they were reconstituted in 100 μl of LC-MS grade water and centrifuged again at 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were carefully transferred to fresh tubes to be analyzed by mass spectrometry. The instrument used was a Waters Quattro Premier XE LC-MS/MS (Manchester, UK) equipped with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a refrigerated autosampler. The separation was performed on BEH C18 reversed phase column (Waters, Manchester, UK) with a mobile phase A containing LC-MS grade water (JT Baker) modified with 0.2% Acetic Acid, 2% Acetonitrile and 5 mM Ammonium Acetate while mobile B containing LC-MS grade Acetonitrile (JT Baker) modified with 0.2% Acetic Acid and 5 mM ammonium Acetate. The gradient was performed with a 1 min ramp from 2% mobile B to 90%, which was then kept at 90% for 1 more minute and ramped back to 2% for column equilibration. The mass spectrometry measurement was performed in negative mode where the parent ion and fragment ion were measured simultaneously to be used for quantitation of the metabolites. A standard curve was generated using UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma-Aldrich), which was used for the quantitation of the metabolites produced by the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cellular subfractionation and Golgi immunoisolation</title><p>Jurkat cells were grown with or without kifunensine for four days, or until cultures reached a density between 1.5–2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Cells used for Golgi compartment disruption were treated with 1000x Brefeldin A (eBioscience 00-4506-51) for up to 30 min. Cells were washed with HEPES buffered saline (145 mM NaCl, 100 μM HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated in an ice-cold hypotonic solution (30 mM KCl, 3 mM MgOAc, 2 mM DTT, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) for 5 min on ice. The volume of the hypotonic solution used was 2.5 times the volume of the cell pellet. The cell solution was then passed through a 26.5 gauge syringe five times before a 1/10 volume of ice-cold hypertonic solution (375 mM KCl, 22.5 mM MgOAc, 1 mM DTT, 220 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) was added. The solution was centrifuged twice in succession at 1000x g for 5 min each to pellet cells and nuclei. The post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was carefully transferred to a new tube and processed further. Ultracentrifugation of the PNS at 100,000 g for 30 min yielded a vesicular fraction (the pellet) and a cytosolic fraction (the supernatant). For immunoisolation experiments, PNS was incubated with anti-TNG46 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich T7576-200UL) previously conjugated to Protein G Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4°C with tumbling.

Myc-DDK tagged human <italic>SLC35A3</italic> (RC215108), <italic>SLC35B4</italic> (RC203263), and <italic>SLC35D2</italic> (RC218472) cDNA clones were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD) in pCMV6 expression vectors. Cells were transfected with each construct individually (for microscopy) or in combination with mVenus to label transfected cells (for flow cytometry). 10<sup>6</sup> cells were transfected with 4–8 μg of DNA using an Amaxa Nucleofector IIb set to program G-10. Cells were immediately transferred to pre-equilibrated media in 6 well plates and placed in the tissue culture incubator. After 5 hr, media was changed and pharmacological treatments were started. For localization studies, cells were transferred to poly-L-lysine coated chamber slides (Falcon) after 24–48 hr of treatment. Cells were incubated in the chamber slides for 15 min to allow attachment to the slides and then fixed for 1 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Standard immunocytochemical staining was performed. Permeabilization was achieved with 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies used were to GM130 (Clone 35, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), TGN46 (AbD Serotec, Hercules, CA), Mannosidase II (a kind gift from Dr. Christine Suetterlin), HA (ab9110, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and DDK (Clone 4C5, Origene). Slides were stained with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor (AF) 488, 555 and 647 and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific). GM130 and TGN46 were always visualized with AF 488 and 647 respectively, while the protein of interest was visualized with AF 555. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using a Zeiss plan-apochromat 100x oil objective with numerical aperture of 1.4. Localization of the proteins of interest was determined relative to GM130 and TGN46 using a line-scan method essentially identical to a previously published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejgaard et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, 30–50 transfected cells were imaged per experimental condition. Files were coded to blind the analyzer to treatment and protein of interest. Images were imported into the Zeiss Zen software (blue edition) with the AF 555 channel disabled. Line-scans (8–10 pixels wide) were drawn perpendicular to the long axis on areas of the Golgi showing maximal separation of GM130 and TGN46. Line-scans were used if they resulted in a single clearly discernable peak in all three channels. The relative distance of the peak intensity of the protein of interest compared to the peak intensities of GM130 and TGN46 was then used to determine intra-Golgi localization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Immunoblotting was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grigorian et al., 2007</xref>).

With this mechanism, N-glycans are converted from highly branched to single-branched elongated LacNac structures. Both types of structures have high avidity for the secreted protein Galectin-3. This galectin forms a Galectin-glycoprotein lattice at the cell surface that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation of T-cells.</p><p>The paper proposes that upon perturbation of N-glycan branching by either genetic or chemical perturbation, cells react by increasing the amount of elongated LacNac structures through increasing the substrate required for LacNac, UDP-GlcNac, in the trans cisternae of the Golgi. GlcNac is usually present only in cis-medial Golgi, but lack of use by the branching enzymes is proposed to lead to its diffusion to the trans cisternae.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript and the data presented are of high quality and very exhaustive. The question tackled, the regulation of protein glycosylation, is not easy and in need of this type of analysis. The methods used by the authors are varied and cutting-edge, for instance the use of mass spec analysis for glycome analysis.</p><p>In terms of results, the increase in LacNac structures as detected by LEA staining is particularly striking and is reproducible across multiple systems.</p><p>However, I am not convinced by the notion of proof-reading for the following reasons:</p><p>The correction mechanism seems to be kicking in only after an extensive perturbation and is not completely correcting: the loss of Mgat5 or Mgat2 does not lead to compensation of Galectin biding to the wild-type levels. In fact, loss of Mgat5 does not induce any significant increase in LacNac branches. This is at odds with the authors model, since levels of UDP-GlcNac would be expected to increase in trans cisternae. In addition, this result suggests a very sloppy &quot;proof-reading&quot; system.</p><p>The perturbations used by the authors are artificial: genetic depletion of Mgat2 or treatment with swainsonine (SW). It is not clear what kind of naturally occurring problems are being mimicked by these treatments. Proof-reading implies that a system is sensing a defect and reacting to correct it. However, in this case, it is not the state of the lattice that is being sensed (or very mildly as per the authors own admission) but the level of use of sugar precursors (UDP-GlcNac) in the cis/medial Golgi. The compensatory mechanism is relatively indirect: other perturbations in the levels of UDP-GlcNac (for instance a change in the amount of cargo being traffic and glycosylated) would presumably lead to change in glycosylation that are unrelated to the status of the lattice.</p><p>Therefore, while the study is interesting and very well executed, at this stage, it is difficult to ascertain whether the phenomenon observed, the reality of which I do not doubt, is a compensatory mechanism occurring only in experimental conditions or whether it has a real biological function in a physiological context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors present a novel perspective for maintaining glycosylation homeostasis. They argue that &quot;bio-equivalent&quot; structures can substitute for certain functional glycans whose structure has been shown to be critical in determining cancer metastasis and autoimmunity. This lab and others have shown that the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine on the N-glycan branch created by an N-acetyl-Glucosaminyltransferse (GNT-V, encoded by MgatV) is essential for creation of lattices (or aggregate) composed of protein-bound glycans and multivalent lectins called galectins. This was a novel perspective when it was introduced 15 years ago. Evidence favoring it has grown in time and its functionality has been documented in deletion of GNT-V (MgatV) that leads to the loss of poly-N-acetyllactosamine on that branch, loss of galectin binding and dramatic decrease in tumor metastasis and increase in autoimmunity. Normally the lattice appears to prevent the inappropriate activation of the T-cell receptor. With the lattice gone, the TCR is able to recruit other cell surface molecules to mount T-cell response.</p><p>In this paper, the authors ask what would happen if two additional N-glycan branches were removed? Presumably, this would further reduce lectin binding and lattice formation and lead to more severe functional response. This did not occur. Instead they found a compensatory functional response in which the poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats are added to another branch that normally would not contain them. To explain this, they propose a mechanism based on donor substrate localization to account for the compensation and float the hypothesis that generating bioequivalent structures may be a common way to maintain homeostasis in response to imbalances or insults. This is a novel perspective.</p><p>It is known that the terminal sugars of both N and O-linked glycans, especially repeating units, have a preferential site of addition, but it is generally not restricted to a single site.</p><p>In the Abstract, the word &quot;transport&quot; is used to refer to the movement of already transported substrates from the medial to the trans Golgi compartment. It is much more likely that it is simply diffusion from the medial to the trans Golgi. The existence of both vertical and horizontal inter-cisternal tubules has been known for some time. An important, but obscure and often overlooked paper 15 years ago (PMID:12376727) shows seven glycosyltransferases from different Golgi stacks and 3 nucleotide sugar transporters are functionally co-localized in a single continuous compartment that is accessible to any of the transported donors. They are freely diffusible within the Golgi and do not depend on any vesicular transport. This reference was not included, but must be acknowledged.</p><p>I think the authors adapt their results into a rationale for its existence. I hesitate to call it a proofreading mechanism to sustain homeostasis, but a much simpler explanation is that if a donor substrate is not used in a preferred location and it has access to a similar reaction in another accessible location, this is almost an inevitable outcome.</p><p>The study is thorough and very well done, using novel approaches and sophisticated techniques to make their arguments.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors say there are no changes in Lec1 cells, yet it rates &quot;**&quot; significant differences. Need to reconcile those conflicting statements.</p><p>The MALDI results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref> as well as similar ones in the supplemental figures are impossible for a reader to quantitatively assemble and make conclusions. The increased ratio of 0.5 to 1.1 in the presence of SW may be true, but the authors need to show this via color-coding or another way to indicate which peaks are to be in the numerators and denominators. This is especially important when isobaric masses have different structures. It was very confusing.</p><p>The authors need to more precisely indicate which figure corresponds to which statement in the text because they are often confusing when multiple figures are indicated and statement refers to figures with many panels. For instance, the comment about a 3-4 fold increase in UDP-GlcNAc is enhanced SW induced poly-LacNAc extension in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Too much searching needed.</p><p>The statement in the Results section – &quot;This suggests that cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc lacks direct access to the trans Golgi compartment&quot; is not necessarily true. It may have been transported into a different compartment, but based on PMID:12376727, it likely has access to all compartments.</p><p>Likewise suggesting that the trans Golgi is deficient in UDP-GlcNAc, thereby limiting β3GnT activity and poly-LacNAc extension under steady state conditions is not necessarily true because the assumption relies on discreet non-interconnected compartments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors propose &quot;that the cis to trans-Golgi organization permits a self-correcting mechanism that serves to preserve cellular homeostasis by maintaining galectin-glycoprotein interactions.&quot; And that &quot;new poly-LacNAc extension by β3GnT maintains galectin binding and immune homeostasis. Poly-LacNAc extension is triggered by transport of unused UDP-GlcNAc from the medial to trans-Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules.&quot; This hypothesis is novel and the data presented in support of it are of high quality. The following points should be addressed in revision:</p><p>1) Some of the authors of this manuscript have previously published nice evidence of glycan elongation as a compensatory mechanism in glycoproteins from core 2 knockout mice. These and other results on this topic should be clearly described in the Introduction and relevant publications quoted.</p><p>2) The authors emphasize that a large drop in poly-LacNAc occurs in glycoproteins from Mgat2[-/-] compared to Mgat5[-/-] cells. However, based on the MS data, MGAT4 is operational in Mgat2[-/-] cells and thus the drop is merely from 3 to 2 branches. Going from 3 to 2 branches seems to be the threshold that stimulates the synthesis of LEA binding glycans.</p><p>3) The authors use mixed sugar symbols for MS spectra, the pathway diagram and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It is strongly recommended that the symbols used on the MS spectra be used in all figures in the manuscript.</p><p>4) A key question that is not addressed is how much LacNAc is on each branch of N-glycans from WT vs. Mgat2 KO vs. Mgat5 KO T cells? The authors should note why they confined MS experiments to Jurkat cells. Given the large increase in LEA binding to Jurkat cells treated with SW, it is surprising that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and 2F</xref> show a maximum of only 3 LacNAcs on 2 branches, but that peak is extremely small. By far the predominate species with a LacNAc extension has only 1 LacNAc (m/z 3102). This is not poly-LacNAc. The authors should discuss this disconnect.</p><p>5) The evidence that UDP-GlcNAc moves to the Trans Golgi when use in the medial Golgi decreases is largely indirect but reasonable, although many differences are small and there is a reliance on inhibitors that give modest effects and whose specificity is not investigated. The authors should discuss qualifications and potential caveats in the Discussion.</p><p>6) Bioequivalence is a fine concept but should be viewed as one function of surface glycans that is distinct from but complementary with biospecificity. It is not helpful to so dogmatically put all eggs in a bioequivalence basket.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>The galectin-glycoprotein lattice is a dynamic extracellular structure important for receptor localization and function. This paper focuses on quality control of the N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) component, which binds galectin. The hypothesis is that cells employ a homeostatic regulatory mechanism to ensure a suitable level of LacNAc in their extracellular N-glycans. Results presented here suggest that the Golgi has a built-in self-correction mechanism in which a deficiency in synthesis of LacNAc branches by cis/medial-Golgi Mgat enzymes is compensated for by enhanced synthesis of linear poly-LacNAc chains by the β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GnT) enzyme in the trans-Golgi. This compensation is proposed to occur when reduced branching enzyme activity results in elevated levels of the UDP-GlcNAc substrate becoming available in the trans-Golgi for linear poly-LacNAc synthesis.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper have two broad implications. First, it seems that the branched and linear LacNAc components are functionally interchangeable with regard to galectin binding. If so, the &quot;glycan code&quot; may be much less complex than has been assumed. Second, therapeutic approaches that target the galectin-glycoprotein lattice can be made more effective by taking into account functional redundancy in the glycan linkages. Both of these insights could be quite significant, making the paper potentially suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This paper is a dense read but is well written, logical, and rigorously controlled. Although I would defer to other referees for evaluating the immunology, the glycobiology and cell biology aspects strike me as largely persuasive, with the following caveats.</p><p>1) All of the experiments employ artificial manipulations such as gene knockouts and glycosylation inhibitors. Is there any justification for assuming that activity of the Mgat branching enzymes can be perturbed under conditions that prevail in an organism? In other words, is this a physiologically relevant phenomenon? I'm not sure if this question can be answered definitively, but it would be nice to see an explanation of how such a perturbation might occur.</p><p>2) Is it clear that B3GnT is normally limited by the levels of UDP-GlcNAc in the trans-Golgi? If so, why doesn't addition of GlcNAc promote poly-LacNAc formation in the absence of swainsonine? It seems unlikely that all of the excess UDP-GlcNAc generated by GlcNAc addition would be consumed by increased branching, so there should be more UDP-GlcNAc available for B3GnT.</p><p>3) While reading the paper, I wondered from the beginning why sialic acid capping would not block LacNAc extension. This issue was not mentioned until the very end of the Discussion. Is it possible that regulation of poly-LacNAc synthesis occurs at the level of sialic acid capping? If so, an entire dimension may be missing from the story. For example, returning to #2 above, perhaps B3GnT is actually limited not by UDP-ClcNAc levels but rather by sialic acid capping.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14814.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The main insight is bio-equivalence of the different LacNAc structures.

We have also previously debated the relative merits of emphasizing the bio-equivalence versus the proofreading aspects of the story. Given the fresh perspective of the expert panel, we are now also in agreement that the emphasis of the paper should be adjusted to highlight glycan bio-equivalence. We have re-worked the paper to better emphasize bio-equivalence. For example, we have removed the term “proof-reading” from the title and text, and describe this now as self-correction. We have also re-organized the paper to focus on bio-equivalence. Although we think it likely that a proof-reading like mechanism is truly at play, we recognize that the positive data directly supporting this hypothesis are limited. This is due in no small part to the fact that well established tools to analyze and track sugar nucleotides at sub-Golgi resolution currently do not exist. However, we are encouraged by the interest and discussion of our colleagues to pursue the issue further in future work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] Overall, this manuscript and the data presented are of high quality and very exhaustive.

In addition, this result suggests a very sloppy &quot;proof-reading&quot; system.</italic> </p><p>These are great points. At the cell surface, mono- and bi-antennary glycans greatly outnumber tri- and tetra-antennary glycans, particularly in low branching cell types such as T cells. This is also apparent when we consider the relative affinity of the MGAT enzymes for UDP-GlcNAc. MGAT1 has the best affinity with Km ~0.04mM. The affinities decrease sequentially for MGAT2 (~0.9mM), MGAT4 (~4mM) and MGAT5 (~11mM). In other words, relative UDP-GlcNAc usage markedly decreases from MGAT1 to MGAT5. Therefore, according to our model, inhibition or loss of MGAT5 is expected to result in very little increase in UDP-GlcNAc availability to B3GNT2, as enzymes with much greater activity (i.e. MGAT1 and 2) will utilize the excess supply. In comparison, MGAT2 loss or inhibition would be expected to result in a much larger rise in UDP-GlcNAc levels in the trans Golgi. Note that B3GNT has a Km for UDP-GlcNAc that is comparable to MGAT2.</p><p><italic>The perturbations used by the authors are artificial: genetic depletion of Mgat2 or treatment with swainsonine (SW). It is not clear what kind of naturally occurring problems are being mimicked by these treatments.</italic> </p><p>Our thinking is that this is a mechanism that is constantly at work to counter the uncertainty of a loosely directed and “template-less” synthetic process. In contrast, the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein, being template driven is guided by very specific instructions. To use the names of the processes literally, it is as if the assignment is to copy or transcribe or translate (word for word) an assigned text. Predicting the outcome is straightforward given the quality of the template and the competence of “the staff”. Glycan synthesis by comparison is akin to asking many more players to produce a finger painting under a specific rule set (you can only use certain fingers (monosaccarides) in specific orders and patterns). The “instruction” is specified by the enzymatic and chemical restrictions, but the resulting product cannot be predicted with anything near the exactness of template driven processes. In addition, the integrity of the genome is maintained in part by restricting DNA replication to a highly controlled context and defined period of time. Glycan biosynthesis by contrast must function in a variety of cellular states and be active virtually at all times. Nevertheless, the Golgi system is charged with maintaining the integrity of the glycome/lattice or risk disease. Just as you point out, the most obvious/likely situations in which such an assembly-line corrective mechanism might function is in response to changes in protein synthesis, metabolism, and cargo transit rates. It is a reasonable hypothesis that high protein transit rates through the medial Golgi would reduce branching efficiency by decreasing the time available for branching reactions. Under this scenario, having a back-up system that provides poly-LacNAc extension in the trans Golgi by capturing unused UDP-GlcNAc from the medial Golgi would be critical for the maintenance of the lattice at a minimal essential level. Even in an unstressed system, a second step in the assembly line would act to counteract the moment to moment variability and stochastic uncertainty of glycan synthesis. We believe that severe branching deficiency (induced by SW treatment or <italic>Mgat2</italic> deletion) uncovers this continual process which is difficult to appreciate at baseline due to technical limitations. This would be akin to DNA repair mechanisms, which are occurring all of the time but made more apparent in the context of super-physiological stress.</p><p>However, physiological relevance may also arise from environmental factors. For example, swainsonine is a natural compound found in plants (locoweed) and ingestion causes disease in livestock. Given the large number of genes involved in glycan biosynthesis, the number of naturally occurring substances which may interfere with these pathways is likely underappreciated. Corrective mechanisms that can buffer such environmental insults to glycan biosynthesis may play a physiological role in these situations.</p><p><italic>Proof-reading implies that a system is sensing a defect and reacting to correct it. However, in this case, it is not the state of the lattice that is being sensed (or very mildly as per the authors own admission) but the level of use of sugar precursors (UDP-GlcNac) in the cis/medial Golgi. The compensatory mechanism is relatively indirect: other perturbations in the levels of UDP-GlcNac (for instance a change in the amount of cargo being traffic and glycosylated) would presumably lead to change in glycosylation that are unrelated to the status of the lattice.</italic></p><p>We have removed the term “proof-reading” from the text and substituted it with more appropriate terminology such as “self-correction.”</p><p>Proofreading in its exact publishing meaning (we had to look it up) refers to comparing typeset with copy prior to mass production. In this sense it is restricted to situations when two texts are compared and assessed for typesetting errors, and therefore has strict analogy to template driven synthetic processes. We had used the term in its broader current usage, where it further applies to reading for grammar, syntax, spelling, flow, logic, internal consistency etc. (the strict term for which is copy editing). We agree with your assessment that what is being sensed is UDP-GlcNAc concentration, and thus reduced UDP-GlcNAc usage by the prior compartment. We are not suggesting that B3GNT2 is a proofreading enzyme specifically, but rather that the entire glycan biosynthetic system with its directional intra-Golgi organization contains a sequential assembly-line self-correcting capability. This function is important for preserving the galectin-glycoprotein lattice.</p><p><italic>Therefore, while the study is interesting and very well executed, at this stage, it is difficult to ascertain whether the phenomenon observed, the reality of which I do not doubt, is a compensatory mechanism occurring only in experimental conditions or whether it has a real biological function in a physiological context.</italic></p><p>We are excited that others share our interest in these issues.

The following points should be addressed in revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Some of the authors of this manuscript have previously published nice evidence of glycan elongation as a compensatory mechanism in glycoproteins from core 2 knockout mice. These and other results on this topic should be clearly described in the Introduction and relevant publications quoted.</italic></p><p>While some of our authors have published data on unusual structures induced in glycan deficient mice, the possibility that these represent a functional compensation mechanism were largely proposed in reviews by others. Importantly, to our knowledge no one has previously directly proven that the induced structures were bio-equivalent and able to functionally compensate for the loss of other glycans. We now describe this issue in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>2) The authors emphasize that a large drop in poly-LacNAc occurs in glycoproteins from Mgat2[-/-] compared to Mgat5[-/-] cells. However, based on the MS data, MGAT4 is operational in Mgat2[-/-] cells and thus the drop is merely from 3 to 2 branches. Going from 3 to 2 branches seems to be the threshold that stimulates the synthesis of LEA binding glycans.</italic></p><p>These are important points. We state that there is a significant drop in LacNAc branching/content not poly-LacNAc (we assume this is a typo in your comment) between <italic>Mgat5</italic> and <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient cells. Also, as you point out below, the MS data are from SW treated Jurkat cells not <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient cells. Thus, it is possible that MGAT4 is not active in <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient T cells. You are correct that the MGAT4 branch is present in the SW treated Jurkat cells. As noted above in the comments to reviewer 1, MGAT2 has a higher affinity for UDP-GlcNAc than MGAT4. Based on this we would predict that loss of MGAT2 activity or inhibition by SW (despite an operational MGAT4) may result in greater UDP-GlcNAc availability for poly-LacNAc extension than loss of MGAT4/MGAT5, despite both scenarios resulting in a maximum of two branches. In other words, going from 3 to 2 branches by combined loss of MGAT4/MGAT5 may not be equivalent to MGAT2 loss or SW treatment. Our model would suggest that UDP-GlcNAc usage by the branching enzymes rather than the number of branches maximally produced dictates extent of poly-LacNAc compensation. This is a subtle but important distinction.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use mixed sugar symbols for MS spectra, the pathway diagram and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It is strongly recommended that the symbols used on the MS spectra be used in all figures in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>This point is well taken. The discordant symbols have been replaced with a uniform set.</p><p><italic>4) A key question that is not addressed is how much LacNAc is on each branch of N-glycans from WT vs. Mgat2 KO vs. Mgat5 KO T cells? The authors should note why they confined MS experiments to Jurkat cells. Given the large increase in LEA binding to Jurkat cells treated with SW, it is surprising that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and 2F</xref> show a maximum of only 3 LacNAcs on 2 branches, but that peak is extremely small. By far the predominate species with a LacNAc extension has only 1 LacNAc (m/z 3102). This is not poly-LacNAc. The authors should discuss this disconnect.</italic></p><p>These are excellent points. Indeed, the <italic>Mgat2</italic> deficient cells exhibited far greater fold LEA increase (~100 fold) than the Jurkat cells (~20 fold). We therefore made several attempts to perform MS experiments on Mgat2 KO vs. WT T-cells. However, the analyses revealed that we were unable to isolate enough biological material to generate meaningful spectra (we only detected high mannose structures), despite pooling cells from many mice. This was due in part to the fact that we are dealing with a T cell specific knockout, which is inefficiently deleted, and mouse T cells yield relatively low amounts of glycan. We therefore resorted to the SW treated Jurkat cells as a reasonable alternative. As far as the extent to which poly-LacNAc is represented on the spectra, these have to be interpreted cautiously because they are not quantitative, particularly for large poly-LacNAc structures. For that reason we performed the endo-β-galactosidase digestion analysis, which revealed increased poly-LacNAc in the Jurkat sample.</p><p><italic>5) The evidence that UDP-GlcNAc moves to the Trans Golgi when use in the medial Golgi decreases is largely indirect but reasonable, although many differences are small and there is a reliance on inhibitors that give modest effects and whose specificity is not investigated. The authors should discuss qualifications and potential caveats in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>Some of the differences noted are indeed small. We suspect that this is because we are achieving mild relative enrichment of the late Golgi compartments, rather than isolating a pure fraction. This dilutes the true difference. As noted above, we have toned down our discussion on this subject by focusing the paper more on bio-equivalence than proof-reading.</p><p><italic>6) Bioequivalence is a fine concept but should be viewed as one function of surface glycans that is distinct from but complementary with biospecificity. It is not helpful to so dogmatically put all eggs in a bioequivalence basket.</italic></p><p>We agree about bio-specificity; however galectin bio-specificity is for LacNAc, rather than the entire glycan structure. The overall glycan structure sets the total LacNAc content, thereby largely determining avidity of binding without affecting affinity of binding (assuming other modifications that may impact binding such as fucose and sialic acid are held constant). Thus, we are not arguing that there is a change in bio-specificity of galectin-glycan interactions, just a recognition that the number of binding sites in the overall glycan (i.e. LacNAc content) is a major driver of bio-equivalence in a manner that does not affect bio-specificity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] This paper is a dense read but is well written, logical, and rigorously controlled. Although I would defer to other referees for evaluating the immunology, the glycobiology and cell biology aspects strike me as largely persuasive, with the following caveats.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) All of the experiments employ artificial manipulations such as gene knockouts and glycosylation inhibitors. Is there any justification for assuming that activity of the Mgat branching enzymes can be perturbed under conditions that prevail in an organism? In other words, is this a physiologically relevant phenomenon? I'm not sure if this question can be answered definitively, but it would be nice to see an explanation of how such a perturbation might occur.</italic></p><p>Please see above comment to reviewer 1.</p><p><italic>2) Is it clear that B3GnT is normally limited by the levels of UDP-GlcNAc in the trans-Golgi? If so, why doesn't addition of GlcNAc promote poly-LacNAc formation in the absence of swainsonine? It seems unlikely that all of the excess UDP-GlcNAc generated by GlcNAc addition would be consumed by increased branching, so there should be more UDP-GlcNAc available for B3GnT.</italic></p><p>GlcNAc treatment markedly increases total cellular UDP-GlcNAc and branching without substantial changes in LEA binding in the absence of swainsonine. Coupled with our data indicating that UDP-GlcNAc transporters are absent from the trans Golgi, we interpret this to mean that excess UDP-GlcNAc generated by GlcNAc addition is indeed consumed by the medial Golgi branching enzymes. In the presence of SW, GlcNAc treatment does substantially increase LEA binding, implying that UDP-GlcNAc is limiting for poly-LacNAc production but only becomes available to B3GNT when the branching enzymes are inhibited. It should be noted that an increase in total cellular UDP-GlcNAc may not necessarily result in one for one increase in Golgi UDP-GlcNAc. The apparent Km of the transporters is measured at 1-10 uM, which is lower than the cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc concentration. Therefore it is likely that increased cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc levels are not fully translated to the Golgi levels.</p><p><italic>3) While reading the paper, I wondered from the beginning why sialic acid capping would not block LacNAc extension. This issue was not mentioned until the very end of the Discussion. Is it possible that regulation of poly-LacNAc synthesis occurs at the level of sialic acid capping? If so, an entire dimension may be missing from the story. For example, returning to #2 above, perhaps B3GnT is actually limited not by UDP-ClcNAc levels but rather by sialic acid capping.</italic> </p><p>Another excellent point. Sialic acid capping could be limiting poly-LacNAc length. However, we did not see significant changes in sialyltransferase transcript levels in our microarray experiment. Moreover, in our mass spec data there appears to be more sialylation of the poly-LacNAc antennae in the Swainsonine treated sample (compare m/z 722 and 1084 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>), arguing against reduced sialic acid capping activity resulting from SW treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
