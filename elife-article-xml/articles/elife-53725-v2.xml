critically dependent on the transcription factor c-Myc (Myc). Herein we use quantitative mass-spectrometry to reveal how Myc controls antigen receptor driven cell growth and proteome restructuring in murine T cells. Analysis of copy numbers per cell of &gt;7000 proteins provides new understanding of the selective role of Myc in controlling the protein machinery that govern T cell fate. The data identify both Myc dependent and independent metabolic processes in immune activated T cells. We uncover that a primary function of Myc is to control expression of multiple amino acid transporters and that loss of a single Myc-controlled amino acid transporter effectively phenocopies the impact of Myc deletion. This study provides a comprehensive map of how Myc selectively shapes T cell phenotypes, revealing that Myc induction of amino acid transport is pivotal for subsequent bioenergetic and biosynthetic programs and licences T cell receptor driven proteome reprogramming.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>T cells are white blood cells that form an important part of our immune defence, acting to attack disease-causing microbes and cancer and directing other immune cells to help in this fight. T cells spend most of their time in a resting state, small and inactive, but when an infection strikes, they transform into large, active 'effector' cells. This change involves a dramatic increase in protein production, accompanied by high energy demands. To fully activate, T cells need to boost their metabolism and take in extra amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. For this, they depend upon a protein called Myc.</p><p>The Myc protein works as a genetic switch, controlling several kinds of cell metabolism, but the molecular details of its effects in T cells remain unclear. Most studies looking to understand Myc have focussed on its role in cancer cells. Here its main job is thought to be driving the use of sugar to make energy. However, it has also been shown to control the levels of transporters that carry amino acids into cells and thus provide the raw materials for protein production. It is possible that Myc plays a similar role in T cells as it does in cancer cells, but this might not be the case because cancer cells have strange biology and do not always accurately represent healthy cells.</p><p>To find out what role Myc plays in T cell activation, Marchingo et al. compared T cells with and without Myc. The cells lacking Myc were much smaller than their normal counterparts and counts of their proteins revealed why. Without Myc, protein production had stalled. In normal T cells, the number of amino acid transporters increased up to 100 times as cells transformed from a resting to an active state. But, without Myc, this did not happen. The loss of Myc cut off the supply of amino acids, halting protein production. For T cells, the most important amino acid transporter is a protein called System-L transporter Slc7a5. It supplies several essential amino acids, including methionine – the amino acid that starts every single protein. To confirm the role of amino acid transporters in T cell activation, Marchingo et al. deleted the gene for the System-L transporter Slc7a5 directly. This had the same effect as deleting the gene for Myc itself, demonstrating that a key role of Myc in T cell activation is to increase the number of amino acid transporters.</p><p>Understanding the role of Myc in T cell activation is an important step towards controlling the immune system. At the moment, many research groups are investigating how best to use T cells to fight diseases like cancer. Further analysis of the link between Myc and amino acid transporters could in the future aid the design of such immunotherapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>T cell activation</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>Myc</kwd><kwd>amino acid transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097418/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205023/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202950/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1543-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchingo</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>705984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchingo</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myc-dependent induction of amino acid transporter expression in response to T cell receptor activation is essential to enable T cell proteome remodelling upon immune activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune activation transcriptionally reprograms T lymphocytes and initiates changes in cell metabolism and protein synthesis that are required for proliferation and effector differentiation.</p><p>The signalling pathways that control T cell metabolism are not fully characterised but it has been shown that the transcription factor Myc has a necessary role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In T cells, Myc is rapidly induced in response to engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and Myc expression is then sustained by costimulatory receptors and cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au-Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heinzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Preston et al., 2015</xref>). The TCR acts as a digital switch for <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA expression, in that the strength of the antigen stimulus determines the frequency of T cells that switch on <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Preston et al., 2015</xref>). Antigen receptor, costimulation and cytokine driven processes also post-transcriptionally control Myc protein: constant phosphorylation on Thr58 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and subsequent proteasomal degradation results in a short cellular half-life of Myc protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Preston et al., 2015</xref>). O-GlcNAcylation of Myc at this same residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chou et al., 1995</xref>), fuelled by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, blocks this degradation and allows Myc to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>). In activated lymphocytes the sustained expression of Myc is also dependent on the rate of protein synthesis and availability of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Verbist et al., 2016</xref>). Myc expression is thus tightly controlled at the population and single cell level during immune responses.</p><p>The expression of Myc is essential for T cell immune responses and mature T cells with <italic>Myc</italic> alleles deleted cannot respond to antigen receptor engagement to proliferate and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Preston et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trumpp et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Myc-deficient T cells have defects in glucose and glutamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>); however, the full molecular details of how Myc regulates T cell metabolic pathways and other aspects of T cell function is not fully understood. In this context there are different models of how Myc works and divergent opinions as to whether or not Myc acts a general amplifier of active gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nie et al., 2012</xref>) or has more selective actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tesi et al., 2019</xref>). There is also evidence Myc can act post transcriptionally, controlling mRNA cap methylation and broadly enhancing mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cowling and Cole, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruggero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). The salient point is that there appear to be no universal models of Myc action that can be applied to all cell lineages. As an example, it is reported that oncogenic Myc mutants control amino acid transporter expression in tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yue et al., 2017</xref>) whereas analysis of endogenous Myc function in immune activated primary B cells found no such role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tesi et al., 2019</xref>). These discepancies highlight the neccessity for direct experimental analysis to understand how Myc controls T lymphocyte function rather than simply being able to extrapolate from other cell models. In this context, T lymphocytes are critical cells of the adaptive immune response and understanding the signalling checkpoints that control T cell function is fundamental for any strategy to manipulate T cell function for immunotherapy or immunosuppression.</p><p>T cell immune activation is associated with increases in mRNA translation, amino acid transport and protein synthesis all of which shape the execution of the T cell transcriptional program and completely reshape the T cell proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geiger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Howden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, one way to gain a full and unbiased understanding of how Myc controls T cell metabolism and T cell function is an in-depth analysis of how Myc shapes T cell proteomes. Accordingly, we have used high-resolution mass-spectrometry to perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of Myc deficiency on the proteomes of immune activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These data reveal a selectivity of Myc action in co-ordinating T cell proteomes and identify both Myc dependent and Myc independent remodelling of T cell metabolic programs. The data uncover that a primary function of Myc in T lymphocytes is control of amino acid transporter expression which affords new insight about how Myc controls T cell biosynthetic and bioenergetic programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective remodelling of T cell proteomes by Myc</title><p>To explore how Myc controls T cell function we used a Cd4<italic>Cre<sup>+</sup>Myc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (Myc<sup>cKO</sup>) mouse model in which <italic>Myc</italic> is conditionally deleted during late thymic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mycko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trumpp et al., 2001</xref>).

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> show that in contrast to Myc T cells, CD3/CD28 activated Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells fail to increase protein content above the level of naive ex vivo isolated Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cells. Hence, the increase in cell biomass that accompanies T cell activation is dependent on Myc. Notably, the protein content of immune activated Myc<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was lower than activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and this correlates with higher levels of Myc in immune activated CD8<sup>+</sup> versus CD4<sup>+</sup> Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).</p><p>The immune activation of T cells is accompanied by complex proteome remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geiger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Howden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ron-Harel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). A key question is whether the dramatically lower cell mass in CD3/CD28 activated Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells reflects a scaled decrease in expression of all proteins or a selective loss of protein expression. In this respect a few hundred very abundant proteins are known to account for most cellular mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Howden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ly et al., 2014</xref>), with 75% of the protein mass of immune activated Myc<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells comprising 344 and 391 proteins respectively. Myc-deficiency reduced the expression of most, but not all of these abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). To assess the selectivity of Myc control of T cell proteomes we used nearest neighbour analysis and Pearson correlation to group and align the expression profile of ~6400 proteins in naïve and immune activated Myc<sup>WT</sup> and Myc<sup>cKO</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These analyses highlight how CD3/CD28 stimulation dynamically reshapes the proteomic landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The impact of Myc loss is striking but clearly selective and not a simple scaled decrease in expression of all proteins. There are a number of proteins expressed at high levels in naïve cells and downregulated by immune activation in both Myc<sup>WT</sup> and Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), including Kruppel family transcription factors which maintain pluripotency and cell quiescence (eg Klf2) and growth factors receptors such as the IL7 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). There is also a subset of ~300–450 proteins that are strongly induced by immune activation irrespective of Myc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These include CD69, CD44 and transcription factors cRel and JunB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–M</xref>). The critical transcription factors T-bet and Irf4 were also upregulated in immune Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells, albeit at reduced levels compared with Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–O</xref>).</p><p>The selective effects of Myc-deficiency on protein expression in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells appeared qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). There were however some quantitative differences. These differences reflect that some proteins were more highly expressed in activated Myc<sup>WT</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than in Myc<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, however, Myc-deficiency reduced protein expression down to a similar level in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, therefore giving a larger effect size in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When taken in conjunction with the observation that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed a higher level of Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), associated with increased cell biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), this suggests a dose-dependent Myc-driven amplification of protein expression.</p><p>Collectively, these data show that immune activated T cell proteome remodelling comprises both Myc dependent and independent processes and that Myc has a qualitatively similar, but dose-dependent effect on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proteomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selective remodelling of T cell metabolic pathways by Myc</title><p>When examining the selective effects of Myc-deficiency on T cell immune activation we observed that Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells increased expression of the glucose transporters Slc2a1 and Slc2a3 (Glut1 and Glut3 respectively) equal to, or exceeding the level seen in Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cells in response to T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The ability of immune activated Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells to upregulate expression of Slc2a1 and Slc2a3 glucose transporters was unexpected as it has been reported that Myc-deficient T cells have abnormal glycolytic metabolism and defective induction of glucose transporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Slc2a1</italic> has been implicated as a direct transcriptional target of Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Osthus et al., 2000</xref>). In this context, CD3/CD28 triggering increases expression of glycolytic enzymes in both Myc<sup>WT</sup> and Myc<sup>cKO</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Although the cumulative levels of glycolytic enzymes in Myc<sup>cKO</sup> are reduced by 58% and 30% in CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells respectively compared with Myc<sup>WT</sup> controls, they still comprise a large percentage of the proteomes of immune activated Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). It was however striking that Myc had a large impact on lactate transporter expression, particularly on the numerically dominant lactate transporter Slc16a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Lactate transporters control a critical rate limiting step for glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanner et al., 2018</xref>). Their absence would prevent lactate export and feedback to suppress glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>). Slc16a1 expression increases from &lt;10,000 copies per naïve T cell to ~140,000 and~80,000 copies per immune activated CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cell respectively. In contrast, Slc16a1 expression in immune activated Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells remains equivalent to naive levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The present data reveal the selectivity of the Myc requirement for expression of important enzymes for glutamine metabolism. Myc controls expression of glutaminase (Gls), Cad and Ppat, the enzymes that control the first steps in glutaminolysis, and pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis respectively. However, expression of Gfpt1, the first and rate limiting step in the hexosamine pathway and Glud1, the enzyme that converts glutamate to a-ketoglutarate are still expressed in Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Myc controls amino acid transporter expression in immune activated T cells</title><p>One major effect of Myc loss on immune activated T cells is failure to increase cell mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref> shows that Myc loss does not prevent loss of the translational repressor Pdcd4 in activated T cells. Myc-deficiency did however suppress CD3/CD28 mediated increases in expression of ribosomes, eukaryotic initiation factor 4 (eIF4F) complexes that translate methyl capped mRNAs and EIF2 complexes which controls tRNA transfer to ribosomes. Although increasing expression of translational machinery is important, an absolutely fundamental requirement for a substantial increase in cell mass is availability of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hosios et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is striking that the loss of Myc prevents the upregulation of expression of multiple amino acid transporters in activated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). The most abundant amino acid transporters expressed on CD3/CD28 activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are Slc7a5 (leucine, methionine, tryptophan), Slc1a5 (glutamine, serine, threonine, alanine), Slc38a1 and Slc38a2 (glutamine, methionine) and Slc7a1(arginine, lysine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We focused on the system L transporter Slc7a5, as this is the most abundant amino acid transporter expressed on immune activated T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and mediates transport of many essential amino acids including methionine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine and tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sinclair et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sinclair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>). Low basal levels of Slc7a5 in naïve T cells mediate amino acid uptake that is not dependent on Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

These data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) show that Slc7a5 is not required for the immediate and rapid upregulation of Myc expression that accompanies T cell activation but is required for activated T cells to sustain Myc protein.</p><p>The finding that Slc7a5<sup>cKO</sup> T cells can induce Myc expression is also surprising in the context of previous work demonstrating an important role for mTORC1 activation (which is critically dependent on uptake of leucine) in controlling Myc expression during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we tested the dependency of Myc protein expression on mTORC1 signalling in our T cell system. The data show that rapamycin treatment had very little impact on expression of Myc protein after 4 hr of T cell activation but did reduce Myc expression after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with the results seen in Slc7a5<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Although Slc7a5 deficiency or mTORC1 inhibition alone was insufficient to prevent Myc induction, the presence of external amino acids is necessary for expression of Myc protein, with T cells activated in amino acid-free media being unable to express Myc protein despite increasing the activation marker CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Deficiency of a single amino acid from the media, such as glutamine, methionine or leucine leads to a reduction in Myc levels but does not prevent its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Myc driven increase in amino acid transport thus triggers a positive feedforward loop supporting its own continued expression which in turn drives and sustains further increases in amino acid transport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has mapped the impact of Myc deletion on antigen driven proteome remodelling of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to understand how Myc controls T cell activation and metabolic reprogramming. The study uncovers both Myc dependent and independent restructuring of the T cell proteome during immune activation. Myc was required for the increase in expression of important metabolic pathway proteins; for example, glutamine transporters and glutaminase, key proteins controlling the first steps of glutaminolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Newsholme et al., 1985</xref>); and lactate transporters, a major rate determining step for glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanner et al., 2018</xref>). However, the current data also show that expression of many key metabolic enzymes for both glutaminolysis and glycolysis can still occur in immune activated Myc null T cells. In particular, in the context of glucose metabolism an unexpected observation was that Myc was not required for protein expression of the glucose transporters Slc2a1 and Slc2a3 in activated T cells. This was surprising, given previous observations that Myc deletion reduced <italic>Slc2a1</italic> and <italic>Slc2a3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) and highlights the value of a proteomics approach to quantify the expression patterns of proteins where there may be a disconnect between mRNA and protein expression due to translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>). The expression of both glucose and lactate transporters are key for glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanner et al., 2018</xref>) and the fact that these are differentially controlled by Myc reveals that upregulation of metabolic pathways during T cell activation is more complex than a simple activation switch or amplifier mediated by a single transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nie et al., 2012</xref>). The data gives molecular insight into why Myc is so important for T cell glutamine metabolism and glycolysis but they also reveal that T cell metabolic reprogramming requires the coordination of Myc expression with other signalling pathways. In this respect we have shown recently that activation of mTORc1 is not required for Myc expression in activated T cell but does have a substantive effect on the expression of glucose transporter protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Howden et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One key conclusion from the present data is that a primary function of Myc is to control expression of the amino acid transporters, inducing a positive feedforward loop to sustain Myc levels in activated T cells. A salient point is that Myc was only necessary for immune activation associated increases in amino acid transporter expression. The absence of Myc did not impinge on the low basal levels of amino acid transport through the system L transporter seen in naïve T cells and it was clear from the proteomic data that Myc null T cells still had some capacity to increase expression of key proteins. The inability of Myc null T cells to increase amino acid transport aligns with previous metabolomic data that Myc null cells have decreased levels of intracellular amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The loss of amino acid transporter induction in Myc null T cells would also prevent the increases in expression of the protein biosynthetic machinery as well as preventing uptake of the raw material required to synthesise protein. The importance of Myc induction of amino acid transporters for T cell activation is particularly highlighted by the large effect of deleting just one of the Myc controlled amino acid transporters, Slc7a5, on the T cell proteome, which almost phenocopies the effects of Myc deletion itself. The impact of the loss of a single Myc controlled amino acid transporter was remarkable and reflects that Slc7a5 transports multiple large neutral amino acids including Leucine, Phenylalanine and Tryptophan. Myc control of Slc7a5 expression would be particularly important for protein synthesis as Slc7a5 is also the major T cell transporter for Methionine, the predominant ‘start’ amino acid used to initiate polypeptide synthesis during mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sinclair et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>). These data highlight how Myc control of even one amino acid transporter, Slc7a5, would have indirect consequences for the expression of thousands of proteins in immune activated T cells and could underpin the ability of Myc to regulate multiple biosynthetic, bioenergetic and epigenetic processes in T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

For the protein and peptide searches we generated a hybrid database from databases in Uniprot release 2019 07. This consisted of all manually annotated mouse SwissProt entries, combined with mouse TrEMBL entries with protein level evidence available and a manually annotated homologue within the human SwissProt database. The following MaxQuant search parameters were used: protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, glutamine to pyroglutamate, and glutamine and asparagine deamidation were set as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed modification; Trypsin and LysC were selected as the enzymes with up to two missed cleavages permitted; the protein and PSM false discovery rate was set to 1%; matching of peptides between runs was switched off. Data filtering and protein copy number quantification was performed in the Perseus software package, version 1.6.6.0. Proteins were quantified from unique peptides and razor peptides (peptides assigned to a group, but not unique to that group). Quantification quality was categorized based on the following: quantification was considered high accuracy if proteins had eight or more unique and razor peptides assigned and at least 75% of these peptides were unique; proteins were considered medium accuracy if they were assigned at least three unique and razor peptides with 50% of these being unique; proteins below these thresholds were considered low accuracy. The data set was filtered to remove proteins categorised as ‘contaminants’, ‘reverse’ and ‘only identified by site’. Mean copy number per cell was calculated using the “proteomic ruler’ plugin as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wiśniewski et al. (2014)</xref>. Briefly, this method sets the summed peptide intensities of the histones to the number of histones in a diploid mouse cell then uses the ratio between the histone peptide intensity and summed peptide intensities of other identified proteins to estimate the protein copy number per cell for all the identified proteins.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ellen A Robey as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeroen P Roose (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Marchingo et al., presents several important findings. The authors compared the proteomes of control and Myc deficient T cells to investigate how Myc controls early T cell activation events. They identified a role for Myc in selectively modulating the expression of various T cell activation and metabolic pathways. The authors identify Myc dependent upregulation of amino acid transporters such as Slc7a5 as a key checkpoint controlling T cell growth. In contrast to earlier work by the same group showing that protein expression of Myc is dependent on Slc7a5 expression, the authors demonstrate that early Myc upregulation is Slc7a5 independent and likely contributes to feedforward maintenance of amino acid transport.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main question the authors addressed is how Myc controls antigen receptor driven cell growth. However, 24 hours of activation also induces IL-2/IL-2R signaling. The authors should comment on the contribution of IL-2/IL-2R signaling to the results they observe, particularly as IL-2 signaling in control T cells are likely to amplify Myc dependent proteome restructuring. This could also be put into context with earlier work by the same group showing that both antigen and IL2 can regulate amino acid transport.</p><p>2) The authors use several different stimulation conditions – anti-CD3/28 at 0.5µg/mL or 3µg/mL or OVA peptide at 10ng/mL (+ hIL-2 in the case of Slc7a5 KO T cells) for their proteome analyses. Could the authors provide some information that these different conditions are roughly equivalent in terms of the proteins/pathways they engage?</p><p>3) The authors compared the proteomes of control and Myc KO in both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Are there any differences in how Myc selectively regulates protein expression in CD4 versus CD8 T cells?</p><p>4) The authors demonstrate strong overlap of Myc KO and Slc7a5 KO proteomes; what are their differences?</p><p>5) The finding that early Myc expression is Slc7a5 independent is interesting and correlates nicely with induction of Myc occurring prior to Slc7a5. Is early Myc expression dependent on amino acid uptake to any extent? For example, would activating T cells in the absence of key amino acids impair early Myc upregulation?</p><p>6) Figure 1H to 1O should have statistical analysis. The same holds for the bar graphs in the other figures.</p><p>7) In Figure 2, the authors explore glycolytic metabolism and glutamine catabolism. This is important because other work has made links between Myc and these processes. It would be valuable to include some functional assays here. For example, are Myc KO cells more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of these processes?</p><p>8) It would be valuable to have a more extensive time course of the data in Figure 3E, as this would nicely connect to the panels presented in Figure 4.</p><p>9) It would be informative for the reader to connect the data presented in Figure 4D to their other studies. There is some text in the Discussion section on mTOR but an experiment would help here. Is the initial induction of Myc independent of mTOR and independent of Slc7a5? Is the sustained induction of Myc independent of mTOR but dependent of Slc7a5? Or not? Either outcome is fine but seeing data with an mTOR inhibitor in Figure 4D would be informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53725.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main question the authors addressed is how Myc controls antigen receptor driven cell growth.

This could also be put into context with earlier work by the same group showing that both antigen and IL2 can regulate amino acid transport.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question as autocrine signalling by IL-2 is important for T cells.</p><p>In this context, under the conditions that we use in the present study, the impact of autocrine secreted IL-2 in the cultures is relatively minimal at 24 hours. This conclusion is based on experiments where we have looked at the effect of blocking IL-2 with the anti-IL-2ra antibody clone PC61. Our results indicate that blocking IL-2 signalling has minimal impact on Myc expression, CD71 expression (a downstream target of Myc), CD98 expression (the heavy chain of the System L amino acid transporters) or cell size at a 24 hour time point after TCR stimulation but has very strong effects at a 48 hour time point. It is also relevant that Myc null T cells make IL-2 in response to TCR activation (Wang, R et al., 2011, supp Figure 4) as do Slc7a5 null T cells (Sinclair, LV, 2013, Figure 6). As such, we think that any effects of IL-2/IL2R signalling on Myc driven proteome remodelling are negligible in the current study. They would be highly relevant if we looked at any later time points.</p><p>We have modified the text to reflect this in subsection “Selective remodelling of T cell proteomes by Myc”</p><p>“To examine how Myc loss impacts proteome remodelling during immune activation we performed quantitative label-free high-resolution mass spectrometry on 24 hour CD3/CD28 activated wild-type (CD4cre<sup>+</sup>, Myc<sup>WT</sup>) and Myc<sup>cKO</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This time point was chosen as it is when we observe maximal increase in cell size of the immune activated cells with no difference in survival between Myc<sup>WT</sup> and Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells. Moreover, at this time point there is minimal impact of autocrine secreted cytokine IL-2 on Myc expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use several different stimulation conditions – anti-CD3/28 at 0.5µg/mL or 3µg/mL or OVA peptide at 10ng/mL (+ hIL-2 in the case of Slc7a5 KO T cells) for their proteome analyses. Could the authors provide some information that these different conditions are roughly equivalent in terms of the proteins/pathways they engage?</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience these stimuli have broadly similar effects when one is looking at cells activated at a 24 time point. Where they do differ is in the kinetics of the response they induce; if one was looking at early time points then it is well established that the signal strength will drive 'digitality' in T cell responses. However, we find that by the time one gets to a 24 hour time point, the cells have all responded and are very similar in terms of expression of the key transcription factors, cytokine receptors and the key proteins for T cell metabolism etc. It is a very intriguing question (beyond the scope of the present study) as to whether the signalling pathways used by CD3/CD28 antibodies versus peptides are all the same? We know that in the mouse when one uses aCD3 (2C11) and aCD28 (37.51) or peptide MHC complexes then these signals all converge on Myc. We have also compared how inhibition of mTORC1, ERK signalling, PI3K signalling, Protein Kinase D signalling impact on T cells activated with CD3/CD28 antibodies versus peptide and to date have found minimal differences. We would stress that we would only be certain about this point with mouse T cells and the different conditions used in the current study. Many years ago, using human T cells and antibodies to human receptors, the Cantrell group showed that different CD28 antibodies could differentially activate Ras or PI3K. Furthermore, some antibodies against human CD3 antigens are excellent activators of PI3K (UCHT1), some are not (OKT3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors compared the proteomes of control and Myc KO in both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Are there any differences in how Myc selectively regulates protein expression in CD4 versus CD8 T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We had not directly addressed this question in our original manuscript and our answer is that Myc has a qualitatively similar effect on CD4 and CD8 T cell proteome remodelling. However, there are quantitative differences in the effects of Myc which reflect that the antigen receptor and Myc driven biomass expansion is larger in CD8 than in CD4s i.e. the higher they rise the further they fall.</p><p>To illustrate and discuss this aspect of the data we have created an additional supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and added the following text to subsection “Selective remodelling of T cell proteomes by Myc”:</p><p>“The selective effects of Myc-deficiency on protein expression in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells appeared qualitatively similar (Figure 1G). There were however some quantitative differences. These differences reflect that some proteins were more highly expressed in activated Myc<sup>WT</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than in Myc<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, however, Myc-deficiency reduced protein expression down to a similar level in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, therefore giving a larger effect size in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). When taken in conjunction with the observation that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed a higher level of Myc (Figure 1C-D), associated with increased cell biomass (Figure 1A-B), this suggests a dose-dependent Myc-driven amplification of protein expression.</p><p>Collectively, these data show that immune activated T cell proteome remodelling comprises both Myc dependent and independent processes and that Myc has a qualitatively similar, but dose-dependent effect on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proteomes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors demonstrate strong overlap of Myc KO and Slc7a5 KO proteomes; what are their differences?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question and one that we had not dealt with in the original manuscript due to fear of making the paper too unfocused. It is perhaps pertinent to say that we were actually amazed at the major impact that losing a single amino transporter had on the proteome of activated T cells. The answer is that there are some differences in between Slc7a5 null T cells and Myc null T cells; Slc7a5 null T cells have zero System L transport capacity whereas the Myc null T cells have low basal System L transport capacity in naive cells but fail to upregulate amino acid transport in response to immune stimulation.</p><p>To discuss this, we have modified the manuscript and included examples of where protein expression differs between Myc KO and Slc7a5 KO T cells, including proteomics data of the glucose transporter Slc2a3, and flow cytometry data for IFNgamma and Granzyme B. The following text has been added to subsection “Myc controls amino acid transporter expression in immune activated T cells”:</p><p>“Although there is a large degree of overlap in the proteomics data, Slc7a5-deficiency does not completely phenocopy the effects of Myc-deficiency. Induction of proteins such as the glucose transporter Slc2a3 (Figure 2B, Figure 3—figure supplement 4C) and effector molecules like Granzyme B and IFNγ (Figure 3—figure supplement 4D-E) exhibit a more severe defect in Slc7a5<sup>cKO</sup> T cells. This is likely due to the lack of basal-level amino acid transport in naïve Slc7a5<sup>cKO</sup> T cells which is not deficient in naïve Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (Figure 3C).”</p><p>Note all the proteomics data in this paper will be freely available for others to explore and make comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The finding that early Myc expression is Slc7a5 independent is interesting and correlates nicely with induction of Myc occurring prior to Slc7a5. Is early Myc expression dependent on amino acid uptake to any extent? For example, would activating T cells in the absence of key amino acids impair early Myc upregulation?</p></disp-quote><p>This question is very interesting, so we performed more experiments and have now included additional data that addresses this question. New panels in Figure 4F and G show the impact of withdrawal of all amino acids or the individual amino acids Glutamine, Methionine and Leucine on TCR induction of Myc expression. The key result is that, yes, the induction of Myc does require exogenous amino acids. It’s a bit convoluted; completely amino acid free media cannot support Myc induction (Figure 4F) however, deficiency of a single amino acid from the media, such as glutamine, methionine or leucine, leads to a reduction in Myc levels but does not prevent its expression (Figure 4G).</p><p>We have added new figures and additions to the main text and methods to describe and comment upon these data (see subsection “Myc induction of amino acid transport initiates a positive feedforward loop”).</p><p>“Although Slc7a5 deficiency or mTORC1 inhibition alone was insufficient to prevent Myc induction, the presence of external amino acids is necessary for expression of Myc protein, with T cells activated in amino acid-free media being unable to express Myc protein despite increasing the activation marker CD69 (Figure 4F). Deficiency of a single amino acid from the media, such as glutamine, methionine or leucine leads to a reduction in Myc levels but does not prevent its expression (Figure 4G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1H to 1O should have statistical analysis. The same holds for the bar graphs in the other figures.</p></disp-quote><p>In all bar graphs of proteomics data, we plot data from each biological replicate. We have not placed lines/stars indicating statistical tests above the figures as we feel this unnecessarily clutters the figure with a large number of comparisons where the differences that we highlight in the main text are visually quite clear. However, the supplementary table does contain p values and fold-changes for all proteins, including statistical testing from comparisons made within the main text under the worksheet tab “fold-change and t test”. Note, since the data were log-transformed fold-changes/p-values for proteins where multiple copy numbers for a given condition were = 0 was not possible. We have now highlighted the availability of results from statistical testing in the figure legends for anyone wishing to look up this information for a particular comparison/protein by including the statement…</p><p>“Fold-change calculations and statistical testing comparing naïve WT vs TCR Myc<sup>WT</sup>, naïve WT vs TCR Myc<sup>cKO</sup>, and TCR Myc<sup>WT</sup> vs TCR Myc<sup>cKO</sup> protein copy number per cell is listed in Supplementary file 1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 2, the authors explore glycolytic metabolism and glutamine catabolism. This is important because other work has made links between Myc and these processes. It would be valuable to include some functional assays here. For example, are Myc KO cells more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of these processes?</p></disp-quote><p>With regard to experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, we could not think of specific tools. Many people use tools to target respiratory chain complexes or target glycolysis, however these usually activate AMPK and inhibit mTORC1 thus making it hard to interpret experiments. Moreover, the metabolism of Myc null T cells is already so compromised and we were not able to generate a specific hypothesis for an experiment that would give us new insight into T cell metabolic pathway regulation in these cells.</p><p>What we did discuss, but possibly with insufficient emphasis, is that Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2011) have used both label free and targeted (tracing) metabolomics to show that Myc null T cells have defective flux through glycolysis and glutaminolysis. We have also shown that Myc null cells have defective o-GlcNACylation (Swamy et al., 2016). The new insight from the current study is protein-level information about why Myc cells may have these defects.</p><p>Furthermore, we have interrogated the proteomics data to determine key protein expression of other metabolic pathways in T cells, eg branched chain amino acid metabolism and methionine metabolism (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Protein expression levels of these pathways is a valuable addition to our understanding of what other metabolic pathways might play a role in T cell activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be valuable to have a more extensive time course of the data in Figure 3E, as this would nicely connect to the panels presented in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we did not do a matched System transport assay in parallel with the proteomics data shown in Figure 4. However, the key question being asked by the reviewer seems to be if amino acid transport activity correlates with transporter numbers. We now present System L transport data from later time points (6 hours and 24 hours) which are covered by the proteomics experiment in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. These data show that System L transport increases substantially between 6 hours and 24 hours after TCR activation in Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cells compared to naïve (IL7 maintained cells) but fails to do so in Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells. The proteomics data show a clear increase in Slc7a5 protein expression from a basal level in naïve cells, at 6 hours and further increased at 24 hours in Figure 4B. Moreover, activated CD4 T cells have lower Slc7a5 copy numbers than activated CD8 cells and corresponding differences in System L transport. Collectively this gives us confidence that the only thing that limits transport is transporter numbers.</p><p>We have added the following text to subsection “Myc controls amino acid transporter expression in immune activated T cells”:</p><p>“There was also a strong correlation between the levels of Myc protein expressed by activated T cells and system L amino acid transport capacity (Figure 3F) and while system L transport continued to increase over the first 24 hours of T cell activation in Myc<sup>WT</sup> T cells this did not occur in Myc<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B). “</p><p>And in subsection “Myc controls amino acid transporter expression in immune activated T cells”:</p><p>“Proteomics data shows that expression of amino acid transporters increases gradually over time (Figure 4B), and Kyn uptake experiments confirm that this increase in transporter number corresponds with higher system L uptake (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It would be informative for the reader to connect the data presented in Figure 4D to their other studies. There is some text in the Discussion section on mTOR but an experiment would help here. Is the initial induction of Myc independent of mTOR and independent of Slc7a5? Is the sustained induction of Myc independent of mTOR but dependent of Slc7a5? Or not? Either outcome is fine but seeing data with an mTOR inhibitor in Figure 4D would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an additional experiment in Figure 4E that addresses this question by measuring Myc expression after 4 and 24 hours TCR activation +/- the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. We have modified the text to describe these data as follows in subsection “Myc controls amino acid transporter expression in immune activated T cells”:</p><p>“The finding that Slc7a5<sup>cKO</sup> T cells can induce Myc expression is also surprising in the context of previous work demonstrating an important role for mTORC1 activation (which is critically dependent on uptake of leucine) in controlling Myc expression during T cell activation (Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, we tested the dependency of Myc protein expression on mTORC1 signalling in our T cell system. The data show that rapamycin treatment had very little impact on expression of Myc protein after 4 hours of T cell activation but did reduce Myc expression after 24 hours (Figure 4E), consistent with the results seen in Slc7a5<sup>cKO</sup> T cells (Figure 4D).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
