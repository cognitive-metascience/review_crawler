decision making, and interval timing. To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects' judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task. We found that the dynamics of striatal neurons predicted duration judgments, and that simultaneously recorded ensembles could judge duration as well as the animal. Furthermore, striatal neurons were necessary for duration judgments, as muscimol infusions produced a specific impairment in animals' duration sensitivity. Lastly, we show that time as encoded by striatal populations ran faster or slower when rats judged a duration as longer or shorter, respectively. These results demonstrate that the speed with which striatal population state changes supports the fundamental ability of animals to judge the passage of time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11386.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11386.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11386.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>You know someone is a good cook from their rice - grains must be well cooked, but not to the point of being mushy. Despite consistently using the same pot and stove, we, however, will sometimes overcook it. It is as if our inner sense of time itself is variable. What is it about the brain that explains this variability in time estimation and indeed our ability to estimate time in the first place?</p><p>One issue the brain must confront in order to estimate time is that individual brain cells typically fire in bursts that last for tens of milliseconds. So how does the brain use this short-lived activity to track minutes and hours? One possibility is that individual neurons in a given brain region are programmed to fire at different points in time. The overall firing pattern of a group of neurons will therefore change in a predictable way as time passes.</p><p>Gouvêa, Monteiro et al. found such predictably changing patterns of activity in the striatum of rats trained to estimate and categorize the duration of time intervals as longer or shorter than 1.5 seconds. Interestingly, when rats mistakenly categorized a short interval as a long one, population activity had travelled farther down its path than it would normally (and vice-versa for long intervals incorrectly categorized as short), suggesting that variability in subjective estimates of the passage of time might arise from variability in the speed of a changing pattern of activity across groups of neurons.</p><p>As further evidence for the involvement of the striatum, inactivating the structure impaired the rats’ ability to correctly classify even the longest and shortest interval durations.</p> <p>The next challenge is to determine exactly how the striatum generates these time-keeping signals, at which stage variability originates, and how the brain regions that the striatum signals to use them to control an animal’s behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11386.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11386.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>interval timing</kwd><kwd>neural dynamics</kwd><kwd>population code</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Champalimaud Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouvêa</surname><given-names>Thiago S</given-names></name><name><surname>Monteiro</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name><name><surname>Motiwala</surname><given-names>Asma</given-names></name><name><surname>Soares</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name><name><surname>Machens</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>Joseph J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCGB #325476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monteiro</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name><name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>Joseph J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIAL-BIC-188/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouvêa</surname><given-names>Thiago S</given-names></name><name><surname>Monteiro</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name><name><surname>Soares</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name><name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>Joseph J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouvêa</surname><given-names>Thiago S</given-names></name><name><surname>Motiwala</surname><given-names>Asma</given-names></name><name><surname>Soares</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons in the rat striatum respond preferentially to long or short time intervals, enabling the animal to track the passage of time.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Time, like space, is a fundamental dimension of the environment, yet how it is processed in the brain is poorly understood.

Animals were required to withhold choice until interval offset. Animals made virtually no errors when categorizing the easiest (i.e. shortest and longest) intervals, but categorization performance declined as intervals approached the 1.5 second categorical boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11386.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rats judged interval durations as either long or short.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Rats triggered interval stimuli (i.e. two brief auditory tones separated by a silent interval of random duration) by inserting their snout into a central port.

For a reconstruction of striatal recording sites see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</xref>). We observed that striatal neurons displayed diverse firing patterns, with different units firing at different times within the interval period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). Can such firing patterns support duration judgments? To determine whether and the degree to which individual neurons could contribute to duration judgments, for each trial, we counted spikes in the last 500 ms of the interval period and compared spike count distributions of short vs long stimulus trials using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (see Materials and methods). We found that the majority of neurons (~57%) preferred either short or long stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; short-preferring: n = 159/433, 36.7%; long-preferring: n = 87/433, 20.1%; permutation test, p&lt;0.05). As expected, short-preferring neurons displayed higher firing on average prior to the 1.5 s category boundary, after which long-preferring neurons displayed higher firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). These averaged activity patterns resemble the likelihood of receiving reward on a moment-by-moment by basis should the animal choose short or long (compare with reward contingency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Such signals, previously observed in the parietal cortex of monkeys performing a similar timing task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leon and Shadlen, 2003</xref>) and in the striatum in a value based decision task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</xref>), are potentially useful for guiding choice. However, were animals’ judgments indeed guided by such signals, it should be possible to predict choices reported later in the trial using neural activity collected during interval stimuli. Indeed, in trials wherein a near boundary interval was judged as long, firing of the short (long) preferring subpopulation dropped (rose) faster, so that the two curves crossed before the 1.5 s boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Conversely, in trials wherein the same interval was judged as short, the two curves evolved more slowly so that at the time of interval offset the short preferring subpopulation was still firing at a higher level and a crossing point had not yet been reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11386.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of striatal subpopulations predict duration judgments.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Psychometric function for neural recording sessions (mean ± standard deviation across sessions and logistic fit, n = 37 sessions from 3 rats).

Might the information afforded by ensembles of striatal neurons account for the pattern of subjects’ judgments across all stimuli? To test this hypothesis, we compared session to session fluctuations in behavioral performance with the separability of activity states of simultaneously recorded ensembles at the offset of short as compared to long intervals. Briefly, for each trial in a session we characterized neural population state as a vector <bold>r</bold> = (r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>,... , r<sub>N</sub>), where <italic>r<sub>n</sub></italic> is the number of spikes fired by neuron <italic>n</italic> ∈ [1,N] within the last 500 ms of the interval period. Next, for each session we found the linear discriminant that best separated population state vectors according to whether they came from a long or a short interval trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; see Materials and methods). A threshold placed along the linear discriminant was then used as a decision rule (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) to generate a ‘neural duration judgment’ for each trial. This procedure allowed us to obtain, for each session, a quantitative description of how well simultaneously recorded neurons could categorize stimuli, i.e., a neurometric function comparable to the behavioral psychometric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Consistent with duration information being encoded at the population level, we found that for sessions in which greater numbers of neurons were recorded simultaneously (i.e. upper tercile of sessions with regard to population size) psychometric and neurometric performances were similar and strongly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). These results demonstrate that a read out of stimulus category from even modestly-sized ensembles of striatal neurons was in many cases sufficient to explain the pattern of duration judgments produced by behaving subjects.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11386.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Simultaneously recorded population state at interval offset can explain behavioral performance.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Low dimensional representation of population state at interval offset for one example session.

In addition, it is well known that striatal neurons can fire around movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>). Could the categorization performance of striatal ensembles reflect activity related to movements the animal might be making during the task? To test to what degree ongoing behavior could explain the categorization performance of striatal neural activity, we applied an analogous classification analysis to video images taken of the animal just before interval offset (see Materials and methods). We found that our ability to categorize intervals using video frames was consistently poorer as compared to neural data collected at the analogous time periods during the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In contrast, we were able to categorize stimuli as well as the animal using video frames taken at the point when animals expressed their choice at one of the reward ports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Furthermore, movement related responses in the striatum are known to occur both pre- and post-movement onset, much later than in other motor areas such as pre-motor and motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</xref>). Thus, if purely movement-related activity were responsible for the categorization performance of striatal ensembles, we would expect ensemble performance to display a similar time course to that of video frames. Applying the same analyses at multiple points in time ranging from 500 ms preceding to 500 ms following stimulus offset revealed a strikingly different profile of categorization performance for video frames as compared to neural ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–e</xref>). Specifically, the time course of duration categorization by neural ensembles was best correlated with the duration categorization by video frames when using spikes collected between 400 ms and 200 ms preceding a reference video frame. These indicate that the categorization performance of striatal neurons was not simply related to the immediate sensorimotor state of the animal, and instead likely reflects that striatal neurons encode an internal neural representation of the state of animals’ categorical decisions.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11386-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11386.014</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Video clips from the entire stimulus period do not show a consistent separation between short and long stimulus trials.</title><p>Superimposed video clips (thresholded and background subtracted) for each stimulus type and for the corresponding stimulus duration (same color conventions as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, when population state at stimulus offset had advanced relatively more or less along the mean trajectory, animals were more likely to judge intervals as long or short respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This effect was observed most consistently for interval stimuli that were closer to the category boundary, and thus variations in projected population state led to horizontal shifts in the psychometric curves (see Materials and methods). These data are consistent with striatal population state encoding a representation of elapsed time that is used by animals to determine categorical judgments. Indeed, such a pattern of population activity has been proposed as a suitable neural code for elapsing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buonomano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1995</xref>).</p><p>However, if such a representation encodes elapsed time, and not only subjects’ judgments in this task, neural activity should continuously traverse a non-repeating trajectory in state space in a manner that predicts duration judgments during presentation of particular stimuli. Indeed, even in a low dimensional projection of population activity, we found that network state ran ahead or behind depending on whether the animal judged a near boundary stimulus as long or short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b,f,j</xref>). The correspondence between population trajectory and duration judgments further suggests that striatal dynamics may form an internal representation of elapsed time that informed categorical decisions about duration. To directly test this hypothesis, we focused on stimuli near the category boundary and decoded time from the population using a naive Bayes decoder and asked whether such a representation correlated with animals’ judgments, exhibiting choice probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Britten et al., 1996</xref>). We found that decoded estimates of time ran faster or slower when animals judged a given stimulus as long or short, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d-g</xref>, cross validated naive Bayes decoder; see Materials and methods). This indicates that striatal activity provides information about elapsing time, the continuously varying decision variable necessary to inform judgments in the task. Furthermore, if this information were read out and used to guide judgments, those judgments would match those of the rats.</p> <p>If the striatal activity we describe above directly supported task performance, manipulating the striatum should modify duration judgments. To test whether this was the case, we bilaterally injected the GABAa receptor agonist muscimol (see Materials and methods). As a result, the duration sensitivity of animals’ judgments dropped significantly as compared to interleaved saline control sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; psychometric slope on saline sessions = [1.03 1.20] vs on muscimol sessions = [0.28 0.67]; 95% confidence intervals), yet animals otherwise performed normally. These results, by demonstrating that duration categorization in this task was dependent on a normally functioning striatum, suggest that the neural signals we observed directly supported duration judgments. However, the possibility that muscimol infusions changed other functions important for task performance such as reward processing or memory for the mapping between time and choice can not be ruled out.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Attempts to understand the neural mechanisms of time estimation have begun to focus on continuously evolving population dynamics as a general mechanism for time encoding across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mauk and Buonomano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buonomano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gershman et al., 2013</xref>). According to this view, time may be encoded by any reproducible pattern of activity across a population of neurons for as long as the pattern is continuously changing and non-repeating. However, no study to date has directly compared the speed of such “population clocks” with the duration judgments of the behaving subjects in which they are found. We show that as rats judged the duration of interval stimuli, striatal neurons displayed dynamics in firing rate that contained information about elapsed time. Furthermore, this information was sufficient to account for the animals’ perceptual decisions, and was not accompanied by systematic differences in outwardly expressed behavior over time. Combined with the observation that striatal inactivation caused a specific decrement in timing performance, these data suggest that striatal dynamics form a central neural representation of time that guides animals’ decisions about duration. Such a coding mechanism in the striatum is well situated to inform the appropriate selection of actions through downstream circuitry involving the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and various extrinsic connections between the basal ganglia and brainstem, thalamic, and cortical motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Steiner and Tseng, 2010</xref>). An intriguing question for future studies is how the striatal dynamics we observed during the interval discrimination task are generated. Neurons in multiple cortical layers spread across the entire cortical mantle, as well as thalamic, pallidal, and neuromodulatory populations provide input to the striatum. While time coding has been assessed in some of these populations, a careful analysis of simultaneously recorded populations that might uncover causal relationships between signals in multiple brain areas has not been carried out. Furthermore, local striatal circuitry may also play a role in shaping dynamics. However, the coding properties tested here could be tested in other brain areas where timing signals have been identified such as the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>), medial prefrontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), parietal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leon and Shadlen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Janssen and Shadlen, 2005</xref>) and motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lebedev et al., 2008</xref>) cortices, and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mauk and Buonomano, 2004</xref>), among others. By comparing the signals recorded simultaneously in multiple brain areas during time estimation tasks, it should be possible to identify signatures of functional interaction between brain areas where they exist. Such an approach promises to elucidate where and how time information encoded at the population level is used by the brain to support the myriad time-dependent functions we and other organisms rely on for survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subject</title><p>Six male Long-Evans hooded rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) between the ages of 6 and 24 months were used for this study.

All recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) targeted dorsal striatum with coordinates centred at +0.2 mm AP and ± 3 mm ML (rat Bertrand), and +0.84 mm AP and ± 2.5 mm ML (rats Edgar and Fernando), from Bregma. Rats were given a week of post-surgical recovery and array placements were confirmed with histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Neural signals were recorded at 30 kHz during behavior, amplified and band-pass filtered at 250–750 Hz (Cerebus - Blackrock Microsystems). Each independent bundle was moved 50-100 μm after every recording session to ensure that independent neural populations were sampled across recording sessions. Waveforms corresponding to action potentials from single neurons were sorted offline using principal component analysis (PCA) (offline sorter, Plexon). All remaining analysis were run in Matlab (Mathworks) software. We selected all isolated units with a mean session firing rate &gt;0.5 Hz and from sessions with &gt;70% correct performance (averaged across all stimuli) and a minimum of 250 trials (n=433 cells, 37 recording sessions, 3 animals; rat Bertrand: 136 units, 10 sessions; rat Edgar: 163 units, 9 sessions; rat Fernando: 134 units, 18 sessions). The general result was found in all subjects. Sample size was not computed during study design. To build PSTHs, spikes were counted in 2-ms bins and convolved with a Gaussian kernel with 25-bin standard deviation. PSTHs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> were ordered by angular position in the space formed by the first 2 principal components describing firing dynamics (i.e., dimensions are all time bins within interval period, samples are each neuron’s mean PSTH).

After one week of post-surgical recovery and 4 days of training, rats were injected with either vehicle (saline, PBS 1x) or muscimol (GABA-A agonist, 100 mg/L (rats Albert and Yuri) and 300 mg/L (rat Zack), Sigma<sup>TM</sup>) solutions in four alternate days. Two 1-μL syringes (Hamilton), attached to an injection pump (Harvard Apparatus) through 20-gauge internal cannulae that extended 1.5 mm bellow the guide cannulae, injected 0.6 μL of solution per site during 2.5 min.

Next, we used a ROC analysis to measure the separation between distributions (95% bootstrap confidence interval, 1000 iterations). We then transformed the area under the ROC curve (<italic>auROC</italic> ∈ [0,1]) into a preference index (<italic>k</italic> = 2*<italic>auROC</italic> - 1; <italic>k</italic> ∈ [−1,1]). We adopted the convention that neurons with positive preference indices fired preferentially for long stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Low dimensional representations of population state</title><p>We refer to the vector describing instantaneous firing rates (measured within 500-ms wide, 10-ms apart, overlapping time bins) across a population of neurons as the population state. The population state vector is a high dimensional variable (i.e., it has as many dimensions as neurons). With the purpose of visualizing population state in 2d plots, we employed standard dimensionality reduction techniques. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, we chose to represent in the abscissa a direction that emphasizes the separability between short and long stimulus trials (i.e., the direction that maximizes variance between groups while minimizing variance within groups; Fisher’s linear discriminant; see below), and in the ordinate the axis of maximal variance that is also orthogonal to the abscissa (i.e. first principal component calculated in the null space of the linear discriminant). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>, population state is represented in the space formed by the first 2 principal components describing population state, calculated during presentation of the interval for which choice variance is maximal (i.e. dimensions are neurons, samples are averaged spike counts for the time bins within that interval).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neurometric curves</title><p>For each trial in a session we characterized neural population state as a vector <bold>r</bold> = (r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>,... , r<sub>N</sub>), where <italic>r<sub>n</sub></italic> is the number of spikes fired by neuron <italic>n</italic> ∈ [1,N] within the last 500 ms of the interval period in that trial.

We iterated over this procedure until all trials had been tested, thus obtaining for each trial a ‘neural duration judgment’. In analogy with behavioral judgments, we used two parameter logistic fits to obtain a quantitative description of the performance of simultaneously recorded neurons in categorizing stimuli -the neurometric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, orange curve).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Videometric curves</title><p>Full session videos (256x192 pixels resolution) were cut into 3-s long clips with Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>). Individual frames from approximately 75 ms before interval offset were used for this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This buffer was added to ensure that all frames used preceded stimulus offset. Images were first represented as vectors composed of individual pixel luminance values. Given that image sequences tend to lie on curved low dimensional manifolds in pixel space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pless, 2003</xref>), any slight differences in behavioral state reflected in images collected at the offset of short and long interval categories are not necessarily expected to be linearly separable. Thus, we employed isomap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tenenbaum and Silva, 2000</xref>), a non-linear dimensionality reduction method, to obtain an information rich yet low dimensional representation of animals’ ongoing behavior. This approach has the advantage over tracking methods that it does not make assumptions as to what part of the animals’ movements might provide information about stimulus category. The neighborhood size, used to compute the shortest paths between data points, was set to 25 frames to minimize, on average, the dimensionality at which the reconstruction error elbow occurred. In analogy with the neurometric curves, for each stimulus type, we then trained a linear discriminant (leave-one-out cross-validation procedure) to classify frames into those that were recorded during trials where a ‘short’ or ‘long’ stimulus interval was presented. The classification was performed in the reduced space determined by isomap. As a positive control for the method, we repeated the same analysis for frames captured at the moment animals expressed their judgment by inserting their snout at one of the two choice ports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Here, the neighborhood size was chosen to be the minimum for which all frames (from a single session) could be included in a single embedding. This analysis was done for all usable videos (8 out of 11) of sessions in the upper tercile with regard to population size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Time course of classification performance from neural and video data</title><p>To compare how the decoding performance using neural and video data evolved over time, the classification analyses described in Neurometric curves and Videometric curves was performed every 100 ms within a one second window centered around stimulus offset. Video frames at the each time point and neural data in a 200 ms time bin terminating at each time point were used for the analysis. This generated neural and video classification curves that described the ability of simultaneously recorded neural ensembles and video frames to correctly classify interval stimuli as long or short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). To determine the relative timing of classification ability in neural ensembles and behavior, we regressed the neural classification curve against the video classification curve for shifts ranging from −300 ms to 300 ms in 100 ms steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Psychometric curves split by population state at interval offset</title><p>We projected neural activity (of populations composed of simultaneously recorded neurons) on individual trials in high dimensional neural space onto the mean trajectory of those neurons during the delay period for correct trials.

We normalized these projections by the length of the mean trajectory of that group of neurons for the longest interval. Pooling normalized projections over all sessions for each animal, we plotted, for each stimulus, distributions of normalized projections at interval offset. To test whether distance traversed along the mean trajectory is predictive of animals' perceptual report, we separated the distribution of pooled projections for each stimulus into 3 bins. Psychometric curves were constructed using trials from each bin. To quantify the key differences between each of these psychometric curves, we performed model comparison using the following 4 parameter logistic function</p><p><disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>b</italic> controls the slope, <italic>c</italic> is the inflection point and <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> are the maximum and minimum values of the curve respectively.

In the third animal (Fernando), the model that best fit the data was one in which the fit to the three curves differed in both horizontal shift and slope.</p><p>A trial's projection on the mean trajectory can be interpreted as a method for decoding time from neural state. Hence, trials that are outliers in the distribution of projections on the mean could potentially correspond to trials where the animal was disengaged.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Patrick Simen (Reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper addresses an important and understudied problem: how does the brain encode time on the scale of a second or so? The authors use a behavioral task in which rats are trained to nose poke left or right depending on the interval between two auditory tones – specifically, whether the interval was short or long in relation to a 1.5 s reference. Striatal recordings from hundreds of cells revealed a robust temporal code: it was possible to determine elapsed time from the onset of the trial based on the current population vector with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, it was possible to predict the incorrect behavioral responses based on whether the population trajectory was &quot;running early&quot; or &quot;running late&quot;. Together with timing-effects of muscimol infusions in striatum (although see concerns below), these data provide and important physiological link between striatal processing and sensory timing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers raised serious concerns about the muscimol data.</p><p>First, the data are from two rats. The reviewers do not think it is easy to make interpretations from two animals and ask that you increase the number. Whilst it is <italic>eLife</italic> policy not to ask for major new data acquisition under revision, the reviewing editor agrees that this is important to solidify the results in this case and believe that you could collect the data within the two month framework. The reviewers think that a good benchmark for a muscimol experiment is 5-6 animals. Please let us know early if you will not be able to perform the extra data acquisition.</p><p>Second, the reviewers were concerned that it is very difficult to tell where the cannulae are from the graphic (they are many hundreds of microns wide) – they might very well be in the dorsolateral striatum. Actual histology would be better.</p><p>Lastly in this section, there were questions about the behavioural effects of muscimol.</p><p>Why didn't muscimol systematically retard or advance the timer if it is truly a clock? It appears that muscimol infusions just increased the variability of the choices, but that doesn't mean that the striatum isn't just listening to a &quot;clock&quot; somewhere else in the brain. I would love to see that a striatal clock could, for example be physiologically sped up or slowed down, as in the amphetamine studies of Meck and colleagues, but I don't think that's what's shown here. Given the role of striatum in reward-guided behavior, I could imagine that inactivating it just makes the task not worth paying attention to, or that the decision stage is disrupted while the &quot;clock&quot;, wherever it is, is still intact.</p><p>2) With respect to the video analysis and controls for movement.</p><p>The reviewers thought that the video analysis likely did a good job controlling for motion effects, but did not think they were clearly presented and had some specific concerns (see point from reviewer directly below). In the discussion, one reviewer suggested including a video that could make the classification clearer. There were also suggestions that the claim could be strengthened by including basic motor control tasks (open-field, circling, paw-rearing) in the muscimol animals, but in the discussion it was agreed that whilst such data would be convincing if you have it, this is not essential.</p><p>Specific point from reviewer:</p><p>I don't understand the author's valiant effort to use classifiers to analyze movement. Traditionally, force-controlled or highly stereotyped motor tasks (see work by Whishaw) are required – in this domain, video assessing kinematics is useful. As presented, I'm not sure if we're looking at movement preparation, licking, reward expectation, etc. See relevant work by Cowan et al., and David Redish on the issue of 'embodied' movement. The animals' behavioral reports are most helpful; as these at least have some consistent events.</p><p>3) There were also questions pertaining to the analysis and interpretation of the neural data.</p><p>I don't think the evidence is particularly strong that time is specifically encoded in the striatum in the way proposed. It seems plausible to me that the striatal neurons are just encoding an output stage of the decision process, in which a short or long choice is preferred. Yes, it is possible to decode subjective time from it, but I would imagine you could do that with population activity recorded from many different brain areas (in particular, areas examined in several of the papers cited here).</p><p>and relatedly:</p><p>This paper provides nice support for the notion that time is encoded in the evolving population dynamics of neurons. The authors also provide some evidence that the striatum is directly involved in the task. Less clear, and admittedly far outside the scope of this paper or any other single paper, is whether the code/dynamics is generated within the striatum. A few sentences as to the authors' thoughts on this issue would be useful, and help guide future research.</p><p>With respect to the following comment from one reviewer – in the discussion the reviewers and editor agreed that the figures could be clarified, but leave it up to you whether you think this can be best achieved using a PCA.</p><p>The neuronal analyses are unclear to me. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, The rasters are helpful, as are the averages, but I'd favor something like PCA to help explain the dataset, as it seems like all patterns are represented in their large population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is the color population size in terms of neurons? I think I don’t understand what is being plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>? I'd like more detail on the 'neurometric' ideal observer – it'd be nice to see the predictions for a single session, and for single population, and even a single neuron as I'm not sure how much neuron population size matters (is that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>?), and I'm not sure what the 'density' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows – or the corresponding plots in the supplement. At the end of the day, is it surprising that striatal neurons predict temporal durations? Also, could the authors define 'psychometric'?

The reviewers do not think it is easy to make interpretations from two animals and ask that you increase the number. Whilst it is eLife policy not to ask for major new data acquisition under revision, the reviewing editor agrees that this is important to solidify the results in this case and believe that you could collect the data within the two month framework. The reviewers think that a good benchmark for a muscimol experiment is 5-6 animals. Please let us know early if you will not be able to perform the extra data acquisition.</italic></p><p>We have now included additional experiments involving the infusion of muscimol into the striatum during task performance. This brings the total numbers to 6 muscimol and 6 saline sessions performed on adjacent days in three different animals (2 saline and 2 muscimol infusions in each animal). In all individual sessions, muscimol infusions produced a significant decrease in the sensitivity of animals’ judgments to interval duration as compared to saline infusions performed on the previous day. It is important to point out that these are reversible inactivations, not permanent lesions, allowing us to collect multiple control and test conditions within each animal. Thus, we believe there should be no doubt that these results reflect a general effect of infusing muscimol on task performance. However, given the slow time course of pharmacology, interpretive issues do remain (see below).</p><p><italic>Second, the reviewers were concerned that it is very difficult to tell where the cannulae are from the graphic (they are many hundreds of microns wide) – they might very well be in the dorsolateral striatum. Actual histology would be better.</italic></p><p>We have now included histology and have updated our schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to reflect the width of the infusion cannulae above the striatum.</p><p><italic>Lastly in this section, there were questions about the behavioural effects of muscimol.</italic></p><p><italic>Why didn't muscimol systematically retard or advance the timer if it is truly a clock? It appears that muscimol infusions just increased the variability of the choices, but that doesn't mean that the striatum isn't just listening to a &quot;clock&quot; somewhere else in the brain. I would love to see that a striatal clock could, for example be physiologically sped up or slowed down, as in the amphetamine studies of Meck and colleagues, but I don't think that's what's shown here. Given the role of striatum in reward-guided behavior, I could imagine that inactivating it just makes the task not worth paying attention to, or that the decision stage is disrupted while the &quot;clock&quot;, wherever it is, is still intact.</italic></p><p>The finding that striatal muscimol infusions reduced the sensitivity of animal’s judgments only shows that signals contributed by the striatum are necessary for normal task performance. Muscimol could have had an effect by changing reward processing, memory for a mapping between time and choice, and/or by making less reliable the representation of the decision variable, elapsed time, that is the major focus of the physiology in the paper. We have now included language explaining this interpretive issue (Results). The experiment that the reviewer seems to be asking for is one wherein we systematically speed or slow the spatiotemporal patterns of activity within striatal populations. Indeed we would love to do such an experiment, although accomplishing this is not trivial and furthermore we believe it is beyond the scope of this paper. Such an experiment would require transiently altering spatiotemporal population dynamics on a small fraction of trials so as to prevent the animal from adapting its choices to the reward feedback it might receive from altered patterns of judgment.</p><p><italic>2) With respect to the video analysis and controls for movement.</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers thought that the video analysis likely did a good job controlling for motion effects, but did not think they were clearly presented and had some specific concerns (see point from reviewer directly below). In the discussion, one reviewer suggested including a video that could make the classification clearer.</italic></p><p>We have now included a supplementary figure and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> to give readers a sense of ongoing behavior during the task.</p><p><italic>There were also suggestions that the claim could be strengthened by including basic motor control tasks (open-field, circling, paw-rearing) in the muscimol animals, but in the discussion it was agreed that whilst such data would be convincing if you have it, this is not essential.</italic></p><p>We did not collect such data, although we agree that it might be informative to collect in the future.</p><p><italic>Specific point from reviewer:</italic></p><p><italic>I don't understand the author's valiant effort to use classifiers to analyze movement. Traditionally, force-controlled or highly stereotyped motor tasks (see work by Whishaw) are required – in this domain, video assessing kinematics is useful. As presented, I'm not sure if we're looking at movement preparation, licking, reward expectation, etc. See relevant work by Cowan et al., and David Redish on the issue of 'embodied' movement.</italic></p><p>We are well aware of the possibility that embodied strategies could play an important role in many instances of timing as well as other cognitive processes. In fact we previously published a paper that examined snout position in relation to timing judgments. However, we were underwhelmed by the power of tracking approaches to detect more subtle differences in behavior that might explain variance in neural firing collected during our experiments. By treating individual images as points in the space defined by the luminance of all of the pixels in the frame, we avoid a pitfall of selective annotation of videos, computer vision, etc. which only consider a subset of the information contained in the image. This was our motivation for the approach to video analysis contained in the paper. We point out that animals cannot lick at the reward ports during the task epochs that we analyze, as this would result in an aborted trial.</p><p><italic>The animals' behavioral reports are most helpful; as these at least have some consistent events.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the behavioral reports are helpful, indeed they play a central role in most of the analyses of neural data in relation to behavior currently contained in the paper.</p><p><italic>3) There were also questions pertaining to the analysis and interpretation of the neural data.</italic></p><p><italic>I don't think the evidence is particularly strong that time is specifically encoded in the striatum in the way proposed. It seems plausible to me that the striatal neurons are just encoding an output stage of the decision process, in which a short or long choice is preferred.</italic></p><p>Were striatal neurons just encoding the output of a decision, we would expect neural activity to occupy two states, with perhaps a transition period in between those two states. We do not observe such a pattern, as evidenced by the distribution of response profiles over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, J, O</xref>) and our ability to decode time continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>) from the population. That said, we do not claim that information about the animals’ decisions is not also contained in the population.</p><p><italic>Yes, it is possible to decode subjective time from it, but I would imagine you could do that with population activity recorded from many different brain areas (in particular, areas examined in several of the papers cited here).</italic></p><p>This sentence seems to directly conflict the previous one, wherein the reviewer proposes that the striatum only encodes the output of a decision process. That aside, we do not doubt that signals related to elapsed time could be recorded from other brain areas. Time is fundamental to many diverse functions that the brain is tasked with carrying out.</p><p>However, a representation of time is necessary for the assumed functionality of the basal ganglia in learning to associate stimuli and actions with reward. Our work is the first to demonstrate that information about elapsed time contained in the evolving population dynamics of striatal neurons reflects time information used by the animals’ to guide their duration judgments.</p><p><italic>and relatedly:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper provides nice support for the notion that time is encoded in the evolving population dynamics of neurons. The authors also provide some evidence that the striatum is directly involved in the task. Less clear, and admittedly far outside the scope of this paper or any other single paper, is whether the code/dynamics is generated within the striatum. A few sentences as to the authors' thoughts on this issue would be useful, and help guide future research.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this issue could be discussed in greater depth and we have now added text in the Discussion to expand on this important point.</p><p><italic>With respect to the following comment from one reviewer – in the discussion the reviewers and editor agreed that the figures could be clarified, but leave it up to you whether you think this can be best achieved using a PCA.</italic></p><p><italic>The neuronal analyses are unclear to me. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, The rasters are helpful, as are the averages, but I'd favor something like PCA to help explain the dataset, as it seems like all patterns are represented in their large population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</italic></p><p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, E, I</xref> contain projections of the neural data onto the first two principal components of the data.</p><p><italic>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is the color population size in terms of neurons?</italic></p><p>Yes, population size refers to the size of the simultaneously recorded population on each session.</p><p> <italic>I think I don’t understand what is being plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>? I'd like more detail on the 'neurometric' ideal observer –</italic></p><p>We direct the reviewer’s attention to the section of the Materials and methods titled ‘neurometric curves’ for a detailed description of the ideal observer analysis.</p><p><italic>it'd be nice to see the predictions for a single session, and for single population,</italic></p><p>We agree that it is nice to see single session examples, which in this case are also single population examples since only simultaneously recorded populations are included in this analysis. Indeed we had included such a single session, single population, example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>.</p><p><italic>and even a single neuron as I'm not sure how much neuron population size matters (is that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>?),</italic></p><p>The single neuron ideal observer analysis corresponds to the receiver operating characteristic analysis displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and extended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>and I'm not sure what the 'density' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows – or the corresponding plots in the supplement.</italic></p><p>We have now updated the figure to label the axis in question as “Trial density” to make it more clear that density refers to the density of single trial population states as a function of the fraction of mean neural trajectory traversed.</p><p><italic>At the end of the day, is it surprising that striatal neurons predict temporal durations?</italic></p><p>We believe it is less surprising that striatal, or any other, neurons predict time than that they predict time in a manner that agrees with the trial to trial variations in temporal judgments exhibited by a behaving subject. Furthermore, many models for how time is encoded by neural systems exist, and our data provides support for a subset of these models. Hence, if the reviewer is asking whether our data is surprising in the sense that it provides information about how timing on the scale of seconds is accomplished by the brain, then yes, we believe these results are surprising and thus informative.</p><p><italic>Also, could the authors define 'psychometric'? It's not clear what this means.</italic></p><p>The psychometric function, a standard term in sensory-based decision tasks, is an “inferential model applied in detection and discrimination tasks. It models the relationship between a given feature of the physical stimulus, e.g. velocity, duration, brightness, weight etc., and the forced-choice responses of the subject.”</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> likely needs to be greatly clarified for most audiences.</italic></p><p>Without more specific instructions, we are not sure how to proceed beyond the changes we list above.</p><p><italic>4) The reviewers were not clear on where in the striatum the authors are interested in. The author's electrodes span the whole striatum, and dorsolateral striatum is completely different than dorsomedial striatum. See work from Henry Yin. Some electrodes even seem to reach ventral striatum.</italic></p><p>We have now included text highlighting our interest in the dorso-central striatum, an area where lesions have been shown previously to produce timing deficits (Results, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
