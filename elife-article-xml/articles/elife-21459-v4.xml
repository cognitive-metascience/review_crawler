multiple layers of regulation that may become evident only when the pathway is probed at different levels or critical nodes are eliminated. To discover regulatory mechanisms in canonical WNT signaling, we conducted a systematic forward genetic analysis through reporter-based screens in haploid human cells. Comparison of screens for negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling, mediators of R-spondin-dependent signaling and suppressors of constitutive signaling induced by loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli or casein kinase 1Î± uncovered new regulatory features at most levels of the pathway. These include a requirement for the transcription factor AP-4, a role for the DAX domain of AXIN2 in controlling Î²-catenin transcriptional activity, a contribution of glycophosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and glypicans to R-spondin-potentiated WNT signaling, and two different mechanisms that regulate signaling when distinct components of the Î²-catenin destruction complex are lost. The conceptual and methodological framework we describe should enable the comprehensive understanding of other signaling systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21459.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21459.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21459.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When an embryo is developing, its cells must communicate with one another to coordinate the processes that shape the bodyâs tissues and organs. Cells often communicate by releasing signaling molecules that engage with proteins called receptors on the surface of other cells. This triggers a series of events that sends the signal along a âpathwayâ of biochemical reactions inside the receiving cell and leads to the activation of genes. One such signaling pathway is triggered by the WNT proteins and is used extensively in all animals. The WNT pathway instructs cells to grow and divide, establishes the identity of specific cell types and maintains populations of stem cells that can regenerate tissues in adulthood as well. The WNT pathway must be carefully regulated because various types of cancer can develop if the pathway becomes too active.</p><p>Some signaling pathways are well conserved between different animals. Many genetic studies into the WNT pathway have focused on animals that are easier to work with in the laboratory, like worms or flies. However, there may be differences in the way these pathways are regulated between these model animals and humans. Therefore, to understand how the WNT pathway operates in humans, it was important to study it in human cells too.</p><p>Lebensohn et al. have now carried out a series of genetic screens in human cells that contain only one copy of each gene instead of the usual two. These cells â referred to as haploid cells â are ideal for genetic studies because only a single copy of a gene has to be disrupted in order to analyze the consequences of that geneâs loss. The screens searched for genes that regulate WNT signaling: those that keep the pathway âoffâ in the absence of WNT and those that turn the pathway âonâ in response to WNT.</p><p>By comparing the outcomes of these screens, Lebensohn et al. identified previously unknown regulators and uncovered new roles for known regulators of the WNT pathway. For instance, a regulator called TFAP4, which had not previously been linked to the pathway, was shown to activate WNT signaling. In another case, enzymes that make molecules called glycophosphatidylinositol anchors, and cell-surface proteins that are modified with those anchors, were found to amplify WNT signaling.</p><p>Lebensohn et al. also identified genes that were needed to sustain the uncontrolled WNT signaling in cells that carried cancer-causing mutations in this pathway. Further studies could now explore if drugs can target these genes, or the molecules encoded by them, to treat cancers in which the WNT pathway is excessively activated. Other studies could also use the same methods to explore more signaling pathways and gain new insights into important biological processes in human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

signaling systems have evolved complex circuitry involving multiple layers of regulation, making their comprehensive characterization a major challenge. Forward genetics in model organisms has been a general and unbiased way to identify new components in signaling pathways and to map their connectivity. However, since signaling pathways have often diverged between humans and these simpler model systems, their analysis in human cells becomes an important goal. Indeed, our ability to identify the best therapeutic strategy or to predict the effectiveness of drugs targeting specific proteins is often hampered by an incomplete understanding of signaling circuitry in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lito et al., 2013</xref>). Recent methodological advances have enabled the interrogation of biological processes in human cells through powerful genome-wide screens that overcome many of the limitations associated with previous platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, inferring functional relationships in complex pathways from such screens remains a major obstacle that has only recently began to be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parnas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Genetics has long relied on the use of sensitized backgrounds, modifier screens and synthetic effects to uncover the myriad layers of regulation in signaling pathways. We reasoned that one way to discover both epistatic relationships on a genome scale and unique context-specific requirements would be through the quantitative comparison of genome-wide screens in which the pathway is activated by different ligands, and of suppressor screens following targeted disruption of critical nodes. We took advantage of two methodologies to conduct a systematic genetic analysis of WNT signaling in human cells: forward genetics in haploid cells using gene trap (GT)-based insertional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carette et al., 2009</xref>), and targeted genome engineering by clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mali et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The WNT pathway is a fundamental signaling system that plays central roles in embryonic development, regeneration and cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoppler and Moon, 2014</xref>). During development, WNT signaling orchestrates transcriptional programs that regulate cell proliferation and survival, cell fate determination, and tissue patterning. In adults, WNT signaling is instrumental in defining stem cell niches in multiple organs, whichÂ maintain tissue homeostasis during routine turnover or following injury. Overactive WNT signaling can be oncogenic, driving both the initiation and maintenance of various types of cancer, most notably colorectal cancer (CRC).</p><p>While the pathway has been studied intensively (we provide a snapshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and refer readers to the legend for details), critical steps remain poorly understood even 34 years after the discovery of â<italic>int1</italic>â, as mammalian WNT was initially called (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nusse and Varmus, 1982</xref>). The complex circuitry of the pathway may mask unknown regulatory mechanisms overlaid on the core module, making it an ideal system for an in-depth, methodical genetic dissection, extending a rich tradition of genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">NÃ¼sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980</xref>). Known pathway components would serve to benchmark any new discoveries, and new discoveries would likely have important therapeutic implications due to the pathwayâs direct relevance to stem cell biology and cancer.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21459.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reporter-based, forward genetic screens in haploid human cells identify negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic model of canonicalÂ WNT signaling, highlighting the main pathway components and regulatory events in the absence (left panel) and presence (center panel) of ligands, and other known regulators relevant to this work (right panel). When the pathway is off, the transcriptional co-activator Î²-catenin (CTNNB1) is constitutively targeted for proteasomal degradation by the destruction complex, composed of the scaffold proteins adenomatous polyposis coliÂ (APC) and AXIN, and the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1Î±Â (CSNK1A1). The T-cell-specific transcription factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) family of transcription factors, together with transducin like enhancer of split (TLE) and histone deacetylases (HDAC), repress WNT target genes. Binding of WNT to its co-receptors frizzled (FZD) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) leads to the assembly of a receptor complex that inactivates the destruction complex through a mechanism involving recruitment of AXIN by LRP6 and the adapter protein dishevelled (DVL). Consequently, CTNNB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus and promotes WNT target gene transcription in cooperation with TCF/LEF and other co-activators such as CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 protein (BCL9). R-spondinsÂ (RSPOs) are secreted proteins that potentiate the response of stem cells to WNT ligands by blocking the degradation of FZD and LRP6 receptors. RSPO binds to leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) and neutralizes two transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, ZNRF3Â andÂ RNF43, that clear WNT receptors from the cell surface. Other regulatory mechanisms include modulation of AXIN levels by the poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146, and recruitment of DOT1L and MLLT10, two proteins involved in histone H3 K79 methylation, to WNT target genes.Â (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of WNT reporter-based forward genetic screens in haploid human cells using a GT-bearing retrovirus for mutagenesis, followed by phenotypic enrichment by FACS.

We identified many of the known core pathway components and found a new requirement for the transcription factor AP-4 (TFAP4). Unexpectedly, these screens uncovered a dominant allele of <italic>AXIN2</italic> that dissociated Î²-catenin (CTNNB1) protein stabilization, considered the decisive event in WNT signaling, from its transcriptional activity. To find factors required for amplification of WNT responses by R-spondins (RSPOs,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we devised a sensitized screen for RSPO-enhanced WNT signaling and uncovered a requirement for the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthetic machinery and glypicans. Finally, we searched for mutations that could suppress constitutive signaling in cells with compromised function of the CTNNB1 destruction complex, recapitulating the most common defect in oncogenic WNT signaling. Suppressor screens in cells lacking adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or casein kinase 1Î± (CSNK1A1), the two rate-limiting negative regulators of the pathway in haploid cells, revealed two distinct mechanisms that regulate CTNNB1 abundance and transcriptionalÂ activity, respectively. One mechanism was specific to cells lacking CSNK1A1, but not APC, suggesting that different components of the destruction complex have different functions in WNT signaling beyond their common function controlling CTNNB1 protein abundance.</p><p>Through a quantitative comparative analysis across seven screens, we confirmed epistatic relationships for known regulators and predicted them for new ones. The combined results of these screens provide a comprehensive resource for understanding theÂ regulation of canonical WNT signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Forward genetic screens in haploid human cells identify negative, attenuating, and positive regulators of WNT signaling</title><p>A central goal of this project was to search for quantitative and context-specific regulators of WNT signaling in an unbiased and comprehensive manner. We adopted two design principles that exploited the flexibility of forwardÂ genetics in cultured human cells. First, as a means of phenotypic enrichment, we chose a fluorescence-based, quantitative transcriptional reporter of WNT signaling. Since WNT reporter fluorescence is a continuous readout, in contrast to digital readouts such as cell viability or the presence or absence of a phenotype, it enabled us to enrich for cells with enhanced or reduced signaling phenotypes by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with complete flexibility on the stringency of selection. Second, all screens were performed in a pooled format following genome-scale insertional mutagenesis using a GT-bearing retrovirus, which contains a strong splice acceptor site and can therefore disrupt genes when it integrates in either exons or introns. This mutagenesis method is untargeted, distinguishing it from approaches in which short hairpin RNAs or single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) are designed to perturb a pre-defined set of cistrons.</p><p>We constructed and thoroughly characterized a clonal haploid human cell line, hereafter called HAP1-7TGP, in which expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is driven by an established WNT-responsive element containing the seven TCF/LEF-binding sites, minimal promoter and 5âUTR of the SuperTOPflash reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuerer and Nusse, 2010</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Aâ1D</xref>). While this construct has been used extensively to report on WNT responses, it may not mimic all endogenous regulatory sequences driving WNT target gene expression. In particular, the effects of proteins involved in modifying chromatin structure could differ between the reporter and endogenous target genes. Given these limitations, whenever possible we confirmed new regulatory mechanisms by measuring endogenous WNT target gene activity or assessing WNT-dependent phenotypes in model organisms.</p><p>To obtain saturating mutational coverage of the genome, we started our screens with 120 million HAP1-7TGP cells (or engineered derivatives thereof) mutagenized with the GT retrovirus, ensuring that the mutant cell population as a whole contained multiple (up to a few hundred) independent lesions in every gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The screens should therefore capture most genes involved in the phenotype being enriched for, except for genes required for the viability of haploid cells and genes with redundant function, since the probability of independent GT integrations disrupting redundant genes in the same haploid cell is vanishingly small. This limitation is inherent to all forward genetic screens that use random or untargeted mutagenesis.</p><p>After sequential rounds of FACS-based phenotypic enrichment and growth (HAP1-7TGP cells do not require WNT signaling for growth, enabling the propagation of cells with decreased or increased WNT signaling activity following phenotypic enrichment), we mapped retroviral integration sites at nucleotide resolution by deep sequencing an amplified library containing junctions between GTs and flanking genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; see Materials and methods). Sequence reads from the sorted cells were compared to those from control, unsorted cells to identify genes enriched for GT insertions in the sorted cell population. Disruption of these genes would be expected to cause the phenotype used as the basis for selection.</p><p>We devised a genome-wide screen to identify the rate-limiting negative regulators of WNT signalingÂ (i.e. genes whose disruption leads to constitutive pathway activity) in haploid human cells. We used FACS to sort mutagenized HAP1-7TGP cells withÂ high WNT reporterÂ activity in the absence of WNT ligand (âEGFP<sup>+</sup>â gate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Following two rounds of sorting (see Materials and methods), GT insertions in only three genes showed statistically significant (false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.01) enrichment in the sorted cells: <italic>CSNK1A1</italic>, <italic>APC</italic> and <italic>PYY</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We mapped 144 independent GT insertions in <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> and 29 in <italic>APC</italic>, showing that our mutagenesis had indeed targeted each gene multiple times. CSNK1A1Â andÂ APC are core components of the destruction complex that suppresses WNT signaling by promoting CTNNB1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); their identification as top hits reassured us that our screening strategy could identify important regulators of canonical WNT signaling. GenesÂ encodingÂ other known negative regulators of the pathway, such as <italic>GSK3A</italic> and <italic>GSK3B</italic> or <italic>AXIN1</italic> and <italic>AXIN2</italic>, presumably did not score as hits in this screen due to redundancy, as suggested by their expression profile in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We demonstrate later that AXIN1 and AXIN2 are indeed functionally redundantÂ inÂ HAP1Â cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The fact that <italic>APC,</italic>Â butÂ notÂ <italic>APC2,</italic> was identified as a hit indicates that these two genes are not redundant in HAP1 cells,Â a conclusionÂ that is supported by the relatively low expression levelÂ ofÂ <italic>APC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21459.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Relative gene expression level of selected WNT pathway regulators in HAP1 cells.

and sorted for cells with the highest 2% EGFP fluorescence (âhighest 2%â gate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Following two rounds of FACS sorting, three genes were significantly enriched for GT insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). <italic>ZNRF3</italic> was the top hit. Eliminating ZNRF3 or RNF43, two transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, has been shown to amplify WNTÂ signaling by increasing FZD and LRP6 levels on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koo et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only <italic>ZNRF3</italic> is expressed at significant levels in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), explaining why it was a hit in this screen. The second most significant hit of this screen was <italic>TCF7L2</italic>, encoding a TCF/LEF family transcription factor that can also function as anÂ attenuating regulator of WNT target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2008</xref>). Loss of either ZNRF3 or TCF7L2 is predicted to potentiate signaling responses rather than making them WNT-independent, explaining why these genes did not score in the negative regulator screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These findings highlight one of the advantages of using a reporter with a graded output: different regulatory layers in the pathway can be revealed by subtle alterations in selection conditions.</p><p>In a screen for positive regulators of canonical WNT signalingÂ (i.e. genes whose disruption reduces signaling output), we stimulated mutagenized HAP1-7TGP cells with a near-saturating dose of WNT3A (50% WNT3A CM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and enriched for cells with the lowest 10% reporter fluorescence (âlowest 10%â gate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>) during two sequential rounds of FACS sorting and amplification. Thirty-three genes were significantly enriched for GT insertions in the sorted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These included genes encoding several known positive regulators of the pathway, such as the WNT co-receptor LRP6, components of the WNT transcription complex including CTNNB1, CREBBP and BCL9, and components of a histone H3Â K79 methyltransferase complex including DOT1L and MLLT10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, regulators with redundant expression profiles in HAP1 cells, such as FZDs or DVLs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), were not recovered in this screen.

TFAP4 is a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor and a target of MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung and Hermeking, 2009</xref>) that has been implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation and metastasis in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackstadt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).

We confirmed this conclusion by epistasis analysis, in which we activated signaling in WT HAP1-7TGP and TFAP4<sup>CR-1</sup> cells at various levels of the pathway by 1) addition of WNT3A, which acts at the cell surface, 2) addition of the GSK3 inhibitor LiCl, which inactivates the destruction complex, or 3) transfection with a non-degradable (ND), constitutively active CTNNB1 mutant (S33Y), which activates the transcription complex directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The ease of genome editing in haploid cells enabled us to preciselyÂ assess the magnitude of signaling defects by comparing multiple independent WT and mutant HAP1-7TGP clonal cell lines containing specific mutations in the single endogenous <italic>AXIN2</italic> allele, which minimized the likelihood of non-specific effects and accounted for interclonal variability. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate HAP1-7TGP cell lines lacking exon 11 of <italic>AXIN2</italic> (designated AXIN2<sup>âC</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

AXIN2<sup>KO</sup> clones exhibited no defect in WNT3A-dependent reporter induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) due to redundancy with AXIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, AXIN2<sup>âC</sup> and AXIN2<sup>âDAX</sup> clones exhibited,Â onÂ average, a 65% and aÂ 76% reduction in WNT3A-inducedÂ signaling,Â respectively, compared to WT HAP1-7TGP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). All <italic>AXIN2</italic> mutant cell lines responded normally to the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), demonstrating that the reduction in WNT3A-induced signaling was not due to defects in downstream steps or to irrelevant factors affecting reporter fluorescence. The fact that C-terminally truncated AXIN2 reduced signaling induced by WNT3A explained why GT insertions generating this unusual <italic>AXIN2</italic> allele were enriched in the WNT screens for positive regulators. Since HAP1-7TGP cells also express AXIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the effect of C-terminally truncated AXIN2 must be dominant.</p><p>We asked whether the reduction in WNT signaling caused by truncated AXIN2 was due to a defect in WNT3A-induced CTNNB1 stabilization. Surprisingly, WNT3A robustly promoted the stabilization of soluble CTNNB1 protein in AXIN2<sup>âC</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), revealing a disconnect between CTNNB1 protein abundance and transcriptional activity.

The discrepancy between CTNNB1 stability and transcriptional activity was not caused by defective nuclear accumulation; in both AXIN2<sup>âC</sup> and AXIN2<sup>âDAX</sup> cells, accumulation of nuclear CTNNB1 following WNT treatment was largely normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude from these experiments that deleting the DAX domain of AXIN2 dissociates CTNNB1 protein abundance from its transcriptional activity.</p><p>These effects could reflect an autonomous property of the AXIN2 protein lacking the DAX domain, or a more complex interaction with the remaining WT AXIN1. To rule out confounding effects due to AXIN1, we disrupted the single allele of <italic>AXIN1</italic> in individual AXIN2<sup>âC</sup>Â and AXIN2<sup>âDAX</sup> clonal cell lines to generate double-mutant cell lines (AXIN1<sup>KO</sup>; AXIN2<sup>âC</sup>ï»¿Â and AXIN1<sup>KO</sup>; AXIN2<sup>âDAX</sup>, respectively,Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The only AXIN protein present in these cells is truncated AXIN2 lacking either half or the entire DAX domain. Truncated AXIN2 caused the same effects upon elimination of AXIN1âdecreased WNT3A-induced reporter activity despite normal accumulation of soluble and nuclear CTNNB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These findings provide further evidence that AXIN2 truncations disrupt CTNNB1-mediated transcription through a novel mechanism intrinsic to this allele.</p><p>We tested the generality of our findings by introducing <italic>Axin</italic> transgenes into the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a model organism that has been used extensively for genetic studies of WNT signaling. We generated a transgene encoding an epitope-tagged (V5) fusion of the single <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Axin protein lacking the last 41 amino acids (AxinâC-V5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).Â TheseÂ aminoÂ acids correspond to those encoded byÂ exonÂ 11Â of human <italic>AXIN2,</italic> the exon disrupted by GT insertions in the WNT screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

The observed defects in Wg signaling were not due to decreased expression of Wg itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B and C</xref>) or to increased expression of AxinâC-V5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3E and F</xref>). In control experiments, expression of WT <italic>Axin-V5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) at physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) using the same promoter as for <italic>AxinâC-V5</italic> did not disrupt Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3BâH</xref>). The fact that in flies, like in haploid human cells, expression of an <italic>Axin</italic> transgene lacking the C-terminal domain reduces Wg signaling even in the presence of endogenous <italic>Axin</italic> is consistent with a dominant effect that restrains CTNNB1 transcriptional activity.</p><p>In summary, unbiased genome-wide screens for positive regulators of WNT signaling uncovered an unsuspected role for the C-terminal DAX domain of AXIN2 in controlling CTNNB1 transcriptional activity, since deletion of this domain led to a severely compromised transcriptional response despite normal accumulation of CTNNB1 protein. While the mechanistic basis of this process remains to be elucidated, our results cannot be explained by previously described functions of the AXIN DAX domain. The DAX domain has been implicated in AXIN polymerization, in interactions with DVL, and in mediating an intramolecular, auto-inhibitory interaction that allows the receptor complex to inactivate the destruction complex in a catalytic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). These models predict that loss of the DAX domain would impair communication between the receptor complex and the destruction complex, leading to defective WNT-induced CTNNB1 stabilization, in contrast to our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Thus, the disconnect between CTNNB1 abundance and transcriptional activity caused by deletion of the DAX domain demonstrates aÂ new biochemical function for this domain.</p><p>The discovery of this dominant allele of <italic>AXIN2</italic> was made possible by the untargeted nature of GT-based insertional mutagenesis and thus would not have emerged from strict loss-of-function screens such as those mediated by RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas9. Given that rare dominant alleles can provide mechanisticÂ insights distinct from those afforded by null alleles, our findings justify the design of comprehensive âexome-wideâ sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9-based screens.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A comparative analysis of screens uncovers requirements for RSPO-potentiated signaling in response to low levels of WNT</title><p>RSPOs are stem cell growth factors that potentiate responses to WNT ligands by binding to LGR-family receptors and neutralizing the ZNRF3 and RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases to increase levels of WNT receptors on the cell surface (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For this analysis, we used two different measures of gene disruption caused by GT integrations (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). First, the FDR-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value, reflecting enrichment of GT integrations in the sorted vs. the unsorted cells from each screen, was used to set a stringent cutoff for inclusion of hits in the analysis. Second, an Intronic GT Insertion Orientation Bias (IGTIOB) score, reflecting enrichment of sense vs. antisense GT integrations (relative to the coding sequence of the gene) in introns only for the sorted cells from each screen, was used to compare hits between screens. The IGTIOB score relies on the fact that generally only sense GT insertions in introns should inactivate genes due to the directionality of the splice acceptor. Genes selectively required for RSPO-enhanced WNT signaling should show a pattern of GT enrichment similar to that of the gene encoding the RSPO receptor, <italic>LGR4</italic>. Conversely, regulators required for WNT signaling under all treatment conditions should be equally enriched for GT integrations in all screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>The most striking outcome of this analysis was the identification of multiple genes encoding components of the GPI-anchor biosynthetic pathway that were enriched for GT insertions in the low WNT + RSPO screen but not the WNT screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Therefore, a GPI-anchored protein may be particularly important in mediating signaling triggered by a combination of RSPO and a low dose of WNT. The gene encoding the glypican GPC4, a GPI-linked heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), was alsoÂ preferentially enriched for GT insertions in the low WNT + RSPO screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), with an FDR-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value=1.92x10<sup>â5</sup>, more significant than those of established WNT signaling components such as <italic>CREBBP</italic> and <italic>BCL9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Glypicans are important for concentrating extracellular ligands at the cell surface, and GPC4 has been proposed to bind and concentrate WNT3A and WNT5A in the vicinity of their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakane et al., 2012</xref>). However, since neither GPI biosynthesis nor glypican genes were significant hits in the WNT screens for positive regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we hypothesized that these genes must play a crucial role under the conditions of the low WNT + RSPO screen, either by mediating RSPO responsiveness like <italic>LGR4</italic>, or by selectively affecting reception of WNT3A at the very low concentration used in this screen.</p><p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed the signaling response to WNT3A alone or to a low concentration of WNT3A plus RSPO1 in clonal HAP1-7TGP cell lines in which we disrupted <italic>PIGL</italic>, a gene in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), or <italic>GPC4</italic> (designated PIGL<sup>KO</sup> and GPC4<sup>KO</sup>, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The glypican GPC6 is redundant with GPC4 in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2012</xref>), so we also generated HAP1-7TGP cell lines in which we disrupted <italic>GPC6</italic> alone or in combination with <italic>GPC4</italic> (designated GPC6<sup>KO</sup> and GPC4<sup>KO</sup>; GPC6<sup>KO</sup>, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In contrast, PIGL<sup>KO</sup> and GPC4<sup>KO</sup>; GPC6<sup>KO</sup> cells manifested some reduction in signaling when stimulated with a near-saturating dose of WNT3A alone, but this reduction was more pronounced following treatment with lower doses of WNT3A alone or a low dose of WNT3A combined with RSPO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). GPC4<sup>KO</sup> cells were stimulated normally by a near-saturating dose of WNT3A and exhibited a smaller defect than GPC4<sup>KO</sup>; GPC6<sup>KO</sup> when stimulated with a lower dose of WNT3A alone or in combination with RSPO1, while GPC6<sup>KO</sup> cells had no signaling defect at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that GPC4 and GPC6 are partially redundant in HAP1 cells, since they are both expressed albeit at very different levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In a control experiment, WNT signaling induced by the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 was largely unaffected in all mutant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), demonstrating that there were no signaling defects downstream of the receptor complexÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these results indicate that genes in the GPI biosynthesis pathway and <italic>GPC4/6</italic> are required for signaling in response to low levels of WNT, and explain why they may have been more prominent hits in the low WNT + RSPO than in the WNT screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Presently, we cannot confirm or discount anÂ additional, direct contribution of GPC4/6 or another GPI-anchored protein to RSPO reception, as we have been unable to directly measure responses to RSPOÂ alone in HAP1 cells. Yet, the presence in all RSPOs of a thrombospondin domain capable of binding heparin sulfate and mediating interactions with HSPGs such as glypicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>) makes this an intriguing possibility.</p><p>In summary, our comparative analysis shows that forward genetic screens in haploid human cells are exquisitely sensitive to both the identity and concentration of ligands used to initiate signaling. They can uncover ligand-specific receptors, such as LGR4, or accessory factors that are rate-limiting for signaling only under specific regimes of ligand concentrations, such as GPI biosynthetic enzymes and glypicans. Of note, the low WNT + RSPO screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) was sensitive enough to reveal redundant regulators, such as <italic>FZD5</italic> and <italic>DVL3</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), that were not significant hits under the near-saturating WNT3A dose used in the WNT screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Suppressor screens reveal genotype-specific signaling requirements</title><p>Given the potential of comparative screens to identify context-specific regulators, we searched for genes whose inactivation would suppress the pathological signaling that ensues when key negative regulators of the WNT pathway are lost.

In the section that follows we explored how SERBP1 regulates WNT signaling in cells lacking destruction complex activity.</p><p>Genes enriched for GT insertions predominantly in the APC suppressor screen included those encoding various RNA binding proteins, components of the mRNA nonsense-mediated decay pathway, and negative regulators of RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting a connection between RNA metabolism and signaling in APC<sup>KO-1</sup> cells.</p><p>Surprisingly, there were a number of genes predominantly enriched for GT insertions in the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Given that the principal role of CSNK1A1 in WNT signaling is thought to be phosphorylation of CTNNB1 through the destruction complex, it was not obvious why these same genes were not enriched for GT insertions in the APC suppressor screen, where destruction complex activity was also disabled. The existence of this class of genes, apparently required for WNT signaling only in cells lacking CSNK1A1, suggested a role for CSNK1A1 in WNT signaling independent of the destruction complex. The most prominent gene in this class encodes HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been proposed to downregulate WNT signaling by ubiquitinating DVL and preventing its multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groot et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the fact that mutations of HUWE1 caused a reduction in WNT reporter fluorescence during the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen suggests a positive regulatory role. Below, we describe the peculiar role of HUWE1 in mediating WNT signaling specifically in the context of CSNK1A1 loss.</p><p><italic>APC</italic> is a prototypical human tumor suppressor gene frequently lost in both sporadic and familial CRC. Importantly, reduction of WNT signaling through restoration of APC in a mouse model of CRC can reverse tumorigenesis even in the presence of mutations in other potent cancer genes such as <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dow et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, genes selectively required to sustain the high-level WNT signaling that ensues when <italic>APC</italic> or <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> are lost, such as those suggested by our comparative analysis, may represent potential therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SERBP1 controls CTNNB1 abundance in cells lacking APC</title><p>The second top hit of the APC suppressor screen, after <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, was the gene encoding the mRNA binding protein SERBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), also known as PAI-RBP1. <italic>SERBP1</italic> was also a significant hit in the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Previous work has implicated HUWE1 as a negative regulator of WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groot et al., 2014</xref>). However, the results of our screens suggested that in the absence of CSNK1A1, HUWE1 is a positive regulator of WNT signaling. To test the role of HUWE1 in this context, we further engineered the CSNK1A1<sup>KO-1</sup> cells used for the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen, as well as an independently derived cell line with a different lesion in <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> (CSNK1A1<sup>KO-2</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

These results are explained by the observation that in cells lacking the DAX domain of AXIN2, CTNNB1 is appropriately stabilized and localized to the nucleus following WNT stimulation, but remains inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, genes encoding components of the GPI anchor biosynthetic machinery, such as PIGL, and the glypican GPC4 were predominantly enriched for GT insertions in the low WNT + RSPO screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and we demonstrated that they indeed play a critical role in mediating signaling especially under the low WNT conditions in which RSPOs exert their strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Third, the enrichmentÂ of GT insertions in <italic>HUWE1</italic> only in the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) revealed a unique signaling condition created by disruption of CSNK1A1, but not other destruction complex components such as APC or GSK3. Only in this very specific context WNT signaling was dependent on HUWE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This positive regulatory function of HUWE1 is evidently different from the negative feedback regulation described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groot et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The presence ofÂ mutationsÂ in known regulators in the expected screens demonstrates the predictive power of our approach, which enabled us to infer the site of action of newly identified pathway components. The transcription factor TFAP4 would be predicted to act downstream of the CTNNB1 destruction complex based on its disruption in all screens for positive regulators of signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as our experimental results confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The selectiveÂ disruption of <italic>SERBP1</italic> in only the APC and CSNK1A1 suppressor screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) suggests a regulatory role on signaling independent of destruction complex activity, which we demonstrated experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>An important conclusion from our studies is that WNT signaling can be regulated by processes other than control of CTNNB1 protein abundance by the destruction complex. We demonstrate two distinct instances in which CTNNB1 transcriptional activity can be dissociated from protein levels, one caused by truncation of the AXIN2 DAX domain and the other caused by depletion of HUWE1 in cells lacking CSNK1A1. It will be interesting to explore if these phenomena can be exploited for therapeutic purposes in tumors driven by inappropriate stabilization of CTNNB1. We also provide evidence that the destruction complex does not have a unitary function in controlling CTNNB1 protein abundance, since disrupting distinct components produces different outcomes. SupressorÂ screens in cells lacking APC or CSNK1A1 revealed mutationsÂ inÂ substantially different sets of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and while SERBP1 controls CTNNB1 abundance in cells lacking APC, the effects of HUWE1 in cells lacking CSNK1A1 are largely independent of changes in CTNNB1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>From these studies a more elaborate picture of the core WNT signaling cascade emerges, with additional regulation superimposed on the core module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate each of these new layers of regulation and to identify the physiological or pathological contexts in which they act. Yet, the comparative analysis of seven unbiased genome-wide screens and the characterization of hits through a quantitative assessment of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered clonal cell lines provided many insights into this complex developmental signaling pathway. The conceptual and methodological framework described in this work should enable the comprehensive understanding of other signaling systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagent providers</title><p>Reagents were obtained from the following companies: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA; Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA; Clontech, Mountain View, CA; Promega, Madison, WI; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT; GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO; Addgene, Cambridge, MA; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX; R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA; Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa (DSHB), Iowa City, IA; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA; Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA; Pall Corporation, Fribourg, Switzerland; Selleckchem,Â Houston, TX;Â Roche, Mannheim, Germany; QIAGEN Sciences, Hilden, Germany; New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA; Epicentre, Madison, WI; Corning, Corning, NY; Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University (BDSC), Bloomington, IN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>7TGP was a gift from Roel Nusse (Addgene plasmid # 24305). pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 (pX330) was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 42230). pCSDest was a gift from Nathan Lawson (Addgene plasmid # 22423). pCS2<sup>+</sup>, pCS2-YFP, pCS2-Î²-cat-S33Y, pCS2-xWnt8, VSV-G and Î8.9 were a gift from Henry Ho.</p><p>The following plasmids were purchased: pAdVAntage (Promega Cat. # E1711), pCMV-VSV-G (Cell Biolabs Cat. # RV-110), pCMV-Gag-Pol (Cell Biolabs Cat. # RV-111), pENTR-D-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. # K240020), pENTR2B (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. # A10463).</p><p>To generate pCSDest-TFAP4, human <italic>TFAP4</italic> was amplified by PCR from MGC Human Sequence-verified cDNA (Clone ID 4181538, GE Dharmacon Cat. # MHS6278-202757542) using primers hTFAP4-FOR (5â-CACCATGGAGTATTTCATGGTGCCCA-3â) and hTFAP4-REV (5â- TCAGGGAAGCTCCCCGT-3â), designed to add a directional TOPO cloning sequence at the 5â end.

Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Cat. # 51304) according to the manufacturerâs âSpin Protocol: DNA Purification from Blood or Body Fluidsâ. Each 3 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cell pellet was resuspended in 600 Âµl PBS, split into three columns, and eluted in 100 Âµl ultrapure water per column.

Seven replicate reactions were set up, each containing 2 Âµg of DNA, 0.5 pmol of the primer 3LTRflanking-biot1 (5â-GGTCTCCAAATCTCGGTGGAAC-3â), 1X AccuPrime PCR Buffer II and 0.4 Âµl AccuPrime <italic>Taq</italic> DNA Polymerase, High Fidelity (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. # 12346) in a total volume of 50 Âµl.

A smear between 100 and 500 base pairs (bp) is typically visible for reactions from GT-mutagenized DNA, indicative of a successful library preparation, but not for the control reaction from unmutagenized DNA. Successful reactions were pooled, and the final PCR product from 100 Âµl of solution was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and eluted in 50 Âµl of ultrapure water. A 10 nM solution of the product (the concentration was calculated using an estimated average PCR product size of 360 bp) was sequenced on one lane of an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx using a custom sequencing primer specific to the outer extreme end of the LTR (SolexaseqFlank: 5â-CTAGCTTGCCAAACCTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCA-3â), resulting in 36 bp reads of the sequence directly flanking GT insertion sites.

Briefly, the 36 bp sequences in the FASTQ sequencing data files were aligned to the human genome version 18 (hg18) using Bowtie alignment software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). To generate a dataset of uniqueÂ GT insertion sites, we excluded ambiguous alignments (no mismatches in the full 36 bp sequence were allowed) and sequences that aligned non-uniquely to the human genome. Furthermore, the sequence was required to align uniquely to the human genome even when 1 or 2 mismatches were allowed,Â andÂ if two sequences aligned 1 or 2 base pairs apart, only one was retained.</p><p>For each screen, insertions mapped to genes in the sorted cells were compared to those in the unsorted control population. The number of insertions per gene was determined by intersecting each dataset of unique insertion sites with a list of the chromosomal coordinates of RefSeq-annotated genes. If an insertion was located in a genomic region shared by multiple transcripts of the same gene, it was only counted once. GT insertions in annotated genes were classified as being in the sense or antisense orientation relative to the coding sequence of the gene, and as being in exons or introns. For the unsorted (control) cells, the number of GT insertions in each gene (regardless of orientation), and the total number of insertions for all genes was determined. For the sorted cells, the number of inactivating GT insertions in each gene, defined as sense and antisense insertions in exons and sense insertions in introns, and the total number of inactivating insertions for all genes was determined. Enrichment of GT insertions for a given gene was calculated by comparing the relative frequency at which that gene harbored <italic>inactivating</italic> GT insertions in the sorted cells compared to the relative frequency at which the gene carried <italic>any</italic> GT insertion in the control dataset. For each gene, a <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated using the one-sided Fisher exact test and was corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Comparative analysis of significant hits across screens</title><p>The FDR-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value for enrichment of GT insertions in the sorted comparedÂ to theÂ control cells depends on many experimental variables affecting both datasets, making it an equivocal metric to directly compare hits between screens. We therefore developed an additional scoring metric that depends only on the dataset for the sorted cells. It relies on the fact that generally only sense GT insertions in introns should inactivate genes due to the directionality of the splice acceptor in the GT, and it captures the relative abundance of intronic GT insertions in the sense and antisense orientations, as well as the overall number of intronic insertions. We defined the Intronic GT Insertion Orientation Bias (IGTIOB) score as log<sub>2</sub>(S/A) x ln(S x A), where âSâ and âAâ equal one plus the number of unique sense or antisense intronic GT insertions, respectively, in a given gene.

Alternatively, WT HAP1-7TGP cells were directly transfected with a combination of pX330 constructs targeting two genes simultaneously. To facilitate screening of mutant clones by PCR when targeting two genes simultaneously, we sometimes targeted one of them at two different sites within the same exon or on adjacent exons and amplified genomic sequence encompassing both target sites.

Matrices were manually curated to remove out-of-focus optical planes and analyzed using MATLAB R2014b (MathWorks) to determine the mean fluorescence intensity of nuclear CTNNB1 staining. Briefly, the fluorescence values from the DAPI channel were smoothed using a low-pass Gaussian filter to remove fine noise, and a threshold was applied to generate a nuclear mask. The nuclear mask was eroded uniformly to prevent contamination with cytoplasmic signal and optical sections with poor nuclear masks were discarded. The fluorescence values from the irrelevant pool of CTNNB1 at tight junctions were removed from the CTNNB1 channel in each plane using a high-pass Gaussian filter. The sum of the corrected fluorescence intensity values from the CTNNB1 channel co-localizing with the nuclear mask were divided by the nuclear mask area to obtain the mean nuclear fluorescence per unit area for each optical plane. The final reported value for each field of view, referred to as ânuclear CTNNB1â, is the median of the mean nuclear fluorescence per unit area obtained from the three most central optical sections.

Instead of siRNA-, overexpression- or genetic screens used previously, they used mutagenesis in haploid cells and an elegant analysis approach. Conducting the screen under various activation modes permitted to screen for select classes of activators/inhibitors. Via limited validation they provide evidence for new factors TFAP4, GPI-anchor biosynthetic pathway (for R-spondin signaling), SERBP1. In addition, their work identified C-terminal truncation mutants for Axin2, which act as dominant negatives and whose epistasis analysis suggest additional layers of Î²-catenin regulation, which is independent from its degradation. They identified HUWE1, a known negative Wnt regulator, is shown to also have a positive mode of action.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please further comment on limitations of the approach due to inherent redundancy of gene function, and perhaps how future screens could address these issues.</p><p>2) The Axin story is confusing. The authors condense the description of why the allele is dominant negative, and need to be clearer on what was learnt from this allele. In particular, the reasons for inactive Î²-catenin accumulation are not properly developed. The authors should either describe this better, or perhaps consider whether this part is essential to their overall story.</p><p>3) The selection is based on a GFP reporter carrying 7 TCF binding elements, which is unlikely to faithfully and fully mimic endogenous regulatory sequences downstream of Wnt. Please add a comment on how this might affect interpretation of results, particularly those pertaining to hits in genes that encode proteins involved in chromatin modification. The authors should discuss follow-ups that allow measurement of endogenous gene activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21459.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Please further comment on limitations of the approach due to inherent redundancy of gene function, and perhaps how future screens could address these issues.</italic> </p><p>We have now explicitly addressed the fact that our approach would miss redundant or essential genes in the Results section. This limitation is inherent to all âforwardâ genetic screens that use random or untargeted mutagenesis. It is possible that CRISPR/Cas9 screens, in which the genomic location of the mutations is chosen by the guide RNA, could be better suited to address issues of redundancy, for example by simultaneously mutating multiple members of a gene family.</p><p><italic>2) The Axin story is confusing. The authors condense the description of why the allele is dominant negative, and need to be clearer on what was learnt from this allele. In particular, the reasons for inactive Î²-catenin accumulation are not properly developed. The authors should either describe this better, or perhaps consider whether this part is essential to their overall story.</italic> </p><p>We have made significant changes to the text that describes the AXIN section of the paper to clarify the logic of the experiments and the consequent conclusions (subsection âThe C-terminal DAX domain of AXIN2 controls CTNNB1 transcriptional activityâ). The discussion in this section has been made more concise to focus on the new information gained by the isolation of this allele, as suggested above. We have included a direct comparison of our results with current models of DAX-domain function from the literature (see aforementioned subsection) to highlight the fact that this allele uncovers an unanticipated role for AXIN in regulating Î²-catenin transcriptional activity downstream of the destruction complex (and hence independent of Î²-catenin protein levels). The precise biochemical mechanism behind why Î²-catenin remains inactive when the DAX domains is deleted will require significant additional investigation (though we have ruled out a defect in nuclear translocation in Figure 3E,F and Figure 3âFigure supplement 2), which we believe is outside the scope of this already expansive manuscript.</p><p>We have retained this section of the paper (with substantial modifications) because the AXIN story makes two important contributions to the overall message of the manuscript. First, it moves the WNT signaling field forward by demonstrating an unexpected biochemical function for the DAX domain conserved from flies to humans. Second, it highlights one of the unique advantages of using untargeted mutagenesis in haploid cells over the more commonly used CRISPR/Cas9 screening system, in which mutations are targeted to specific regions of genes by the guide RNA. Indeed, our work suggests that it might be possible to isolate rare (and often informative) dominant alleles by constructing guide RNA libraries that systematically target the whole exome.</p><p><italic>3) The selection is based on a GFP reporter carrying 7 TCF binding elements, which is unlikely to faithfully and fully mimic endogenous regulatory sequences downstream of Wnt. Please add a comment on how this might affect interpretation of results, particularly those pertaining to hits in genes that encode proteins involved in chromatin modification. The authors should discuss follow-ups that allow measurement of endogenous gene activity.</italic> </p><p>We have now explicitly addressed this point in the second paragraph of the subsection âForward genetic screens in haploid human cells identify negative, attenuating, and positive regulators of WNT signalingâ, commenting on how reporter genes and endogenous target genes may significantly differ in their sensitivity to chromatin modifications. We also note in this section that we have addressed this concern by confirming new regulatory mechanisms (whenever possible) by measuring the expression of endogenous target genes (Figures 2A, 6B, F, Figure 6âFigure supplement 1A and E), measuring the entirely non-transcriptional readout of Î²-catenin stabilization (Figures 3D,F, 6C,D,G,H, Figure 3âFigure supplement 1C, Figure 6âFigure supplements 6B and 6F), or assessing WNT-driven phenotypes in animals (Figures 2E,F, 3G,H, Figure 3âFigure supplement 3), rather than relying solely in reporter gene activity data. Finally, we have not pursued the detailed analysis of any screen hits that encode chromatin-modifying enzymes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
