pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22187.001</object-id><p>Recently, we showed that generation of tumours in syngeneic mice by cells devoid of mitochondrial (mt) DNA (ρ<sup>0</sup> cells) is linked to the acquisition of the host mtDNA. However, the mechanism of mtDNA movement between cells remains unresolved. To determine whether the transfer of mtDNA involves whole mitochondria, we injected B16ρ<sup>0</sup> mouse melanoma cells into syngeneic C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></italic> mice that express red fluorescent protein in their mitochondria. We document that mtDNA is acquired by transfer of whole mitochondria from the host animal, leading to normalisation of mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, knockdown of key mitochondrial complex I (NDUFV1) and complex II (SDHC) subunits by shRNA in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells abolished or significantly retarded their ability to form tumours. Collectively, these results show that intact mitochondria with their mtDNA payload are transferred in the developing tumour, and provide functional evidence for an essential role of oxidative phosphorylation in cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22187.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22187.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are vital organelles of eukaryotic cells responsible for energy production and other key biochemical functions. Many human diseases, including cancer, are characterised by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This is linked to altered mitochondrial bioenergetics, such that cancer cells are more glycolytic than their non-malignant counterparts, as postulated almost a century ago by Warburg. Altered energy metabolism is now regarded as one of the hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vyas et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, the mitochondrial genome has been reported to play a role in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and St John, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patananan et al., 2016</xref>) and in metastatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although many cancer cells are biased towards the glycolytic metabolism, they also need oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for their ‘pathophysiological’ requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weinberg et al., 2010</xref>). Recent research has demonstrated a new concept of cancer metabolism, emphasising the importance of OXPHOS in the tumour environment beyond its role in bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gentric et al., 2016</xref>). A novel paradigm has emerged, according to which respiration is important for cancer cell proliferation, and also for tumour formation, progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBleu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Viale et al., 2014</xref>). This is probably linked to metabolic re-modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). There are reports that some cancer cells retain OXPHOS capacity and have no obvious respiratory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frezza and Gottlieb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jose et al., 2011</xref>). Further, inhibiting glycolysis may restore higher rates of OXPHOS in neoplastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moreno-Sánchez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michelakis et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, depriving cancer cells of their capacity to respire may preclude them from forming tumours.</p><p>We recently reported on the importance of respiration in tumour formation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). We showed that cancer cells without mtDNA (ρ<sup>0</sup> cells) form tumours after a considerable delay compared to their parental counterparts. Tumour progression was associated with mtDNA acquisition from the host, resulting in respiration recovery. While these findings point to a new phenomenon of horizontal transfer of mtDNA between mammalian cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2016</xref>), direct evidence for the role of mitochondrial respiration in tumour formation as well as understanding the mode of mtDNA acquisition is lacking.</p><p>Here we provide a link between efficient tumour formation and recovery of mitochondrial respiration, and show that mtDNA acquisition occurs via trafficking of whole mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell lines derived from tumours that formed from B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells are homogeneous in mtDNA distribution and contain a fully assembled respirasome</title><p>We have shown that B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6J mice formed syngeneic tumours with a 2–3-week delay compared to B16 cells, and next generation sequencing (NGS) indicated the host origin of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).

Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy exerted similar levels and distribution of mtDNA nucleoids in B16, B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC, B16ρ<sup>0</sup>CTC and B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SCL cells, and no nucleoids in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, also showing largely unchanged levels of Tom20 and low level of TFAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—figure 2E</xref>). Native blue gel electrophoresis (NBGE) revealed that B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells do not contain the supercomplex/respirasome (formed by CI, CIII and CIV), but contain low amounts of sub-CV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). CII was found to be fully assembled in all sub-lines, which is reasonable considering that all four subunits in CII are encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test if cells replicate their mtDNA, we established the mitochondrial chromatin immunoprecipitation (mitoChIP) assay. This showed a high level of DNA polymerase-γ1 (POLG1) binding to the <italic>D-LOOP</italic> region of mtDNA in all cells except B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC, B16ρ<sup>0</sup>CTC and B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SCL cells showed similar respiration to B16 cells, but no respiration was observed with B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Accordingly, B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells produced more lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and less ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells also had lower succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and succinate quinone reductase (SQR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) activity, as well as lower citrate synthase (CS) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Finally, we observed higher glucose uptake in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> and B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC cells, and lower uptake in B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SCL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Collectively, these results document that mitochondrial function is already fully restored in cells derived from the primary tumour.</p><p>We next analysed cells for their mtDNA levels and expression of selected transcripts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref> shows no mtDNA in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, while mtDNA was present at similar levels in other sub-lines. No mtDNA-encoded transcripts were present in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. Their levels were low in B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC cells, while higher levels were seen for most transcripts in B16ρ<sup>0</sup>CTC and in B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SCL cells. Transcripts of the assembly factor SCAFI were present at similar levels in all sub-lines, but TFAM transcripts were low in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells relative to the other cells. Transcripts of nDNA genes coding for subunits of respiratory complexes were found to be present in all cells, with some being lower in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. WB revealed that most proteins investigated were relatively abundant in all sub-lines with LC3AII levels lower in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, indicating stalled autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, although present in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, many nDNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins, including subunits of RCs, were unstable in these cells, as evidenced using cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—figure 2D</xref>). Exceptions were SDHA and ATPβ; a plausible reason is the absence of binding partners encoded by mtDNA, which could render the ‘unassembled nDNA-encoded’ subunits unstable. In summary, these results indicate that, in contrast to 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), the respiratory function of B16 sublines is already fully recovered at the primary tumour stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Recovery of B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cell respiration fully restores their propensity to form tumours</title><p>Given the rapid recovery of respiratory function in the B16 model, we next tested tumour-forming capacity of B16 and B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, and of the sub-lines B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC, B16ρ<sup>0</sup>CTC and B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SCL, derived from various tumour stages as described above.

However, direct evidence for the requirement of respiration for tumour formation has been missing. We therefore prepared B16 and B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells with suppressed levels of NDUFV1 (the catalytic subunit of CI) or SDHC (ubiquinone-binding CII subunit essential for its SQR activity) by RNA interference (RNAi) using two different shRNAs for each protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that NDUFV1 shRNA#2 and SDHC shRNA#2 were rather efficient in knocking down the respective proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> also reveals that NDUFV1 knock-down (KD) cells exhibit lower level of CI subunits (NDUFV1 and NDUFS3) while CII subunits (SDHA and SDHC) were unaffected. Conversely, SDHC KD cells showed low levels of CII subunits and also decreased levels of CI subunits. We used cells stably transfected with NDUFV1 shRNA#2 or SDHC shRNA#2 in subsequent experiments.

Only one out of 5 mice of the B16ρ<sup>0</sup> NDUFV1 KD group formed a tumour, with a lag of about 40 days compared to B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells.

On pathological examination of the different tumours, relatively subtle differences in morphology were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). B16 melanoma cells form tumours in control mice (NS) showed prominent nuclear pleomorphism. They appeared more aggressive than cells from ρ<sup>0</sup> tumours. Tumours derived from both B16 NDUFV1 KD and B16 SDHC KD cells showed better histological differentiation associated with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and frequent deposits of melanin pigments, indicating the KD cells are less aggressive than their parental counterpart.

Both B16ρ<sup>0</sup> NDUFV1 KD and B16ρ<sup>0</sup> SDHC KD tumours showed focal areas of nuclear pleomorphism and frequent mitotic features.</p><p>These data clearly point to respiration recovery as essential for driving efficient tumour formation, since suppression of respiration completely deregulated this process.

The only plausible explanation for this phenomenon is the transfer of mtDNA from host cells to tumour cells with compromised mtDNA. The question of how mtDNA moves between cells has not been addressed. An attractive scenario is that whole mitochondria with their payload of mtDNA are transferred, but alternative explanations such as cell fusion have also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vitale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maiuri and Kroemer, 2015</xref>). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as donors of mitochondria due to their high levels of Miro-1, which is the adaptor protein responsible for mitochondrial association with the microtubule mobility complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills et al., 2016</xref>).

Prior to co-culture, the mitochondria of the potential donor (MSC or B16) cells were labelled with mitochondrial dark red fluorophore (MitoDR). Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) that binds covalently to amino acid residues inside cells was used for staining the potential recipient (B16 or B16ρ<sup>0</sup>) cells. Following co-culture, cells were assessed by confocal microscopy to determine the extent of mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells. Representative images and quantitative evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 3A,B</xref>) reveal accumulation of MitoDR stained mitochondria in CFSE stained ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, as a result of their transfer from MitoDR stained MSCs.

DP cells also showed strong binding of POLG1 to the <italic>D-LOOP</italic> region of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) as well as recovery of respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and showed a propensity to form tumours without a lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results document that mtDNA is transferred from stromal cells to B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells within intact mitochondria, resulting in the restoration of respiration and in efficient tumour formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Horizontal gene transfer is a process that until recently had not been known in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keeling and Palmer, 2008</xref>), but has been described for lower eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gladyshev et al., 2008</xref>), affecting their phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boschetti et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, the mitochondrial gene transfer has been inferred in a 10,000 year-old canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rebbeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murchison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strakova and Murchison, 2015</xref>). These predictions have now been confirmed, and a recent study showed at least 5 mtDNA transfers in CTVT within the last 1–2 thousand years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strakova et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondrial transfer was reported in vitro with functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spees et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and Gerdes, 2015</xref>), as well as in mice with endogenously injected MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Islam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>), but these results could also be explained by the association of membrane-bound particles or exosomes containing mitochondria with the damaged cells rather than functional mitochondria proliferating/dividing inside cells. A recent publication from our laboratory showed, for the first time, horizontal transfer of mitochondrial genes between mammalian cells in vivo, based on acquisition of host mtDNA by ρ<sup>0</sup> tumour cells and on the presence of host mtDNA markers in cell lines derived from these tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Several subsequently published papers also provide evidence for horizontal transfer of mitochondria under (patho)physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayakawa et al., 2016</xref>; ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moschoi et al., 2016</xref>), pointing to OXPHOS as a factor complicating cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moschoi et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matassa et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, our data, along with those of other groups, point to mitochondrial transfer as a highly dynamic field of research, with important implications for the conceptual understanding of cancer.</p><p>Our recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>) provoke a number of questions, such as whether respiration is essential for tumour formation, and what is the mode of mtDNA acquisition. To address these queries, B16 metastatic melanoma cells without mtDNA and with compromised respiratory function were used. We show that B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells do not form tumours unless they acquire mtDNA and that severe suppression of either CI- or CII-dependent respiration leads to impaired ability to form tumours, directly linking mitochondrial respiration and tumor growth. The reason(s) for the apparently greater importance of CI-dependent respiration in tumour formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) remain to be explored, particularly when the role of SDH in metabolic re-modelling is taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</xref>). From a mechanistic point of view, CI is essential for respirasome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</xref>) that is needed for CI-dependent respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acín-Pérez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Another indication of the importance of CI is the finding that tumours derived from B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells feature much higher CI-dependent respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We document here that the primary tumour-derived B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC cells feature a fully assembled respirasome and complete recovery of respiration, while corresponding 4T1ρ<sup>0</sup>SC cells show only partial (20–25%) recovery of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, 4T1ρ<sup>0</sup>SC cells formed tumours with a longer delay than parental 4T1 cells, while no delay was observed for B16ρ<sup>0</sup>SC cells. This is likely related to the higher requirement of B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells for respiration recovery to form tumours. This ‘threshold’, apparently lower for 4T1ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, may be due to higher routine respiration of B16 cells of some 100 pmol O<sub>2</sub>/s/10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) when compared to less than 20 pmol O<sub>2</sub>/s/10<sup>6</sup> cells for 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the different genetic changes in B16 melanoma and 4T1 breast carcinoma cells could underpin altered respiration recovery. Whether there is a link to a requirement for ‘threshold’ recovery of respiration for cancer cells to initiate tumour formation has yet to be determined. We propose the term ‘OXPHOS addiction’ to describe the requirement for mitochondrial respiration across the landscape of tumours, and will investigate this in more detail in future research.</p><p>A key question has been the mode of movement of mtDNA between cells. Both selective transfer of mitochondria and cell fusion have been proposed in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vitale et al., 2011</xref>). Using C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></italic> mice with red fluorescent mitochondria in somatic cells, we now provide evidence for acquisition of mtDNA by the trafficking of whole mitochondria from host donor cells to ρ<sup>0</sup> cells both in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), resulting in long-lasting respiration recovery and, consequently, efficient tumour formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). The transient nature of dsRed expression in recipient B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cell mitochondria in the in vivo model sheds additional light on the mechanism of mitochondrial transfer. When dsRed-containing mitochondria are selectively transferred from the host into the recipient cells, dsRed cannot be replenished in the donated mitochondria by de novo synthesis (not being encoded in the recipient’s nuclear genome), and the red fluorescence in donated mitochondria is quickly lost. On the other hand, if cell fusion were responsible for the observed acquisition of mitochondria from the donor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maiuri and Kroemer, 2015</xref>), the donor’s nuclear material would also be transferred, and mitochondrial dsRed expression would be maintained. As this is not the case, the selective transfer of whole, intact mitochondria remains the only possible explanation of our experimental data. The next step will be to investigate the mechanism of mitochondrial trafficking between cells in vivo, with tunnelling nanotubes being a plausible mode of intercellular transfer of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rogers and Bhattacharya, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rustom, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that recovery of respiration in tumor cells with damaged mtDNA is essential for efficient tumour formation and that this is accomplished by the intercellular transfer of whole mitochondria. Our findings are consistent with the emerging notion of the essential role of respiration in cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBleu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Viale et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Viale et al., 2015</xref>), and of a role for mitochondrial transfer in maintaining the bioenergetics balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sinha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). From translational angle, recent studies on horizontal mitochondrial transfer indicate two tantalising, novel approaches to cancer therapy: targeting mitochondrial respiration and blocking transfer of mitochondria from stromal cells to cancer cells. While we have started exploring the first approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boukalova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kluckova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rohlenova et al., 2017</xref>), the other approach remains untested, with recent papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moschoi et al., 2016</xref>) pointing to its plausibility. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first report to show lasting functional consequences of a well-documented mitochondrial transfer event.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cell lines were prepared and maintained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).

The primary cells were plated at the density of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in T25 culture flasks and experiments were performed after the fourth passage.

The cells were then co-cultured for 24 hr and evaluated by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur) and confocal microscopy (63 x; Leica SP8). Mitochondrial transfer was primarily ascertained by a fraction of CFSE-positive cells that were also MitoDeepRed-positive. The quantitative mitochondrial transfer was primarily ascertained by pixel counts on Z-stack confocal images i.e. red pixels in cells with green background. Geometric mean intensity of MitoDeerRed fluorescence in double positive cells was additionally calculated, as a confirmatory measurement of the degree of mitochondrial transfer. Other co-culture combinations (MSCs with B16 cells, B16 cells with B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells) were performed in a similar fashion. Additionally, ρ<sup>0</sup> cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for nBFP and pmGFP followed by clonal selection. Transfected ρ<sup>0</sup> cells were seeded with MSCs prepared from C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9DsRed2</sup></italic> mice in glass-bottom dishes (In Vitro Scientific) at 1:1 ratio and co-cultured for 24 hr.

Approximately 10,000 cells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate, nuclei were stained with DAPI and automated image analysis was performed to identify viable attached cells. Candidate cells were removed with a 30 µm capillary aspirating 0.1 µl per cell using automated bottom detection and scrape mode. Each removed cell was deposited into 10 µl of nuclease-free water supplemented with 1 µg/µl BSA (ThermoFisher) in a 384-well plate that was cooled during the cell picking. The plate was then sealed and placed on dry ice until use. Images were collected before and after picking, and only those samples that contained a single cell were used for further analysis. Negative controls were medium only. Half of the cell lysate (5 µl) was used in 20 µl ddPCR following the manufacturer´s recommendations using ddPCR Mastermix for probes (BioRad) supplemented with 450 nM primers, 250 nM probes: <italic>tRNA</italic> 8A FAM and 9A HEX (Sigma Aldrich, sequences are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> below).

To each 20 µl ddPCR reaction mix about 20,000 copies of parental mtDNA were added (≈1 ng of purified B16 DNA) and spiked with 1000, 100, 10 and 1 copy of host mtDNA. Loss of linearity was observed at a prevalence of 0.5% and 0.05% spiked in host DNA. Pure parental mtDNA gave a background corresponding to 0.18% of host mtDNA. This very low background is caused by cross reaction due to residual affinity of the 8A host probe to the 9A parental locus. The reciprocal cross reaction of 9A probe binding to 8A parental locus was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> for validation of sc/ddPCR). No template controls (NTC) as well as B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells were negative. A single B16 cell contains about 100 copies of mtDNA (not shown); hence our ddPCR sensitivity of 0.5% is sufficient to detect a single host mtDNA molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s18" sec-type="appendix"><title>Mitochondrial biochemistry and bioenergetics</title><p>The activity of SQR, SDH and CS were assessed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ralph DeBerardinis (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

It follows from a previous study from the same authors demonstrating that rho0 B16 cells acquire mtDNA from the host during tumorigenesis. Here the authors provide two new types of information. First, they significantly extend their previous work to demonstrate the importance of, and selection for, cells with electron transport chain function during tumorigenesis in this model. Second, the authors use additional mouse models to provide evidence for direct transfer of intact mitochondria from the host into rho0 melanoma cells during tumor growth, as opposed to cellular fusion events or transfer of mtDNA. This is a provocative finding, novel to models of cancer biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, additional controls are needed. NDUFV1 and SDHC should be silenced with multiple independent shRNAs, ideally with rescue using cDNAs resistant to shRNA knockdown. Statistics are required for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: It is unclear that the data represent true transfer of intact mitochondria. The MitoDR dye diffuses into the cell and then accumulates in the mitochondria. Therefore, simple dye transfer from donor to recipient would produce the same result. A better experiment would be to fuse GFP or another fluorescent marker to a nuclear-encoded protein that is targeted to the mitochondria.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: It is unclear why mitochondria from MSCs are transferred to B16p˚ cells but not B16 cells. Because the analysis was performed just 12 hours after co-culture, the result should not be influenced by selective pressure. This implies a regulated process of transfer, e.g. structural changes that facilitate acceptance of transfer or a signaling-mediated event. If true, this would be the most interesting and surprising component of the paper. This should be studied more thoroughly.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: More systematic analysis of the images, including analysis of z-stacks, is required to assure that the transferred mitochondria are really inside the recipient cells.

NDUFV1 and SDHC should be silenced with multiple independent shRNAs, ideally with rescue using cDNAs resistant to shRNA knockdown. Statistics are required for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that several different shRNAs should be used. In response to this well taken point, we state that we used four different shRNAs for both NDUFV1 and SDHC. We assessed the level of expression of the relevant proteins and respiration in cell lines transfected with all four shRNAs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we document protein levels for shRNA#1 and shRNA#2 for both NDUFV1 and SDHC. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B-D</xref> we only show proliferation and respiration (both routine and CI- and CII-dependent) for the more efficient shRNA#2 (for both NDUFV1 and SDHC). Since we then wanted to perform the experiments (respiration and tumour growth) using the shRNA with higher level of knock down, we focused on shRNAs #2 for both NDUFV1 and SDHC. We decided not to carry out the functional experiments with shRNAs #1 due to their less profound effect on the protein levels. The fact that in case of SDHC shRNA and, in particular NDUFV1 shRNA, we observed highly delayed tumour growth initiation or no tumour growth within 100 days after grafting the cells (with the corresponding ρ<sup>0</sup> cells giving rise of tumour growth within 20-25 days), we believe that the knock down (also given its effect on respiration shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), is causally linked to knocking down of SDHC and NDUFV1, respectively. It is important that both SDHC and NDUFV1 knockdowns led to a delay in tumor formation. It is quite unlikely that both an SDHC and NDUFV1 shRNA would manifest an off-target effect that would result in a delay of tumor growth, it is much more likely that reduction in CI and CII activity induced by respective shRNA is at the bases of the observed phenomenon. This brings consistency to the reported results, as these are in fact two independent shRNAs directed at different components of the electron transport chain. Furthermore, to perform the in vivo experiments again with an independent set of shRNA would require at least 5 months, including all preparatory work, renewal of mouse work permits and the extended 100 days observation period in mice (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). For these reasons, we asked the editors to consider exempting this point from the revision process.</p><p>In support of our reasoning re the point pertaining to the use of several different shRNAs, we discussed this point with the Editor of <italic>eLife</italic> and obtained the response as shown below, supporting our explanation above.</p><p>‘Thanks for your recent query that relates to point 1 in the reviewers' comments. I've shared your comments with the editors and they have the following comments:</p><p>The key experiment will be the one using the mitochondrially-targeted fluorescent protein to better substantiate the claim about horizontal transfer. It would be helpful if they referred to this exchange in their rebuttal letter, so that I remember that we decided to go forward without the additional shRNAs in the in vivo experiment.</p><p>As the editors point out, please refer to the above exchange so the editors remember what they decided to go with.’</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> requires statistical evaluation, and we performed it.

A better experiment would be to fuse GFP or another fluorescent marker to a nuclear-encoded protein that is targeted to the mitochondria.</italic> </p><p>While in general we agree with reviewer’s concern in the matter of die leakage, we find it unlikely that this is an issue in our co-cultures of ρ<sup>0</sup> cells with MitoDeepRed-labelled MSCs prepared from C57BLmice. The reason is that we do not see any mitochondria staining of parental cells co-cultured with MitoDeepRed-labelled MSCs, whereas if die leakage occurred from MCSs, the parental cell mitochondria would be stained as well, all the more so that these cells have higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared to ρ<sup>0</sup> cells and would accumulate the die more readily. Notwithstanding this reasoning, we performed an additional experiment to unequivocally document intercellular transfer of whole mitochondria in MCSs co-cultures using nuclear-encoded mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein as suggested by the reviewer. We used transgenic C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9DsRed2</sup></italic> mice with red fluorescent mitochondria in somatic cells, from which we isolated MSCs and co-cultured them with ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, whose nuclei were labelled with blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and plasma membrane with green fluorescence protein (GFP). Images in Appendix 1—figure 3C of the revised version of the manuscript document that mitochondria labelled with DsRed protein moved from MSCs to B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. This confirms results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, strongly supporting the case for mitochondrial transfer. We added a few sentences concerning this result in the Results section and also added legend to the new Appendix 1—figure 3C in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: It is unclear why mitochondria from MSCs are transferred to B16p˚ cells but not B16 cells.

This should be studied more thoroughly.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a very intriguing point. In fact, we have started a separate project that will answer the very question why transfer of mitochondria from MSCs occursinto B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells but not into their normal counterparts. The group of our collaborator and co-author of this manuscript Prof. Agrawal published a paper recently showing that mitochondria move from MSCs to rotenone-stressed lung alveolar epithelial cells (Ahmad et al. Miro1 regulates intercellular mitochondrial transport &amp; enhances mesenchymal stem cell rescue efficacy. EMBO J 33, 994-1010). We have now carried out similar experiments with MSCs isolated from C57BL mice and with parental B16 cells stressed with rotenone. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>, there was over 3-fold increase in movement of mitochondria from MSCs into rotenone-treated B16 cells compared to their control counterparts, recapitulating our observation with B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. We do not include these results in the revised version of the manuscript, since they are a part of another project (as eluded to above), in which we study the reasons for selective movement of mitochondria to cells lacking mtDNA or whose mtDNA is compromised in some way. The fact that we do see movement of mitochondria into B16 cells with normal mtDNA that were stressed with rotenone indicates that cells with compromised mitochondrial function (rotenone targets mitochondrial complex I) will import mitochondria in order to correct the situation, such as recover their respiratory capacity as we show in our manuscript. The nature of the signal that directs mitochondrial transfer to mitochondria-compromised cell is a matter of intense research in our laboratory.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22187.010</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CFSE labeled B16 cells were co-cultured with mitoDR labeled MSC for 24 h.</title><p>In identical experiments the B16 cells were pretreated with rotenone to induce mitochondrial dysfunction.

This figure also needs data from several mice to assess the reproducibility of the findings and the frequency of double-positive cells, which appears to be extremely low.</italic> </p><p>We basically agree with the reviewers. Before answering this point, it may be good to recapitulate the experiment we performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, where we document the presence of dsRed-positive mitochondria donated by the stroma cells of the C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></italic> mouse in the cytoplasm of the grafted, nuclear BFP-expressing B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. The experiment itself is quite complicated. First, one needs to take into consideration that mitochondria move across over a relatively long period of time. We now have data from a different cell line from another project documenting that mitochondria start to move from the mouse stromal cells to grafted ρ<sup>0</sup> cells within 5 days (will be published elsewhere). Also, using single cells real-time PCR, we observe continuous movement of mitochondria between stromal cells and grafted ρ<sup>0</sup> cells for some 20 days following grafting of ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, until all cells in the small tumour that starts to grow contain mitochondria with DNA. These new, unpublished data are from experiments with 4T1ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, where the principle of mitochondrial transfer is similar to that of mitochondrial transfer to B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. An important aspect of the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> stems from the fact that the MitoDsRed protein is coded for in the nucleus of the host (stromal, presumably mesenchymal stem) cells. Once the mitochondrion moves across to the grafted B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cell, the MitoDsRed protein will ‘fade’, since it is not replenished – the recipient ρ<sup>0</sup> cell does not code for this transgene. This in itself is a good evidence of selective mitochondria transfer as opposed to other possible mechanisms such as cell fusion. Therefore, at any point in time, we can visualise only a small percentage of mitochondria that would have moved across and would not have yet lost the red fluorescence emitted by the MitoDsRed protein.</p><p>We have performed the experiment in which we grafted B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells with BFL nuclei into C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></italic> mice 4 times. In each experiment, we subjected the cells recovered from the animal after being sacrificed to fractionation by cell sorting 4, 7, 9, 11 or 12 days post-grafting. Prompted by the reviewer, we analysed data from available sorts and the average percentage of double-positive (DP) cells in the BFP-positive population was 0.23 ± 0.18, demonstrating that mitochondrial transfer is a reproducible phenomenon occurring in vivo at a relatively low, but stable frequency for an extended period of time. This frequency has now been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>We performed sorting of DP cells with very conservative settings, so that we were sure that we only recover DP cells without any contamination by single-positive cells or cell doublets. This stringency would cause exclusion of, for example, B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells with only a few red mitochondria and B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells were mitochondrial DsRed is already fading. Hence, the presented data give most likely some underestimation of the true in vivo mitochondrial transfer frequency.</p><p>Another, separate and more technical issue, is imaging of the double-positive cells that are recovered and sorted following subcutaneous grafting of B16ρ<sup>0</sup>nuBFP cells into C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></italic> mice. As discussed above, we have to take into consideration the fact that, following transfer from stromal cells of the host into the grafted ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, the MitoDsRed protein will fade rather fast, within about 20-24 h. Therefore, we only have a small window of opportunity to get an image of cells still expressing the mitochondrial red fluorescent protein. This involves first dissection of the tissue comprising the grafted cells, preparation of single cell suspension and sorting of DP cells with red and blue fluorescence. It takes up to 12 hours from sacrificing the animal to having cells sorted for further experimentation. For confocal microscopy, we need to seed the cells in special dishes and allow them to attach, at least to some extent, so that we can take reasonably clear images. We cannot allow the cells to be in the incubator for more than some 6-8 hours before imaging is performed, otherwise the red fluorescence will fade. Therefore, the images that we take in this way are not perfect, although they still clearly document red fluorescent mitochondria in cells with BFP nuclei. Later on, when we use these cells that are established as a subline, imaging is good but the cells do not comprise the MitoDsRed protein anymore. Therefore, we chose the best image we obtained. Additional images of B16ρ<sup>0</sup>DP cells recovered on different days following the engraftment of B16ρ<sup>0</sup> nBFP cells into C57BL/6N<italic><sup>su9DsRed2</sup></italic> mice are presented in the attachment to this document, demonstrating that the images shown do not represent a one-off scenario. Given the technical difficulties of confocal imaging in this setup, the sorting data discussed above present a much more reliable evidence for the reproducibility of the mitochondria-transfer process in vivo.</p><p>The issue of potential fusion of original ρ<sup>0</sup> mitochondria in B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells and mitochondria with mtDNA moving into these grafted cells form the host cells is of great interest. We do not know much about this process at this moment. In fact, we are researching this issue at the moment using the 4T1 cellular system and Balb-c mice in a separate project. We know that cells that contain both ρ<sup>0</sup> mitochondria and mitochondria with mtDNA will not change their ratio much over longer periods in culture, which more-or-less excludes fusion of mtDNA-positive and mtDNA-negative mitochondria, which need to undergo fission in the course of cell division, at which stage they need to be shared relatively similarly between the daughter cells. A rather different issue is to resolve what happens under in vivo conditions, i.e. after cells with ρ<sup>0</sup> mitochondria are grafted in mice and after they import mitochondria with mtDNA from the stroma. The original ρ<sup>0</sup> mitochondria may fuse with the incoming mitochondria with mtDNA or ρ<sup>0</sup> mitochondria may be removed by mitophagy, or both processes may occur in parallel. We know that at certain stage (about 20-25 days post grafting of 4T1ρ<sup>0</sup> cells; unpublished data), the ρ<sup>0</sup> mitochondria ‘disappear’ and the original ρ<sup>0</sup> cells now contain virtually only mitochondria with mtDNA.</p><p>While we do not study in vivo fusion or fission of mitochondria in this manuscript (it is a separate and rather complex project), we subjected the B16 parental, B16ρ<sup>0</sup> and B16ρ<sup>0</sup>DP cells to transmission electron microscopy. As seen in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> in the revised version of the manuscript, B16 and B16ρ<sup>0</sup>DP cells comprise mitochondria with cristae, while B16ρ<sup>0</sup> cells contain mitochondria with two concentric membranes with no cristae or with very low number of cristae. This suggests that defective mitochondria have been either cleared or reconstituted with mtDNA in vivo. Due to the new panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panels C, D, E and F of the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are panels D, E, F and G, respectively, in the revised version of the manuscript. We accordingly changed the Results section and legends to the figures. Also, we added a short chapter on TEM in the Supplementary Methods.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is hard to interpret.
