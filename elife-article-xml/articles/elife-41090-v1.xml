somatically mutated peptides presented by cancer cells on major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I). However, it is unknown why the immune system fails to eliminate immune-recognizable neoplasms before they manifest as frank disease. To understand the determinants of MHC-I peptide immunogenicity in nascent tumors, we tested the ability of thousands of MHC-I ligands to cause tumor subclone rejection in immunocompetent mice by use of a new ‘PresentER’ antigen presentation platform. Surprisingly, we show that immunogenic tumor antigens do not lead to immune-mediated cell rejection when the fraction of cells bearing each antigen (‘clonal fraction’) is low. Moreover, the clonal fraction necessary to lead to rejection of immunogenic tumor subclones depends on the antigen. These data indicate that tumor neoantigen heterogeneity has an underappreciated impact on immune elimination of cancer cells and has implications for the design of immunotherapeutics such as cancer vaccines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41090.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>T cells are specialized agents of the immune system that can detect and attack tumors. They spot their target by identifying small pieces of proteins – or antigens – at the surface of diseased cells. In particular, they can recognize the new and abnormal antigens that a cancer cell often displays. Yet, cells that become cancerous and start displaying suspicious antigens can manage to escape T cells and grow into full tumors. Why does the immune system not recognize and kill these early cancers before they get out of control?</p><p>One possibility is that T cells do not identify certain antigens carried by cancer cells. To test this, researchers have conducted experiments where they inject a mouse with cancer cells that display a single new antigen. If the animal develops a tumor, then this antigen does not trigger an immune response. However, this method is slow and laborious, because only one antigen can be tested at the time. Instead, Gejman, Chang et al. developed a new technique, PresentER, where a rodent gets injected with a mix of millions cancer cells that each displays a different antigen. This way, many thousands of new antigens can be studied in one go. The tumors are left to grow for several weeks before they are removed and analyzed to see which cells survived and which have been killed by the immune system.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the nature of the antigen did not make a big difference. Instead, cancer cells with new antigens could go undetected if they were rare and made up only a small proportion of all the different cancer cells in a tumor. However, the immune system would eliminate the exact same cancer cells when they were the major component of a cancerous lump.</p><p>Future research now has to explore exactly how rare cancer cells can hide amongst other cells, and remain invisible to the body. Armed with this knowledge, it might be possible to improve cancer therapy by prompting the immune system to target these emerging threats earlier.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumor antigens</kwd><kwd>genetic heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>tumor evolution</kwd><kwd>tumor resistance to immune response</kwd><kwd>cancer immunology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007052</institution-id><institution>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Functional Genomics Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gejman</surname><given-names>Ron S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hakimi</surname><given-names>Abraham Ari</given-names></name><name><surname>Schietinger</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Scheinberg</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 CA225212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hakimi</surname><given-names>Abraham Ari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Josie Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schietinger</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 CA 55349 and CA23766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheinberg</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM07739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gejman</surname><given-names>Ron S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 CA200327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gejman</surname><given-names>Ron S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007052</institution-id><institution>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Grant P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hakimi</surname><given-names>Abraham Ari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new, high-throughput in vivo MHC-I peptide minigene library platform shows that the naive immune system cannot eliminate cells presenting immunogenic antigens found at low frequencies within a growing tumor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cancers bear uniquely distinguishable features on the surface of their cells in the form of neoantigens, which are peptides derived from mutated, foreign or oncofetal proteins that are presented in complex with major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) molecules. These short, 8–11 amino acid fragments specifically mark cancer cells and activate potent immune responses that can lead to effective anti-cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenberg and Restifo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zacharakis et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, the existence of T cells that recognize neoantigens is often not sufficient to eliminate tumors. Karl Hellström first described the coexistence of tumor-specific lymphocytes together with cancer cells in human solid tumors as a paradox 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hellström et al., 1968</xref>). In mice, an analogously enigmatic observation has been made that sporadic tumors occurring in aged or carcinogen-treated mice induce strong T cell responses only when transferred into new hosts, thereby preventing engraftment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heike et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dubey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shankaran et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, tumor-specific T cells can lead to tumor rejection in a new host or when used as a cancer therapy, but somehow immune surveillance is evaded during early tumorigenesis in the host that originally developed an immunogenic tumor. The increased rate of tumor formation in immunocompromised individuals has led to the hypothesis that the immune system can and does eliminate some tumors, particularly virally induced tumors, before they become clinically apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schulz, 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that if the immune system can eliminate some early tumors, but not others, perhaps it is because some antigens are more potent at inducing effective T cell responses during early tumorigenesis. Identification and characterization of neoantigens that can induce an effective immune response and clear cancer cells is critical to understanding why and how immunogenic tumors develop in immunocompetent hosts.</p><p>Immunogenic peptides have been discovered in animal studies by injection of thousands or millions of tumor cells bearing neoantigens into animals and observing tumor rejection. However, the robust immune activation and tumor rejection in these cases is not analogous to the events of early tumorigenesis in humans, when the number of transformed cells is miniscule. Thus, even though some tumors are immunogenic, it is not clear why the host cannot eliminate them when the tumors first arise. If the biochemical features of neoantigens that lead to effective T cell responses were known, it might be possible to identify which tumors bear immunogenic antigens. Some reports have linked peptide immunogenicity to the biochemical characteristics of amino acid residues at certain positions along the MHC-I ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calis et al., 2013</xref>), while others have focused on the difference between the affinity of a wild-type ligand and a mutated ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). However, the absence of a large, unbiased data set of known immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides has stymied the validation of these approaches. Indeed, most known immunogenic antigens are derived from viral proteins; few mutationally-derived neoantigens are confirmed as bonafide immunogenic peptides in mice or humans. Here, we have developed a novel genetic method to express libraries of precisely defined MHC-I ligands in mammalian tumor cells and have used this method to ask questions about MHC peptide immunogenicity in immunocompetent animals during early tumorigenesis.</p><p>Using libraries of genetically encoded MHC-I ligands, we tracked the dynamic growth and depletion of thousands of tumor subclones in vivo and noted a striking failure of cancer immunosurveillance that is potentially analogous to the failure of immune surveillance in humans during early tumorigenesis. We demonstrate for the first time that the ability of the naive immune system to surveille a nascent tumor and reject immunogenic subclones is limited by the fraction of cells expressing each unique antigen. Furthermore, we show that these rejection thresholds vary among antigens. Our data are consistent with the observation in humans that patients whose tumors have high numbers of subclones—and thus more subclonal neoantigens—have increased levels of relapse and worse survival than patients with more homogenous tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reuben et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turajlic et al., 2018a</xref>). Thus, our data provide an antigen-specific rationale for the impact that tumor heterogeneity has on survival of human patients. According to our findings, antigen-specific immune effects are limited during early tumorigenesis, which has implications for the emergence and outgrowth of immunogenic tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PresentER expressing cells recapitulate known T cell immunogenicity</title><p>We have developed a reductionist method for encoding diverse peptide/MHC (pMHC) ligands in mammalian cells (termed ‘PresentER’), which was purposefully designed to enable us to ask questions about the immunogenicity of individual peptide epitopes presented by cancer cells at relatively physiologic levels. We used this method to perform high-throughput, pooled screening of MHC-I ligand immunogenicity in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The PresentER antigen minigene is comprised of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal sequence followed by a short peptide/epitope. Expression of the peptide and its display on MHC-I does not require proteasomal degradation or peptide processing, thus enabling precise definition of the exact epitope displayed to the immune system. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gejman, 2018a</xref>), Transporter associated with antigen presentation (Tap) deficient cell lines expressing PresentER antigen minigenes lead to surface presentation of the encoded MHC-I peptide, detectable by multiple modalities, including fluorescently labeled antibodies directed to specific MHC-I ligands, mass spectrometry based immunopeptidomics and antigen-specific T cell reactivity. To demonstrate the applicability of PresentER antigen minigenes to study MHC-I ligand immunogenicity, we first asked if cancer cells encoding known immunogenic (mouse Tyrp1/gp75 TAYRYHLL W223A,H224Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dyall et al., 1998</xref>); mouse Ddx5/p68 SNFVFAGI S551F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dubey et al., 1997</xref>); synthetic SIYRYYGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Udaka et al., 1996</xref>); synthetic VTFVFAGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dubey et al., 1997</xref>); chicken ovalbumin SIINFEKL) or non-immunogenic (mouse Serpinf1/Pedf MSIIFFLPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2006</xref>); scrambled chicken ovalbumin FEKIILSN; mouse Ndufa4/dEV8 EQYKFYSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holler et al., 2003</xref>); mouse Ddx5/p68 SNFVSAGI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dubey et al., 1997</xref>); mouse Tyrp1/gp75 TWHRYHLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dyall et al., 1998</xref>); Mouse Trp2 SVYDFFVWL) MHC-I ligands would be rejected by wild-type (WT) animals. The C57BL/6 syngeneic, Tap deficient mouse cell line RMA/S was transduced with these antigen minigenes and we first checked that the antigens were expressed at physiologically normal levels on the cell surface. Previously we, and others, had shown that endogenously expressed MHC-I tumor antigens are presented on the cell surface at several hundred to several thousand sites per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sergeeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathias et al., 2017</xref>). Using a radiolabeled TCR mimic antibody (25-D1.16) reactive with SIINFEKL/H-2Kb, we demonstrated that there were on average 3500 binding sites per RMA/S cell expressing PresentER-SIINFEKL, compared with ~90 sites on cells expressing PresentER-MSIIFFLPL, suggesting that the PresentER system allows display of the epitopes in a relatively physiologic range. We injected 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells subcutaneously into WT C57BL6/N mice. Tumors expressing known non-immunogenic peptides grew, while tumors expressing known immunogenic peptides were rejected in some or most animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Tap deficient cells were used because peptides derived from proteins that are not directed to the ER (e.g. eGFP) are not presented on MHC as these cells lack the ability to transport peptide from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41090.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cells expressing PresentER minigenes recapitulate the known immunogenicity of encoded antigens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the cloning strategy of PresentER antigen minigenes along with the experiments performed in vivo in this manuscript.

Several known immunogenic and known non-immunogenic control antigen minigenes were included in each library, including some that were described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The libraries of wild type and mutant libraries were separately cloned and introduced into RMA/S cells by transduction at multiplicity of infection &lt;0.3, thereby ensuring that few cells received more than one minigene. Naive C57BL6/N mice were injected with either (a) 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells expressing the wild type library, (b) 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells expressing the mutant library, (c) 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> mutant library cells plus 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> wild type RMA/S (‘padded’) or (d) 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> wild type library cells mixed with 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> mutant library cells (n = 5 per group).

Genomic DNA was extracted from all of the tumors, as well as RMA/S library cells frozen on the day of injection (‘pretumor’ samples) and the minigenes encoded by each cell were amplified by PCR and sequenced by Illumina next generation sequencing.</p><p>Comparison of minigene abundance in the tumor outgrowth with minigene abundance in the pre-tumor samples led to the surprising finding that no minigenes were robustly depleted during growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This result stood in stark contrast to the experiments described above, in which mutant peptide expressing clones were efficiently depleted in immunocompetent mice. Some minigenes that were not abundant in the library (&lt;1/10,000) at the time of injection were depleted or dropped out entirely in the tumor due simply to stochastic drop-out; however, minigenes that were abundant in the library at time of injection maintained their abundance despite in vivo growth of the tumor. Surprisingly, even positive control minigenes encoding strongly immunogenic peptides (orange points) were not depleted in this context. Analysis of minigene abundance in individual animal tumors (as opposed to the average of several tumors) yielded the same conclusion that few, if any, minigenes were reliably depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The absolute number of cells at time of injection can be estimated from the relative abundance of each minigene in the pre-tumor samples. The least abundant minigenes were found at 1 per 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells (0.00002%) and the most abundant at ~23×10<sup>3</sup> per 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> (~0.5%). The immunogenic controls SIINFEKL, VTFVFAGL and SNFVFAGI were found at 0.005–0.013% of cells before injection into mice, which correspond to between 250 and 650 cells injected out of 5 × 10<sup>6</sup>. The number of cells expressing the immunogenic antigens upon injection is very low and thus analogous to the number of cells that are present during early tumor development, when immunogenic transformed cells first arise. The surprising inability of the immune system to eliminate these demonstrably immunogenic cells may shed light on the limits of immune cell activation and killing during the early stages of tumorigenesis that enable outgrowth and escape of immunogenic cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Vaccination with minigene library does not result in immunosurveillance</title><p>A possible explanation for failure of immune surveillance in our RMA/S MHC-I minigene library model might be insufficient antigen available in the growing tumor to activate an initially productive anti-tumor immune response in naive mice.

Discovery of the biochemical characteristics of mutationally-derived neoantigens that are immunogenic would be important to clarify why some neoantigens are tolerated by the immune system and others are not. The significance of this question is underscored by the major challenge currently facing cancer immunotherapy: the identification of patients whose tumors bear immunogenic neoantigens—and are thus likely to respond well to immune checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies—vs those patients who will be unnecessarily exposed to potentially toxic therapies without a chance for efficacy.</p><p>Here, we have developed a reductionist approach to determine which MHC-I ligands are immunogenic in immunocompetent mice. We demonstrate that tumors are rejected when an immunogenic pMHC is expressed on all or most injected cancer cells. To our surprise, we have discovered that effective T cell responses are not mounted against highly immunogenic peptides when cells expressing these peptides are a minor fraction of the tumor, which is the case in early developing tumors in humans. Furthermore, the threshold percentage of tumor cells necessary to yield an antigen-specific immunogenic T cell response varies with the antigen. We propose that ineffective T cell responses may be a consequence of intratumoral (or intra-tissue) heterogeneity and that neoantigen clonal fraction is an important, overlooked aspect of MHC-I antigen immunogenicity.</p><p>There are many mechanisms by which immune mediated killing of immunogenic cancer cells can fail. Here we report the first evidence that tumor heterogeneity is an explicit factor leading to failure of effective immunity in a tumor and that the maximum level of heterogeneity tolerable before immune escape occurs is dependent on the antigen. Immune checkpoints or active tumor suppression do not explain the observed immune evasion because such mechanisms would be expected to suppress T cell killing irrespective of the fraction of tumor cells that expresses an immunogenic epitope. This is evidenced by robust depletion of the highly immunogenic peptides SIINFEKL and TAYRYHLL when present at ≥1% of the tumor. The mechanism by which T cell responses are restrained when immunogenic MHC-I antigens are present at low frequency is not yet clear. Low levels of antigen presentation may lead to ineffective cross-presentation of antigen in the tumor draining lymph node, thus limiting T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spiotto et al., 2002</xref>). In animal models, low levels of immunogenic epitopes of oncogenic drivers presented on transformed cells early during tumorigenesis (at the premalignant stage) were shown to induce a program of cellular hypo-responsiveness in tumor-specific (oncogene-specific) CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willimsky and Blankenstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schietinger et al., 2016</xref>). After prophylactic vaccination with irradiated library cells we observed smaller tumors and increased numbers of antigen-specific T cells in splenocytes and draining lymph nodes, suggesting that some antigen-specific T cell proliferation does occur. While we demonstrated sufficient levels of the high affinity, highly immunogenic antigens on the cell surface, tumor associated epitopes of lower affinity, immunogenicity and expression levels should produce an even more pronounced deficit in T cell recognition. We speculate that the mechanism of immune escape in this model is either ineffective T cell activation or failure of activated T cells to identify and kill antigen-positive cells present at low abundance within a sea of cells displaying irrelevant antigens.</p><p>The observation that animals prophylactically vaccinated with MCA205∆Tap2 cells are partially protected from outgrowth of RMA/S tumors may be due to several possibilities. For instance, the vaccinations may have activated T cells that recognize some immunogenic peptides in the library, or T cells that recognize mutated peptides expressed by both cell types, or, most intriguingly, T cells specific to T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (TEIPPs). TEIPPs are T cell epitopes derived from wild type proteins that are not normally presented, unless antigen presentation is altered by loss of Tap, which yields a relative deficit of peptides translocated into the ER. TEIPPs in RMA/S cells can be immunogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van Hall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doorduijn et al., 2016</xref>). Although RMA/S and MCA205∆Tap2 are unlikely to share neoantigens derived from somatic mutations, they may share TEIPPs that contribute to protection against RMA/S tumor growth. A caveat to the vaccination experiments is that differences in the antigen presentation machinery of MCA205∆Tap2 and RMA/S cells may lead to incomplete congruence in the MHC-I peptidome of these two cell lines. These differences may lead to some peptides encoded by the PresentER library (or by the endogenous genome of the cell) to be poorly presented in one cell line but well presented in another cell line.</p><p>Although we have focused our efforts on understanding the role of CD8 T cells, other infiltrating cell types are also important for anti-tumor effects. In particular, CD4 T cells have been shown to play important roles in the CD8 T cell responses to tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Borst et al., 2018</xref>) and to target neoantigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sahin et al., 2017</xref>). However, our experimental design does not allow us to assess the role of CD4 T cells in CD8 T cell mediated anti-tumor responses. Thus, while it may be the case that the magnitude or quality of the immune response may differ when both CD8 and CD4 cells recognize a related immunogenic antigen, we are unable to study this with the tools we have developed to perform pooled library experiments because we cannot encode both a specific MHC II and MHC I ligand in a single minigene. Moreover, there is the confounding possibility that some CD4 help is coming from unrelated antigens, such as mutated proteins found in RMA/S or the exogenous proteins introduced into the cells by the PresentER vector. More broadly, the heterogeneity in actual human tumors is characterized by differential infiltration with antigen presenting cells, which can change the sensitivity of the immune system to detect immunogenic antigens present at low clonal fractions, and thus could impact our findings. Although we could not modulate the infiltrating immune cells in our experimental tumor models, we appreciate that this may influence the potency of a subpopulation of immunogenic cells. It would be interesting to understand how various levels of antigen presenting cells contribute to dynamic thresholds of T cell immunogenicity.</p><p>The PresentER system we have employed does have some potential biochemical caveats that may impact the interpretation of the data. While we have not observed alternative cleavage patterns in individual peptides we have studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gejman, 2018b</xref>), in a library setting we cannot test if every minigene is properly yielding its encoded MHC-I ligand. For instance, some encoded peptides may not bind well to MHC-I or may only bind in the presence of an MHC loading chaperone. Some peptides may lead to improper or no cleavage of the signal peptide whereas other peptides may be shortened (e.g. by ERAP1, an ER associated endopeptidase), altered or destroyed in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>New therapeutic modalities such as immune checkpoint blockade have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of human tumors, but the toxicity of the drug regimens has led to many efforts to find biomarkers that predict patient response. Tumors with high mutation burdens—which are more likely to have immunogenic neoantigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van Allen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yarchoan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Snyder et al., 2014</xref>)—and tumors that have mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or microsatellite instability (MSI-H) respond well to checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Le et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2017</xref>). In mouse models, syngeneic tumors with MMR gene knock outs accumulate mutations over time and grow more slowly in wild type mice than do tumors without MMR deficiency. Cell lines derived by sub-cloning of MMR deficient lines—thus increasing the clonal fractions of each neoantigen—grow more slowly or are rejected entirely. In all cases, MMR inactivation in tumors leads to better responses to checkpoint blockade than the parental tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Germano et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, survival is inversely related to tumor neoantigen clonality in human patients with lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reuben et al., 2017</xref>). Patients whose tumors bear high numbers of subclonal (or branched) neoantigens have increased levels of relapse and worse survival than those patients with more homogenous tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reuben et al., 2017</xref>). Response to checkpoint blockade in lung and skin tumors is also associated with lower levels of intratumoral heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>). The combination of these data are highly suggestive that while total neoantigen burden is important for long term survival and response to checkpoint blockade, neoantigen clonality is an additional important factor in mediating tumor regression.</p><p>The discovery that intratumoral heterogeneity prevents effective T cell responses has implications for the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines, checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapies, and studies of tumor immunogenicity. In addition, our data may provide a new understanding of mechanisms of immune surveillance and its failure that allows growth and evolution of tumors and subclones. For instance, recent data shows that subclones with very low clonal fraction yet distinct intratumoral functions may be important to tumor survival and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vinci et al., 2018</xref>)—suggesting that even low abundance tumor subclones may be important targets for immunotherapy. In general, we may speculate on one mechanism for cancer escape and progression, in which small early cancers generally do not bear immunogenic epitopes derived from their limited number of driver oncogenic proteins and few passenger mutations. Then as the tumors evolve, the neoantigens appearing in subclones do not reach a clonal fraction high enough to breach their antigen-specific immunogenicity thresholds, thereby allowing escape of these otherwise immunogenic clones. This model may help to explain why sun-damaged and aged healthy tissue is replete with mutations, sometimes reaching frequencies seen in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martincorena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Risques and Kennedy, 2018</xref>). Cumulatively, these findings suggest that effective T cell immunity is restrained in the context of healthy tissue and growing tumors and paint a picture of T cell immunogenicity that is poorly captured by existing models of tissue immunosurveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

All steps were performed in PCR hoods or other clean environments with precautions to avoid cross contamination between samples.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: K Melief (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Your careful quantitative analysis of the role of tumor heterogeneity (clonal fraction) in effective T cell elimination of cancer adds an important new level of insight into the reasons for failure of immunotherapy even when a tumor possesses adequate neoantigens for immune recognition and effector T cells specific for that antigen exist.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper in an ingenious fashion approaches experimentally the important issue of tumor heterogeneity and immunogenicity. To that purpose the authors have used the antigen processing defective (TAP defective) RMA-S cell-line and supplied it with minigene constructs that allow the MHC class I epitope direct access to the ER for MHC class I loading, circumventing the TAP defect in RMA-S. The startling finding is then made through a number of well-designed experiments that small numbers of tumor cells, presenting a given model neo-epitope in a sea of other neo-epitopes escape being noted by the immune system, leading to tumor outgrowth. Not entirely surprisingly, for some epitopes larger fractions of tumor cells go unnoticed than for others, probably reflecting the &quot; quality&quot; of each epitope. While the interpretation offered by the authors in general may be appropriate, additional consideration apply, which they should discuss, because this adds to the relevance of their paper. If true, the conclusions imply a novel parameter strongly influences immunogenicity/targeting of tumor cells and could explain empirical observations on frequent development of heterogenous human tumors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have not reckoned with a potential presentation of epitopes by MHC class II and possible effects of CD4 help. It is well known that optimal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity depends bot for effector cell induction and memory on specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity. Specific help is better than non-specific help, because the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells not only assist in the induction and programming of optimally activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but also improve the intra-tumoral conditions for activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In the average neo-antigen carrying human tumors both CD4 and CD8 neo-epitopes exist (see Ott et al., 2017 and Sahin et al., 2017 papers quoted in the manuscript). It would be great to probe the rules for immunogenicity ageing in the presence or absence of specific helper epitopes being expressed and presented from the same RMA-S tumor, but I appreciate the fact that this is asking too much at the present time. Nevertheless it is quite possible that smaller fractions of tumor cells would become eliminated in the presence of robust and tumor-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> help. The importance of CD4<sup>+</sup> help has been discussed recently in Nature Reviews Cancer by Jannie Borst et al., 2018.</p><p>2) Tumor heterogeneity may also involve the fact that some tumors are very rich in APC, while others are not, lacking the appropriate chemokine (receptor) expression. This type of heterogeneity might heavily influence the results one might obtain with the system used by the authors. Moreover most tumors lack intrinsic danger signals to activate these DC. Again this is likely to substantially influence the outcome. It will enrich the paper if these aspects are discussed.</p><p>3) The observation that vaccination with the MCA 205 TAP-deficient tumor protects non-specifically against RMA-S is not unexpected, because of the existence in RMAS and likely MCA 205 TAP deficient of so-called TEIPP antigens (T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing), first described by Thorbald van Hall et al. in 2006 and lately last revisited in J. Exp. Med. 2018. These epitopes are generated from normal non-mutated household epitopes in a TAP-independent fashion, but being at low numbers, never make it to the cell surface in TAP-competent cells. However, in TAP-deficient cells they see their chance to load MHC class I in the absence of this competition.</p><p>4) The authors assume that the antigenic peptide is cleanly produced in the cells by cleavage of the ER translocation signal. Such cleavages are often influenced by surrounding sequences which in this case include the antigenic peptide. So it is possible that what are thought of as perfect antigenic peptides may not always be so. This should at least be discussed.</p><p>5) No thought seems to have been given to other ER trimming events such as those caused by the ERAP1, the ER aminopeptidase that is well known to trim antigenic peptides and influence presentation. Selective effects of ERAP1 trimming could change the outcome of actual peptides presented on the cell surface. Because the analysis carried out is of DNA sequences, rather than of the presented peptides discrepancies might be explained by differential processing of antigenic precursors. Again, this needs to be discussed.</p><p>6) The original model system was developed in RMA/S cells, but in later experiments included MCA cells that were rendered TAP2-deficient by targeted mutation. Is peptide presentation in two cell types comparable? Especially if there are differences in ERAP1 expression among the two cell types.</p><p>7) How the authors compute the relative frequency of minigenes in the library is key to the analysis but it is unclear how this was done. Is it possible that results could be skewed by the number of viral integration events or amplification errors?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41090.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have not reckoned with a potential presentation of epitopes by MHC class II and possible effects of CD4 help.

We have added the following statement to the manuscript to address the question of CD4 T cell help and additionally expanded on our thoughts below:</p><p>“Our experimental design does not allow us to assess the role of CD4 T cells in CD8 T cell mediated anti-tumor responses. […] Moreover, there is the confounding possibility that some CD4 help is coming from unrelated antigens, such as mutated proteins found in RMA/S or the exogenous proteins introduced into the cells by the PresentER vector.”</p><p>The reviewers make the excellent point that the priming activities of helper CD4 T cells may increase the quality of some CD8 antigens. We strongly agree that CD4 cells likely play an important role in increasing the potency of some poorly immunogenic MHC I antigens. However, we think it is unlikely that CD4 help could normalize T cell responses such that all CD8 antigens would then have the same potency. In other words: even if CD4 cells can help some subclonal antigens to yield more potent immune responses, some antigens would still be more potent than others and this would be reflected in differential ability to clear subclonal cells.</p><p>Our ability to study MHC II ligands with our present method is limited (although we are considering building a CD4 version of PresentER). We have not worked out whether our signal sequence method efficiently yields MHC II peptides to APCs. In addition, the concept of pooled libraries of precisely defined MHC I antigens cannot yet be combined with libraries of longer MHC II peptides for technical reasons: two libraries would need to be made, one encoding MHC I peptides and the other encoding MHC II peptides, and there is no existing way to ensure that the quantity of the matched MHC I and II peptides are comparable across two libraries). Moreover, MHC II peptides are more difficult to predict computationally than MHC I peptides. We can imagine experiments with individual model antigens to test if the addition of a defined MHC II epitope to the tumor cells would improve T cell rejection of immunogenic subclones. However, a great deal of preliminary experiments would be needed to first show that MHC II peptides were being generated and seen in the RMA/S model we have defined and there are many caveats that would need to be addressed, e.g. the relative strengths of the CD8 and CD4 ligands, the possibility of CD4 help coming from an unrelated antigen, etc. In sum, we think this is a highly complex problem for which there are many experimental unknowns. We have not yet begun this work and we envisage it would take greater than 1 year to construct the system and to be confident in any assessment. As such, this is better suited for a follow-up manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Tumor heterogeneity may also involve the fact that some tumors are very rich in APC, while others are not, lacking the appropriate chemokine (receptor) expression. This type of heterogeneity might heavily influence the results one might obtain with the system used by the authors. Moreover most tumors lack intrinsic danger signals to activate these DC. Again this is likely to substantially influence the outcome. It will enrich the paper if these aspects are discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This is also an excellent point. We have added to the Discussion the following statement:</p><p>“The heterogeneity in actual human tumors is characterized by differential infiltration with antigen presenting cells, which can change the sensitivity of the immune system to detect immunogenic antigens present at low clonal fractions, and thus could impact our findings. […] It would be very interesting to understand how different levels of antigen presenting cells contribute to dynamic thresholds of T cell immunogenicity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The observation that vaccination with the MCA 205 TAP-deficient tumor protects non-specifically against RMA-S is not unexpected, because of the existence in RMAS and likely MCA 205 TAP deficient of so-called TEIPP antigens (T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing), first described by Thorbald van Hall et al. in 2006 and lately last revisited in J. Exp. Med. 2018. These epitopes are generated from normal non-mutated household epitopes in a TAP-independent fashion, but being at low numbers, never make it to the cell surface in TAP-competent cells. However, in TAP-deficient cells they see their chance to load MHC class I in the absence of this competition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that TEIPPs deserve a fuller discussion and thank the reviewers for pointing out that vaccination with MCA205 may be semi-protective against RMA/S tumors because of shared TEIPPs. Although we were aware of the existence of TEIPPs, we did not consider the possibility that shared TEIPPs could confer an antigen-specific protective effect. We have added this possible explanation, among others, to the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“The observation that animals prophylactically vaccinated with MCA205∆Tap2 cells are partially protected from outgrowth of RMA/S tumors may be due to a number of distinct possibilities. […] Although RMA/S and MCA205∆Tap2 are unlikely to share neoantigens derived from somatic mutations, they may share TEIPPs that may contribute to protection against RMA/S tumor growth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors assume that the antigenic peptide is cleanly produced in the cells by cleavage of the ER translocation signal. Such cleavages are often influenced by surrounding sequences which in this case include the antigenic peptide. So it is possible that what are thought of as perfect antigenic peptides may not always be so. This should at least be discussed.</p><p>5) No thought seems to have been given to other ER trimming events such as those caused by the ERAP1, the ER aminopeptidase that is well known to trim antigenic peptides and influence presentation. Selective effects of ERAP1 trimming could change the outcome of actual peptides presented on the cell surface. Because the analysis carried out is of DNA sequences, rather than of the presented peptides discrepancies might be explained by differential processing of antigenic precursors. Again, this needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the points made in #4 and #5. We agree that the caveats and limitations of the PresentER system should be discussed more fully, especially as they apply to libraries of MHC-I antigens. Some of the considerations have been addressed in our first manuscript on the PresentER technology (see Gejman 2018 doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/267047). To be more explicit in the present paper, we have added a paragraph to the manuscript to discuss these points. Of note: we have not yet found evidence of alternative cleavage sites in any of the model antigens we have studied, however our tools to examine this phenomenon are limited (and would require to conduct MHC IP + mass spectrometry to show that cleavage/alteration is occurring). Nevertheless, we agree that some encoded peptides may cause alternative or no cleavage of the signal peptide leading to altered peptide or no free peptide.</p><p>The following paragraph is added:</p><p>“The PresentER system we have employed does have some potential biochemical caveats that may impact the interpretation of the data. […] Some peptides may lead to improper or no cleavage of the signal peptide whereas other peptides may be shortened (e.g. by ERAP1, an ER associated endopeptidase), altered or destroyed in the endoplasmic reticulum.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The original model system was developed in RMA/S cells, but in later experiments included MCA cells that were rendered TAP2-deficient by targeted mutation. Is peptide presentation in two cell types comparable? Especially if there are differences in ERAP1 expression among the two cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that differences in the antigen presentation machinery of MCA205∆Tap2 and RMA/S might affect the peptides presented in the library setting and we have added a sentence to the Discussion to address this:</p><p>“A caveat to the vaccination experiments is that differences between the antigen presentation machinery of MCA205∆Tap2 and RMA/S cells may lead to incomplete congruence in the PresentER-encoded MHC-I peptidome of these two cell lines. These differences may lead to some peptides encoded by the library to be poorly presented in one cell line but well presented in another cell line.”</p><p>In general, we believe that this caveat would only impact a small fraction of the members of the library. Moreover, we do not think that these data would change the interpretation of the results because MCA205∆Tap2 cells were only used to boost the initial T cell responses in the pooled library setting. Our later data suggests that there may be a fundamental roadblock to identifying immunogenic peptides in pooled library experiments, namely that low frequency antigens do not lead to effective T cell response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How the authors compute the relative frequency of minigenes in the library is key to the analysis but it is unclear how this was done. Is it possible that results could be skewed by the number of viral integration events or amplification errors?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This is an excellent point. In general, pooled library experiments can be skewed by viral integration events or amplification errors. We have taken precautions at the level of PCR and viral transduction to avoid these issues. We have added several clarifying statements in the Materials and methods and provide more narrative detail here.</p><p>In order to avoid amplification bias due to high PCR cycle numbers or multiple integration events, PCR was performed with the minimum number of cycles necessary to see a clear band on an ethidium bromide gel (i.e. distinct from the gDNA smear). The minimum number of PCR cycles was empirically-determined for each batch of samples, but was typically 22 cycles for outer PCR and 18 cycles for inner PCR when the template was genomic DNA. These are relatively low cycle numbers that do not exhaust available dNTPs or primer (which can lead to amplification errors with &gt;30 cycles). All steps were performed in PCR hoods or other clean environments with precautions to avoid cross contamination between samples. The maximum amount of genomic DNA that could be used in each reaction without inhibiting PCR was used in order to minimize amplification biases in each well. In order to avoid under-sampling low abundance minigenes, each sample was amplified using DNA equivalent to &gt;1,000-fold the number of minigenes in the library. For instance, for the 5,000 minigene library samples used in this manuscript, at least 8e6 cell equivalents of gDNA (6µg of gDNA per cell =&gt; 48µg of gDNA) was amplified across &gt;40 PCR reactions (we have subsequently optimized this using Q5 polymerase and can now load 10µg of gDNA per reaction). The total amount of gDNA from which to amplify was determined by examining H&amp;E slides of RMA/S tumors and noting that growing tumors were comprised mainly of sheets of transformed cells, indicating that most gDNA comes from tumor/minigene-bearing cells and not stromal cells lacking the minigene construct. If we had noted more stromal infiltration, we would have amplified from a larger number of total cells (i.e. more total gDNA) in order to avoid under-sampling low abundance minigenes.</p><p>Biases arising from multiple viral integration events were avoided by transducing target cells at low multiplicities of infection (MOI). The functional titer was determined empirically for each batch of virus by aliquoting+freezing concentrated viral supernatant and transducing RMA/S (or MCA205) with a range of viral supernatant amounts. The amount of viral supernatant corresponding to &lt;⅓ maximal transduction efficiency was used to generate the library, suggesting that on average &lt;10% of cells were doubly infected. &gt;1,000 more cells than minigenes in the library were transduced (usually 2-3,000) and maintained at all times (including during puromycin selection) to ensure that low abundance minigenes did not drop out of the pool.</p><p>The quantification of minigenes in the library after an experiment was performed as follows: genomic DNA was extracted from tumors, the minigenes were amplified by nested PCR and sequenced on Illumina instruments. After sequencing, all reads were aligned to the minigenes in the library. The number of reads aligning to each minigene was divided by the total number of reads aligning to the library to obtain the relative abundance of each minigene.</p></body></sub-article></article>
