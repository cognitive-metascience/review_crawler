Our work in human breast cancer cells identifies three classes of GBSs with distinct epigenetic characteristics and reveals that BRG1 interacts with GBSs prior to hormone exposure. The GBSs pre-occupied by BRG1 are more accessible and transcriptionally active than other GBSs. BRG1 is required for a proper and robust transcriptional hormone response and knockdown of BRG1 blocks recruitment of the pioneer factors FOXA1 and GATA3 to GBSs. Finally, GR interaction with FOXA1 and GATA3 binding sites was restricted to sites pre-bound by BRG1. These findings demonstrate that BRG1 establishes specialized chromatin environments that define multiple classes of GBS. This in turn predicts that GR and other transcriptional activators function via multiple distinct chromatin-based mechanisms to modulate the transcriptional response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35073.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Steroid hormones play a number of roles in the body, including controlling the immune system and the body’s response to stress.

This transcriptional response is essential for human health and development. Glucocorticoids such the synthetic hormone Dexamethasone (Dex) are utilized to activate GR signaling to treat human auto-immune and inflammatory diseases and to promote fetal lung development. Understanding the mechanisms through which the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids is generated is critical for human health and for the further development of disease treatments. A detailed mechanism for GR transcriptional activity has been established through the examination of GR at model genes such as the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). Upon hormone binding, GR enters the nucleus and binds to regions in the chromatin known as GR binding sites (GBSs). At MMTV, GR binding triggers the recruitment of other factors including the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordingley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fryer and Archer, 1998</xref>). Recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex induces the reorganization of nucleosomes around GR binding sites, which in turn facilitates binding of other transcription factors and potentiates transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wallberg et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is comprised of one of two catalytic ATPases, BRG1 and BRM, and 10 or more BRM/BRG1-asssociated factor (BAF) subunits. The so-called BAF complex is critical throughout embryonic development and is among the most commonly mutated protein complexes in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shain and Pollack, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadoch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). BRG1 and the BAF subunits also play critical roles in mediating the transcriptional response to glucocorticoid signaling. GR interacts directly with BAF57, BAF60A, and BAF250, and requires the catalytic ATPase activity of BRG1 to promote transcriptional activation of MMTV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsiao et al., 2003</xref>). Chromatin remodeling by the BAF complex was required for the subsequent recruitment of RNA Polymerase II and other transcription factors to the MMTV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). Transcriptional activation of MMTV was also promoted by the recruitment of a complex containing Ku70/86, Topoisomerase IIβ, and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase one by BRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trotter et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, chromatin remodeling through the BAF complex is a critical component of GR signaling.</p><p>Beyond the requirement for chromatin remodeling by the BAF complex, the underlying chromatin landscape appears to play a crucial role in patterning the hormone response. GR preferentially binds to regions in the chromatin that are pre-accessible as measured by DNase hypersensitivity or formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">John et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burd et al., 2012</xref>). These findings indicated that GR chromatin interactions were predetermined by other chromatin interacting factors. Pioneer factors, transcription factors that can bind to and open regions of closed chromatin, have been implicated in the pre-patterning of GR binding. The pioneer factors C/EBPβ and AP1 pre-occupied a large proportion of GR binding sites in mouse liver and mammary cells, and were required to maintain chromatin accessibility at GR binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biddie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grøntved et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, FOXA1 pre-bound a large number of Estrogen Receptor (ER, another nuclear hormone receptor closely related to GR) binding sites and was required for ER binding and transcriptional activity. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated that hormone signaling through both ER and GR promoted the redistribution of FOXA1 chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>). These findings helped to demonstrate that current models of GR activity fail to fully account for the complexities of GR signaling at a genomic scale, and that more sophisticated and diverse models are required to describe the mechanisms through which GR initiates a transcriptional response.</p><p>In this study, we examined mechanisms of GR transcriptional regulation through genome-scale analyses of hormone-induced changes in transcriptional activity and the binding patterns of GR, BRG1, and pioneer factors. We identify distinct classes of GR binding site based upon the binding profile of BRG1 before and after hormone treatment. BRG1 binding to GR sites prior to hormone marked GR binding sites that were pre-accessible and enriched for marks of transcriptionally active chromatin. BRG1 was required for a robust GR transcriptional response, as disruption of BRG1 expression dramatically altered the profile of hormone-induced differentially expressed genes. GR binding sites that were pre-bound by BRG1 were also enriched for motifs of pioneer factors such as FOXA1 and GATA3, and BRG1 binding at pioneer factor binding sites in untreated cells was predictive of GR binding upon hormone treatment. Furthermore, BRG1 expression was required for Dex-induced recruitment of additional FOXA1 and GATA3 to GR binding sites. Taken together, our data suggest that GR elicits the transcriptional response to hormone via multiple distinct mechanisms that are reliant on the pre-patterning of specialized chromatin environments through the actions of the BAF complex and additional factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential patterns of BRG1 interaction define three classes of GR binding site</title><p>Current models of GR function commonly depict the hormone-dependent recruitment of the BRG1-containing SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to GBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordingley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fryer and Archer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wallberg et al., 2000</xref>). This recruitment of BRG1 facilitates the opening of chromatin around the GBS to enhance the ability of GR to elicit transcriptional effects. However, recent work demonstrates that GBSs exhibit chromatin accessibility prior to hormone treatment, suggesting that some mechanism pre-patterns the chromatin environment around GBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">John et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burd et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To investigate a potential role for BRG1 in this phenomenon, we preformed chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the A1-2 model cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archer et al., 1994</xref>). We obtained data of high depth (&gt;60 million reads per GR or BRG1 ChIP-seq) and called peaks using a 0.001 false discovery rate cutoff to ensure high confidence in identifying GR and BRG1 binding sites. One hour of hormone exposure was sufficient to induce a massive DNA binding response by GR, with 29934 GR binding sites/peaks identified specifically in Dex-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The number of peaks called from our dataset falls within the range of peak numbers called by GR ChIP-seq experiments in other cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Starick et al., 2015</xref>). Dex treatment also had a robust effect on the chromatin localization of BRG1. While 50,000 + BRG1 peaks were identified in each condition, only 33582 peaks were shared while 17699 were specific to EtOH-treated cells and 20658 were specific to Dex-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This rearrangement of BRG1 chromatin localization is consistent with BRG1 being recruited to GBSs upon hormone treatment. To verify this, we examined the overlap between BRG1 and GR peaks and found that 58% of GR peaks are overlapped by a BRG1 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Surprisingly, there was significant overlap in both EtOH and Dex-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with 12034 GR peaks bound by BRG1 in both conditions, and 5565 bound by BRG1 in a Dex-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). 12223 GR peaks were not bound by BRG1, and a total of 54340 BRG1 peaks (including 15093 Dex-specific and 17699 EtOH-specific) did not overlap GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These findings indicate that a large subset of the subsequent GR peaks are bound by BRG1 prior to hormone treatment consistent with the concept that BRG1 could be involved in pre-patterning GBSs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35073.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BRG1 chromatin interaction defines distinct classes of GR binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap demonstrating that GR is detected at 29934 binding sites following 1 hr Dex treatment.

Upon 1 hr Dex exposure, low but distinct levels of accessibility were induced, predominantly at class III peaks where BRG1 binding was also induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Histone 3 Lysine 27 acetylation (K27ac), a histone modification associated with transcriptionally active chromatin at TSSs and active enhancers, was only detected at Class II GR peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Histone 3 Lysine four monomethylation (K4me1), a marker of both inactive/poised and active enhancers, was enriched at all three peaks classes, but had a unique pattern at Class II peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While K4me1 enrichment was centered on the GR peak at Class I and III peaks, Class II peaks had broader K4me1 enrichment with an apparent trough of enrichment directly over the GR peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). None of the peak Classes displayed strong enrichment of Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (K27me3), a repressive chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together with the ATAC-seq data, the patterns of histone modifications at GR peaks were associated with enhancer-like chromatin marks. The strong ATAC accessibility signal and K27ac enrichment at Class II peaks suggested that they might represent GR binding to active enhancers. On the other hand, the relatively low levels of ATAC accessibility and the patterns of K4me1 and K27ac at Class I and III peaks suggested that they represented GR binding to inactive or poised enhancers. Furthermore, Class II GR peaks represent a distinct set of GR peaks that are associated with BRG1 as well as marks of accessible and transcriptionally active chromatin.</p><p>To characterize transcriptional events associated with GR chromatin interaction, we investigated whether any GR peaks were proximal to functionally engaged transcriptional start sites (TSSs). We previously used Start-seq to identify actively transcribed TSSs in A1-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lavender et al., 2016</xref>). We divided these TSSs into those correlated with active, annotated gene TSSs and those that were greater than 2 kb from any gene TSS and represent putative active enhancer TSSs. GR ChIP-seq signal after 1 hr of Dex treatment was modestly enriched over active gene TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), however this was dwarfed by the level of GR enrichment at active enhancer TSSs identified in either EtOH- and Dex-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). The average GR enrichment over active gene TSSs was not markedly increased when the analysis was restricted to genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) following 1, 4, 8, or 18 hr of Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) Thus, GR was much more frequently associated with enhancer transcription than gene transcription. Unlike GR, BRG1 ChIP-seq signal was broadly detected and similarly enriched at all active TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Over active gene TSSs and EtOH-detected active enhancers, the average levels BRG1 enrichment appeared unaffected by Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). This was consistent with the predominantly Class II-specific enrichment of ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal and indicated that BRG1 was constitutively associated with most active TSSs in A1-2 cells. Furthermore, ATAC-seq accessibility and K27ac were also strongly enriched at hormone-independent BRG1 peaks that did not overlap GR peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that BRG1 was largely associated with open and active chromatin independently of GR, and that BRG1 peaks that were not affected by hormone treatment most strongly exhibited these characteristics. However, a Dex-induced increase in BRG1 enrichment was observed at active enhancer TSSs detected in Dex-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and more modestly at the TSSs of Dex-induced DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, TSSs with altered transcriptional activity upon Dex exposure also exhibited hormone-induced BRG1 enrichment.</p><p>K27ac and K4me1 ChIP-seq suggested that GR peak classes were differentially associated with active and inactive/poised enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). To further dissect this relationship, we looked to see how many peaks in each class were in close proximity to active enhancer and gene TSSs. When considering active TSSs called in untreated cells, 38% of Class II peaks were within 1 kb of a TSS, compared to 2% of Class I peaks and 7% of Class III peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). However, when considering active TSSs called in cells treated with Dex for 1 hr, a significant portion of each peak class was within 1 kb of a TSS (26% Class I, 45% Class II, and 38% Class III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Despite the induction of transcriptional activity near a significant subset of Class I and III peaks, K27ac was not observably induced at these peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) whereas the pattern of K4me1 was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together with the patterns of K27ac and K4me1, these data indicated that Class II peaks represented GR interactions with accessible chromatin and transcriptionally active enhancers. Furthermore, they indicated that Class I and III peaks represented GR interactions with inactive or poised enhancers that could be activated upon GR binding, but exhibited limited accessibility and were devoid of the K27ac mark.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BRG1 is required for the transcriptional hormone response</title><p>To further investigate the role of BRG1 in regulating the transcriptional hormone response, we performed RNA-seq in cells which harbor an inducible shRNA targeting BRG1 (A1A3 cells, previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burd et al., 2012</xref>]).

RNA-seq performed at 1 hr Dex treatment in A1-2 cells yielded approximately 200 DEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lavender et al., 2016</xref>). In order to capture a more robust transcriptional hormone response for analysis, we used an 8 hr Dex treatment in A1A3 cells. In normal conditions, 1244 DEGs (Fold Change &gt; 1.5, p-value&lt;0.01, false discovery rate &lt;0.05) were identified following 8 hr of Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). 743 of these DEGs failed to meet the same fold-change and significance cutoffs in Dex treated BRG1-KD cells, indicating BRG1 was required the transcriptional response to Dex. Intriguingly, BRG1-KD cells had 114 Dex-regulated DEGs that were not called DEGs in control Dex-treated cells, indicating that BRG1 also suppressed the hormone responsiveness of a small number of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Reduction of GR protein levels by 50–70% by siRNA resulted in a modest loss of dex-induced transcription at candidate ‘lost’ genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

DEG TSSs tended to be closer to GR peaks, and the percentage of DEGs with GR peaks within 50 kb was more than double that of non-DEG obsTSSs (77.2 to 29.8%). Thus, while GR binding is distal from gene TSSs, genes that are regulated by GR tend to have a higher degree of local GR binding sites. When considering the closest GR peak to each DEG, the different types of DEGs had different proportions of GR peaks classes, with Class II peaks enriched among the closest peaks to ‘common’ and ‘gained’ DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparing the distance from the closest GR peak to each DEG TSS, Class II peaks were also closer than Class I or Class III peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Overall, ‘common’ DEGs had closer GR peaks than ‘gained’ or ‘lost’ DEGs, with the median distance from TSSs to closest GR peaks of 6889, 20094, and 22104 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). DEGs that were ‘gained’ or ‘lost’ also had fewer GR peaks within 50 kb of their TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Our examination of the genomic glucocorticoid response demonstrates a previously undescribed role of BRG1 in patterning the underlying chromatin architecture. Our data reveals that BRG1 interacts with approximately 40% of GR binding sites prior to hormone treatment, and an additional 20% of GR binding sites upon hormone treatment. BRG1 is also broadly associated with transcriptional activity at active gene and enhancer TSSs. The patterns of BRG1 binding at GR biding sites prior to and upon hormone signaling allowed us to define three classes of GR binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These classes exhibited distinct patterns of underlying chromatin accessibility, transcriptional activity, histone modification, and transcription factor motif enrichment and binding. These findings are corroborated by the observation that GR bound enhancers exist in three distinct chromatin states in mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Class I and Class III peaks gain chromatin accessibility upon Dex exposure and are associated with Dex-specific enhancer TSSs, suggesting that they represent regulatory elements that are activated only upon hormone treatment. Class II GR binding sites are strikingly enriched for chromatin that is active and accessible prior to hormone signaling and appear to represent GR binding to active enhancers.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35073.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Overview of three classes of GR binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Class I GR binding sites (GBSs) reside within relatively closed regions of chromatin and have little dex-dependent chromatin remodeling or recruitment of BRG1 and pioneer factors.

The majority of GR binding sites are not associated with transcriptional activity, indicating that GR binding to chromatin is not sufficient to activate transcription. This is especially evident at Class I peaks, which are devoid of active chromatin markers and display minimal ATAC accessibility. Active and accessible chromatin was only detected at Class II GR peaks where BRG1 localization was constitutive/hormone-independent. This active chromatin environment was pre-existing, and was largely unchanged by Dex exposure and GR binding. However, half of Class II peaks do not have active TSSs within 1 kb, and not all Class II peaks have appreciable K27ac enrichment. Furthermore, BRG1 binding was also not sufficient to generate a fully activated chromatin environment at GR binding sites, as Dex-induced recruitment of BRG1 at Class III peaks occurs without a concomitant induction of K27ac. The implications for these phenomena are wide-ranging. Enrichment of H3K4me1 at Class I and III GR peaks suggests that these binding sites are poised for transcriptional activation, and yet, Dex-induced binding of GR and BRG1 do not yield conversion of these sites to a more active chromatin profile such as that observed at Class II peaks. Thus, it appears that a large subset of GR chromatin interactions are transcriptionally unproductive and uneventful in terms of the effect on the chromatin environment. Despite this, Start-seq reveals that transcriptional activity is gained at ~25% of Class I peaks and ~30% of Class III peaks upon Dex exposure. This suggests that the induction of transcriptional activity at GR binding sites occurs independently of the induction of common active chromatin characteristics.</p><p>Intriguingly, ~60% of Dex-regulated DEGs are lost following BRG1 knockdown, and Class II and III GR binding sites represent ~60% of GR binding sites. The suppression of the GR transcriptional response following BRG1 knockdown suggested that BRG1 interaction with GR binding sites is required for GR-mediated transcriptional regulation of many genes. Surprisingly, over 100 genes gained hormone-responsiveness following BRG1 knockdown, indicating that at some genes, BRG1 prevents GR from eliciting transcriptional activity. Thus, BRG1 plays a critical role in patterning the GR transcriptional response. As the number of GR peaks is substantially greater than the number of GR-regulated genes, and most genes have multiple GR peaks of different classes within the surrounding several hundred kilobases, it is difficult to clearly associate individual GR peaks or peak classes with specific genes. The distal nature of GR binding events and the enhancer-like characteristics of the chromatin under GR binding sites indicate that the GR signaling largely regulates transcription through modulation of enhancer activity. On the other hand, BRG1 was enriched at most active gene and enhancer TSSs, implicating a widespread role for BRG1 in facilitating transcriptional activity. A reasonable hypothesis for GR signaling would be that BRG1 binding at gene TSSs and GR binding sites/enhancers promotes chromatin looping. Long-range chromatin interactions have been implicated in GR transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vockley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hakim et al., 2009</xref>). It has also been suggested that clusters of GBSs interact with each other over long ranges to synergistically regulate transcription of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Holmqvist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vockley et al., 2016</xref>). Identifying such long-range interactions between GR and BRG1 would provide more insight into whether the different classes of GR binding sites are differentially utilized in regulating transcription. Such long range interactions could potentially provide functional rationale for the existence of ‘unproductive’ GR binding sites, which could be associated with transcriptionally active GR binding sites to cooperatively regulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, GR and BRG1 could regulate gene expression through decompaction of broad regions of chromatin surrounding gene TSSs and enhancers, such as has been reported at the Fkbp5 and Ms4xxx loci in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jubb et al., 2017</xref>). In either case, removing individual or combinations of GR peaks around candidate DEGs will allow for interrogation of how multiple GR binding events are coordinated to elicit a transcriptional response. The eventual identification of which GR binding sites are critical for transcriptional regulation in a given cell type will have wide-ranging implications for the pharmacological targeting of GR signaling for disease treatment.</p><p>We observed that BRG1 binding at Class II binding sites is predictive of potential GR interactions with pioneer factor binding sites. This finding is intriguing when considered along with the recent finding that FOXA1 binding is reorganized upon activation of ER or GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>). Like FOXA1, BRG1 binding is significantly reorganized upon hormone treatment and the majority of EtOH-specific and Dex-specific BRG1 peaks are not associated with GR binding sites [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>]. Thus, the rearrangement of BRG1 and FOXA1 binding does not appear to be dependent on direct interaction with GR. While these rearrangements occur within an hour of hormone treatment, it is possible that the reorganization of BRG1 and FOXA1 binding occurs secondarily to the initial GR binding events, which occur rapidly within the first several minutes of hormone treatment (unpublished data). Alternatively, it is also possible that a subset of interactions between GR, BRG1 and FOXA1 on chromatin are not detectable by standard ChIP methods. Single molecule analysis of GR, BRG1, and FOXA1 indicated that the majority of chromatin interactions occur with residence times of approximately 1 s, and a minority of events occur with longer residence times of 5 to 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paakinaho et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, chromatin binding by these factors in individual cells is highly dynamic. While ChIP-seq experiments represent the overall binding profile of these factors in large populations of cells, they still represent snapshots of the chromatin interaction profiles of these factors and could fail to detect the full expanse of rapid and dynamic binding events. As such, it remains unclear whether there is any set hierarchy of binding or timing/order of events of FOXA1, BRG1, and GR chromatin interactions. As suggested by the distinct patterns of interactions at GR peak classes, it is likely that several series of binding events occur at GR binding sites prior to and upon hormone signaling. Elucidating these distinct mechanisms will help to unravel the basic mechanisms of nuclear receptor signaling and the role of pioneer factors and chromatin remodeling complexes in facilitating chromatin interactions and modulating transcriptional output.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Chromatin structure plays a critical role in determining which sites are bound by the hormone-activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The authors describe a genomic study of the role of the BRG1 chromatin remodeler in Dex-induced binding of GR and transcription activation in a human breast cancer cell line. They show that the presence or absence of BRG1 can distinguish three specific classes of GR binding site chromatin. One of these classes (Class II) corresponds primarily to GR-site-containing enhancers that are already active before hormone addition; they are already associated with BRG1, the H3-K27ac active mark, the FOXA1 and GATA3 pioneer factors, and the enhancer DNA is accessible. Addition of Dex results in relatively strong binding of GR and increased binding of FOXA1 and GATA3 pioneer factors. They show that knock down of BRG1 prevents Dex-dependent binding of these pioneer factors. Of the other classes of GR site, Class I sites are not associated with BRG1 at all, indicating that GR binding is independent of BRG1, whereas Class III sites are associated with BRG1 only after Dex treatment. Both of these classes of site are associated with H3-K4me1 (which marks inactive/poised enhancers) and are less accessible than Class II enhancers. Overall, the authors provide important new insight into the complexity of GR binding site selection, the role of the BRG1 remodeler and the link to pioneer factors. This study is thorough, describes a lot of new data, and the paper is nicely written.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) A primary concern is that BRG1 knockdown (only 50% effective on WB) leads to ~50% decrease in GR nuclear translocation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), which was ignored by the authors and could per se explain the changes in GR binding and hormone responsiveness observed at the genomic level. Can the authors experimentally rule out the possibility that the effects they attribute to reduced BRG1 are in fact due to reduced GR? While it may be difficult to make the clean separation of nuclei from cytoplasm that is necessary to distinguish between nuclear Dex-bound activated GR and cytoplasmic inactive GR, control markers for the WB for nuclear and cytoplasmic markers may help.</p><p>2) The number of peaks that the authors identify is high (GR binding to 20K<sup>+</sup> sites) with relative low functional significance as only ~1200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The authors use MACS2 to call peaks and they seem to have a common problem with this type of analysis (over-calling peaks). They used regions of high depth in the untreated and input samples to filter out false positives but the discrepancy between the high number of GR-binding sites and the vastly lower number of functionally relevant DEGs brings the effectiveness of this method in question.</p><p>3) Another issue is that the authors used 8 hours of Dex treatment in the transcription studies (Figure 3), but the rest of the data are for 1 hour of Dex. The authors should comment on whether the difference in Dex treatment times could be important.</p><p>4) The authors should consider adding a &quot;cartoon&quot; figure as a summary of the properties of the three classes of GR site.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35073.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential Revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) A primary concern is that BRG1 knockdown (only 50% effective on WB) leads to ~50% decrease in GR nuclear translocation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), which was ignored by the authors and could per se explain the changes in GR binding and hormone responsiveness observed at the genomic level.

To address this directly, we have performed a new experiment to reduce GR protein levels by siRNA and compare the effects on target gene expression with those observed in the BRG1-KD conditions. Briefly, while GR knockdown did reduce the dex-induction of “lost” target genes, the effects caused by BRG1 knockdown were greater. This suggests that, while the reduction of GR levels following BRG1-KD may have some effect on transcription, knockdown of BRG1 is major driver of this altered gene expression.</p><p>We have added two new panels to F<underline>igure 3—figure supplement 1</underline> and added an additional paragraph discussing this to the Results section (subsection “BRG1 is required for the transcriptional hormone response”, third paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of peaks that the authors identify is high (GR binding to 20K<sup>+</sup> sites) with relative low functional significance as only ~1200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified.

We are confident in our GR peak calls for several reasons:</p><p>1) Our GR, BRG1, and input ChIP-seq experiments were sequenced at high-depth (greater than 60 million reads each) and produced high quality data with low signal-to-noise.</p><p>2) We called peaks using a fairly stringent 0.001 False Discovery Rate cutoff, and we have added this information to the Materials and methods section of the manuscript.</p><p>3) Calling peaks with Homer and using the same 0.001 False Discovery Rate threshold resulted even more peaks being called (~58,700).</p><p>4) Previously published data sets have identified a wide range of GR peaks in different cells types, including data sets in IMR90 and U2OS cells which identified &gt;40,000 GR peaks in each cell line (Starick et al., 2015). We have added a sentence indicating this to the Results section.</p><p>5) It has been proposed that clusters of multiple GR binding sites interact and synergize to regulate transcriptional activity (Vockley CM et al., Cell 2016). We have added a reference to this finding in our Discussion section (third paragraph).</p><p>Thus, abundance of GR peaks relative to DEGs is an intriguing feature of GR transcriptional regulation and we propose further investigation of this phenomenon in our Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another issue is that the authors used 8 hours of Dex treatment in the transcription studies (Figure 3), but the rest of the data are for 1 hour of Dex. The authors should comment on whether the difference in Dex treatment times could be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not sufficiently present the reasoning behind our choice of the 8hr Dex treatment timepoint for our A1A3 RNAseq experiment. We reasoned that 1hr treatment could potentially be insufficient to capture a “full” transcriptional response to Dex, and that an 8hr treatment would provide a greater panel of DEGs. Indeed, at 8hrs Dex we identified ~5x more DEGs than previously detected at 1hr by RNAseq in A1-2 cells. We have added an appropriate description of our rationale to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should consider adding a &quot;cartoon&quot; figure as a summary of the properties of the three classes of GR site.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have added a cartoon summary of the three peak classes as Figure 7 and referenced this figure in the Discussion section (first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
