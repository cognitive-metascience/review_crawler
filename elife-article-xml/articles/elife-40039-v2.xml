We previously showed that PsAvh52, an early-induced RxLR effector secreted from the soybean root rot pathogen, <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>, could suppress plant immunity. Here, we found that PsAvh52 is required for full virulence on soybean and binds to a novel soybean transacetylase, GmTAP1, in vivo and in vitro. PsAvh52 could cause GmTAP1 to relocate into the nucleus where GmTAP1 could acetylate histones H2A and H3 during early infection, thereby promoting susceptibility to <italic>P. sojae</italic>. In the absence of PsAvh52, GmTAP1 remained confined to the cytoplasm and did not modify plant susceptibility. These results demonstrate that GmTAP1 is a susceptibility factor that is hijacked by PsAvh52 in order to promote epigenetic modifications that enhance the susceptibility of soybean to <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40039.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just like animals, plants can become infected and diseased. Among the microbes that infect plants, one group tends to stand out. Named <italic>Phytophthora</italic> after the Greek for âthe plant destroyerâ, these fungus-like microbes cause diseases in many species of plant, including important food crops. These diseases are difficult to control, and as a result <italic>Phytophthora</italic> diseases cost the farming industry billions of dollars every year.</p><p>Effective control of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> diseases is likely to depend on scientists first gaining a better understanding of how these microbes infect plants. Also like animals, plants have an immune system to protect themselves from disease. Yet many disease-causing microbes make so-called effector proteins to overcome their hostsâ defenses. Previously in 2015, researchers reported that one effector made by a species known as <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> could suppress the immune system of soybean plants during the early stages of an infection. But it was not clear how the effector achieved this.</p><p>Now, Li et al., who include many of the researchers involved in the 2015 study, go on to show that the same effector, known as PsAvh52, helps <italic>P. sojae</italic> to infect soybean plants by interacting with a previously unknown soybean enzyme. The enzyme is a transacetylase, meaning it belongs to a group of enzymes that transfer a chemical marker called an acetyl group on to other molecules including proteins.</p><p>Li et al. went on to show that the PsAvh52 effector essentially hijacks the transacetylase enzyme, moving it to a location in the cell nucleus where it could chemically modify the proteins that package the soybean plantâs DNA. These chemical changes activate nearby genes that would have otherwise been switched off, and these incorrectly activated genes make the plant more susceptible to the infection.</p><p>By deciphering one of the strategies that helps <italic>P. sojae</italic> to infect soybean plants, Li et al. have uncovered two possible approaches that may help to get this plant disease under control. The findings highlight the effector PsAvh52 as a weapon that could be blocked; they also reveal the transacetylase enzyme as a vulnerable point in the plant that could be protected. The next step will be to explore if there are chemical or genetic means that can achieve either of these two goals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic modifications</kwd><kwd>Glycine max</kwd><kwd>histone acetylation</kwd><kwd>nuclear re-localization</kwd><kwd><italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic></kwd><kwd>plant susceptibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Creative Research Groups 31721004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yuanchao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010042</institution-id><institution>Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201303018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yuanchao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>China Agriculture Research System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARS-004-PS14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yuanchao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Key Programme 31430073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yuanchao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PsAvh52 modulates epigenetic modification to enhance the susceptibility of soybean to <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic modifications regulate numerous biological processes including growth and development and disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">GÃ³mez-DÃ­az et al., 2012</xref>). Epigenetic modifications, including chromatin remodeling by acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination of histones, affect the expression levels of defense genes upon pathogen attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have indicated that epigenetic regulation can be triggered by plant-pathogen interactions. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the transcription factor WRKY70, which activates salicylic acid (SA)-regulated defense-response genes, is epigenetically controlled through the trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Venegas et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> histone methyltransferases SET DOMAIN GROUP8 (SDG8) and SDG25 regulate immune responses triggered by PAMPs (pep1 and flg22) or effectors by modulating global histone lysine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Histone H2B monoubiquitination mediated by <italic>Arabidopsis HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1</italic> (<italic>HUB1</italic>) is involved in protecting plants against necrotrophic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhawan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Histone acetylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in remodeling chromatin structure and regulating gene expression in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger, 2007</xref>). The levels of histone acetylation are regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roth et al., 2001</xref>). Previous studies have shown that histone acetylation regulates plant immunity. For example, HDAC19 regulates resistance-gene expression in response to jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling during pathogen infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou, 2005</xref>). In rice, HDT701, which deacetylates histone H4 of defense-related genes, negatively modulates plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). However, the potential mechanisms by which pathogen effectors might regulate epigenetic modifications by interacting with HATs and HDACs remain unclear. Some reports have indicated that effectors secreted by plant pathogens are involved in epigenetic modifications that manipulate plant immunity. The <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> effector PsAvh23 suppresses defense gene expression to promote infection of soybean by inhibiting acetylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2017</xref>). Geminivirus TrAP inhibits histone methyltransferase SUVH4/KYP to decrease repressive H3K9me2 and DNA methylation, resulting in activation of viral virulence and plant susceptibility genes to attenuate host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castillo-GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2015</xref>). The maize pathogen, <italic>Cochliobolus carbonum</italic>, produces a non-ribosomal peptide toxin, HC Toxin, that inhibits the histone deacetylase of its host, resulting in hyperacetylation of both histones and non-histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ransom and Walton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walley et al., 2018</xref>). In the animal parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, effectors block STAT1-dependent transcription by manipulating the histone deacetylase complex Mi-2/NuRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olias et al., 2016</xref>). Although these cases suggest that pathogen manipulation of host epigenetic processes may be a broad virulence strategy, the full spectrum of underlying mechanisms remains unexplored.</p><p>Filamentous fungi and oomycete pathogens secrete intracellular and extracellular effectors to manipulate host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giraldo and Valent, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tyler et al., 2006</xref>). Oomycete-secreted RxLR effectors are cytoplasmic effectors that possess a conserved RxLR (Arg-x-Leu-Arg) motif to facilitate translocation from pathogens into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2008</xref>). However, the various mechanisms by which RxLR effectors manipulate plant immunity remain to be fully defined. Some plant targets of RxLR effectors have been identified that regulate plant immunity. For example, the <italic>P. infestans</italic> effector AVR3a manipulates plant immunity by stabilizing the host E3 ligase, CMPG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bos et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>P. sojae</italic> effectors PSR1 and PSR2 suppress RNA silencing in immune signaling pathways in plants to promote <italic>Phytophthora</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiao et al., 2013</xref>). The Nudix hydrolase activity of PsAvr3b reduces host NADH and ADP-ribose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2011</xref>) following activation by GmCYP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kong et al., 2015</xref>). PsAvh262 interacts with soybean proteins that control endoplasmic reticulum stress in order to modulate plant resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jing et al., 2016</xref>). PsAvr3c reprograms host pre-mRNA splicing to subvert plant immunity, to promote disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our previous research, we found that the transcript levels of the RxLR effector gene <italic>PsAvh52</italic> are strongly upregulated during the early stages (0.5Â âÂ 6 h.p.i.) of <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, PsAvh52 could suppress cell death induced by effectors and PAMPs in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) and soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). These results indicated that PsAvh52 could potentially suppress plant defense responses during the early stages of pathogen infection. In this study, we examined whether PsAvh52 is required for pathogenesis and the mechanism by which it suppresses plant immunity. We found that PsAvh52 was required for the full virulence of <italic>P. sojae</italic>, and promoted <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection when overexpressed in soybean hairy roots. PsAvh52 interacted with GmTAP1, a novel acetyltransferase, causing GmTAP1 to relocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, GmTAP1 acetylated core histones, up-regulating the expression of potential plant susceptibility genes. PsAvh52 targeted a different set of host genes than the effector that suppresses acetylation, PsAvh23, and at an earlier time point than PsAvh23.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PsAvh52 is a required factor for the full virulence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic></title><p>Genome sequence analysis found that PsAvh52 is conserved in four primary <italic>P. sojae</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

PsAvh52 could bind to the soybean acetyltransferase, GmTAP1, causing it to re-localize from the cytoplasm into nuclear speckles, a process that required the PsAvh52 NLS as well as protein-protein interactiondomains on both PsAvh52 and GmTAP1. Furthermore <italic>GmTAP</italic>-silencing in soybean hairy roots by RNAi reduced susceptibility to <italic>P. sojae</italic>. Finally, when GmTAP1 was localized into the nuclear speckles, it could increase the level of histone H2AK5 and H3K9 acetylation and enhanced plant susceptibility, both of which required the histone acetyltransferase enzyme activity of GmTAP1. Together, these results indicate that PsAvh52 recruits GmTAP1 to promote plant susceptibility through epigenetic modifications.</p><p>HATs include two broad classes based on their subcellular localization; namely, nuclear localization and cytoplasmic localization. The cytoplasmic HATs acetylate newly synthesized histones prior to their assembly into nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Workman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boycheva et al., 2014</xref>). Although we only observed cytoplasmic localization by GmTAP1 in the absence of PsAvh52, several pieces of evidence suggest that it may be targeted to the nucleus under certain conditions. First, it belongs to the GNAT family of nuclear-targeted histone acetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Workman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boycheva et al., 2014</xref>). Second, it acetylated histones H2A and H3, whereas canonical cytoplasmic HATs are specific for histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Workman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boycheva et al., 2014</xref>). Third, when it was targeted to the nucleus by addition of an NLS, it displayed a specific sub-nuclear localization (nuclear speckles) suggesting that it had natural targets in the nucleus. Fourth, when its N-terminal PsAvh52-interaction domain was removed, it localized substantially into the nucleus, but it did not localize in the nuclear speckles nor could it promote <italic>Phytophthora</italic> infection. Thus, the N-terminal domain may regulate the sub-cellular localization of GmTAP1, excluding it from the nucleus as the default state, but targeting it to the nuclear speckles when it is transported into the nucleus. Together these results suggest that, under certain physiological conditions and/or in certain tissues, GmTAP1 may relocate into the nuclear speckles to modify histone acetylation, and that relocation into the nucleus may be regulated by proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain. If this is true, then PsAvh52 has evolved to subvert the normal process by which the activity of GmTAP1 activity is regulated. PsAvh52 localized to the nuclear speckles and this localization required the M4 GmTAP1-interaction domain. However, since <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> contains a GmTAP1 homolog, our data do not reveal whether PsAvh52 has an intrinsic speckle-targeting capability, or whether it relies on binding to GmTAP1 to target the speckles. Our current model is that PsAvh52 physically recruits GmTAP1 into the nucleus as a protein-protein complex, and that once in the nucleus, the complex is targeted to nuclear speckles through speckle-targeting signals on GmTAP1 at least, and perhaps on PsAvh52 also. However, since we did not identify a protein complex containing nuclear importins, PsAvh52 and GmTAP1 (and did not try to), we cannot rule out other mechanisms that do not involve PsAvh52 and GmTAP1 entering the nuclear as a physical complex. Nuclear speckles have most often been described as complexes involved in pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galganski et al., 2017</xref>). Our data do not indicate whether the speckles targeted by PsAvh52 and GmTAP1 are also involved in pre-mRNA processing or whether we have observed a new class of speckles.</p><p>We note that extended over-expression of PsAvh52 and GmTAP1 for 36 hr to 48 hr in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells resulted in an apparent uniform distribution of the two proteins throughout the nucleus rather than concentration in the nuclear speckles. Our data do not distinguish whether the nuclear speckles had become saturated with GmTAP1-PsAvh52 resulting in the excess complex accumulating in the nucleoplasm, or whether the complexes dissociated from the speckles over time. Many nuclear speckles are dynamic structures and proteins associated with nuclear speckles may diffusely distribute throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sleeman et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>GmTAP2 showed 85% sequence identity with GmTAP1 in soybean, differing primarily in the N-terminus. When expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, GmTAP2 localized to the cytoplasm and also to the nucleus, but did not localize to nuclear speckles in either the presence or absence of PsAvh52. Furthermore, GmTAP2 did not bind to PsAvh52 and expression of GmTAP2 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> did not affect plant immunity. In addition, similar to GmTAP2, expression of GmTAP1<sup>atd</sup> which also localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus did not affect histone acetylation or plant immunity in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. These observations are consistent with our model that in order to promote susceptibility, GmTAP1 must be targeted to certain nuclear speckles via the concerted action of the PsAvh52 and the N-terminal domain of GmTAP1.</p><p>The closest homolog of GmTAP1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is the nuclear shuttle protein-interacting protein (AtNSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGarry, 2003</xref>). AtNSI was identified as binding to the nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) of cabbage leaf curl geminivirus and as having the ability to acetylate histones H2A and H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGarry, 2003</xref>), consistent with our findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGarry, 2003</xref> did not observe that AtNSI could activate transcription, but used only an in vitro assay for this test. They proposed that AtNSI may regulate the ability of NSP to regulate the shuttling of geminivirus DNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGarry, 2003</xref>). Thus GmTAP1/AtNSI may have been co-opted by two very different pathogens.</p><p>GmTAP1 re-localization from cytoplasm to nucleus is a significant effect of the presence of PsAvh52. The manipulation of host protein localization by effectors is an emerging theme in pathogen virulence mechanisms. Two other <italic>P. sojae</italic> effectors, PsCRN63 and PsCRN115, could recruit the catalase NbCAT1 into the plant nucleus to perturb H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis, and promote <italic>Phytophthora</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> effector Pi03192 prevented the transport of two plant NAC transcription factors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus during infection, which promoted disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McLellan et al., 2013</xref>). Another <italic>P. infestans</italic> effector, Pi04314, could bind to the host protein phosphatase one catalytic subunit (PP1c), causing it to re-localize from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, promoting <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boevink et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>P. infestans</italic> effector AVRblb2, bound to plant protease C14 at the haustorial interface, preventing its secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bozkurt et al., 2011</xref>). Our finding that PsAvh52 caused GmTAP1 to relocate into host nuclear speckles to acetylate histones and promote susceptibility adds to this growing theme.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that protein acetylation plays a key role in host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">GÃ³mez-DÃ­az et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robert McMaster et al., 2016</xref>). Some pathogens enhance both host histone and non-histone protein acetylation to alter host immunity by secreting effectors that have acetyltransferase enzyme activity or that modulate host acetylases or deacetylases during a susceptible interaction. For example, HC toxin secreted by the fungal pathogen <italic>Cochliobolus carbonum</italic> inhibits maize histone deacetylase (HD) and increases the acetylation level of H3 and H4, which may affect transcription at specific gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ransom and Walton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walley et al., 2018</xref>). Here we showed that PsAvh52 could cause GmTAP1 to relocate into nuclear speckles to enhance global acetylation of H2AK5 and H3K9 during early <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2017</xref> showed that another <italic>P. sojae</italic> effector, PsAvh23, attenuated the acetylation of H3K9 by binding to the ADA2 subunit of the histone acetyltransferase complex, SAGA. Examination of the timing of expression of <italic>PsAvh52</italic> and <italic>PsAvh23</italic>, and the levels of H3K9 acetylation during infection by wild type <italic>P. sojae</italic>, and by <italic>PsAvh52</italic> and <italic>PsAvh23</italic> knockout strains, suggests that these two effectors may coordinately manipulate H3K9 acetylation levels to optimally promote <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection. <italic>PsAvh52</italic> transcript levels peak at 1 hr post infection and then decline steadily over the next 11 to 23 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, transcript levels of <italic>PsAvh23</italic> are initially very low and do not rise substantially until after 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). During the period from 6 to 12 hr, the transcript levels of <italic>PsAvh52</italic> and <italic>PsAvh23</italic> cross over (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). During wild type <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection, the global acetylation levels of H2AK5 and H3K9 first increase (0Â âÂ 9 hr) and then sharply fall (after 12 hr). However, during infection by <italic>P. sojae</italic> strains carrying a <italic>PsAvh23</italic> deletion (and a functional <italic>PsAvh52</italic> gene), H3K9 acetylation level rise rapidly during infection, but never fall after 9 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, during infection by a <italic>PsAvh52</italic> deletion strain (carrying a functional <italic>PsAvh23</italic> genes), H3K9 acetylation levels never rise, but remain at levels typical of late infection, and there is no further drop after 9 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>PsAvh23</italic> or silencing of its target gene, <italic>GmADA2</italic>, strongly suppressed the expression of multiple defense genes including ones encoding transcription factors and MAP kinase kinase kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2017</xref>). However, none of those genes were affected by over-expression of <italic>PsAvh52</italic> or by silencing of <italic>GmTAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). On the other hand, several putative susceptibility genes were elevated by overexpression of <italic>PsAvh52</italic> or silencing of <italic>GmTAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Together, these observations suggest a model in which <italic>PsAvh52</italic> acts early in infection to promote H3K9 acetylation, stimulating the expression of susceptibility genes, and then <italic>PsAvh23</italic> acts to reverse the action of <italic>PsAvh52</italic>, and also to block any host-mediated increases in H3K9 acetylation that may support the expression of plant defense genes. It will be of interest to determine if there are additional mechanisms, other than timing of expression, that determine which host genes are targeted by the actions of these two effectors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>)</td><td>P6497</td><td>PMID: 1128796</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic>)</td><td>LT263</td><td>PMID: 28318979</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>)</td><td><italic>PsAvh52</italic></td><td>JGI Physo3 <break/>database</td><td>ID:356704</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Glycine max</italic>)</td><td><italic>GmTAP1</italic></td><td>Phytozome database</td><td>ID: <break/>Glyma.18G216900.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>anti-GST</td><td>Abmart</td><td>M20007</td><td>Western bloting <break/>(1:5000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>anti-His</td><td>Abmart</td><td>M30111</td><td>Western bloting (1:5000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>anti-GFP</td><td>Abmart</td><td>M20004</td><td>Western bloting (1:5000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Rat monoclonal)</td><td>anti-RFP</td><td>Chromotek</td><td>5f8</td><td>Western bloting (1:5000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Anti-Flag</td><td>Sigma</td><td>F3165</td><td>Western bloting (1:5000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>anti-H3ac</td><td>Millipore</td><td>382158</td><td>Western bloting <break/>(1:2500 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>anti-H3K9ac</td><td>Millipore</td><td>06â942</td><td>Western bloting (1:2500 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>anti-H3K14ac</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab52946</td><td>Western bloting (1:2500 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>anti-H2K5ac</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab45152</td><td>Western bloting (1:2500 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody <break/>(Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>anti-H2AK9ac</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab177312</td><td>Western bloting (1:2500 dilution)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vector construction</title><p>The <italic>PsAvh52</italic> gene and other <italic>P. sojae</italic> RxLR genes were cloned without their signal peptide coding regions from cDNA of P6497. <italic>GmTAP</italic> genes were cloned from cDNA of soybean cultivar Williams 82.

The levels of histone acetylation were quantified by ImageJ software.</p><p>For in vivo HAT assays, GFP, GmTAP1, NLS-GmTAP1, NES-GmTAP1 and NLS-GmTAP1M1 were expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves as described above and then nuclear proteins were extracted as follows: (1) 6 g harvested plant tissue from each sample were ground in liquid nitrogen and then placed into a 50 ml BD tube with 30 ml TBST (1Â ÃÂ TBSÂ +Â 0.1% tween 20); (2) the BD tubes with samples were shaken gently at 4Â°C for 15 min; (3) the samples were filtered into new BD tubes with 2 layers of micro-cloth and centrifuged at 1500 g for 8 min at 4Â°C; (4) the supernatants were removed and each precipitate was resuspended in 800 Âµl 50% sucrose; (5) the suspensions were gently added under 800 Âµl 25% sucrose in 2 ml tubes and centrifuged at 13000 g for 1 min at 4Â°C; (6) steps (4) and (5) were repeated 7 times; (7) the final nuclear precipitates were resuspended in 100â300 Âµl nuclear lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1Â ÃÂ protease inhibitor cocktail) and vigorously shaken at 4Â°C for 30 min; (8) the lysates were centrifuged at 13000 g for 1 min at 4Â°C, then the supernatants were transferred into new 2 ml tubes; (9) 5Â ÃÂ SDS loading buffer (1/5 total volume) was added to the supernatants and the samples were boiled for 7 min. Then the samples were frozen until needed.</p><p>To test the levels of acetylation of the nuclear core histones, samples were analyzed using western blotting after 15% SDS-PAGE with the antibodies listed above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ChIP-PCR assays</title><p>Soybean hairy roots expressing <italic>PsAvh52</italic>-overexpression constructs or containing a control empty vector (EV) were inoculated with <italic>P. sojae</italic> and harvested 6 hr later. ChIP analysis was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). ChIP assays were performed after extracting chromatin. 5 g harvested plant tissue from each sample were ground in liquid nitrogen, washed twice using 10 ml M1 buffer (0.01 M Potassium Phosphate pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, Î²-mercaptoethanol, 11.85% Hexylene glycol) then washed twice with 10 ml M2 buffer (0.01 M Potassium Phosphate pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, Î²-mercaptoethanol, 11.85% Hexylene glycol, 0.5% Triton X-100). 20 Î¼l micrococcal nuclease (MNase: NEB M0247S) was added to digest nuclei in 2 ml MNB buffer (10% Sucrose, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 10 min at 37Â°C. After then, 50 Î¼l EDTA (0.5 M) is added to stop the nuclease digestion before adding antibodies. 3 Âµg antibodies (anti-H2K5ac, anti-H3K9ac) were added to the chromatin solution and agitated at 4 ËC overnight. 30 Î¼l protein A Dynabeads (Thermofisher, 10001D) were added to the chromatin-antibody solution and agitated for 6 hr or overnight at 4 ËC. The beads were recovered using magnetic separation then washed successively with 1 ml buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA), containing 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaCl, or 150 mM NaCl. 400 Î¼l elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) was added twice to elute the DNA at 42Â°C for 15 mins. The two eluates were combined and extracted using phenol-chloroform isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1) to remove remaining proteins, then the DNA was precipitated using ethanol overnight at â20Â°C, and washed twice with 70% ethanol. The sample was dried and dissolved in 20 Î¼l ddH<sub>2</sub>O. As controls, input DNA was recovered by phenol extraction after the nuclease digestion step. As a second control, the antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation procedure. To quantitate the genes present in the DNAs purified from the precipitated chromatin, the appropriate primers were added to qPCR reactions with the respective DNAs, and qPCR was performed. Specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) corresponded to a short (~100 bp) gene-specific region within 500 bp following the transcription start site of each gene. The ratio for each gene of interest was calculated from the chromatin samples from the roots expressing the constructs of interest compared to those containing the empty vector, after normalizing to the respective inputs. Each ratio was then divided by the same ratio calculated for the negative control gene (UBQ5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Transcript IDs of <italic>P. sojae</italic> genes in the JGI Physo3 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Physo3/Physo3.home.html">http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Physo3/Physo3.home.html</ext-link>): <italic>PsAvh52</italic> (ID: 356704), <italic>PsAvh53</italic> (ID: 287363), <italic>PsAvh137</italic> (ID: 288597).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jian-Min Zhou as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul RJ Birch (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study Wang and colleagues report a new mechanism by which <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> causes disease on soybean. They show that the RXLR effector protein <italic>PsAvh52</italic> is required for full virulence on soybean by targeting GmTAP1, an acetyltransferase. Convincing evidence is provided to show that GmTAP1 negatively regulates plant disease resistance through its acetyltransferase activity. The authors also show that GmTAP1 and <italic>PsAvh52</italic> are associated with increased acetylation of histones and upregulation of several candidate susceptibility genes in hairy roots. Importantly, GmTAP1 is localized in the cytoplasm, but translocates into nuclear speckles in the presence of <italic>PsAvh52</italic>. This requires both the NLS sequence and a sequence between RXLR motif and NLS in <italic>PsAvh52</italic>. Overall, this is nicely done work providing new mechanistic insight into pathogenesis by <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A/B â it would be normal and standard to complement a KO. Please complement the <italic>avh52</italic> KO mutant and perform virulence assays.</p><p>2) The relationship between virulence function of <italic>PsAvh52</italic> and nuclear speckle localization of GmTAP1 is interesting but not fully worked out. Significant amount of GmTAP1atd is localized in the nucleus, but not nuclear speckles (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B). Is overexpression of GmTAP1atd sufficient for histone acetylation and susceptibility to <italic>P. capsici</italic> or <italic>P. sojae</italic>? If not, it would further support a role of nuclear speckle localization in susceptibility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40039.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A/B â it would be normal and standard to complement a KO. Please complement the avh52 KO mutant and perform virulence assays.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>P. sojae</italic> we currently only have one selectable marker in routine use, namely G418 resistance. Thus complementation of CRISPR mutants is currently challenging. In some cases it is possible to select variant transformants that have lost their G418 resistance. We attempted to do that with the <italic>PsAvh52</italic> KO <italic>P. sojae</italic> mutants. The two mutants were repeatedly passaged on vegetable (V8) juice agar medium without antibiotics (G418), but the <italic>PsAvh52</italic> KO <italic>P. sojae</italic> mutants could still grow on the vegetable (V8) juice agar medium with antibiotics. This complementation of the <italic>PsAvh52</italic> mutants was not feasible. We note that the same phenotypes were obtained with two independent transformants, but not with a control transformant that had not lost <italic>PsAvh52</italic>. We also note the extensive data presented in the remainder of the manuscript in support of the conclusion that <italic>PsAvh52</italic> contributed to the virulence of <italic>P. sojae</italic>. In particular, we point to the data of Figure 4D that shows that <italic>PsAvh52</italic> mutant T37 is equally virulent as WT when <italic>GmTAP</italic>-silenced roots are inoculated; those data support that the loss of virulence of T37 is specific and not an artifact of the transformation process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relationship between virulence function of PsAvh52 and nuclear speckle localization of GmTAP1 is interesting but not fully worked out. Significant amount of GmTAP1atd is localized in the nucleus, but not nuclear speckles (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B). Is overexpression of GmTAP1atd sufficient for histone acetylation and susceptibility to P. capsici or P. sojae? If not, it would further support a role of nuclear speckle localization in susceptibility.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original submission, we showed that overexpression of GmTAP1<sup>atd</sup> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> could not promote <italic>P. capsici</italic> susceptibility. In the revised manuscript, we have added the result that overexpression of GmTAP1<sup>atd</sup> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> could not increase histone acetylation. This supports the conclusion that speckle localization of GmTAP1 is required for acetylating histones and promoting susceptibility. We have modified the manuscript title accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
