symmetric, enveloped particle, covered by 90 dimers of envelope protein (E), which mediates viral attachment and membrane fusion. Fusion requires a dimer-to-trimer transition and membrane engagement of hydrophobic ‘fusion loops’. We previously characterized the steps in membrane fusion for the related West Nile virus (WNV), using recombinant, WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) for single-particle experiments (Chao et al., 2014). Trimerization and membrane engagement are rate-limiting; fusion requires at least two adjacent trimers; availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane creates a trimerization bottleneck. We now report an extension of that work to dengue VLPs, from all four serotypes, finding an essentially similar mechanism. Small-molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection that target E block its fusion-inducing conformational change. We show that ~12–14 bound molecules per particle (~20–25% occupancy) completely prevent fusion, consistent with the proposed mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>virus entry</kwd><kwd>flavivirus</kwd><kwd>inhibitor mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA13202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI109740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008601</institution-id><institution>Charles A.

The envelope glycoprotein (E) is the membrane fusogen required for cell entry and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Harrison, 2015</xref>). E comprises three beta-sheet rich domains: domain I (DI) is a central beta barrel that organizes the rest of the subunit; domain II (DII: an extension emanating from DI) bears a hydrophobic fusion loop at its distal tip; domain III (DIII), with an immunoglobulin-like fold, connects to the C-terminal ‘stem’ and transmembrane helical hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rey et al., 1995</xref>). The conserved, fusion-inducing conformational rearrangements these proteins undergo when exposed to reduced pH, from a pre-fusion dimer to a post-fusion trimer, offer an opportunity to exploit the common structural features of all flavivirus E proteins to find viral entry inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36461.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flavivirus membrane fusion</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Steps in the fusion transition.

This pocket closes up during the fusogenic conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Modis et al., 2004</xref>), and the observation that a small molecule can bind there suggested that it might be a good target for an entry inhibitor. Indeed, a screen originally designed to detect small molecules that interfere with another step in the conformational transition yielded a series of cyanohydrazone compounds that bind a soluble DI-DII fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). These compounds block fusion in vitro and infection in cell culture; they bind the E protein on the virion surface before the virus attaches to a cell. The most potent of them inhibit viral infectivity with IC<sub>90</sub> values in the single-digit micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies of the effects of mutation on members of several chemically distinct series of inhibitors, including the cyanohydrazones, confirm that the β-OG pocket is indeed their binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wispelaere et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In previous work on the mechanism of membrane fusion by West Nile virus (WNV) E, we used single-particle fusion measurements with WNV virus-like particle (VLPs) to outline steps in the transition leading to membrane merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). We could interpret the observed, pH-dependent kinetics with a model in which trimerization of E into an extended intermediate, with the three fusion loops inserted into the target membrane, becomes a kinetic bottleneck in progression to hemifusion, because hemifusion requires collapse to the postfusion conformation of at least two <italic>adjacent</italic> trimers in a ~30 monomer contact zone between a virus particle and the membrane with which it is fusing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Stochastic simulations gave estimates for the rates of various steps. In the present work, we have extended the analysis to all four dengue virus (DV) serotypes, using VLPs as in our studies of WNV fusion. We also use the single-particle approach to examine inhibition by compounds in the cyanohydrazone series and to estimate the number of small-molecule inhibitors per particle needed to block fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-particle measurement of dengue VLP hemifusion kinetics</title><p>VLPs for the four DV serotypes were prepared by expression in 293 T cells, essentially as described for WNV VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chao et al., 2014</xref>).

We incorporated into the target bilayer a pseudo-receptor, to uncouple membrane attachment from exposure of the fusion loop triggered by the pH drop. The receptor was either the lectin domain of DC-SIGN-R linked through a histidine tag to a NiNTA-headgroup lipid or a similarly linked, antigen-binding fragment (Fab) from antibody 1AID-2, specific for DV2 domain II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003</xref>).

We confirmed that the modified form of the inhibitor was active by recording bulk hemifusion inhibition and found its IC<sub>50</sub> to be about 10- to 20-fold higher that of the unmodified compound; the strong tendency of these hydrophobic compounds to associate in solution reduces the effective monomer concentration, and the actual difference may be smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also showed that 3-110-22 competed for binding with the modified inhibitor, indicating that they both interact at the same site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>We incubated DV2 VLPs with 1 μM Alexa-555/3-110-22, removed excess compound with a desalting column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), and measured single-particle hemifusion events. We determined inhibitor occupancy for each particle using a calibrated intensity in the Alexa-555 channel (see Materials and methods) and correlated the occupancy with hemifusion fate of that particle. At pH 5.5 under the conditions of our experiment, the overall yield of hemifusion in the absence of inhibitor was ~25% (i.e. the percent of total particles in the observation field that ultimately fused). Particles with more than about 12 bound inhibitors failed to fuse at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We did not detect particles with more than about 60 copies of Alexa-555/33-110-22, showing that binding saturated at an occupancy consistent with a large fraction of ‘small VLPs’ (~60 E subunits) in the preparation. Assuming that the contact zone between the particle and the membrane includes about 30 E subunits (i.e. about half a small VLP) and that binding at one site is independent of the occupancy of any other site, then ~6 bound inhibitors in the contact should block fusion completely. The percent of uncleaved prM, estimated from Western blots, was between 10 and 20% for various preparations. Residual uncleaved prM is usually found in a single cluster on virus particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Plevka et al., 2011</xref>); it should therefore be absent from the contact zone with the target membrane, to which the prM associated E cannot attach. If there were no binding of the fluorescent inhibitor to prM-associated E, our estimate for the number of bound inhibitors per fully mature particle needed to prevent fusion completely would be about 14, rather than 12, or 7 in the contact zone, rather than 6. Thus, presence of a small fraction of uncleaved prM on the particles in our experiments would have had at most a relatively small effect on our determination of the inhibitory threshold.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36461.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Frequency of hemifusion (measured as DiD fluorescence dequenching) as a function of number of bound Alexa-fluor-555/3-110-22 molecules.</title><p>Histogram shows the number of particles with a particular number of bound fluorescent inhibitor molecules, in bins of five.

A hexagonal array of 30 E protomers represents the contact patch between viral and cell membranes. Each E subunit transits between an inactive state (in a dimer) and an activated monomer, which can trimerize when two other adjacent monomers are activated. Hemifusion occurs upon formation of two adjacent trimers. Dimer pairs are explicitly defined in the simulation, and a cooperativity factor increases the probability of activation when the dimer partner is already activated. The threshold for trimerization was set to pH 5.4, the bulk threshold for hemifusion, based on our previous finding that these two thresholds are the same for WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chao et al., 2014</xref>).

The inhibitor and its analogs bind E on the virion surface before the particle attaches to a cell, at a site on each of the E monomers that closes up during the transition from prefusion dimer to postfusion trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Modis et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wispelaere et al., 2018</xref>). The bound molecules appear to fix the E protein in the conformation present in the prefusion dimer, blocking progression along the fusogenic pathway. We have shown that the assay originally used to identify the cyanohydrzone inhibitors probably worked because these molecules lock the hinge in a dimer-like configuration, even in the context of a fusion-intermediate trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). Synthesis of a fluorescent derivative has now enabled us to examine its effects on a single-particle basis and hence to derive not only a bulk inhibitory IC<sub>50</sub> but to determine the fusion efficiency as a function of the number of molecules bound.</p><p>Most of the particles in our preparations were small, ~60 subunit VLPs. As we concluded above from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the parameter likely to be relevant to small-molecule inhibition is the number of E proteins in the contact zone between particle and target membrane, estimated here, as in our previous work, as ~30. The experimental results show that about 6–7 inhibited monomers in a 30-monomer contact zone (a fractional occupancy of about 0.2) will be enough to prevent fusion completely (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our previous work with WNV VLPs showed that virions, virion-sized (180-subunit) VLPs, and small VLPs have indistinguishable fusion kinetics, including their pH dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, about 35 inhibitors per dengue virion (i.e. about 20% occupancy) should block any detectable fusion, assuming that for complete inhibition the threshold density of bound inhibitor is the same for the two size classes. An important inference is that complete (or nearly complete) inhibition should occur at concentrations substantially lower than the Kd for an individual binding event.</p><p>In the simulation scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, modeling the effect of inhibitor binding to a monomer, at any step in the fusogenic conformational change, by inactivating at random seven monomers does not lead to full inhibition without further restrictions on the model. That is, there are ways of distributing inactivated monomers within the 30-monomer contact zone that still allow two neighboring, activated trimers to form, although in general more slowly than if all monomers could participate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We suggest two potential explanations: (i) failure of an inhibitor-free trimer to associate with the target membrane, leading to an abortive fold-back with insertion of the fusion loops into the virion membrane instead; (ii) dimer cooperativity, such that binding of inhibitor to one dimer partner inactivates (with some probability) the other, for example, by inhibiting dimer dissociation, thereby preventing the unliganded partner from forming an active trimer with other neighbors. The former mechanism would add a dead-end side reaction to the trimer zippering step in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It is precisely analogous to the mechanism that accounts for a closely related observation in studies of influenza virus fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ivanovic and Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Otterstrom et al., 2014</xref>). The latter mechanism would generate more effectively inhibited monomers than actual bound inhibitor molecules. Both inspection of diagrams such as the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and modified simulations with randomly inactivated monomers in the contact zone show that a total of eight or nine inactive monomers in the contact zone -- just one or two in addition to the seven with bound inhibitor -- would be enough to rule out formation of two adjacent, active trimers. Thus, the abortive trimer model would require only a low frequency of dead-end events, with minimal effect on fusion yield or kinetics in the inhibitor-free case (see also the similar conclusion for influenza fusion: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ivanovic and Harrison, 2015</xref>), and the dimer cooperativity model would require a relatively low probability for inactivation of the unliganded dimer partner (e.g. only partial inhibition of dimer dissocation). The geometrical idealizations inherent in the current simulation model do not allow us to distinguish between these alternatives.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Virus-like particles (VLPs)</title><p>Dengue virus-like particles were produced from a stable, mycoplasma-free 293 T cell line (obtained originally from the Broad Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Luo et al., 2008</xref>), maintained in our laboratories since then, and not further characterized) transfected with the pVRC8400 expression vector bearing a structural cassette containing a codon-optimized version of the prM-E sequence from the DV 1 clone 45AZ5, DV two clone Harvard/BID-V2992/2009, DV three isolate IN/BID-V2417/1984, or DV4 isolate TVP/360.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;How small-molecule inhibitors of dengue-virus infection interfere with viral membrane fusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this Research Advance article, Chao et al. extend the work they published in a research article in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2014 on the mechanism and dynamics of membrane fusion of West Nile (WN) virus-like particles to all four dengue virus serotypes. As in the original study, membrane fusion is assayed with liposomes in bulk, in and a single particle assay with a planar lipid bilayer installed in customized microfluidic cells imaged by TIRF microscopy. The 2014 study is extended further with experiments examining the mechanism of inhibition by a small hydrophobic compound, 3-110-22, previously identified as inhibitors of the fusogenic conformational transition in dengue virus. The authors then determined the minimum number of inhibitor molecules per virus like particle (VLP) to completely prevent fusion. The observed minimum number per VLP (15) along with a simulation suggests a model where the inhibitor interferes with the transition from dimer to monomer of the envelope protein.</p><p>All referees agree that your study constitutes an interesting extension of your previous work to a medically more relevant virus, confirming that the stochastic simulations developed previously indeed produces meaningful results. Thus, the referees suggest in principle publication provided that the following two issues are addressed during revision:</p><p>1) Most importantly, a possible caveat is that the authors have used 293T cells to produce the VLPs. A previous study reported that dengue virions produced in 293T cells yield near 70% uncleaved prM (Dejnirattisai et al., Nature Immunology 2015), and the presence of prM inactivates its E partner for fusion. In the previous publication on WNV, the authors had explicitly verified that uncleaved prM was only a minimal proportion of the particles. It seems important that they quantify here the amount of uncleaved prM, and if its contribution is important, it would require to explicitly model its presence in their simulations.</p><p>2) Another concern is regarding the location of the 3-110-22 binding site. The authors show that 3-110-22 and the fluorescently labeled analog compete for the same binding site, which is &quot;presumed&quot; to be the detergent binding pocket of the E protein. Based on the fusion simulation data and on the maximum number of fluorophore per VLP the compound is proposed to bind to the E protein dimer and inhibit the dimer to monomer transition as opposed to other steps downstream in the fusion reaction. Ultimately, a structure of the bound inhibitor would be of interest, but this is outside the scope of this Research Advance. In the absence of such a structure (or structure/function mutagenesis), a more in depth discussion of the likely binding site and likely mechanism of inhibition would be desirable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36461.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All referees agree that your study constitutes an interesting extension of your previous work to a medically more relevant virus, confirming that the stochastic simulations developed previously indeed produces meaningful results.
