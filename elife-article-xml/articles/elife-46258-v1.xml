Elucidating the structure-function relationships governing OMPs within native membrane environments remains challenging. We constructed a diverse library of &gt;3000 monoclonal antibodies to assess the roles of extracellular loops (ECLs) in LptD, an essential OMP that inserts lipopolysaccharide into the outer membrane of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Epitope binning and mapping experiments with LptD-loop-deletion mutants demonstrated that 7 of the 13 ECLs are targeted by antibodies. Only ECLs inaccessible to antibodies were required for the structure or function of LptD. Our results suggest that antibody-accessible loops evolved to protect key extracellular regions of LptD, but are themselves dispensable. Supporting this hypothesis, no α-LptD antibody interfered with essential functions of LptD. Our experimental workflow enables structure-function studies of OMPs in native cellular environments, provides unexpected insight into LptD, and presents a method to assess the therapeutic potential of antibody targeting.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46258.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria which threaten global public health. Antibiotics interfere with essential processes in bacteria so they are unable to divide or survive, but over time, the microbes have found ways to become immune to the drugs. New antibiotics are now desperately needed.</p><p>Gram-negative bacteria are wrapped in an outer membrane made of large molecules called lipopolysaccharides. This structure is an extra barrier to molecules (such as drugs) that try to enter the cell, but it could also hold new targets for antibiotics to exploit.</p><p>A protein called LptD is embedded in the outer membrane, where it inserts new lipopolysaccharides. It is critical for bacteria to grow and survive, and is a relatively new potential target for antibiotic development. The protein has a number of ‘extracellular loops’ that extend into the environment, but their roles in the structure and the activity of LptD are still largely unknown. This is partly due to a lack of tools to investigate these elements.</p><p>In response, Storek et al. built a library of over 3,000 custom antibodies, which are small Y-shaped proteins that can each recognise a specific portion in one of the extracellular loops and potentially incapacitate LptD. The antibodies were used to target LptD in its native environment, when it is embedded in the bacteria. In parallel, mutant bacteria were created in which the loops were genetically removed one by one to assess their importance for LptD activity.</p><p>The experiments revealed that although the antibodies could target most extracellular loops, they could not target the few loops that were essential for LptD to work properly. This suggests that antibody-accessible loops are expendable and that these structures could serve to shield other regions of LptD which are critical for survival.</p><p>The findings will help to prioritise research that develops other approaches to inhibit LptD. Finally, the antibody workflow designed by Storek et al. can serve as a road map to study other membrane proteins in their native cellular environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LptD</kwd><kwd>outer membrane</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>K. pneumoniae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004328</institution-id><institution>Genentech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storek</surname><given-names>Kelly M</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Joyce</given-names></name><name><surname>Vij</surname><given-names>Rajesh</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiang</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Zhonghua</given-names></name><name><surname>Bevers</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name><name><surname>Koth</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vernes</surname><given-names>Jean-Michel</given-names></name><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>JianPing</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallweber</surname><given-names>Heidi</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalmas</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Shriver</surname><given-names>Stephanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Tam</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>Kellen</given-names></name><name><surname>Seshasayee</surname><given-names>Dhaya</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Peter A</given-names></name><name><surname>Payandeh</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><name><surname>Koerber</surname><given-names>James T</given-names></name><name><surname>Comps-Agrar</surname><given-names>Laetitia</given-names></name><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>Steven T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dispensable loops shield the functionally-important extracellular loops of the essential Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane protein LptD from antibody interference.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is a permeability barrier to antibiotics and other cytotoxic agents, such as detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). A key feature of the OM is its distinctive asymmetrical bilayer populated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet and phospholipids in the inner leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Funahara and Nikaido, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamio and Nikaido, 1976</xref>). Lateral interactions between LPS molecules mediated by divalent cations on the surface and packing of hydrocarbon chains in the membrane impede the passage of both hydrophilic and large hydrophobic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). LPS is composed of a conserved lipid A molecule, a core oligosaccharide, and a variable O-antigen glycan. Lipid A is synthesized in the cytoplasm where the core oligosaccharide is attached to form core-LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whitfield and Trent, 2014</xref>). This molecule is flipped into the periplasmic space by the inner membrane ATPase MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). The O-antigen is appended onto core-LPS in the periplasm and LPS is transported to the outer leaflet of the OM by the <underline>LP</underline>S <underline>t</underline>ransport (Lpt) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abeyrathne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okuda et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, all 7 components of the Lpt pathway, LptABCDEFG, are essential and shuttle LPS molecules from the IM across the periplasm to the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okuda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okuda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). LptD is a β-barrel outer membrane protein (OMP) responsible for the final unidirectional insertion of LPS into the OM outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). The LptD β-barrel is comprised of 26 anti-parallel β-strands with a proposed lateral gate formed where the first and last β-strands interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>). Like other Gram-negative β-barrel OMPs, LptD possess long extracellular, environmentally-exposed loops and short periplasmic loops connecting adjacent strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin and Slusky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rollauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schulz, 2002</xref>). The roles of the extracellular loops (ECLs) in folding or activity of LptD have not been determined. LptD forms an obligate interaction with the OM lipoprotein LptE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chimalakonda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freinkman et al., 2011</xref>). An N-terminal jelly roll domain is located on the periplasmic side of the β-barrel below the lateral gate. Structural, biochemical, and genetic analyses suggest that the hydrophobic lipid A portion of LPS is embedded in the hydrophobic jelly roll domain. The presumed model for LPS transport across the OM posits that lipid A is inserted into the hydrophobic OM through a lateral gate of LptD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). By an unknown mechanism, the polar sugars of the LPS core oligosaccharide and O-antigen are presumably moved through the LptD β-barrel lumen and flipped to the exterior of the cell.</p><p>Due to its essential role in OM biogenesis, high conservation among Gram-negative bacteria, and exposure to the extracellular environment, LptD represents a potential new antibacterial target. Genetic experiments show that crosslinking LPS to LptD in the jelly roll domain or the lateral gate, or introduction of disulfide bonds that disrupt the proposed LPS path through LptD, inhibit growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, two antibacterial peptides targeting LptD have been described, both presumably targeting the periplasmic jelly roll domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srinivas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vetterli et al., 2018</xref>). Critical roles for ECLs in OMP function have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Browning et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rigel et al., 2013</xref>). For example, removal of the LptD extracellular loop 4 (L4), <italic>imp</italic>4213, is known to disrupt the OM barrier leading to sensitization to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sampson et al., 1989</xref>). However, the roles of the extracellular LptD loops remain largely underexplored due to a lack of robust tools to systematically assess structure-function relationships in the context of a native OM.</p><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent useful tools to probe protein structure and function because they typically have high target specificity and affinity. Accordingly, here we pursued four diverse strategies to produce thousands of mAbs that bound to LptD. The breadth and depth of mAb discovery that we report here is unusual, especially for an integral membrane protein, and also takes advantage of an efficient and novel targeted boost-and-sort α-OMP discovery approach recently reported for another OMP, BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vij et al., 2018</xref>). Characterization of the α-LptD mAbs discovered herein allowed us to map the environmentally-exposed surfaces of LptD and to systematically explore the structure-function relationship of the large ECLs of this essential OMP within its native OM environment. Through the construction and characterization of LptD loop deletion strains, we identified non-exposed loops that are critical for LptD function under defined conditions, which are all inaccessible to antibody interference. Our data provide unique insights into the structure and function of LptD and suggest that non-antibody approaches for interfering with the function of this essential OMP in <italic>E. coli</italic> should be prioritized to develop novel antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying α-LptD mAbs that bind to extracellular LptD loops</title><p>To probe the functional relevance of the ECLs of the essential <italic>E. coli</italic> OMP LptD, we set out to discover α-LptD antibodies to these surface-exposed structures. We generated a diverse mAb library against <italic>E. coli</italic> LptD by running four independent discovery campaigns.

This result was not surprising considering that all protein immunization campaigns utilized only purified <italic>E. coli</italic> LptDE protein. Analysis of the surface-exposed portion of LptD predicted from experimental x-ray crystallographic structural models identified regions of &gt;5 amino acids that were conserved among all three Enterobacteriaceae species, the size of a typical hot spot of residues that contribute to antibody binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stave and Lindpaintner, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, we identified 10 (7%) α-LptD mAbs that bound to LptDE from all three species and 42 that bound either <italic>E. coli</italic> plus <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (22%) or <italic>E. coli</italic> plus <italic>E. cloacae</italic> (9%) LptDE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, our immunization campaigns using <italic>E. coli</italic> LptD-derived peptides and <italic>E. coli</italic> LptDE protein yielded diverse antibodies that bound to both unique and conserved extracellular accessible (i.e., FACS<sup>+</sup>) and extracellular-inaccessible or periplasmic (i.e., FACS<sup>-</sup>) epitopes.</p><p>The differences in cross-species reactivity of the α-LptD mAbs suggested that the FACS<sup>+</sup> antibodies bound multiple surface-exposed LptD epitopes. To determine if these antibodies bound unique extracellular epitopes, we tested α-LptD mAbs with the highest FACS<sup>+</sup> signal for their abilities to compete with each other for binding to purified <italic>E. coli</italic> LptDE. Every possible FACS<sup>+</sup> pair of α-LptD mAbs was screened for the ability to either bind LptDE protein simultaneously (i.e., different epitopes) or to compete for binding (i.e., same or nearby epitopes) using a SPR-based binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdiche et al., 2017</xref>). From these results, we constructed a surface epitope map for the FACS<sup>+</sup> α-LptD mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We identified two major epitope bins and a possible third bin with limited overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When the species cross-reactivity data were considered, most three-species cross-reactive α-LptD mAbs were tightly clustered, while those that bound only <italic>E. coli</italic> LptDE formed a distinct cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). There were some outliers to these trends with the dual-species binders and <italic>E. coli</italic>-only binders binning with the cross-reactive mAbs suggesting distinct, but overlapping epitopes.

Comparing these data with the species cross-reactivity and in vitro binding competition epitope map provided a complete picture of the mAb accessible surface of LptD.

Partitioning the mAbs with respect to the host animal used for immunization highlighted a trend for L6, L7, and L8 to be critical from the rat immunization campaign, while mAbs from the mouse immunization campaign tended to yield FACS<sup>+</sup> antibodies that required L8 and L9. Because these animals are likely not tolerized to the foreign bacterial LptD protein, this difference could reflect differences in the types of binding sites presented for rat versus mouse antibodies. Thus, even within these immunization campaigns, diverse binding profiles to the loop mutants were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LptD ECLs critical for function are not accessible</title><p>A potential application of antibodies raised against extracellularly-exposed bacterial proteins is as direct-acting antibacterial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LaRocca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Storek et al., 2018</xref>).

There are two essential OMPs embedded in the OM and involved in construction of the OM barrier. BamA is part of the β-barrel assembly machine that folds and inserts β-barrel OMPs, including BamA and LptD, into the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konovalova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ricci and Silhavy, 2012</xref>). LptD is the last protein in the Lpt pathway that establishes and maintains OM asymmetry by inserting LPS exclusively into the outer leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okuda et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the importance of these β-barrel OMPs, understanding of how their structures contributes to their folding and function is still incomplete.</p><p>Similar to other Gram-negative β-barrel OMPs, both BamA and LptD possess short periplasmic loops but long, variable, and environmentally-exposed ECLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin and Slusky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rollauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schulz, 2002</xref>). A deeper examination of the roles of these ECLs in a native OM context could contribute to a greater understanding of how they contribute to the structure and function of OMPs in general. To systematically interrogate the LptD ECLs, we performed four antibody discovery campaigns to generate thousands of antibodies targeting LptD to probe structure-function relationships of this essential OMP in its native OM environment. The unusual breadth and depth of our approach represents a powerful way to probe the accessible surfaces of the ECLs of LptD and to tease apart the changes that accompany LPS insertion by LptD in the native OM environment of the bacterial cell. By characterizing hundreds of these α-LptD mAbs, we discovered that extensive portions of the extracellular surface of LptD are dispensable in <italic>E. coli</italic> and critical features of LptD are likely occluded and protected by non-essential loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46258.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Antibody accessible ECLs of LptD.</title><p>Side view of LptD structure rendered in PyMol from <italic>E. coli</italic> LptDE with LptE removed (PDB 4RHB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malojcic et al., 2015</xref>]).

In an effort to probe as many extracellular epitopes as possible, we generated a large, diverse α-LptD mAb library by undertaking multiple immunization campaigns utilizing different antigens, adjuvants, and hosts. Varying antigens systematically presented LptD in increasingly complex arrangements to potentially capture different available epitopes. First, peptide immunizations utilized both linear peptides derived from conserved and non-conserved LptD ECL sequences and cyclic variants in an effort to constrain particular conformations. Next, purified full-length LptDE immunizations aimed to capture a more native state of the ECLs. Because the matrix in which the protein is reconstituted can alter the conformational flexibility and exposure of membrane-proximal epitopes, we utilized multiple reconstitution matrices (i.e., detergents and amphipols). Finally, using an approach that we have recently leveraged to find rare, inhibitory α-BamA antibodies, a targeted boost-and-sort strategy, we immunized rats with sub-lethal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections and then boosted them with purified LptDE protein to enrich for any LptD antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vij et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, our effort to maximize the epitope coverage in our α-LptD mAb library led to distinct clusters of antibodies that possessed differing abilities to cross-react with LptD species variants, required different ECLs for binding, and exhibited varying levels of access to LptD through the protective LPS layer. Although the full breadth of antibody diversity in our library required the multiple immunization approaches described here, we propose a streamlined workflow for future OMP efforts. An accessible approach is to immunize SD rats with recombinant purified OMP either with or without whole bacterial cells (strategies 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both of these workflows returned the highest percentages of FACS<sup>+</sup> antibodies coupled with recognition of diverse epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the ease of manipulating bacterial strains, it could even be possible to steer immunizations towards particular ECLs by initially immunizing with a ΔECL-OMP strain followed by boosting with recombinant protein.</p><p>Other scaffolds or antibodies from different host species might be able to recognize distinct epitopes on the exposed portions of LptD. For example, recognition of partially buried epitopes could be achieved using species, such as rabbits, chickens, llamas, or camels, that contain longer CDRH3s that are better suited to reach into cavities on a particular antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lavinder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muyldermans and Smider, 2016</xref>). In the case of the mouse and rat antibodies described here, we found that seven different LptD ECLs, out of a total of 13, could affect binding of the mAbs and the remaining six loops are likely partially or fully buried based on models from crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When this α-LptD mAb campaign is combined with of our α-BamA mAb effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Storek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vij et al., 2018</xref>), we now have the ability to probe the structure-function relationships of the only two essential OMPs in their native OM environment in <italic>E. coli</italic> at a level not previously possible. Importantly, we note the antibody discovery methods that we describe herein are efficient, robust, and a streamlined approach can be readily applied within a standard laboratory setting.</p><p>We have observed that in LptD there appear to be differential requirements for particular ECLs, L2 and L10, depending on the structure of LPS, specifically wild-type LPS versus the truncated Δ<italic>waaD</italic> LPS. Notably, BamA appears to be defective in the highly fluid OM of an LPS-truncated strain grown under low salt and high temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Storek et al., 2018</xref>). This is manifest by an increased sensitivity to a recently discovered inhibitory α-BamA antibody MAB1 and a requirement for elevated BamA levels. In these cases, the defects can be suppressed by altering the conditions to increase membrane rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Storek et al., 2019</xref>). The LPS-dependent requirement for LptD loops suggests that effects of the OM structure on OMPs might be more general. Among the 13 extracellular LptD loops, both L2 and L10 are short and lack large insertions or deletions across LptD homologs when compared to the longer loops in highly divergent LptD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). One possible reason for this is that these loops are uniquely positioned to make interactions with the LPS in the OM to allow for proper folding or functioning of this essential OMP. Although these interpretations are speculative and complicated by the fact that LPS is the substrate for LptD, it is tempting to hypothesize that the structure and function of OMPs evolved to be maximal when embedded in the constrained, liquid crystalline, OM matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paracini et al., 2018</xref>) and altering the nature of this membrane leads to defects. Thus, membrane environment is a critical consideration when interpreting biochemical and structural data of LptD and other OMPs in detergent micelles and must be considered when attempting to design or discover inhibitors of these essential processes in Gram-negative bacteria.</p><p>Genetic, biochemical, and structural data support a model for LPS insertion into the OM whereby the acyl chains of lipid A are inserted into the hydrophobic bilayer through a lateral gate created between the first and last strands of the LptD β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>). It is less clear how the polar sugars of the core oligosaccharide and O-antigen emerge from the periplasm to the cell exterior as it would be unfavorable for them to pass directly through the membrane. Presumably the sugars must pass through the LptD transmembrane β-barrel lumen, which is also occupied by an essential lipoprotein, LptE, and then through a proposed opening in the surface-exposed cap of LptD. Thus, consistent with prior molecular dynamic simulations, there are likely major structural surface re-arrangements in LptD during LPS insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). Given this model, we hypothesized that an antibody could have interfered with this process in a number of ways. For example, a mAb could staple the lateral gate in either a closed or open conformation, prevent the movements associated with expelling the sugars to the outside, or allosterically alter the protein so that LPS movement is thwarted. It is informative, therefore, that none of our identified α-LptD mAbs were able to inhibit the activity of LptD. One explanation is that binding to a single epitope is insufficient to disrupt the required movements of LptD. Alternatively, the positions on LptD critical for these presumed structural changes might be inaccessible to mAbs. Indeed, few or no α-LptD mAbs bound to the extracellular LptD loops that were found genetically to be important for viability or OM maintenance under specific conditions. Consistent with this possibility, in crystal structures of LptDE, the two loops we found most critical were occluded by other parts of the protein: L2 by L3, and L10 by L9 and L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By burying critical regions, LptD appears to avoid direct interference by antibodies, providing bacteria an evolutionary advantage in evading functional antagonism by the host immune system. Accordingly, the antibody-accessible LptD loops also are the most diverse in sequence, suggesting that these regions may be subject to selective pressures from the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botos et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, the proximity of a particular epitope to the membrane can sterically or electrostatically block binding. However, in rare cases, recognition can be achieved via stabilizing hydrophobic residues in an antibody CDR that transiently interact with the membrane, as observed for several α-HIV or α-GPCR antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishchenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scherer et al., 2010</xref>). It remains to be seen whether immobilizing these loops in LptD, for example, with a small molecule or peptide macrocycle that can access these positions, would inhibit LptD activity. While our observations make direct interference with LptD function by antibodies unlikely, they do not rule out the potential value of LptD as a vaccine candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zha et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our study represents an exhaustive α-LptD antibody discovery campaign, and potentially the most exhaustive on any membrane protein described to date. For the first time, we have been able to map essential and non-essential structural features of this intriguing and important potential antibiotic target. We have observed extreme tolerability of the ECLs to interference, suggesting that the architecture of the exposed ECLs of LptD play a role in protecting critical functions of this essential OMP. More generally, we provide a robust template for future efforts to dissect the structure-function relationships of complex membrane proteins from bacteria and mammals in their native environments, and a method to rapidly assess the therapeutic potential of antibody targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth conditions</title><p>Luria-Bertani broth (ThermoFisher Scientific 12795027) and Mueller Hinton II cation-adjusted broth (BBL 212322) was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions.

The resins were washed by the buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1% Zwittergent 3–14, 15 mM imidazole, 1x complete protease inhibitor mixture and eluted with the buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1% Zwittergent 3–14, 300 mM imidazole and 1x complete protease inhibitor mixture. The eluate was concentrated and purified by a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) using 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5% n-Octyl-β-D-Glucopyranoside (OG; Anatrace), 1x complete protease inhibitor mixture as the running buffer. The obtained LptD/E protein was diluted 4-fold into the buffer of 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5% OG and further polished using Q HP anion exchange 5 ml column (GE Healthcare). 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 25 mM NaCl, 1.5% OG was used as the start buffer and elution was achieved with linear gradient of 0.025–1 M NaCl. When protein was required in amphipol, LptD/E protein was incubated with biotinylated amphipol (Anatrace) overnight at 4°C and then purified over a Superdex 200 16/60 column in a buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Peptide pools</title><p>Peptide pools are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Massive antibody discovery used to probe structure-function relationships of the essential outer membrane protein LptD&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Edmund RS Kunji (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Storek et al. describe an exhaustive immunisation strategy to assess the use of an antibody-based approach as an antimicrobial agent against one of the essential OMPs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, LptD. They find that only a small fraction of mAbs (FACS<sup>+</sup>) were successful in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 with intact LPS and were much more successful at raising antibodies in the <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>waaD</italic> conditional strain with a chromosomal arabinose-inducible LptD that produces a truncated from of LPS. Many of the mAbs recognised extracellular loops in LptD. However, by expressing many extracellular loop deletions they found out that all the FACS<sup>+</sup> mAb bound to loops that were not required to function and had no antimicrobial effect. The most essential loops were L2 and L10, which are closer to the membrane. The authors did manage to produce mAb against L2 and L10 loops by using LptD-derived peptides for immunization instead of the full-length protein. Whilst these antibodies were not therapeutically useful in the <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain with an intact LPS, they nonetheless provided some interesting insights into the different roles of the loops. The authors concluded that the more accessible and longer extracellular loops might be &quot;decoys&quot; to avoid the immune system to produce antibodies against the inner loops L2 and L10 that were essential for function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Identifying α-LptD mAbs that bind to extracellular LptD loops”: &quot;…while &lt;1% were FACS<sup>+</sup> on <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 (Figure 2A)…&quot;</p><p>What were the properties of these antibodies, as they can recognise LptD despite there being a lipopolysaccharide layer?

First, the K-12 FACS<sup>+</sup> antibodies were all LptDE ELISA<sup>+</sup> (subsection “Identifying α-LptD mAbs that bind to extracellular LptD loops”) indicating they bound the protein. Second, their discovery was not limited to any one particular immunization campaign (subsection “Identifying α-LptD mAbs that bind to extracellular LptD loops”). Third, binding to LptD on <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 cells was indistinguishable from binding to LptD on the <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>waaD</italic> cells (subsection “Identifying α-LptD mAbs that bind to extracellular LptD loops”and new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), suggesting the epitope is not altered between the strains but rather extends further from the cell surface past the K-12 LPS layer. We also analyzed a representative <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 FACS<sup>+</sup> mAb for binding to our LptD loop mutant panel and report the binding profile for comparison to the <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>waaD</italic> binders (subsection “Mapping surface loop binding sites of α-LptD antibodies” and new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Identifying α-LptD mAbs that bind to extracellular LptD loops”and onwards: &quot;Indeed, we identified 10 (7%) α-LptD mAbs that bound to LptDE from all three species and 42 that bound either E. coli plus K. pneumoniae (22%) or E. coli plus E. cloacae (9%) (Figure 2C).&quot;</p><p>Could the loop replacement approach (Figure 3B and related text) be used to confirm the location of the cross-reactive loops?

This is relevant because it could show a common or differential bacterial strategy to evade an immune response and would firm up the claim that there is an evolutionary link. I find Figure 2D not very informative (unless you have the particular antibodies). More relevant would be to understand where the cross-reactive loops are. Maybe better to map the cross-reactive epitopes on the structure, based on the experimental results?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this important information can be obtained from our reported data and we have altered our figures and added text to address these relevant questions. The data pertaining to binding by cross-reactive antibodies to LptD loop mutants is captured across Figure 2, Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. To highlight the cross-reactive antibodies more, we have (1) swapped in an additional representative cross-reactive antibody (1H12) into the highlighted antibodies shown in Figure 4B to show its distinct binding pattern and (2) altered Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to indicate which antibodies bind only <italic>E. coli</italic> LptDE (hatched bars) and which bind LptDE from 2 or more species (solid bars). These comparisons are further resolved in Figure 2D. We have also highlighted each of the representatives shown in Figure 4B by notating those in Figure 2D. As these changes should make it easier to relate Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to Figure 2D, we think that this makes Figure 2D more relevant as well and have kept it in the figure. We have also pointed the reader to Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 to provide a structural context for the conserved regions of LptD. These additions and changes have made some important trends much more apparent for the reader and are now described in the text (subsection “Mapping surface loop binding sites of α-LptD antibodies”). Briefly, a majority of the two- or three-species cross-reactive α-LptD mAbs were dependent upon L8 and L9 for binding. The cross-reactive mAbs (5A3 and 3D4) recognize slightly different epitopes comprised of L6/8/9/11 and L7/8, respectively, consistent with our in vitro epitope binning experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Effects of removing extracellular LptD loop on E. coli growth” and onwards. &quot;These results suggest that extracellular L2, L4, L8 and L10 are important.&quot;</p><p>Maybe another remarkable result is that the shortest loops cannot be easily deleted, whereas the longer loops are fairly tolerant (with the possible exception of loop 8 which was partially deleted). What it may tell you is that, structurally, the short loops are possibly as short as they can get to be compatible with a well-folded and therefore functional protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we have not directly shown this, we agree that this is a viable hypothesis. We have now included a short discussion point highlighting this idea (Discussion section). Additionally, to provide more context, we have also included an alignment of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> LptD protein with even more divergent LptD species in a new figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) that further highlights the plasticity in length of the ‘long’ loops compared to the ‘short’ loops. This comparison is in line with the hypothesis that the long loops are more tolerant to perturbations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Effects of removing extracellular LptD loop on E. coli growth” and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Where is the expression profile of LptDΔL2? Legend says that it could not be evaluated, but maybe LptDΔL2 is not produced, explaining the severe phenotype, as we know the protein is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>Because LptD is essential, depletion of the wild-type copy renders the strain non-viable. If the production of an LptD variant does not support growth, expression levels of the LptD variant protein cannot be assessed. This was the case for L2. The expression profiles shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A measured LptD levels from K-12 <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in liquid culture. In this condition, the L2 mutant does not complement the conditional strain, thus this strain did not grow (Figure 3B) and LptD levels could not be measured. To determine if L2 is produced in a condition where it can support growth sufficiently (agar plate-grown <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>waaD</italic>), we measured LptD levels and have included the expression profile in a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) demonstrating L2 is expressed near WT levels under that condition. This was not clear as described in the original version of the text made thus, we have modified the text (subsection “Effects of removing extracellular LptD loop on <italic>E. coli</italic> growth” and subsection “Mapping surface loop binding sites of α-LptD antibodies”) and figure legend to remove any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Have these OMPs evolved extracellular loops as &quot;decoys&quot; or these extracellular loops just happen to pose a technical issue when using an antibody-based approach to target OMPs? Is there any other data to support this conclusion, i.e., do non-pathogenic strains harbouring similar OMPs have shorter extracellular loops?</p></disp-quote><p>We employed our antibody-based approach because it would be the predominant selective pressure from the host’s adaptive immune system. Pathogenic or not, the host would still recognize both bacteria as foreign and mount an immune response against the bacteria, including the OMPs. Although we cannot make a definitive evolutionary argument at this time, there are additional data to support the ideas that the loops are under evolutionary pressure. To showcase this point, we have added an additional figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, mentioned above, LptD loop alignments of the three closely-related <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> species with 2 pathogens of high interest, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> highlight the large variation in sequence diversity and loop lengths. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, the conservation of each amino acid from 150 LptD homologs ranging from 35-95% identity with <italic>E. coli</italic> LptD is mapped on the surface of the LptD structure. This figure strikingly illustrates that while the inside of the β-barrel is conserved, the extracellular loops are highly divergent. These points are discussed in the revised text (Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
