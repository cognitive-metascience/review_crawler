Organ growth is a dynamic process that is finely tuned by highly conserved signaling molecules that are produced and act within the tissue of origin (intrinsic) or on a distant tissue (extrinsic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hariharan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston and Gallant, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</xref>). These growth signals regulate final organ size through three distinct processes: cell division (proliferation), mass accumulation (cell growth) and cell death (apoptosis). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc, the larval precursor to adult wings and thorax, has been widely used as a model to study the molecular mechanisms that control organ growth and size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martín et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic analysis has identified numerous wing disc intrinsic factors, such as Wnt, Hedgehog, and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) homologs, that are required for proper patterning and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hariharan, 2015</xref>). In contrast, examples of extrinsic factors that regulate imaginal disc growth are limited. The insulin-like signaling pathway is one clear exception. Insulin-like peptides are produced in the brain and fat body and are well known to promote both growth and proliferation in many tissues including imaginal disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Droujinine and Perrimon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grewal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nijhout, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shingleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sopko and Perrimon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teleman, 2010</xref>). Insulin-like factors act in a physiological capacity to coordinate overall organismal growth with nutrition. Identification of other extrinsic growth signals could provide new insights into mechanisms governing coordinated organ scaling.</p><p>The largest and most diverse group of signaling molecules is the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors. The superfamily is divided into the BMP and the Activin/TGFβ-like subfamilies based on sequence and signaling relationships. In higher vertebrates, these growth factors play a myriad of roles during development from cell fate specification and stem cell maintenance to control of cellular growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2016</xref>). Both TGFβ branches are conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where limited functional redundancy and a powerful genetic toolkit provide an attractive system for study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peterson and O'Connor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMP ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp) functions as a classic intrinsic morphogen, since it is secreted from a limited number of imaginal disc source cells and then diffuses throughout the tissue to regulate proliferation and patterning based on its concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Restrepo et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, the Activin-like branch also plays a significant role in disc growth, however, it is much less characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hevia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Activin-like signaling is initiated by the three ligands, Myoglianin (Myo), Activinβ (Actβ), and Dawdle (Daw). These ligands bind to and activate a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex on the cell membrane consisting of two type-I receptor subunits encoded by the <italic>baboon (babo)</italic> locus and two type-II receptor subunits encoded by either the <italic>punt</italic> or <italic>wishful-thinking (wit)</italic> genes or perhaps a combination of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). Activated Babo phosphorylates cytosolic dSmad2 which then accumulates in the nucleus and, along with the co-Smad Medea, regulates expression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hevia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Notably, there are three splice isoforms of <italic>babo</italic> with different ligand binding domains, which presumably provide ligand binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Babo</italic> null mutants die at the larval-pupal transition and have significantly smaller wing imaginal discs and escapers, produced by hypomorphic alleles, also have smaller adult wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, expression of constitutively activated Babo in wing imaginal discs leads to larger adult wings that contain more cells, suggesting that Activin-like signaling has a role in regulating proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>). Additionally, Babo can signal non-canonically through Mad (the BMP Smad) to stimulate wing disc overgrowth, but only in the background of a protein null allele of <italic>dSmad2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson and O'Connor, 2013</xref>).</p><p>For both the dSmad2 canonical and the Mad non-canonical signaling pathways, it remains unclear which Babo isoform and which Activin-like ligands, or combination thereof, regulates disc growth, nor is it clear which tissue(s) provide the ligands that promote disc growth. Expression analysis by in situ hybridization or RNAseq data suggests that all Activin-like ligands are expressed in the imaginal wing disc, albeit at low levels, perhaps indicating collective contribution to stimulating tissue growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>). However it is important to recognize that mRNA expression does not necessarily correlate with secretion of functional ligand, especially since TGFβ−type ligands undergo a series of post-translational modifications and ligand processing to generate active molecules and these processes may vary within different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report our analysis of Activin-like ligands and Baboon isoforms for their roles in regulating imaginal disc growth. Through a series of genetic experiments, we demonstrate that among the three <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activin-like ligands, only Myo is required for proper growth of imaginal discs. We also identify the receptors Babo-A and Punt as being necessary for Myo regulation of wing imaginal disc growth via phosphorylation of dSmad2. Surprisingly, we identify the tissue source of Myo that controls disc growth to be the larval muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Myoglianin</italic> is required for proper disc growth</title><p>All <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activin-like ligands (Myo, Actβ, and Daw) have tissue specific function yet signal via the sole Type-I receptor Babo. Hence, the <italic>babo</italic> mutant phenotype is likely a composite of the three individual ligand mutant phenotypes. The imaginal discs of <italic>babo</italic> mutants are approximately 30% smaller than wild-type but do not exhibit any obvious defects in tissue patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>). We set out to identify which Activin-like ligand(s) are required for proper imaginal disc growth. Null <italic>myo</italic>, <italic>Actβ,</italic> and <italic>daw</italic> mutants are larval or pharate lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh and O'Connor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss-Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the size of imaginal wing discs from late third instar larvae of null mutant animals. For this initial analysis, we used a simple yeast/sugar diet (5Y5S), because <italic>daw</italic> mutants are sensitive to standard acidic cornmeal food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh and O'Connor, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, only <italic>myo</italic> mutants yield significantly smaller discs, phenocopying <italic>babo</italic> mutants. <italic>Myo</italic> wing discs are approximately 40% smaller than <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> controls, but retain their normal shape and pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). <italic>Actβ</italic> mutant discs had no significant size defects, while <italic>daw</italic> mutant discs were slightly smaller, which may be attributable to the reduction of insulin secretion in the <italic>daw</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh and O'Connor, 2014</xref>). Previous studies suggested that all Activin-like ligands are expressed in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>). Despite this observation, our result clearly suggests that only <italic>myo</italic> is functionally required for growth of the discs, and that other ligands may have other functions apart from disc growth. We next asked whether other imaginal tissues such as the haltere and leg discs are also affected by the loss of <italic>myo</italic>. Indeed, both these imaginal discs are also approximately ~40% smaller in <italic>myo</italic> mutants and maintain their proportional size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-I</xref>). This suggests that Myo signaling regulates tissue growth in all three of these imaginal discs to similar extents.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Myoglianin</italic> regulates size of imaginal discs and activates dSmad2.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) DAPI staining of wing imaginal discs from late third instar larvae of various TGFβ ligand mutants.

First, to assess cell size, we used phalloidin staining to mark the apical actin belt, and measured the cell density at the epithelium apical surface. We observed that the cells in <italic>myo</italic> mutants are more densely packed. We calculated that the cells in these mutants are approximately ~20% smaller than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J-L</xref>). This observation is consistent with the smaller cell size report for <italic>dSmad2</italic> mutant discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson and O'Connor, 2013</xref>). Next, we checked for cell proliferation and cell death markers at 90–96 hr after egg lay (AEL ), a time at which a large amount disc growth occurs, and because cell death pathways are blocked later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jaszczak and Halme, 2016</xref>). We examined proliferation by staining for phospho-Histone 3(ser10) to mark mitotic cells, and found no significant difference between <italic>myo</italic> discs and controls at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M-O</xref>). Next, we stained 90–96 hr AEL discs with anti-cleaved-caspase 3, an apoptosis marker, and found no increase in apoptosis in <italic>myo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1, A–B</xref>).</p><p>Another possible explanation for why <italic>myo</italic> mutant discs do not grow properly could be defects in TOR pathway regulation. To address this issue, we stained growing early L3 imaginal discs for phospho-S6, which is a target of S6K and a readout of TOR pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2017</xref>). We found no decrease in pS6 staining in <italic>myo</italic> mutant discs, indicating that TOR signaling is not perturbed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1, C–D</xref>). We conclude that <italic>myo</italic> mutant discs are smaller in part due to smaller cells. However, the 22% decrease in cell size is insufficient to completely account for the ~40% decrease in total tissue size. Because our proliferation and apoptosis assays are snapshot experiments of fixed tissues, we infer that the portion of final disc size that cannot be accounted for by smaller cell size represents either a small proliferation reduction or a slight increase in apoptosis rate that cannot be detected at individual time points but, over the course of the entire developmental period, leads to an additional ~20% decrease in disc size. We note that a previous study of <italic>dSmad2</italic> mutant clones in wing discs reported smaller <italic>dSmad2</italic> mutant average clone size compared to control clones, consistent with a reduction in proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hevia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>Myo</italic> is homologous to vertebrate <italic>Mstn</italic>, which negatively regulates skeletal muscle size by inhibiting proliferation of muscle stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2016</xref>) and regulation of protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trendelenburg et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using RNAi tissue-specific knockdown suggested that Myo also functions as a negative regulator of muscle size similarly to vertebrate <italic>Mstn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 2017</xref>). We re-examined this issue using <italic>myo</italic> null alleles and measured the size of muscles 6 and 7, as well as the number of nuclei per fiber from the 2nd Abdominal segment. Surprisingly, <italic>myo<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant muscles are 13% smaller vs heterozygote controls (p=0.02), however they contain the same number of nuclei per fiber, which suggests that there were no defects in myoblast fusion during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1, P–S</xref>). We repeated the experiment using a newly generated <italic>myo<sup>CR2</sup></italic> allele and analyzed <italic>myo<sup>1/CR2</sup></italic> transheterozygotes to rule out 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome background effects. In this case, we find no difference in muscle size compared to controls again indicating that <italic>myo</italic> mutants do not have larger muscles compared to heterozygote controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

First, overexpression of <italic>myo</italic> in larval muscles in wild type animals results in wings that are larger than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In particular, how and which inter-organ signals regulate organ/tissue growth remains an open question. In the present study, we demonstrate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activin-like ligand Myoglianin is a myokine that acts systemically to fine tune imaginal disc growth. We suggest Myo tuning of disc growth may play an important role in maintaining proper allometric scaling of appendage size with the size of the muscles that control their movements.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Only Myo regulates imaginal disc size</title><p>Although Babo/dSmad2 signaling has been previously implicated in imaginal disc growth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson and O'Connor, 2013</xref>), the ligand(s) responsible and their production sites(s) have not been identified. Previous <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and RNAi knockdown experiments suggested that all three Activin-like ligands (Myoglianin, Activinβ, and Dawdle) contribute to control of wing size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>). However, we find no expression of these Activin-like ligands in imaginal discs, with the exception of <italic>Actβ</italic> which is expressed in differentiating photoreceptors of the eye imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss-Taylor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). More importantly, using genetic null mutants, we show that only loss of <italic>myo</italic> affects imaginal disc size. The discrepancy in phenotypes between tissue-specific knockdown results and the genetic nulls is often noted and not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Cara and King-Jones, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbens et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to simple off-target effects within the wing disc itself, one possible explanation is that many GAL4 drivers are expressed in tissues other than those reported, potentially resulting in deleterious effects for the animal that indirectly affect imaginal disc size. Another possibility is that in <italic>Actβ</italic> and <italic>daw</italic> genetic null backgrounds a non-autonomous compensatory signal is generated by another tissue and this signal is not activated in the case of tissue-specific knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Cara and King-Jones, 2016</xref>). We think both of these explanations are unlikely in this instance since we demonstrate that only the Babo-A receptor isoform is expressed and required in discs. Since we have previously shown that Daw only signals through isoform Babo-C, it is unclear why knockdown of <italic>daw</italic> in the wing disc would result in a small wing phenotype as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). We conclude that the small wing phenotypes caused by RNAi knockdown of <italic>Actβ</italic> or <italic>daw</italic> are likely the result of off-target effects and that Myo is the only Activin-type ligand that regulates imaginal disc growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Punt is required for efficient Babo-A signaling to dSmad2 in the wing disc</title><p>The signaling ability of TGFβ ligands is modulated by the specific combinations of receptors and co-receptors to which they bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heldin and Moustakas, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the receptor requirements for effective signaling through dSmad2 likely vary for each ligand and tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). In this report, we find that Myo signaling in the wing disc requires Punt as the type II receptor and Babo-A as the type I receptor. Furthermore, we establish that Myo is the exclusive Activin-like ligand signaling to the discs since loss of Myo eliminated detectable phosphorylation of dSmad2 in the wing imaginal disc. Since Babo-A is the only isoform expressed in wing discs, we also conclude that Myo is able to signal through this isoform in the absence of other isoforms. Whether Myo can also signal through Babo-B or C is not yet clear, but in the context of mushroom body remodeling Babo-A also appears to be the major receptor isoform utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). The co-receptor Plum is also required for mushroom body remodeling, suggesting that Plum and Babo-A are both necessary for efficient Myo signaling. However, it is noteworthy that Plum null mutants are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) while Myo null mutants are not. This observation suggests that Plum is not required for all Myo signaling during development. Further studies will be required to evaluate whether Plum is essential to mediate Myo signaling in imaginal discs.</p><p>The requirement of Punt as a type II receptor for production of an efficient signaling complex with Myo may be context dependent. In the mushroom body, indirect genetic evidence suggests that the two Type II receptors function redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). Although both <italic>punt</italic> and <italic>wit</italic> are expressed in imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Childs et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marqués et al., 2002</xref>), only loss of <italic>punt</italic> produces a phenotype in the <italic>brk</italic> reporter assay. To date, we have not been able to see clear signaling in S2 cells expressing Punt and Babo-A when Myo is added. It is also notable that a previous attempt to study Myo signaling in a heterotypic cell culture model also failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee-Hoeflich et al., 2005</xref>). In that study, Myo was found to form a complex with Wit and Babo-A in COS-1 cells but no phosphorylation of dSmad2 was reported. One explanation is that effective signaling by Myo requires Punt, and Babo-A, and perhaps another unknown co-receptor that substitutes for Plum. Despite this caveat, our results provide in vivo functional evidence for a Myo signaling complex that requires Babo-A and Punt to phosphorylate dSmad2 for regulation of imaginal disc growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Proliferation and cell size</title><p>Final tissue size is determined by several factors including cell size, proliferation, death rates, and duration of the growth period. While we did observe cell size changes upon manipulation of Myo signaling, the direction of change depended on the genotype. In <italic>myo</italic> mutants, estimation of cell size via apical surface area indicates that the cells are ~20% smaller than wild-type. Although this measurement does not indicate the actual volume of the cells, it gives an indication of cell density in the epithelial sheet of the wing pouch, which is analogous to counting cells in the adult wing. RNAi knock down of <italic>babo-a</italic> in the entire disc produced smaller adult wings with larger (less dense) cells. This result differs from the <italic>myo</italic> mutant, but is similar to the reported adult wing phenotypes of <italic>babo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>) and larval disc phenotypes of <italic>dSmad2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson and O'Connor, 2013</xref>). When <italic>babo-a</italic> is knocked down in one compartment, that compartment is reduced in size with smaller cells. We conclude that tissue size reduction is the consistent phenotype upon loss of Myo signaling, but cell size changes depend on the specific type of manipulation.</p><p>While cell size effects may be context dependent, it is notable that neither reduction in size of imaginal discs nor adult wing surface area can be explained solely by a cell size defect. Since we see no apoptotic increase in <italic>myo</italic> mutant discs, and because <italic>dSmad2</italic> knockdown also fails to alter apoptotic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>), the mostly likely cause is an altered proliferation rate. Consistent with this view is that the large disc phenotype exhibited by dSmad2 protein null mutants is clearly dependent on Myo and we and others have previously shown that this is the result of enhanced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson and O'Connor, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>). Similarly earlier studies also showed that expression of activated Babo or activated dSmad2 in wing discs also leads to larger wings with slightly smaller cells which is most easily explained by an enhanced proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brummel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>). It is worth noting that this proposed enhanced proliferation rate is difficult to detect since cell division is random with regard to space and time during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Thus a ~ 20% reduction in adult wing size caused by a proliferation defect translates into about 1/5<sup>th</sup> of disc cells dividing on average one less time throughout the entire time course of larval development. Therefore, without prolonged live imaging, this small reduction in proliferation rate will not be detectable using assays that provide only static snapshots of cell division. It is worth noting, however, that previous clonal studies also concluded that dSmad2 or Babo loss in wing disc clones resulted in a reduced proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hevia and de Celis, 2013</xref>).</p><p>One attempt to shed light on the transcriptional output of TGFβ signaling responsible for wing disc size employed microarray mRNA profiling of wild-type versus <italic>dSmad2</italic> gain- and loss-of-function wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hevia et al., 2017</xref>). However, this study did not reveal a clear effect on any class of genes including cell cycle components, and it was concluded that the size defect is the result of small expression changes of many genes. Consistent with this view are dSmad2 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments in Kc cells which revealed that dSmad2 is associated with many genomic sites and thus may regulate a myriad of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van Bortle et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Is <italic>myoglianin</italic> function evolutionarily conserved?</title><p>Insect <italic>myoglianin</italic> is a clear homolog of vertebrate <italic>Myostatin</italic> (<italic>Mstn/GDF8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinck et al., 2016</xref>), a TGFβ family member notable for its role in regulating skeletal muscle mass. <italic>Mstn</italic> loss-of-function mutants lead to enlarged skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grobet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McPherron and Lee, 1997</xref>). Mstn is thought to affect muscle size through autocrine signaling that limits muscle stem cell proliferation, as well as perturbing protein homeostasis via the Insulin/mTOR signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Gdf11</italic>, a <italic>Mstn</italic> paralog, also regulates size and proliferation of muscles and adipocytes, and may promote healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egerman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McPherron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Mstn</italic> and <italic>Gdf11</italic> differ in where they are expressed and function. <italic>Mstn</italic> is highly expressed in muscles during development while <italic>Gdf11</italic> is weakly expressed in many tissues. Both molecules are found to circulate in the blood as latent complexes in which their N-terminal prodomains remain associated with the ligand domain. Activation requires additional proteolysis of the N-terminal fragment by Tolloid-like metalloproteases to release the mature ligand for binding to its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolfman et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Myoglianin N-terminal domain was also found to be processed by Tolloid-like factors, but whether this is a prerequisite for signaling has not yet been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serpe and O'Connor, 2006</xref>). In terms of functional conservation in muscle size control, our results of both null mutants and RNAi depletion indicates that it has little effect on muscle size. This contradicts a previous study in which muscle-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>myo</italic> was reported to produce larger muscles similar to the vertebrate observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 2017</xref>). The discrepancy between our tissue-specific RNAi knockdown and previous studies is not clear, but our null mutant analysis strongly argues that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myo does not play a role in muscle size control. Intriguingly however, we find that loss of <italic>Actβ</italic>, another ligand that signals through Babo and dSmad2, results in a smaller muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss-Taylor et al., 2019</xref>) contrary to that produced by loss of vertebrate <italic>Mstn</italic> and various other vertebrate Activin family members. Recent data has shown that <italic>DrosophilaActβ</italic> is the only Activin-like ligand that affects muscle growth, and it does so, in part, by regulating Insulin/Tor signaling in the opposite direction compared to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and O’Connor, 2020</xref>). Thus, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the Myo/Activin pathway promotes muscle growth while in vertebrates it inhibits muscle growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Intrinsic (intra-organ) vs extrinsic (inter-organ) mode of Myo signaling and the significance of muscle to disc inter-organ communication</title><p>The most intriguing finding of this study is that muscle-derived Myo acts non-autonomously to regulate imaginal disc growth. This is in stark contrast to the two BMP ligands, Dpp and Gbb, which are produced by disc cells and act autonomously within the disc itself to regulate both growth and pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haerry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minami et al., 1999</xref>). The fact that a TGFβ ligand can act in an endocrine-like manner is not particularly novel since many vertebrate members of the TGFβ family, including Myostatin, the closest homolog to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myoglianin, are found in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>). Even the disc intrinsic molecule Dpp has been recently shown to be secreted into the hemolymph where it circulates and signals to the prothoracic gland to regulate a larval nutritional checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Setiawan et al., 2018</xref>). Several additional reports indicate that ligands from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activin-like subfamily also circulate in the hemolymph and function as inter-organ signals. For example, muscle-derived Actβ and Myo signal to the fat body to regulate mitochondrial function and ribosomal biogenesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demontis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Daw produced from many tissue sources can signal to the Insulin producing cells and the midgut to stimulate Insulin secretion and repress expression of sugar metabolizing genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh and O'Connor, 2014</xref>). Thus, many TGFβ type factors act as both paracrine and endocrine signals depending on the tissue and process involved.</p><p>The phenotype of the <italic>myo</italic> mutant animal supports our claim that endogenous Myo contributes to imaginal disc growth. The ectopic expression assay produced various wing disc sizes when Myo was expressed in different tissues, indicating that the growth response likely depends on the level of Myo being produced in the distal tissue. Loss of glial derived Myo is not sufficient to suppress overgrowth of <italic>dSmad2</italic> mutant discs, but overexpression of Myo in glia did partially rescue size of <italic>myo</italic> null wing discs, likely because the <italic>repo-</italic>Gal4 driven overexpression produces more ligand than endogenous glia. Likewise, expression from a large tissue such as muscle or fat body likely produces more Myo than glia leading to normal disc growth or even overgrowth. It is also possible that Myo signaling activity is modified depending on the tissue source. Like other TGFβ family members, Myo requires cleavage by a furin protease at its maturation site to separate the C-terminal ligand from the prodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee-Hoeflich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lo and Frasch, 1999</xref>). Myo may also require a second cleavage by a Tolloid protease family member to achieve full dissociation of the prodomain from the ligand to ensure complete activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serpe and O'Connor, 2006</xref>). Either of these cleavage reactions, or any other step impacting the bioavailability of active Myo ligand, may vary with tissue or may be modulated by environmental conditions.</p><p>What is the rationale for larval muscle regulating imaginal discs size? A possible reason is that for proper appendage function, the muscle and the structure (leg, wing, and haltere) that it controls should be appropriately matched to ensure optimal organismal fitness for the environmental niche the adult occupies. For example, a large muscle powering a small wing might result in diminished fine motor control. Conversely, a small muscle may not be able to power a large wing to support flight. However, the multi-staged nature of muscle and appendage development complicates this picture. Larval muscles are histolysed during metamorphosis and do not contribute to the adult muscle. However, remnants of larval muscles in the thoracic segment are preserved as fibers that act as scaffolds upon which the larval myoblasts infiltrate and fuse to become the adult indirect flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutta et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, at least for the indirect flight muscles, the size of the larval muscle scaffold might contribute to the building of a bigger adult muscle. Another possibility invokes a signal relay system. Wg and Serrate/Notch signaling from the wing disc epithelial cells control myoblast proliferation during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). Thus it may be that Myo signaling from the larval muscles stimulates proliferation of the disc epithelial layer which in turn enhances Wnt and Serrate/Notch signaling to myoblasts to increase their number thereby coordinating the adult appendage size with muscle size. A final scenario is that, since muscle is a major metabolic and endocrine organ, Myo production may be regulated by the general metabolic state of the larva. If healthy, high levels of Myo, in concert with other growth signals such as insulin, leads to a bigger fly with large wings, and if the metabolic state is poor then lower Myo levels leads to diminished proliferation and a smaller cell size resulting in a smaller fly with small wings.</p><p>Regardless of the precise mechanism, the ability of the muscle to control appendage size has interesting implications in terms of evolutionary plasticity. The proportionality of insect wing size to body size can vary over a large range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shingleton et al., 2008</xref>), but the mechanism responsible for determining this particular allometric relationship for a given species is not understood. We have recently demonstrated that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, motor neuron derived Actβ, another TGFβ superfamily member, can dramatically affect muscle/body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss-Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that evolutionary forces might modulate the activity of these two genes to produce an appropriate body-wing allometry that is optimal for that species’ ecological niche.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>w<sup>1118</sup></td><td>Bloomington<italic>Drosophila</italic>Stock Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_5905">BDSC_5905</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>myo<sup>1</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBal0267082</td><td>Synonym: myo<sup>Δ1</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Actβ<sup>80</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2008</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBal0217392</td><td>Synonym: Actβ<sup>ed80</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>daw<sup>11</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serpe and O'Connor, 2006</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBal0212326</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>myo<sup>CR2</sup></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dSmad2<sup>F4</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterson et al., 2012</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBal0268512</td><td>Synonym: Smox<sup>F4</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>babo-a miRNA</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBtp0071178</td><td>Also a new allele at VK37;

We also enjoyed reading your response, and as one reviewer stated, which we agree with, &quot;this response and the sum of observations and possibilities the authors provided could be highlighted in the published response to reviewers.&quot; Thank you for submitting your work to <italic>eLife</italic>!</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Muscle-derived Myoglianin regulates <italic>Drosophilamelanogaster</italic> imaginal disc growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Upadhyay et al. uses the imaginal disc/adult wing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to examine molecular mechanisms that coordinate organ growth during development. The authors report that muscle secreted Myo controls the wing growth. They examine the components of the Myo signaling pathway and demonstrate that Babo-A, Punt and the co-receptor Plum are required for Myo-dependent regulation of the wing growth. Using elegant genetics and exploiting loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function phenotypes, the authors systematically built the case for each of the pathway components downstream Myo. They next turn towards the source of ligand and demonstrate that the productive Myo is secreted from the muscle. The manuscript is compelling and clearly written. The findings are interesting and timely, especially as more and more reports find that inter-organ signaling control multiple aspects of development. However, I do have a number of concerns that need to be addressed before this manuscript could be considered for publication.</p><p>First, the authors need to sort through some conflicting data published by other laboratories. However, they stop short of evaluating the reproducibility of some of these previous findings. Without turning this manuscript into a &quot;set the record straight mission&quot;, I do think that this group of authors should use this stage to set the record straight and, in the process, validate some reagents or raise the appropriate flags. This process will benefit of the entire signaling community, especially since Myo has been the topic of extensive controversies.</p><p>For example, the authors write a Discussion section on Myo as being functionally distinct from vertebrate Mstn. While I agree with the authors' interpretation, as a reader I really want to know whether the <italic>myo</italic> null and the muscle knockdown of <italic>myo</italic> indeed show reproducible opposing muscle phenotypes; I want to be aware of such extreme off-targets or compensatory effects. The authors have already validated a <italic>myo-RNAi</italic> line and used it, including in the muscle (Figure 4). They should complete the comparison and include/discuss their data.</p><p>Secondly, Myo was previously shown to bind to Babo and Wit in mammalian tissue culture. Nonetheless, the authors demonstrate that Wit is dispensable for Myo signaling in the wing disc. Based on the non-canonical signaling analysis, the authors argue that Myo signals through Babo-A, Punt and Plum. The authors should cement this conclusion using signaling assays which could presumably recapitulate and illustrate both canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways downstream of Myo. Such results will tremendously strengthen the authors' proposed model and will increase the overall impact of the paper. Since, so far, it's been difficult to reconstitute signaling by <italic>Drosophila</italic> activin-type ligands in tissue culture, the field will be urged to take note of the co-receptor contributions.</p><p>Thirdly, the data presented here do not exclude an alternative explanation: That the positive effect of Myo onto the wing growth is due to both canonical and non-canonical signaling through Babo-A. The authors should include pMad analyses in Figure 1T to address this possibility. Also, they should provide pMad and pSmad2 panels for Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) &quot;muscle&quot; is misspelled in Figure 1R-S; area units are misspelled in Figure 1E.</p><p>In this figure each graph has a different font styles and sizes.</p><p>2) Is Plum required for Myo signaling in the wing disc? Figure 2 should be expanded to directly probe for a role for Plum.</p><p>3) Provide higher magnification panels for Figure 4A-B. The current images and their low magnification are not enough to support the authors' arguments.</p><p>4) Please correct the following sentences in the subsection “Overexpression of Myo in muscle or fat body rescues <italic>myo</italic> mutant disc growth&quot;:</p><p>“First, ubiquitous overexpression of <italic>myo</italic> in wild type larva results in wings that were larger than normal (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Next, we examined whether overexpression of <italic>myo</italic> in either glia, muscle, or fat body is able to rescue the size of <italic>myo</italic> mutant discs.”</p><p>5) Figure 5F is disproportionate and mislabeled.</p><p>6) Previous studies showed that the wing discs secretes Dpp in the hemolymph; Dpp reaches the ring gland and functions to control developmental timing.</p><p>Did the authors observe any disruption of the developmental progression in <italic>myo</italic> null mutants? If yes, they should speculate on the larger picture of inter-organ coordination.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Upadhyay et al. characterized the function of an Activin family member, Myoglianin (Myo), in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disc growth. They found that Myo uses the canonical <italic>dSmad2</italic>-mediated signaling to regulate wing size, and that a specific isoform of the Type-I receptor, Babo-A, is the sole signaling receptor in the wing disc mediating both canonical and non-canonical signaling. In addition, Punt and Plum function as co-effectors for the non-canonical Babo activity. The authors presented clear genetic and phenotypic data showing that Myo, which is mainly derived from muscle, can stimulate imaginal disc growth in a tissue non-autonomous manner.</p><p>This is an interesting study demonstrating the inter-organ signaling in growth control. The authors also carefully teased apart the signaling pathway mediating Myo function using genetic analysis. Experiments are well designed and most of the data support the conclusions. I have the following major comments:</p><p>1) The <italic>myo</italic> mutant imaginal discs are 40-50% smaller than controls. However, the <italic>myo</italic> mutant cells are only 22% smaller than the controls. The authors did not detect any difference in cell proliferation and apoptosis in fixed tissues, and suggested that there were slight differences overtime. It would be nice to perform live imaging of fluorescently labeled cells in imaginal discs incubated in vitro to support the authors' hypothesis.</p><p>2) It appears that Myo and its mouse homologs have opposite functions in regulating muscle size. What accounts for the difference? Would overexpressing Myo in mouse C2C12 cells promote muscle growth?</p><p>3) The authors suggested the activation of compensatory pathways in the null mutant, which may account for the differences in the null mutant vs. RNAi phenotypes. What is the muscle size phenotype when both <italic>myo</italic> and Actβare mutated?</p><p>4) Does knocking down <italic>babo-a</italic> lead to a decreased level of phosphorylated <italic>dSmad2</italic>?</p><p>5) Why knocking down <italic>babo-a</italic> by the Hh-GAL4 driver disrupts the A-P compartment boundary?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>How organ growth and sizes are coordinated within an organism during its development is a fascinating area of study that is not well understood. This emerging area clearly has important ramifications for our understanding of normal development and disease states, as well as for treatments achieved through regenerative medicine.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe their work showing that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activin-like ligand, Myoglianin, regulates growth of the imaginal discs during development. Using a previously published myoglianin (<italic>myo</italic>) mutant, they show that the wing (and other) discs are between 40-50% smaller than control in this mutant. Loss of other Activin-like ligands, Dawdle and ActivinB, do not show the same affect. Myoglianin's effect on the discs appears to be through cell size regulation, as other parameters that could contribute to disc size (cell proliferation, cell death), do not appear to be affected in the <italic>myo</italic> mutant. The authors also report changes in the sizes of other cell types, specifically the larval somatic musculature, that is linked to loss of myoglianin. Note that this particular finding, smaller muscles, is a finding that is contrary to previous RNAi studies which indicated that loss of myoglianin lead to larger muscles.</p><p>The authors then investigate how Myoglianin mediates its effects. They show that Myoglianin signals in the wing disc through its receptors Baboon isoform A and Punt, and the accessory protein, Plum. These in turn lead to the phosphorylation of <italic>dSmad2</italic> and the subsequent regulation of gene transcription. Lastly, the authors investigate the source of Myoglianin. Expression of myoglianin is detected primarily in glia and muscle, although low levels are reported in the wing disc. Tissue specific knockdown using myoglianin RNAi suggest that muscle is the primary source of secreted myoglianin. Likewise rescue experiments in the <italic>myo</italic> mutant show that expression of myoglianin from the muscle yields complete rescue of the wing disc size; expression from glia can give some rescue and ectopic expression in fat body also lead to complete rescue.</p><p>This is an interesting study of inter-organ communication. It identifies a pathway that regulates organ size through regulation of cell size (myoglianin-Babo-a-Punt-Plum-dSmad). It challenges published studies on the impact of myoglianin on muscle size. Moreover the authors implicate the muscle as one source of signals that could regulate organ size.</p><p>Nevertheless, there remains several issues with the manuscript as submitted.</p><p>The major concerns:</p><p>1) For several of the points, muscle size-area and, given the changes in wing disc cell volume, volume-- should be assessed. For example, the authors should show that <italic>myo</italic> kd in muscle shows a larger muscle size as published. The authors should also test how changes in muscle size could influence <italic>myo</italic> levels and in turn, wing disc size.</p><p>2) Myoglianin level assessment; Could myoglianin levels in the hemolymph be measured under the different conditions?</p><p>3) Quantification: For all figures, the quantification should be improved. This is particularly true for Figure 4, all wing disc sizes should be quantified. In all cases N values, number of replicates should be reported in the figure legends. Better/higher mag images of <italic>myoGAL4&gt;UAS</italic>-reporter should be included.</p><p>4) Consideration of the Adepithelial cells of the wing disc. The muscle progenitors that go on to populate the thoracic muscles are situated on the wing disc and could regulate its size. These express DMef2 and could also possibly be a local source for myoglianin. Specific GAL4 lines are available which drive expression in these. Having these as a local source of myoglianin would be an interesting finding.</p><p>There are additional issues with the figures listed below.</p><p>However, there are some common themes:</p><p>1) Control for RNAi usually is expression of an RNAi directed to GFP or mCherry. Controls for overexpression are usually expression of <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> or mCherry.</p><p>2) Better labeling of the images and include quantification please.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51710.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The manuscript is compelling and clearly written.

While I agree with the authors' interpretation, as a reader I really want to know whether the myo null and the muscle knockdown of myo indeed show reproducible opposing muscle phenotypes; I want to be aware of such extreme off-targets or compensatory effects. The authors have already validated a myo-RNAi line and used it, including in the muscle (Figure 4). They should complete the comparison and include/discuss their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We obtained the <italic>myo</italic> RNAi line used by (Augustin et al., 2017) and repeated their experiments. We found that knockdown of <italic>myo</italic> using <italic>mef2-GAL4</italic> does not significantly increase muscle size relative to <italic>UAS-myoRNAi</italic> alone. We controlled for gender in our analysis and only measured the muscle size of females. It is well appreciated in the field that females are substantially larger than the males and perhaps this could account for some differences that have been documented in prior studies. We also note that the genetic background of various GAL4 and UAS lines can significantly impact results. Specifically, we find that the <italic>UAS-myoRNAi</italic> line has significantly smaller muscles compared to any other “wild-type” controls that we have used. Therefore choosing such a line as a control “baseline” might lead to false interpretation of how <italic>myo</italic> affects muscle size.</p><p>Ideally, RNAi lines are validated by comparing their phenotypes to the genetic nulls. To validate whether <italic>myo</italic> regulates muscle size, we generated new alleles. Our previously published <italic>myo</italic> alleles (<italic>myo1</italic> and <italic>myo4</italic>) are on the same genetic background that can’t be “cleaned” because the 4th chromosome doesn’t recombine. For the new <italic>myo</italic> alleles we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate targeted deletions or indel frameshifts of the <italic>myo</italic> coding sequence. Using a transheterozygous combination of the Crispr generated CR2 allele over <italic>myo1</italic> greatly reduces the possibility of 4th chromosome genetic background effects arising in the original alleles. We find that there is no difference in muscle size of <italic>myo1/myoCR2</italic> nulls versus heterozygous controls. It is important to reiterate that we have never observed an increase in muscle size using any combination of the genetic null alleles. Furthermore, knocking down <italic>myo</italic> ubiquitously using <italic>da-GAL4</italic> does not increase muscle size beyond that of <italic>w1118</italic> (Kim et al. BioRxiv) or <italic>myo</italic> hets or nulls (this report). Taken together our data suggests that <italic>myo</italic> does not regulate the size of larval body wall muscles. One last note is that we have completed a more thorough analysis of muscle size in all ligand mutants as well as <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>dSmad2</italic> nulls where we counted Z disc number in addition to measuring surface area. This helps control for potential differences in “stretching” during sample preparation. This analysis is available as a BiorXiv preprint (Kim and O’Connor, 2020, see Figure 1A, B, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, Myo was previously shown to bind to Babo and Wit in mammalian tissue culture. Nonetheless, the authors demonstrate that Wit is dispensable for Myo signaling in the wing disc. Based on the non-canonical signaling analysis, the authors argue that Myo signals through Babo-A, Punt and Plum. The authors should cement this conclusion using signaling assays which could presumably recapitulate and illustrate both canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways downstream of Myo. Such results will tremendously strengthen the authors' proposed model and will increase the overall impact of the paper. Since, so far, it's been difficult to reconstitute signaling by Drosophila activin-type ligands in tissue culture, the field will be urged to take note of the co-receptor contributions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would love to have a cell culture signaling assay that works for Myo and dAct. We have no trouble detecting signaling by the BMP ligands Gbb, Dpp, Scw and various heterodimers, but the only Activin-like ligand that signals reliably in S2 cells is Daw. We have manipulated the <italic>babo-a</italic> levels in S2 cells and checked for <italic>plum</italic> expression (which is strong) but we obtain no signal above background when Myo is added. We have tried numerous perturbations over the last 15 years and never gotten it to work. We suspect some other cofactor, or an unknown Myo activation step, is needed and there is no way to predict how long that might take to work out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thirdly, the data presented here do not exclude an alternative explanation: That the positive effect of Myo onto the wing growth is due to both canonical and non-canonical signaling through Babo-A. The authors should include pMad analyses in Figure 1T to address this possibility. Also, they should provide pMad and pSmad2 panels for Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we knocked down <italic>babo-a</italic> and <italic>plum</italic> in the entire wing disc using a compound stock of <italic>ci-GAL4</italic> and <italic>hh-GAL4</italic>, then checked for p-dSmad2 and p-Mad levels in wing disc tissue extracts by western blotting. As a control, we crossed the GAL4 line to <italic>w1118, UAS-iRFP, and UAS-iGFP</italic>. Oddly, <italic>Disc&gt;iGFP</italic> animals are sick and don’t make it past the L2 stage, and thus they were excluded from the analysis. (this illustrates that iGFP is not always a good control). Knocking down <italic>babo-a</italic> in the disc resulted in almost complete loss of p-dSmad2 levels. Knocking down <italic>babo-a</italic> did not alter p-Mad levels in the disc. Taken together, this demonstrates that Myo signaling via Babo-A activates <italic>dSmad2</italic> in the disc but not Mad. The data is now shown in Figure 2S-T. The suggestion to check p-Smad levels upon muscle overexpression of <italic>myo</italic> is interesting however we regret that we missed this request. For p-Mad, we don’t expect there to be a change. This is based on several literature reports that Mad phosphorylation by Babo in the wing disc only occurs under extreme (strong overexpression of activated <italic>babo</italic>) conditions, as well as the lack of P-Mad change in the <italic>babo</italic> lof discs described above. Given the current stay at home order, and that these are relatively minor points, we hope that this will be acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) &quot;muscle&quot; is misspelled in Figure 1R-S; area units are misspelled in Figure 1E.</p><p>In this figure each graph has a different font styles and sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is Plum required for Myo signaling in the wing disc? Figure 2 should be expanded to directly probe for a role for Plum.</p></disp-quote><p>We checked by western blot whether knockdown of <italic>plum</italic> resulted in a decrease in p-<italic>dSmad2</italic> levels in the wing disc. To our surprise, we did not detect any decrease. We are not able to reconcile this result with the original supplementary genetic data provided in the first submission that Plum was necessary for Myo signaling in the disc. It is possible that Plum is required with Babo-A to produce a non-canonical signal, but this requires more experimentation, which is not possible at the moment. Therefore, we removed the section about <italic>plum</italic> since it is not that important for the central message. We hope to design additional experiments in the future to more rigorously test the genetic interaction of <italic>plum</italic> with Myoglianin signaling in the wing disc and if we find something interesting, we could submit a short supplement describing these studies as a “Research Advances” to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide higher magnification panels for Figure 4A-B. The current images and their low magnification are not enough to support the authors' arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>The additional images are now provided as Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please correct the following sentences in the subsection “Overexpression of Myo in muscle or fat body rescues myo mutant disc growth”:</p><p>“First, ubiquitous overexpression of myo in wild type larva results in wings that were larger than normal (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Next, we examined whether overexpression of myo in either glia, muscle, or fat body is able to rescue the size of myo mutant discs.”</p></disp-quote><p>Sentence corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5F is disproportionate and mislabeled.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Previous studies showed that the wing discs secretes Dpp in the hemolymph; Dpp reaches the ring gland and functions to control developmental timing.</p><p>Did the authors observe any disruption of the developmental progression in myo null mutants? If yes, they should speculate on the larger picture of inter-organ coordination.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Myo</italic> mutants do have developmental progression defects. They appear to stall at late 3rd instar larval stage and fail to undergo proper pupariation. They do not wander and form prepupa that are often curved or elongated on the food surface. These prepupa do not undergo head eversion and fail to differentiate disc derived structures. This phenotype is due to a defect in glia to neuron signaling since it can be rescued by Myo expression in the surface glia (unpublished). We are currently exploring this phenotype in more detail for a future report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] This is an interesting study demonstrating the inter-organ signaling in growth control. The authors also carefully teased apart the signaling pathway mediating Myo function using genetic analysis. Experiments are well designed and most of the data support the conclusions. I have the following major comments:</p><p>1) The myo mutant imaginal discs are 40-50% smaller than controls. However, the myo mutant cells are only 22% smaller than the controls. The authors did not detect any difference in cell proliferation and apoptosis in fixed tissues, and suggested that there were slight differences overtime. It would be nice to perform live imaging of fluorescently labeled cells in imaginal discs incubated in vitro to support the authors' hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>In theory this is a good idea. However, to our knowledge, only Suzanne Eaton’s group has been able to grow mid third instar discs in culture for up to 24 hr and this time frame may still not be long enough to reliably detect a subtle growth rate change (Dye et al. 2017 Dev.) To set up a live imaging system in our lab and to implement the segmentation program necessary to follow individual divisions on our scope would take many months and it still may be difficult to detect the changes. Therefore, we can’t do this experiment at this time. However, we do note that Hevia et al., 2017, did measure <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>dSmad2</italic> null mutant clone sizes in the wing discs and found them to be smaller than the wildtype twin spots. Their interpretation was that loss of <italic>dSmad2</italic> caused a 2 fold proliferation defect. Since, as we show in our report, that Myo is responsible for all of the p-dSmad2 signal in the wing disc, we think this data, coupled with the cell size reduction that we report, is sufficient to explain the smaller wing disc size of <italic>myo</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It appears that Myo and its mouse homologs have opposite functions in regulating muscle size. What accounts for the difference? Would overexpressing Myo in mouse C2C12 cells promote muscle growth?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure why there is a difference in the direction of the effect on muscle size between the vertebrate and the fly. We have done an extensive analysis of how Activin influences muscle size and have a drafted a paper (Kim and O’Connor, 2020 BioRiv) which demonstrates that Activin regulates muscle size, in part, through its effects on Akt1 and Pdk1 expression. Mammalian myostatin is also thought to regulate muscle size, in part, by its effects on the IsR/Tor pathway, but it appears to be negative instead of positive. We discuss this issue extensively in the Kim and O’Connor manuscript and briefly refer to it in the Discussion of the present manuscript. As to adding Myo ligand to PC12 cells, it will likely not work since there is no Babo-A in these cells and the vertebrate Smads 2/3 are very different in sequence within the Mh1 DNA binding domain compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> dSmad2. Eventually, it may be worth trying to recapitulate the entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> pathway, including expression of <italic>dSmad2</italic>, in a vertebrate cell line to see if and how it affects Ins/Tor signaling, but until we have a better understanding of the important variables in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture system, this type of experiment will likely not uncover any useful insights into why the effects on Ins/Tor pathway are opposite in the two systems.</p><p>I would also like to point out that the present paper is not about muscle size control. It is about inter-organ signaling and Myo control of disc growth. The muscle aspects are really a side issue, and as mentioned above, are the subject of a much more extensive analysis that has been submitted as a separate manuscript and is available at BioXriv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggested the activation of compensatory pathways in the null mutant, which may account for the differences in the null mutant vs. RNAi phenotypes. What is the muscle size phenotype when both myo and Actβare mutated?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, not the primary subject of this paper, but yes, we have made the double mutant and the muscle is still small. A more extensive analysis of the phenotypes produced by all double mutant combinations as well as he triple mutant is now underway but in no case do we see larger muscles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does knocking down babo-a lead to a decreased level of phosphorylated dSmad2?</p></disp-quote><p>Knocking does lead to decreased levels of p-dSmad2 in the wing disc. This result is now shown in Figure 2S.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why knocking down babo-a by the Hh-GAL4 driver disrupts the A-P compartment boundary?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know, but we are exploring whether other signaling pathways are affected when Activin signaling in the disc is disrupted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] This is an interesting study of inter-organ communication. It identifies a pathway that regulates organ size through regulation of cell size (myoglianin-Babo-a-Punt-Plum-dSmad). It challenges published studies on the impact of myoglianin on muscle size. Moreover the authors implicate the muscle as one source of signals that could regulate organ size.</p><p>Nevertheless, there remains several issues with the manuscript as submitted.</p><p>1) For several of the points, muscle size-area and, given the changes in wing disc cell volume, volume-- should be assessed. For example, the authors should show that myo kd in muscle shows a larger muscle size as published. The authors should also test how changes in muscle size could influence myo levels and in turn, wing disc size.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue of why our results differ from published RNAi studies was addressed above. We do not see the larger larval muscle size that was reported by Augustine et al., 2017 when <italic>myo</italic> is specifically knocked down in muscles. We have looked a bit at how muscle size affects wing discs, but it is very complicated. It is not likely that it is size per se, but some other aspect of muscle physiology. Our preliminary data suggest that the results are strongly dependent on the nutrient composition of the media that the larvae feed on. Again, this will require a detailed analysis, including a study of how the <italic>myo</italic> promoter/enhancer is being regulated by various environmental manipulations. This is in progress, but is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Myoglianin level assessment; Could myoglianin levels in the hemolymph be measured under the different conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tried, but other mass spec results only report finding Daw in hemolymph. So far, our attempts to tag Myo and produce an active ligand have been unsuccessful. As a result, we have not further pursued analysis of Myo in hemolymph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Quantification: For all figures, the quantification should be improved. This is particularly true for Figure 4, all wing disc sizes should be quantified. In all cases N values, number of replicates should be reported in the figure legends. Better/higher mag images of myoGAL4&gt;UAS-reporter should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification for Figure 4 is now shown in Figure 4L. The higher magnification of Figure 4A and split channel images for Figure 4B are shown in Figure 4—Figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Consideration of the Adepithelial cells of the wing disc. The muscle progenitors that go on to populate the thoracic muscles are situated on the wing disc and could regulate its size. These express DMef2 and could also possibly be a local source for myoglianin. Specific GAL4 lines are available which drive expression in these. Having these as a local source of myoglianin would be an interesting finding.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We initially did consider that the adepithelial myoblasts in the wing disc could provide the Myo necessary for disc growth. However, two sets of data suggest that this is not the case. First, as shown in Figure 4, we find that knocking down <italic>myo</italic> in the muscle using <italic>mhc-GAL4</italic> is sufficient to rescue the <italic>dSmad2</italic> wide wing phenotype. Unlike <italic>mef2-GAL4,</italic> the <italic>mhc-GAL4</italic> line is not expressed in the adepithelial myoblasts of the wing disc. Therefore, in animals where <italic>myo</italic> is knocked down by <italic>mhc-GAL4</italic>, Myo should still be secreted by the myoblasts, and yet we observe a complete rescue of the <italic>dSmad2</italic> wide wing phenotype. We also examined adepithelial cells for <italic>myo</italic> expression using our <italic>myo-GAL4</italic> reporter line and by in situ hybridization. In neither casedid we observe any expression. Taken together, we believe these observations indicate that the adepithelial cells are not the source of Myo that regulates disc growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are additional issues with the figures listed below.</p><p>However, there are some common themes:</p><p>1) Control for RNAi usually is expression of an RNAi directed to GFP or mCherry. Controls for overexpression are usually expression of UAS-GFP or mCherry.</p></disp-quote><p>When doing new experiments for the western blots in Figure 2 we did try the <italic>UAS-iGFP</italic> and <italic>UAS-iRFP</italic> lines. As mentioned the iGFP line was toxic and we were never able to dissect wing discs from 3rd instar larvae. One could argue that the best control for RNAi experiments is a scrambled sequencewhich is just not feasible for every experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Better labeling of the images and include quantification please.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
