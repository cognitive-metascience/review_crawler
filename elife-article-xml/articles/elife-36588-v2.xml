Remarkably, simultaneous loss of RNST-2 and de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides leads to complete embryonic lethality, which is suppressed by supplements of uridine or cytidine.

The resulting catabolites are reutilized to maintain cellular homeostasis under both stress and physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizushima, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levine et al., 2011</xref>). During autophagy, bulk cytosol may be randomly sequestered into double-membrane autophagosomes, which eventually fuse with lysosomes where cargos are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xie and Klionsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, specific substrates can be recognized and removed through selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cebollero et al., 2012</xref>). In both cases, multiple protein complexes act coordinately to control the initiation, formation and maturation of autophagosomes as well as their fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A variety of cellular components including organelles are found to be substrates of autophagy. Ribosomes were among the first few cargos detected in the interior of autophagosomes by electron microscopy and have served as a marker of bulk cytoplasm degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashford and Porter, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eskelinen et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to non-selective autophagy, prolonged nitrogen starvation in yeast leads to ribophagy, during which mature ribosomes are selectively targeted and removed by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>). In ribophagy, the large and small ribosomal subunits appear to be independently targeted for degradation, which involves both ubiquitination and deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraft and Peter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dargemont and Ossareh-Nazari, 2012</xref>). Ribosomes contain about 50% of the cellular proteins and 80% of total RNA. Both ribosomal proteins and RNAs are processed in lysosomes during autophagy-mediated degradation, which may serve as the major source of amino acids and nucleotides in nutrient deprivation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lafontaine, 2010</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that autophagic degradation of ribosomes is crucial for survival of yeast cells in nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether mature ribosomes are degraded through autophagy under normal growth conditions and whether ribosome degradation contributes to animal physiology.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos are wrapped in tough eggshells that are impermeable to most solutes. The development of embryos from the one-cell stage to the end of embryogenesis (558 cells) relies on degradation of maternally loaded materials, independent of external nutrients. The maternally loaded yolk proteins are degraded in lysosomes, while PGL granules and aggregates of SQST-1/p62 and SEPA-1 family proteins are removed by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting catabolites are recycled from lysosomes to provide energy and essential building blocks for embryogenesis. Impairing autophagy or lysosome function leads to reduced hatching rate and retarded embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). It is unclear whether ribosomes, which contain abundant proteins and RNAs, may be used as a nutrient source for development.</p><p>In this study, we identified RNST-2, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> T2 family endoribonuclease, from a genetic screen for lysosome-defective mutants.

RNST-2 localizes to lysosomes and loss of its function causes rRNA accumulation in enlarged lysosomes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Thus, RNST-2 degrades rRNA delivered by autophagy in lysosomes, which is consistent with the function of Ryn1 and RNS2, the yeast and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> T2 family endoribonucleases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Floyd et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of zebrafish <italic>rnaset2</italic> results in accumulation of undigested rRNA in lysosomes of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haud et al., 2011</xref>), while expression of human RNASET2 in worms efficiently rescued the lysosome phenotype in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E,I</xref>). Thus, T2 family endoribonuclease acts as the key enzyme to degrade ribosomal RNA in lysosomes in diverse species throughout evolution. The <italic>rnst-2</italic> lysosomes appear to accumulate intact 26S and 18S rRNA, suggesting that mature ribosomes are targeted for degradation. In addition to rRNA, <italic>rnst-2</italic> lysosomes also contain high levels of ribosomal proteins, suggesting that rRNA degradation may facilitate destruction and further digestion of ribosomes. Our data suggest that the autophagy process is partially impaired in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. We suspect that gradual buildup of undigested rRNA and ribosomal proteins in lysosomes leads to impaired autophagy kinetics and thus reduction in autophagic flux. Consistent with this, dysregulation of autophagy has been commonly found in lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of undegraded metabolites in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seranova et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ribosomal RNA degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway is important in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis essential for animal development</title><p>Bulk or selective degradation of ribosomes via the autophagy-lysosome pathway is important for cell survival under nutrient deprivation conditions, but whether it occurs under normal conditions and is important for animal physiology remains unclear. Here, we found that loss of RNST-2 function affects degradation of ribosomal RNA and proteins, and causes severe developmental defects, suggesting that ribosome degradation occurs under normal growth conditions and is important for animal development. Importantly, simultaneous loss of RNST-2 or autophagy and the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines causes complete embryonic lethality, and this synthetic lethality can be suppressed by exogenous supply of uridine or cytidine. This indicates that rRNA turnover through the autophagy-lysosome pathway plays an important role in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis during development. We have attempted to measure the nucleoside levels by LC/MS in <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos, and observed a reduction in cytidine but not guanosine (data not shown). Given that the nucleoside levels were measured in embryonic lysates prepared from unhealthy embryos with an intact purine synthesis pathway but containing heterogeneous tissues and both intracellular and extracellular nucleosides, the results may not reflect the situation in key tissues that cause the phenotype.</p><p>The nucleosides or nucleobases derived from lysosomal rRNA turnover may be re-utilized through the pyrimidine salvage pathway to provide precursors to multiple metabolic pathways essential for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang and Graves, 2003</xref>).

It is possible that excessive ribosomes are removed at the late phase of embryogenesis to cope with the lower demand for protein synthesis and the high levels of energy that are required for morphogenesis and hatching. Although supplements of uridine or cytidine significantly reduced the embryonic lethality in <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1</italic> double mutants, it did not obviously improve the embryonic viability of <italic>rnst-2(qx245)</italic> single mutants, suggesting that the developmental phenotype may be attributed to defects in both general autophagy and nucleotide supply.</p><p>In addition to late embryonic and early larval stages, enlarged lysosomes are also present in <italic>rnst-2</italic> adults, and the <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutation reduces the lifespan of both wild-type and long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> worms. This suggests that lysosomal degradation of ribosomes also occurs during adulthood and may contribute to longevity. Lysosome-dependent ribosome turnover may help to clear defective ribosomes generated during aging and/or contribute to downregulation of protein translation. It is reported recently that NUFIP1 serves as a receptor for the selective autophagy of ribosomes in mammalian cells under nutrient starvation conditions to supply nucleosides required for cell survival during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wyant et al., 2018</xref>). Here we found that ribosome degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway occurs under normal growth conditions and is important for development and longevity. Whether ribosomes are recognized and removed through selective or bulk autophagy during development and aging requires future investigations.</p><p>Our study reveals the essential role of autophagy-dependent ribosome degradation in animal development, which may be conserved through evolution as both the autophagy machinery and T2 family endoribonucleases are highly similar from worms to humans.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.

Importantly, the authors find that simultaneous suppression of RNST-2 and de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides causes complete lethality and that this phenotype can be rescued by uridine/cytidine supplementation. These results suggest that RNST-2-dependent lysosomal RNA turnover is critical for a pyrimidine nucleotide recycling, general lysosomal function, and worm development. This work potentially represents a significant advancement in the field. However, there are several points that should be clarified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(Comments 1, 2, and 3 are related)</p><p>1) One of the main conclusions is that lysosomal turnover of RNAs is important for providing nucleotides. Although this can be hypothesized by the data, the levels of nucleotides are not directly measured in mutants. Quantification of nucleotides in wild-type and <italic>rnst-2, pyr-1, pyr-1;rnst-2</italic>, and some <italic>atg</italic> mutants would directly support this conclusion.</p><p>2) In Figure 4F and G, although uridine or cytidine supplementation rescues embryonic lethality of <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants, it does not improve embryonic viability of <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. It could indicate that reduced embryonic lethality is not caused primarily by defects in the supply of pyrimidines. Instead, other functions of RNST-2 could be the cause of embryonic lethality of <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. For example, a general defect in autophagy could be the reason behind both embryonic lethality and synthetic lethality phenotypes. This point should be clarified to prove the recycling hypothesis.</p><p>3) As autophagy mutants such as <italic>lgg-1(bp500), atg-18(gk378), atg-2(bp576)</italic> also show partial embryonic lethality, it is still unclear whether this lethality is caused by a defect in RNA degradation or other molecules. The embryonic lethal phenotype of autophagy mutants should also be tested with uridine or cytidine supplementation.</p><p>4) Another important conclusion is that general lysosomal function is impaired in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. If this is due to accumulation of autophagy-derived RNAs, is not only the size of lysosomes (Figure 3E) but also their function (e.g. degradation of endocytosed cargos) restored by additional deletion of autophagy genes such as <italic>atg-2</italic>?</p><p>5) The data presented here also suggest that the autophagy pathway itself is affected in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. In Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, the accumulation of LGG-1-I is difficult to explain simply by lysosomal dysfunction. Generally, impairment of lysosomal function causes accumulation of LGG-1/ATG8-II, but not -I. The result rather suggests that autophagy induction or autophagosome formation may also be affected. To further characterize the autophagy pathway, additional assays (i.e. measurement of autophagic flux using bafilomycin A1 and testing accumulation of phagophore markers such as ATG1 and ATG18). This is important because in other organisms (e.g., <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) autophagosomes accumulate in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants in an attempt to compensate for inhibition of RNA degradation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Autophagy-dependent rRNA degradation is essential for maintaining nucleotide homeostasis during <italic>C. elegans</italic> development&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We first measured the nucleoside levels in samples prepared from mix-staged worms, but they gave very big variations, likely due to asynchronization of the worms. We then switched to measurements using mix-staged embryos, which are hard to collect but showed less variations than the mix-staged worm samples. We utilized RNAi treatment in these experiments because (1) <italic>pyr-1;rnst-2</italic> double mutants do not produce viable progeny and we were unable to collect enough embryos for measurements; (2) <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic> exhibited synthetic embryonic lethality as in double mutants, but the RNAi treatment can be achieved on a sufficiently large scale to obtain enough embryos for LC-MS analyses. We found that levels of adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine and UMP were all obviously decreased in <italic>rnst-2(qx245)</italic> and <italic>pyr-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos compared to wild type, consistent with the role of RNST-2 and PYR-1 in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic>, the cytidine level appeared to be further reduced, while levels of adenosine and UMP were similar to those in single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A, C, E</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, levels of guanosine and uridine were higher in <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic> than in wild type and single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B, D</xref>). We do not understand why guanosine and uridine levels increased in <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic>. Since RNA inactivation reduces but does not completely disrupt PYR-1 function, it is possible that feed-back responses may be elicited in <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic>, which lead to increased guanosine and uridine through de novo or salvage pathways. However, this is pure speculation and we do not have a straight forward approach to test this hypothesis due to the high complexity and our incomplete understanding of the pyrimidine and purine metabolism pathways in worms. We therefore did not include these data in the revised manuscript. Nevertheless, except for the increase in guanosine and uridine levels in <italic>rnst-2;pyr-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos, the nucleoside measurement results are all consistent with the genetic and cell biology data and support the idea that lysosomal turnover of RNA is important for providing nucleotides.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36588.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of nucleosides.</title><p>Mix-staged embryos were collected and ground.

The embryonic lethal phenotype of autophagy mutants should also be tested with uridine or cytidine supplementation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we examined embryonic lethality in <italic>lgg-1, atg-18</italic> and <italic>atg-2</italic> without and with uridine or cytidine supplements. Like in <italic>rnst-2</italic> single mutants, uridine and cytidine supplements did not rescue the partial embryonic lethality in these autophagy-defective mutants, although cytidine supplement increased the viability of <italic>atg-18</italic> embryos (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C, D). These data and our finding that loss of <italic>rnst-2</italic> partially impairs autophagy together suggest that a general autophagy defect may contribute to the partial embryonic lethality in <italic>rnst-2</italic> and autophagy-defective mutants.</p><p>We found that in <italic>pyr-1</italic> and <italic>umps-1</italic> mutants, which have a blockage in de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, loss of RNST-2, but not LAAT-1 (lysosomal amino acid transporter) or LMP-1/LAMP1, leads to complete embryonic lethality. This indicates that loss of RNST-2 function, but not a general defect of lysosomes, leads to the synthetic embryonic lethality (Figure 6A, B and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C-E). Although supplements of uridine or cytidine did not obviously improve the viability of <italic>rnst-2</italic> single mutants, these treatments efficiently suppressed the synthetic lethality in <italic>pyr-1;rnst-2</italic> double mutants (Figure 6C, E). This strongly suggests that the synthetic lethality is mainly caused by defective supply of nucleotides.</p><p>We have included the new rescue data in the revised manuscript to indicate that a general autophagy defect contributes to the embryonic lethality in <italic>rnst-2</italic> and autophagy-defective mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another important conclusion is that general lysosomal function is impaired in rnst-2 mutants.

We found that CAV-1, VIT-2 and apoptotic cell corpses are properly degraded in <italic>rnst-2</italic> as in wild type (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2). Thus, loss of RNST-2 affects degradation of autophagic but not endocytic or phagocytic cargos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data presented here also suggest that the autophagy pathway itself is affected in rnst-2 mutants. In Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, the accumulation of LGG-1-I is difficult to explain simply by lysosomal dysfunction. Generally, impairment of lysosomal function causes accumulation of LGG-1/ATG8-II, but not -I. The result rather suggests that autophagy induction or autophagosome formation may also be affected. To further characterize the autophagy pathway, additional assays (i.e. measurement of autophagic flux using bafilomycin A1 and testing accumulation of phagophore markers such as ATG1 and ATG18). This is important because in other organisms (e.g., Arabidopsis) autophagosomes accumulate in rnst-2 mutants in an attempt to compensate for inhibition of RNA degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed additional experiments to further characterize the autophagy process in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. Unfortunately, we do not have an efficient way to completely block lysosome function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (bafilomycin A1 treatment did not work well), and therefore we are unable to measure autophagic flux precisely in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. To further examine the autophagy process in <italic>rnst-2</italic>, we did the following experiments:</p><p>1) We examined accumulation of PGL granules, which are efficiently removed by selective autophagy during embryogenesis. This process is very sensitive to changes in autophagy activity (Zhang et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2010). The PGL granule component PGL-3 and the bridging molecule SEPA-1 failed to be removed and thus persisted in <italic>atg-2</italic> mutants (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). However, PGL-3 and SEPA-1 were removed in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants as in wild type, indicating that autophagic clearance of PGL granules is normal (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>2) SQST-1/p62 associates with various protein aggregates that are removed by autophagy, while LGG-1/ATG8 associates with autophagic structures from early to late stages. Both SQST-1 and LGG-1 are substrates of autophagy. We found that SQST-1 and LGG-1 puncta were removed in wild type but were present in late-staged embryos in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants (Figure 4 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). In <italic>atg-2</italic> mutants, however, SQST-1 and LGG-1 puncta persisted in embryos at both early and late stages (Figure 4). These data suggest that the autophagy process is partially impaired or delayed in <italic>rnst-2(lf)</italic>, causing accumulation of SQST-1 and LGG-1 in late-staged embryos.</p><p>3) <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants accumulated both LGG-1-I and LGG-1-II (lipid-conjugated form of LGG-1) at both embryonic and adult stages, consistent with partial impairment of autophagy (Figure 4).</p><p>4) We found that GFP::ATG-18, which associates with early autophagic structures, was diffuse in the cytoplasm in both wild type and <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutant embryos, suggesting that autophagosome formation is not blocked (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>5) Loss of <italic>rnst-2</italic> leads to shortened lifespan of L1 larvae in the absence of food, a process that requires autophagy activity.</p><p>Altogether, these data suggest that the autophagy process is partially impaired in <italic>rnst-2</italic> mutants. We suspect that the gradual buildup of undigested rRNA and ribosomal proteins in <italic>rnst-2</italic> lysosomes leads to impaired autophagy kinetics and thus causes a reduction in autophagic flux. This is in fact consistent with the notion that dysregulation of autophagy serves as a common mechanism underlying lysosomal storage diseases that are characterized by the accumulation of undegraded metabolites in lysosomes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>We appreciate that you have made a substantial effort to address the comments and criticisms of the first review round.

The phenotype should be caused by both defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion section as suggested to indicate clearly that the development phenotype may be caused by defects in both general autophagy and nucleotide supply.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) During the revision, a related paper on autophagy-mediated nucleotide recycling was published by David Sabatini's group (Wyant et al., 2018). You may want to cite this paper and discuss a relationship with this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited the paper published by David Sabatiniâs group and discussed the potential relationship with our study (subsection âRibosomal RNA degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway is important in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis essential for animal developmentâ).</p></body></sub-article></article>
