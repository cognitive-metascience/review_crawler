Downstream of RAS, RAF kinases are actionable targets regulating keratinocyte turnover; however, chemical RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate the pathway, promoting epidermal proliferation. We generated mice with compound epidermis-restricted BRAF/RAF1 ablation. In these animals, transient barrier defects and production of chemokines and Th2-type cytokines by keratinocytes cause a disease akin to human atopic dermatitis, characterized by IgE responses and local and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, BRAF and RAF1 operate independently to balance MAPK signaling: BRAF promotes ERK activation, while RAF1 dims stress kinase activation. In vivo, JNK inhibition prevents disease onset, while MEK/ERK inhibition in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 phenocopies it. These results support a primary role of keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the animals lacking BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis represent a useful model for this disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14012.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14012.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14012.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin is the largest organ of the body and shields it from damage. It is also home to cells of the immune system, which protect the body from infections. To maintain its role as a barrier, the skin regenerates throughout life, constantly producing new cells to replace the old ones. If this process goes wrong and the skin regenerates too much, the skin may produce tumors. Likewise, disrupting the immune barrier can lead to autoimmune or allergic skin diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema).</p><p>The outer layer of the skin is called the epidermis, and is made up of cells known as keratinocytes. A family of proteins called RAF plays an important role in controlling how keratinocytes behave. These proteins are part of a signaling pathway that controls the production of new cells and is disrupted in skin tumors. Therapies that inhibit RAF are effective treatments for these tumors but have side effects that can affect the skin so severely that the treatment must be interrupted.</p><p>Keratinocytes also play a role in the development of allergic skin diseases. However, it is not known whether they do so by triggering the disease themselves, or by responding to stimuli produced by immune cells.</p><p>Raguz et al. investigated what would happen if RAF proteins were removed from keratinocytes in the epidermis of mice. This caused the mice to develop an allergic disease similar to human atopic dermatitis. This was an unexpected effect and different from the side effects caused by drugs that inhibit RAF proteins. By analyzing the signaling pathway that RAF is part of, Raguz et al. discovered that removing RAF from the epidermis reduces the pathway’s ability to prevent excessive stress signals being sent throughout the skin. Under these conditions, the keratinocytes bring about inflammation and allergy by activating the immune cells in the skin and elsewhere.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Raguz et al. indicate that allergic dermatitis can be triggered by defects in keratinocytes rather than in immune cells. Furthermore, RAF in the epidermis appears to prevent allergic skin diseases. Future studies could use mice that lack RAF in their epidermis to further understand atopic dermatitis and to investigate the way in which drugs that target RAF can damage the skin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14012.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14012.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mechanisms of disease</kwd><kwd>allergy</kwd><kwd>atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>RAF</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W1220-B09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baccarini</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INFLA-CARE FP7_HEALTH 223151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baccarini</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P 19530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baccarini</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In keratinocytes, the BRAF and RAF1 proteins work independently to balance the activity of mitogenic and stress kinase cascades and uphold the mechanical and immunological barrier functions of the epidermis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The largest organ of the body, the skin, allows exchange with the environment while shielding the organism from insults of mechanical, chemical, and infectious nature. In the skin, the epidermis acts as a mechanical barrier which prevents water loss and the entry of potentially harmful chemicals; in addition, through the interplay between keratinocytes in the epidermis and immune cells based mainly in the underlying dermis, the skin works as an immunological barrier actively defending the body from pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasparakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nestle et al., 2009</xref>). Maintaining these barrier functions throughout life requires continuous regeneration of the epidermis and appropriately balanced immune responses. Dysregulation of the regenerative process can lead to a wide range of defects, from epidermal thickening to malignancies; and an imbalance in the skin’s immune reactions can lead to recurrent infections, or inflammatory/allergic diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis.</p><p>The RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an essential role in the epidermis. Downstream of the EGFR and RAS, it acts in hair follicle development and wound healing; its mild activation in Rasopathies, genetic diseases caused by activating mutations in the pathway, results in skin phenotypes ranging from thickening of palms and soles to the development of papillomas; and strong activation in keratinocytes results in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kern et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ratushny et al., 2012</xref>). In animal models, epidermis-restricted inducible activation of RAF or MEK causes massive cutaneous hyperplasia and reduced differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khavari and Rinn, 2007</xref>). Consistently, RAF1 (also known as CRAF) and BRAF are essential for the development and progression of RAS-induced tumors although they fulfil different roles, with RAF1 preventing keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehrenreiter et al., 2009</xref>) and BRAF promoting proliferation through MEK/ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kern et al., 2013</xref>). The requirement for MEK/ERK in epidermal proliferation has been independently assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khavari and Rinn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumesic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scholl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scholl et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In line with their prominent roles in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a number of tissues, the components of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway are attractive targets for molecule-based therapy. Many inhibitory compounds have been developed that are currently in clinical trials or have reached the clinic. Reflecting the function of the pathway in skin, cutaneous toxicities are one of the main adverse effects of these therapies; they can be severe and lead to an interruption of the therapy or to its termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dy and Adjei, 2013</xref>). These adverse effects can be roughly classified as inflammatory reactions, elicited chiefly by blocking EGFR or MEK; and proliferative events, caused by multikinase inhibitors such as sorafenib or by more specific RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib). Cutaneous inflammation induced by agents blocking EGFR (erlotinib or cetuximab) and by MEK inhibitors (selumetinib and trametinib) is characterized by papulopustular rash, pruritus, and suppurative folliculitis in ≥80% of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curry et al., 2014</xref>). The effects of erlotinib and cetuximab are on-target, as recently demonstrated by two studies showing similar inflammatory phenotypes in mice with epidermis-restricted EGFR ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Skin rashes and pruritus are also observed in patients treated with inhibitors targeting RAF. Up to half of the cutaneous reactions induced by these compounds, however, consist of anomalous epidermal proliferation events ranging from different forms of keratosis to the development of drug-induced papillomas, keratoacanthomas, and squamous cell carcinomas (4–30% depending on the study and the inhibitors used) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anforth et al., 2013</xref>). These side effects are mechanism-based and rely on the paradoxical activation of MEK/ERK promoted by the inhibitors in cultured cells, animal models, and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holderfield et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, combination treatment (RAF plus MEK inhibitors) reduces cutaneous toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flaherty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mattei et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to RAF inhibitor treatment, inducible epidermis-restricted ablation of BRAF and RAF1 causes the rapid regression of RAS-driven tumors without apparent cutaneous toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kern et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we systematically test the effect of compound BRAF/RAF1 ablation in epidermis and show that it gives rise to a progressive disease strongly resembling human atopic dermatitis. Mechanistically, the disease relies on the combination of reduced ERK and increased stress kinase activation, leading to chemokine/cytokine overproduction and chronic, systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epidermal BRAF and RAF1 are essential to prevent local and systemic inflammation</title><p>BRAF and RAF1 were ablated in the epidermis by introducing the <italic>Krt5-Cre</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tarutani et al., 1997</xref>) into a <italic>Braf <sup>f/f</sup>; Raf1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kern et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mice (heretofore referred to as Δ/Δep2) were born at Mendelian ratio but with their eyes open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), probably as a result of the migration defects of RAF1-deficient keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehrenreiter et al., 2005</xref>). With time, however, they started to show symptoms of a progressive skin disease. These included intense itching and scratching resulting in partial alopecia and self-inflicted wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Histological examination of the non-affected areas revealed thickening of the epidermis correlated with increased proliferation and expansion of both the basal and suprabasal keratinocytes but not with keratinocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

MLK3 downregulation by two independent shRNAs strongly reduced both ERK and JNK phosphorylation in F/F2 cells treated with EGF and proinflammatory stimuli; however, in Δ/Δep2 cells, only JNK phosphorylation was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

We describe an essential role of BRAF and RAF1 in keratinocytes in the control of allergic inflammation. Mice lacking BRAF/RAF1 in keratinocytes develop a disease clinically very similar to human atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieber, 2010</xref>). It starts with a barrier defect accompanied by the reduced expression of crucial tight junction proteins and by a marginally increased expression of chemokines and cytokines, particularly CCL2, IL6 and IL18. It then progresses to a stage in which the skin appears unaffected, yet both local (mast cell infiltration, chemokine and cytokine production) and systemic (T and B cell activation, increased amounts of circulating leukocytes and chemokines) anomalies become evident while TSLP and IgE levels are only slightly increased. This is reminiscent of the early phase of atopic dermatitis in children, prior to IgE sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieber, 2010</xref>). Unlike the majority of atopic dermatitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Benedetto et al., 2012</xref>), however, the Δ/Δep2 animals don’t have a stratum corneum defect, which may help explain the lack of symptoms at this stage. Adult mice present with a full-fledged disease characterized by rich dermal infiltrates, increased cytokine production, clearly elevated IgEs and mast cell activation, in good correlation with the intense pruritus causing extensive scratching and self-inflicted wounds. The initial barrier defect contributes to full-fledged disease, since ablation of BRAF/RAF1 after the third week causes a less severe condition lacking IgE sensitization and mast cell activation, yet recapitulating the systemic symptoms of the disease. This could be likened to late-onset, IgE-sensitization-independent dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieber, 2010</xref>). Thus, BRAF and RAF1 act together to ensure the timely establishment of the inside-out barrier of the epidermis and to prevent allergic inflammation. The data support the hypothesis that the keratinocytes play a primary role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the Δ/Δep2 animals may be useful as a model for this disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14012.020</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Molecular and physiological defects in mice lacking BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis.</title><p>Compound BRAF/RAF1 ablation in keratinocytes induces an imbalance in MAPK signaling, resulting in low ERK, high JNK activation.

Conversely, the set of cytokines (TSLP, IL5, IL13, IL18, borderline IL2 and IL17) observed in adult, diseased Δ/Δep2 mice was similar to that promoting symptomatic disease in RAF1Δep animals treated with trametinib, which showed an increase in TSLP, IL2, IL5, IL13, as well as in IL18. These data can be interpreted to mean that ERK signaling negatively regulates the production of allergy-promoting factors. However, it is important to note that trametinib treatment reduced IL2 and IL5 as well as GMCSF in the F/F2 epidermis, indicating that sensitivity to ERK inhibition must be seen in the context of altered cell-autonomous signaling (increased JNK activation in RAF1Δep epidermis) and/or tissue milieu. Along the same lines, Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes treated with inflammatory stimuli were significantly more efficient than F/F2 in producing CCL2, CCL7, IL6, IL18, TSLP and IL13, but not IL2 or IL5, resembling, but not fully reproducing, the spectrum observed in epidermal lysates. At this stage, it is impossible to determine whether these discrepancies might be due to the presence of cell types other than keratinocytes in the epidermal lysates or whether the culture and stimulation conditions used did not recapitulate the situation in vivo.</p><p>Be that as it may, the range of chemokines and cytokines overrepresented in the Δ/Δep2 mice and in the trametinib-treated RAF1Δep mice is consistent with allergic inflammation. In this respect, strong expression of CCL2 has been reported in the basal keratinocytes of atopic dermatitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giustizieri et al., 2001</xref>), and expression of CCL7, which can attract basophils, eosinophils, mast cells and Th2 cells, can be induced by allergens in atopic skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ying et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>TSLP, the signature cytokine of allergic disease, promotes the functions of these same cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ziegler et al., 2013</xref>), and is responsible for the extreme itching accompanying atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). High levels of TSLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu, 2006</xref>), but also of IL5 and IL13 have been reported in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients, particularly in those with elevated IgEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeong et al., 2003</xref>). In mice, it could be shown that the expression of TSLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu, 2006</xref>), IL4, IL5 and IL13 induces atopic dermatitis as well as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Flavell, 2004</xref>), and IL5 knockout mice exposed to allergens are less prone than wild-type to develop skin eosinophilia and epidermal thickening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spergel et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, expression of IL13 in keratinocytes is sufficient to induce a disease mimicking atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, these cytokines appear instrumental for the development of atopic dermatitis with IgE sensitization. IL18, on the other hand, can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakanishi et al., 2001</xref>), and appears to be causally involved in a different type of atopic dermatitis. IL18 is essential for the induction of dermatitis by the epidermis-restricted expression of caspase 1, the enzyme that generates active IL18 from its precursor. In addition, expression of IL18 in keratinocytes induces a late-onset dermatitis associated with mastocytosis, but independent of IgE production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Konishi et al., 2002</xref>). More recently, IL18 knockout mice were shown to be resistant to infection-associated atopic dermatitis, in a mouse model generated by perturbing the stratum corneum with detergent prior to topical application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> protein A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Terada et al., 2006</xref>). However, stratum corneum defects could not be observed in Δ/Δep2 mice, and caspase 1 ablation does not modify the course of the Δ/Δep2 disease. Thus, IL18 is not a determining factor in the context of the Δ/Δep2 dermatitis, which rather resembles a Th2/IgE-driven disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>An imbalance in MAPK signaling underlies skin inflammation in Δ/Δep2 mice</title><p>Ablation of BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis has non-redundant functions converging on MAPK cascades. Decreased ERK and increased JNK activation are observed in Δ/Δep2 epidermis in vivo independently of the severity of the disease as well as in Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes and BRAF/RAF1 knockdown HaCat cells. Thus, the imbalance in MAPK signaling represents an intrinsic defect of cells and tissues lacking BRAF/RAF1. While BRAF ablation, as in many other tissues/organs, is responsible for reduced ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desideri et al., 2015</xref>), RAF1 ablation correlates with a previously unnoticed increase in stress kinase activation. Consistent with this, we have observed a reduction in the expression of two DUSPs involved in the inactivation of stress kinases, which is strongest in the Δ/Δep2 epidermis. This is in line with the reported positive role of p38 in the induction of DUSP expression and of ERK in its attenuation at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caunt and Keyse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taxman et al., 2011</xref>), which would predict that decreased ERK signaling would be needed to reduce DUSP expression and stabilize JNK phosphorylation when p38 is active. Importantly, both DUSPs have been implicated in the production of cytokines by immunocompetent cells and in murine models of inflammatory and autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We could further identify MLK3 as the kinase responsible for JNK activation as well as for the expression of inflammatory molecules in primary Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes and BRAF/RAF1 knockdown HaCat cells costimulated with EGF, TNFα and IL1β (as a proxy for the alterations observed in the Δ/Δep2 animals). The lack of basal JNK activation in unstimulated cells suggests a cross-talk at the level of BRAF/RAF1 and MLK3 rather than direct MLK3 activation by BRAF/RAF1 ablation. Such a cross-talk was previously reported to occur in the context of ERK signaling, which is positively regulated by MLK3 via the stabilization of the RAF dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chadee and Kyriakis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chadee et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that in turn, BRAF and RAF1 would restrict the involvement of MLK3 in the JNK pathway, at the same time promoting ERK and reducing JNK activation in stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanistic details remain to be fully elucidated, the relevance of the imbalance in MAPK signaling for the development of the atopic dermatitis-like disease in Δ/Δep2 animals was shown in vivo in two complementary ways: 1) by preventing disease onset with the specific peptide inhibitor D-JNKI1; and 2) by inducing disease in healthy RAF1Δep animals with a MEK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The second set of experiments also clearly shows that the function of BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis is not redundant. Finally, the combined RAF knockout and inhibitor data help explain why in patients the cutaneous toxicity of RAF inhibitors, which increase ERK activation, is mostly related to hyperproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anforth et al., 2013</xref>), while inhibitors of ERK activation promote the onset or exacerbate the course of cutaneous inflammatory reactions involving stress kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curry et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies and inhibitor treatment</title><p>All strains were maintained on a Sv/129 background. <italic>Krt5-CreBraf <sup>f/f</sup>;Raf1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were generated for this study by mating <italic>Krt5-Cre;Braf<sup>f/f</sup>:: Krt5-Cre;Raf1<sup>f/f</sup> </italic>animals.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Epidermal RAF prevents allergic skin disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted a list of experiments and changes that we feel must be completed before this work could be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. At this point, it would help us to have a response from you concerning the list of requirements and the time it would take to complete these task before we make a final recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript addresses the role of the RAF kinases BRAF and RAF1 in keratinocytes. Mice with combined loss of expression of these kinases in the epidermis exhibit skin defects similar to the human disease, atopic dermatitis (AD). There is local and systemic inflammation, including increased production of chemokines and TH2-type cytokines. The authors show that BRAF is required for ERK activation and that RAF1 suppresses the activation of the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38. Inhibition of JNK in mice prevents the skin defects while inhibition of MEK in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 promotes these.</p><p>The authors conclude that RAF enzymes play a key role in the pathogenesis of the atopic dermatitis-like disease in mice and suggest that this may represent a relevant model for studying the disease. Overall the study is interesting. It builds on previous work addressing the complex interplay between the RAF enzymes and the observations that inhibitors targeting RAF can result in inflammatory skin conditions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) TSLP is a key cytokine for AD-like disease, thus an increase in TSLP levels is very relevant for the conclusions of this study. However, TSLP staining in the epidermis does not look specific, as it should be localized to the cytoplasm, not to the nucleus. The authors should determine the levels of TSLP by RNA and protein (WB or ELISA) in epidermal extracts in all Figures.</p><p>2) It is well accepted that IL-4/IL-13 cytokines play important roles in the development of AD. It is necessary to include analyses of both cytokines in all experiments.</p><p>3) The IHC analysis is difficult to interpret; some examples include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> where the panels are too small; Figure 6—figure supplement 1 where the changes in staining between F/F2 and ∆/∆ep2 are unclear; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>: please use the same magnification that is used for TSLP staining in all panels to make staining more visible; and in regards to ICAM staining use, a better example that clearly shows the epidermis is needed. In general, the quality of all IHC images should be improved and quantifications should be included.</p><p>4) The data on MLK3 expression in HaCat cells are not convincing. Is MLK3 activated by loss of Raf1/Braf? JNK inhibition in KD2 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> is not clear either, and thus these results should be repeated in ∆/∆ep2 keratinocytes in vitro.</p><p>5) There is a large body of evidence presented in the manuscript as data not shown that relates to the investigation of increased JNK activation, such as mating the ∆/∆ep2 mice to MyD88, TNFα and caspase 1/11 knock-out mice. These data should be included in the paper, as these results are relevant to the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>6) The use of SP600125 is not recommended because it is a relatively non-selective kinase inhibitor. Any experiment where SP600125 was used should be replaced with a more selective inhibitor.</p><p>7) The RNAi studies are poorly designed – phenotypes should be confirmed with two independent single oligonucleotides and rescued by expression of an RNAi-resistant cDNA.</p><p>8) The authors show that BRAF/RAF1 deletion causes an &quot;inside out&quot; barrier defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Comparing mice with combined BRAF/RAF1 deletion, with mice presenting single deletion for BRAF or RAF1, would be important. Some studies have shown that RAF1 is implicated in disrupting tight junctions (Oncogene. 2007 26(8):1222-30 PMID: 16924233; J Cell Biol. 2000 148(4):791-800.PMID: 10684259).</p><p>9) The transient barrier defect conclusion in E18.5 embryos is unclear. At the end of the subsection “Lack of epidermal BRAF and RAF1 causes transient inside-out barrier defects” it is proposed that this defect affects the progression of the disease. This is partly based on the fact that deletion of Braf/Raf1 at 3 weeks produces a more modest phenotype. This may be one possible explanation. The milder phenotype may be a reflection of less robust gene deletion in the K5CreER(TX) mice. An immunoblot of epidermal lysates for BRAF and RAF1 should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: First, there appears to be specific activation of one ERK isoform (which one?) based on the pERK immunoblot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, whilst in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> both isoforms are phosphorylated. Second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – significance value for IL-13 missing.

For example, the analysis of the inflammation markers is often inconsistent, and the cytokines/chemokines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> should also be shown in the subsequent figures such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14012.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) TSLP is a key cytokine for AD-like disease, thus an increase in TSLP levels is very relevant for the conclusions of this study.

TSLP amounts, determined by ELISA, are significantly increased in the supernatant of primary Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes; treatment with a D-JNKI1 abolishes this increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and D</xref>); Tslp mRNA levels are also increased in Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes; this increase is abolished by MLK3 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Collectively, the data show that TSLP is elevated in a JNK pathway-dependent manner in Δ/Δep2 tissues and cells.</p><p><italic>2) It is well accepted that IL-4/IL-13 cytokines play important roles in the development of AD. It is necessary to include analyses of both cytokines in all experiments.</italic></p><p>These data were already included in the manuscript, either in the main Figures (original 1F, adult mice – now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, 3-weeks old mice; original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>,D-JNKI1 – now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>; original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, trametinib – now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, keratinocytes). IL-4 was not detected, this is stated in the first paragraph of the subsection “Interfering with the JNK pathway decreases the production of proinflammatory molecules in primary Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes and RAF knockdown HaCat cells”..</p><p><italic>3) The IHC analysis is difficult to interpret; some examples include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> where the panels are too small; Figure 6—figure supplement 1 where the changes in staining between F/F2 and ∆/∆ep2 are unclear; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>: please use the same magnification that is used for TSLP staining in all panels to make staining more visible; and in regards to ICAM staining use, a better example that clearly shows the epidermis is needed. In general, the quality of all IHC images should be improved and quantifications should be included.</italic></p><p>We used low magnification to show a larger portion of the epidermis; however, we agree with the reviewers that some of the immunostainings are less clear in this magnification. The revised manuscript includes higher magnifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (original manuscript; now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>); in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the same magnification originally used for the TSLP panel has been used for K6 and ICAM1; however, the original lower magnification is still shown for the panels showing changes in the dermis, i.e.: H&amp;E, β1-tryptase, and toluidine blue. Quantifications of the IHC analysis are shown wherever they are possible.</p><p><italic>4) The data on MLK3 expression in HaCat cells are not convincing. Is MLK3 activated by loss of Raf1/Braf? JNK inhibition in KD2 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> is not clear either, and thus these results should be repeated in ∆/∆ep2 keratinocytes in vitro.</italic></p><p>We have succeeded in performing this experiment (JNK inhibition by MLK3 silencing) in ∆/∆ep2 keratinocytes, even if knockdown experiments in primary cells are notoriously difficult. The lentiviral vectors used to knockdown MLK3 in keratinocytes were constructed by Joanna Nowacka in the lab. The authors’ list has been revised to reflect her contribution. The new experiment is shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–F</xref>, while the original experiment in HaCat cells is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Concerning MLK3 activation, we have now tried several different phosphospecific antibodies against the autophosphorylation sites, all of which gave a very high background but no reliable signal. However, the lack of JNK activation in unstimulated Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes suggests a cross-talk at the level of BRAF/RAF1 and MLK3 rather than direct MLK3 activation by BRAF/RAF1 ablation. A sentence to this effect has been added to the Discussion (subsection “An imbalance in MAPK signaling underlies skin inflammation in Δ/Δep2 mice”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) There is a large body of evidence presented in the manuscript as data not shown that relates to the investigation of increased JNK activation, such as mating the ∆/∆ep2 mice to MyD88, TNFα and caspase 1/11 knock-out mice. These data should be included in the paper, as these results are relevant to the conclusions of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript includes representative pictures of the animals and of their lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as information on the number of animals monitored (Legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) and on the time of disease onset. The paragraph read as follows:</p><p>“None of these knockouts altered the progression (onset around 2 months of age) or severity of the Δ/Δep2 skin disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Myd88 KO, however, reduced the splenomegaly observed in the Δ/Δep2 mice. This specific phenotype is due to an increase in Mac1+/Gr1+ splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and its selective rescue in the compound Δ/Δep2;MyD88 KO animals is likely due to the crucial role of MyD88 in the generation of these cells (Arora et al., 2010; Delano et al., 2007).”</p><p><italic>6) The use of SP600125 is not recommended because it is a relatively non-selective kinase inhibitor. Any experiment where SP600125 was used should be replaced with a more selective inhibitor.</italic> </p><p>All experiments involving SP600125 have been replaced with experiments in which JNK activation was inhibited by D-JNKI1. In addition, the experiment in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> now clearly shows that D-JNKI1 reduces ICAM1 expression in ∆/∆ep2 primary keratinocytes.</p><p><italic>7) The RNAi studies are poorly designed – phenotypes should be confirmed with two independent single oligonucleotides and rescued by expression of an RNAi-resistant cDNA.</italic></p><p>The RNAi studies involving knockdown of Raf1 and BRaf are backed up by all the experiments performed in knockout mice and cells, making off-target effects more than unlikely. Therefore, we have attempted to perform the requested experiments/controls only for MLK3 knockdown in Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes (see also response to point 4). Knockdown/re-expression experiments in primary mouse keratinocytes are notoriously difficult; we have succeeded in targeting MLK3 with two separate hairpins encoded by a lentiviral vector, but the reconstitution experiments using a single vector expressing both the hairpin and WT or shRNA-resistant MLK3 have failed because the infection efficiency with these large constructs went from 60-90% to less than 20%. This is a problem because keratinocytes cannot be FACS-sorted – they will not reattach and in fact will die after sorting. Irrespective of this, we now show that MLK3 knockdown by two distinct shRNAs in primary keratinocytes (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–F</xref> and Figure legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “Interfering with the JNK pathway decreases the production of proinflammatory molecules in primary Δ/Δep2 keratinocytes and RAF knockdown HaCat cells”) has the same effect as MLK3 knockdown by a pool of siRNAs targeting distinct sites in HaCat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised version). We are therefore confident that the effects of MLK3 silencing are specific.</p><p><italic>8) The authors show that BRAF/RAF1 deletion causes an &quot;inside out&quot; barrier defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Comparing mice with combined BRAF/RAF1 deletion, with mice presenting single deletion for BRAF or RAF1, would be important. Some studies have shown that RAF1 is implicated in disrupting tight junctions (Oncogene. 2007 26(8):1222-30 PMID: 16924233; J Cell Biol. 2000 148(4):791-800.PMID: 10684259).</italic></p><p>This experiment has been included in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>; discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection “Lack of epidermal BRAF and RAF1 causes transient inside-out barrier defects”). The figure shows that neither single knockout shows inside-out barrier defects or reduced tight junction proteins expression.</p><p><italic>9) The transient barrier defect conclusion in E18.5 embryos is unclear. At the end of the subsection “Lack of epidermal BRAF and RAF1 causes transient inside-out barrier defects” it is proposed that this defect affects the progression of the disease. This is partly based on the fact that deletion of Braf/Raf1 at 3 weeks produces a more modest phenotype. This may be one possible explanation. The milder phenotype may be a reflection of less robust gene deletion in the K5CreER(TX) mice. An immunoblot of epidermal lysates for BRAF and RAF1 should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</italic></p><p>This experiment has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. As described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Lack of epidermal BRAF and RAF1 causes transient inside-out barrier defects” and shows nearly complete deletion of both proteins in epidermal lysates.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: First, there appears to be specific activation of one ERK isoform (which one?) based on the pERK immunoblot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, whilst in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> both isoforms are phosphorylated. Second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – significance value for IL-13 missing. Third, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> – what is the explanation for why D-JNKi specifically suppresses CCL2 and CCL7 levels in the Δ/Δep2 mice, while the JNK/p38 inhibitors reduce levels in both F/F2 and knock-out mice?</italic></p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> (now 9C) has been replaced by a new figure showing the effect of the specific JNK inhibitor D-JNKI1. We agree with the reviewer, however, that there is some preference for the phosphorylation of one isoform, and this is ERK2. This can also be observed in epidermal lysates throughout the paper and in HaCat cells. The reason for this preference is not known, but unequal phosphorylation of ERK isoforms has been frequently observed in many different tissues and cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (now 9B), we stand corrected; this value has been inserted in the revised Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (now removed), the explanation is likely that SP600125+SB203580 have a stronger impact and more off target effects than the specific D-JNKI1. In fact we have been requested to remove the experiments in which SP600125 was used for exactly this reason.</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>: D-JNKi appears to suppress pERK in F/F2 epidermis to similar levels as found in Δ/Δep2. Is there an explanation for this?</italic></p><p>There is no obvious or easy explanation for this result; however, it should be noted that gradual differences in intensity observed in IHC may be difficult to interpret. We have therefore performed immunoblot analysis of epidermal lysates, which has given us a more quantitative measure of the differences observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> in the revised version) and does not show a significant reduction in pERK or in the downstream target pRSK in F/F2 epidermal lysates.</p><p><italic>12) Overall the outline of the paper is not very logical and it should be improved for clarity. For example, the analysis of the inflammation markers is often inconsistent, and the cytokines/chemokines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> should also be shown in the subsequent figures such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have done our best to improve the manuscript’s clarity, describing all the in vivo studies first and moving the experiments with cultured cells, now restricted to keratinocytes, to the end of the results.

Concerning inflammation markers, we have added K6 as an inflammation marker in addition to ICAM1 in all experiments. The cytokines/chemokines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> are shown for each experiment, but in the Figure supplements rather than in the main Figures, which are already extremely crowded.</p></body></sub-article></article>
