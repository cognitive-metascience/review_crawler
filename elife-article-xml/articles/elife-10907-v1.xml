However, how much cell environment is crucial for subtype determination still remained unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of <italic>Protocadherin20 (Pcdh20</italic>), which is expressed in post-migratory neurons of layer 4 (L4) lineage, caused the cells to localize in L2/3. The ectopically positioned “future L4 neurons” lost their L4 characteristics but acquired L2/3 characteristics. Knockdown of a cytoskeletal protein in the future L4 neurons, which caused random disruption of positioning, also showed that those accidentally located in L4 acquired the L4 characteristics. Moreover, restoration of positioning of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons into L4 rescued the specification failure. We further suggest that the thalamocortical axons provide a positional cue to specify L4 identity. These results suggest that the L4 identity is not completely determined at the time of birth but ensured by the surrounding environment after appropriate positioning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10907.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10907.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10907.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outer surface of the brain (the neocortex) in mammals is formed out of neurons arranged into layers. These layers are laid down during embryonic development, and each layer has characteristic mix of distinct subtypes of neurons that have different forms and sizes.</p> <p>Previous evidence suggests that neurons that are born at around the same time end up in the same layer of the cortex, and tend to have the same form. It is also possible that the environment a newborn neuron finds itself in influences its eventual form. However, many previous studies have investigated the function of molecules that work within the neurons, and the effect that a neuron’s surroundings have on its development still remains largely unknown.</p> <p>Neurons that contain a protein called protocadherin20 normally end up in layer 4 of the neocortex. Oishi et al. genetically engineered mouse embryos so that the production of protocadherin20 was reduced in these neurons whilst the neocortex formed. These neurons were also tagged with a fluorescent marker, so that their eventual position and shape in the brain could be tracked.</p> <p>Examining the brains of the mice after they had been born showed that the tagged neurons ended up not in layer 4, but in layers 2 and 3 of the neocortex. What is more, these neurons now looked similar to other neurons in layer 2 and 3, as well as producing proteins and establishing connections consistent with their new location. However, further experiments that placed neurons with reduced levels of the protocadherin20 protein into layer 4 showed that these neurons acquire the characteristics of other layer 4 neurons, despite lacking a key layer 4 protein.</p> <p>These results therefore suggest that the eventual form of a neuron is not determined just by when it is born, but also by the environment that it finds itself in. In future studies, it will be important to clarify the molecular mechanism that provides the appropriate environment and so regulates the identity of the neurons in the developing cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10907.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10907.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>cortical layer</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>protocadherin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H02355, 22111004, 25640039, 15H01586, 19700295, 21700356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oishi</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Understanding of molecular and environmental bases for brain health</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Terumo Life Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Life Science Foundation of Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001697</institution-id><institution>Keio University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Keio Gijuku Fukuzawa Memorial Fund for the Advancement of Education and Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001697</institution-id><institution>Keio University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Keio Gijuku Academic Development Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oishi</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Layer 4 neuronal identity is specified by Protocadherin20 positioning the neurons into layer 4 so that they receive a positional cue from thalamocortical axons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian neocortex consists of six layers, each containing one or more distinct subtype of neurons that share cell morphology, birth dates and connections with other regions of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>). The neurons are born in the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ), migrate radially toward the pial surface, to eventually come to reside beneath the marginal zone (MZ). Later-born neurons migrate past earlier-born neurons to more superficial layers, which results in the inside-out patterning of the cortical plate (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angevine and Sidman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry and Rogers, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rakic, 1974</xref>).</p><p>The processes involved in the differentiation and specification of distinct neuronal subtypes during development of the neocortex have been under investigation for a long time. Several determinants of the identities of neuronal subtypes have been identified, including Tbr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hevner et al., 2001</xref>), Fezf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>), Ctip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>), Satb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcamo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leone et al., 2014</xref>), Otx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weimann et al., 1999</xref>), Brn1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McEvilly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sugitani et al., 2002</xref>), Sox5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2008</xref>), and CoupTFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomassy et al., 2010</xref>), which are transcription factors expressed typically in a neuronal subtype-specific manner. However, the mechanisms by which neurons obtain such subtype-specific characteristics during development still remain largely unclear.</p><p>Given that each layer of the neocortex is occupied by neurons born at around the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angevine and Sidman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rakic, 1974</xref>), the hypothesis of temporal regulation of the progenitor cells, according to which the subtype of neurons is specified depending on their birth date, has been widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehay and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the cortical neurons acquire a birth-date-dependent segregation mechanism before their somas reach the MZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajioka and Nakajima, 2005</xref>). Previous transplantation studies of ferret cerebral cortical neurons suggest that the ultimate laminar fate (whether they eventually come to reside in the superficial layers or in the deep layers) is determined, at least to some extent, in the progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McConnell and Kaznowski, 1991</xref>). Recent in vitro culture studies also suggested a cell-intrinsic mechanism of subtype specification of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eiraku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaspard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2006</xref>); however, only a limited number of subtype specific markers were applied in these studies, still leaving it an open question whether all laminar fates are intrinsically determined.</p><p>Although this contention had attracted little attention until recently, it is also conceivable that cortical lamination or appropriate cell positioning in the CP is required for full differentiation of neurons. The neocortex of mutant mice, such as homozygous mutant mice for <italic>Reln<sup>rl</sup></italic> (also known as <italic>reeler</italic>),which contains an almost normal set of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dekimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hevner et al., 2003</xref>), but severely disorganized cortical lamination, shows some changes in subtype specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polleux et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, several subtype-specific characteristics of cortical neurons appear in the post-migratory phase, when the cortical layers begin to develop, implying that additional events of subtype specification may also take place. For example, pyramidal neurons begin to develop their apical dendrites only after the neurons settle beneath the MZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer and Altman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marin-Padilla, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, a number of subtype-specific molecular markers can be detected only in post-migratory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcamo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, there is a high degree of plasticity in the identity of postmitotic cortical neurons, which was revealed by ectopic expression of a subtype-specific transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De la Rossa et al., 2013</xref>). We previously reported a set of genes that are preferentially expressed in the superficial region of the developing CP, including the primitive cortical zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sekine et al., 2011</xref>), of the mouse, and proposed that several events critical for proper neuronal maturation and layer formation must take place beneath the MZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sekine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tachikawa et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is still not established whether the neuronal subtype might also be affected by the microenvironment in the cortical layers after radial migration.</p><p>L4 of the neocortex is composed of several types of spiny neurons, including the spiny stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>), that integrate thalamic inputs into cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petersen, 2007</xref>). In contrast, most of the other neocortical neurons transmit output signals to subcortical regions or other cortical regions such as the contralateral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomson and Bannister, 2003</xref>). Thalamocortical axons terminate primarily in L4, and the signals received in L4 are transduced mainly to L2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomson and Bannister, 2003</xref>). Reflecting their specific functions, L4 neurons show a round shape and granular morphology with multiple short dendrites, which is unique, and distinct from other neocortical “pyramidal” neurons. In addition to these unique morphological characteristics, several genes are also expressed preferentially in L4 neurons, such as <italic>Rorb</italic> (also known as <italic>RORβ), Unc5d</italic> and <italic>Coup-tf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakagawa and O'Leary, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pouchelon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting underlying some mechanisms that might regulate the specification of L4 neurons at a molecular level. In this study, we newly identified a non-clustered protocadherin, <italic>Protocadherin20 (Pcdh20</italic>), which encodes a putative transmembrane protein, as a gene that begins to be expressed in immature postmitotic neurons, and is expressed in L4 neurons in the postnatal stages.</p><p>The protocadherin family of proteins, whose adhesion strength is usually very weak or undetectable, belong to the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and are widely expressed throughout the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morishita and Yagi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takeichi, 2007</xref>). Although several members of this protein family, including Pcdh20, show layer-specific expression in the CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), it still remains largely unclear whether these genes may play a role in neocortical layer formation and subtype specification of neocortical neurons.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of Pcdh20 during the development of L4. We found that Pcdh20 regulated the positioning of “future L4 neurons” into L4 via RhoA signaling, and that its knockdown not only caused malpositioning of these neurons into L2/3, but also caused them to acquire L2/3 characteristics. Recovery of positioning of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons to L4 also rescued the defect of their specification. Furthermore, thalamocortical axons appeared to provide a positional cue to immature L4 neurons. Our data indicate that Pcdh20 plays an essential role in the specification of L4 neurons through regulating positioning of the cells after radial migration to beneath the MZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression pattern of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> during cortical development</title><p>To identify the genes responsible for the post-migratory events during layer formation, we explored genes that are preferentially expressed in the superficial part of the CP, where the radial migration of neurons eventually ends, on embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) and E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tachikawa et al., 2008</xref>), and are expressed in a layer-specific manner in the neocortex on postnatal day 7 (P7). As a result, we found that <italic>Pcdh20</italic> is preferentially expressed in L4 on P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A”</xref>). No layer-specific signals were detected with the sense probe in the P7 neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’”</xref>). On E18.5, <italic>Pcdh20</italic> was expressed beneath the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,B’</xref>) in the somatosensory cortex, where a large fraction of the “future L4 neurons” resides after radial neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajioka and Nakajima, 2005</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

First, we examined the knockdown efficiency of the shRNA vectors on ectopically expressed Pcdh20. We found that expression of an shRNA vector targeting <italic>Pcdh20</italic> (hereinafter referred to as PC20sh) was associated with a markedly reduced protein expression level of Pcdh20 as compared with that of a control shRNA (CONsh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, expression of a mutant shRNA vector harboring three point mutations in PC20sh (PC20sh_mut) did not significantly affect the expression level of Pcdh20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, this knockdown vector was found to markedly decrease the endogenous expression levels of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as well as protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) in primary cortical cultures.</p><p>To examine the in vivo role of Pcdh20 during cortical development, we transferred RNAi vectors into living embryos by in utero electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>). Various RNAi vectors together with a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing vector were injected into the lateral ventricles of the mouse embryos on E14.0 and introduced into cortical cells by electroporation. First, the pups were sacrificed on P7, by which time, the basic structure of the neocortex was already expected to have formed. In the controls, most of the GFP-positive cells with CONsh or PC20sh_mut in the somatosensory cortex were located in L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). On the other hand, electroporation of PC20sh changed the laminar location of the GFP-positive cells to more superficial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). In addition, another shRNA vector targeting the 3’UTR of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic> gene also disrupted the laminar positioning of the electroporated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The specificity of PC20sh for <italic>Pcdh20</italic> was further confirmed by an experiment in which co-introduction of an RNAi-resistant Pcdh20-expressing vector (resPcdh20) with PC20sh recovered the defect of neuronal positioning of the PC20sh-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also analyzed the effects of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown on deep layer neurons by transfecting the shRNA vectors on E12.5, when L5 and L6 neurons were expected to be produced. We found that <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown in the deeper layer neurons hardly affected the cell positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), suggesting the specific function of Pcdh20 in L4 neurons.

To determine whether the <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown affected the neuronal positioning by inhibiting radial migration of the neurons toward the MZ or by a mechanism operative after the radial migration, a series of time-course experiments were performed. Brains electroporated on E14.0 were analyzed on E16.5, E18.0 and P2, the time-points roughly corresponding to mid-migration, end of migration and post-migration, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K</xref> and data not shown). On E16.5 and E18.0, few differences were observed between the control and <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I,L</xref> and data not shown). In contrast, analysis of the P2 brains, in which the “future L4 neurons” had started to form a layer structure beneath the primitive L2/3, revealed that the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown cells were located in a slightly more superficial position than that in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K,M</xref>).

We first analyzed the expression of Rorb and Lhx2 in the E18.0 neocortex. However, since Rorb expression was almost exclusively detected in L5, and Lhx2 expression was uniform in all the superficial layer neurons (both future L2/3 and L4) on E18.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M–P</xref>), we could not assess the specification/differentiation of L2/3 and L4 at this stage. On P2, Rorb expression was detected in control L4 neurons, but not in <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1Q,R</xref>), similar to the finding in the P7 neocortex, although Lhx2 expression was still relatively uniform in all superficial layer neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1S,T</xref>), suggesting that at least some of the laminar characteristics had begun to be regulated by Pcdh20 by this stage.</p><p>We next analyzed whether the axonal projection patterns were affected by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown. Normally, many L4 neurons, which can be labeled by electroporation on E14.0, extend axons locally within the ipsilateral cortex, while most of the L2/3 neurons, which can be labeled by electroporation on E15.0, extend axons to the contralateral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>). We injected Fluoro-Gold, a fluorescent retrograde axonal tracer, into the hemisphere contralateral to the electroporated side to label commissural neurons, and analyzed whether the electroporated neurons incorporated this fluorescent dye. We first confirmed that the percentage of retrogradely labeled neurons in L2/3 was much higher than that in L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>).

It is thus possible that misspecification of the neuronal laminar identity after <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown was caused as a result of additional or delayed cell divisions. To address this question and determine whether the laminar specification was indeed changed by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown in the postmitotic cells, we performed electroporation of the shRNA and GFP vectors on E14.0 and subsequently labeled the entire population of mitotic cells by serial injections of BrdU every 5 hr for 20 hr immediately after the electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In this experiment, the population of GFP-positive and BrdU-negative cells (referred to as GFP<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>–</sup> cells) was thought to represent postmitotic neurons or cells in the very late stages of the cell cycle in terminal mitosis in the VZ at the time of the electroporation, based on the following reasons. First, plasmid vectors are incorporated primarily into VZ cells by in utero electroporation. Second, since the duration of the S phase at this stage is about 4 hr, and since the nuclei in the S phase can be labeled for at least 2 hr after a single injection of BrdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takahashi et al., 1992</xref>), injections of BrdU at intervals of up to 6 hr are sufficient for labeling all the mitotic VZ cells. Finally, the total length of the cell cycle is about 15 hr, which is shorter than the total period of BrdU application (see ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tabata et al., 2009</xref>) for more details). These GFP<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>–</sup> cells are included in the “slowly exiting population”, a population that becomes postmitotic in the VZ and migrates out slowly into the multipolar cell accumulation zone above the VZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tabata et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Triple immunostaining of P7 brain sections for GFP, BrdU and Rorb revealed that the percentage of Rorb-positive cells in the GFP<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>–</sup> population was markedly decreased by knockdown of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown perturbed L4 specification of the postmitotic cells. The extent of decrease in the percentage of Rorb-positive cells was comparable in all cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the effect of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown was not influenced by whether the knockdown vector was introduced into a postmitotic population or a mitotic population.

These previous discrepancies might have been caused by the differences in their experimental conditions. We examined the effect of DN-RhoA at E18.0, when future L4 neurons just finished migration and started to mature. We found that there was no significant difference in cell positioning between control and DN-RhoA expressing cells at least at the concentration/condition we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the DN-RhoA-expressing neurons settle in the ridge of the CP similarly to normal cells after radial migration, although they could have migrated differently. Therefore, the phenotype observed at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) was thought to be caused mainly by the event after radial migration toward the brain surface is completed. However, we do not exclude the possibility that there might be an additional effect of migration difference on subtype specification, especially in the case of enhanced migration, because there was a tendency (not statistically significant) for the DN-RhoA-expressing cells to position in deeper layers at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> (bins 4–6)). One might suspect that accelerated neuronal migration could cause premature differentiation, which would result in more cells in deeper layers, although this effect of DN-RhoA, if any, was thought to be minor.</p><p>If RhoA is an intracellular effector downstream of Pcdh20, the phenotypes observed by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown should be rescued by activation of RhoA. To test this, we examined whether a constitutively active form of RhoA (CA-RhoA) could restore the phenotypes resulting from <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown. The results revealed that co-expression of CA-RhoA with PC20sh indeed rescued the malpositioning of future L4 neurons caused by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Moreover, we examined the misspecification phenotype associated with <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown and found that the loss of Rorb expression by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown was also restored by co-expression of CA-RhoA with PC20sh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>).

One is that the two phenotypes might arise independently, and the other two are that the disrupted neuronal positioning may affect the neuronal specification, or vice versa. To distinguish among these possibilities, we sought to disrupt the neuronal positioning of “future L4 neurons” using another method. We took advantage of knockdown of <italic>Doublecortin (Dcx</italic>), since knockdown of this gene in the mouse neocortex has been reported to cause random disruption of neuronal positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2006</xref>). We focused on the cells that came to reside in the superficial layers (L2–4) for the purpose of this study. The proportions of Rorb- as well as KCNH5-positive cells among the GFP-positive cells located in L2–4 were dramatically decreased by <italic>Dcx</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

It is thus possible that TCAs invading upward from the deeper part of the CP may provide a positional cue to the cortical neurons. We therefore analyzed <italic>Pcdh10</italic> (also known as <italic>OL-protocadherin</italic> or <italic>OL-pc</italic>)-knockout mice, in which the TCAs are severely disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uemura et al., 2007</xref>). First, we examined the extent to which the TCAs are lost in the neocortex of this mutant line. Immunohistochemistry for NetrinG1, a TCA-specific marker, revealed a marked decrease of the TCAs in the brains of the <italic>Pcdh10 (OL-pc</italic>) knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). We next examined the expressions of several subtype-specific markers to investigate layer identities on P3 and P7. We found that expression of Rorb was markedly decreased in <italic>Pcdh10 (OL-pc</italic>) knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). In parallel with the decrease in the expression of the L4 marker, expressions of Lhx2 and Tbr1, both of which are not expressed in L4 in the control neocortex, were increased in the mutant neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–K</xref>). These results suggest that the neurons that are destined to become L4 neurons lose their L4 identity and instead acquire some of the L2/3 characteristics, presumably because of the absence of the TCAs. Moreover, these results are similar to the misspecification phenotype of the malpositioned neurons by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> or <italic>Dcx</italic> knockdown, suggesting that TCAs might provide a positional cue to immature L4 neurons.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10907.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Requirement of TCAs for correct differentiation of L4 neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>K</bold>) The sections prepared from <italic>Pcdh10</italic> (<italic>OL-pc</italic>) knockout mice were immunostained for NetrinG1 (<bold>A, B</bold>), Rorb (<bold>C, D</bold>), Lhx2 (<bold>F, G</bold>) and Tbr1 (<bold>I, J</bold>).

This positioning enables the future L4 neurons to come in contact with TCAs, which appears to be required for further specification and maturation of the L4 neurons (upper right). In the absence of Pcdh20, the neurons reside in the upper part and are unable to receive signals from TCAs (lower row).

We propose that the laminar identities of neurons within the superficial layers (L2–4) of the CP are not completely specified until the neurons arrive beneath the MZ; the ultimate fates of the L2/3 and L4 neurons are specified in the post-migratory phase according to the positioning of the cells. In this model, “future L4 neurons” are positioned in the deeper part of the superficial layers in a Pcdh20-RhoA-dependent manner after radial migration to the top of the CP, and then differentiate into mature L4 neurons, presumably by receiving signals from TCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). Although post-migratory neurons were generally thought to just pile up on the earlier-settled neurons after radial migration, our results imply that the processes that take place after radial migration are also precisely regulated and are critical for correct laminar positioning of at least the “future L4 neurons”.</p><p>Sufficient attention has not been paid in previous studies to the relationship between cell positioning and laminar identity specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehay and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2006</xref>). In previous studies, the <italic>Reln<sup>rl</sup>/Reln<sup>rl</sup></italic>neocortex, in which the cortical laminar structure is largely inverted and considerably disorganized, was shown to contain an almost normal set of neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehay and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hevner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Polleux et al., 1998</xref>). Another relevant observation is that when future L2/3 neurons were induced to localize in L5, they did not acquire the characteristics of L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we showed regulation by Pcdh20 of the cell positioning of “future L4 neurons” and also specification of their laminar identity, and concluded the causal effect of cell positioning regulated by Pcdh20 on L4 specification, which was supported by the results of the following experiments. First, malpositioning of the neurons by another method (i.e., knockdown of <italic>Dcx</italic>) reproduced the failure of the laminar identity specification of the L4 neurons. Second, loss of Pcdh20 caused misspecification of L4 neurons only in vivo but not in an in vitro primary culture, where positional effects did not exist. Third, recovery of cell positioning into L4 even in the absence of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> rescued the L4 characteristics. One might suspect that this model is controversial to the observation in the <italic>Reln<sup>rl</sup>/Reln<sup>rl</sup></italic>cortex, where L4 neurons are actually generated. In this mutant, a substantial amount of TCAs was reported to grow into the mutant CP, although they pass a bizarre course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caviness and Frost, 1983</xref>), which could be enough to induce L4 specification.</p><p>Although it has long been supposed that cell fate decision of cortical neurons takes place mainly in the progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehay and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>), our data now suggest that L4 specification may also occur in postmitotic neurons, which is supported by several lines of evidence. First, the expression of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> mRNA was undetectable or very low, if any, in progenitor cells, but became clearer in the postmitotic neurons beneath the MZ, as evaluated by in situ hybridization and higher by quantitative RT-PCR. Consistent with this finding, the distribution of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons remained normal before and during radial neuronal migration, but became disrupted after the neurons settled beneath the MZ. Moreover, introduction of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown vector even in a postmitotic population caused misspecification of the L4 neurons. Finally, expression of Pcdh20 in the postmitotic neurons was able to rescue the phenotypes induced by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown. This idea, of postmitotic regulation of subtype specification, is also supported by the fact that many subtype-specific genes play roles in postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcamo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leone et al., 2014</xref>) and that there is a high level of plasticity in the identity of postmitotic cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De la Rossa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, as the result of the misspecification induced by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown, which caused malpositioning of the “future L4 neurons” into L2/3 and loss of both the characteristic morphology of L4 neurons and of the expression of the L4 markers, the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons exhibited the morphological characteristics of pyramidal neurons and the functional characteristics of L2/3 neurons, including the characteristic marker expressions and axonal projections. These observations suggest that “future L4 neurons” have the capacity to differentiate into L2/3 neurons even in the postmitotic stage. Our results, however, also suggest regulation, at least in part, of the laminar fates in the progenitor cells, because the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown “future L4 neurons” had “imperfect” characteristics as compared to the normal L2/3 neurons, such as poorly developed basal dendrites and relatively mild conversion of the axonal projection patterns in the knockdown neurons located in L2/3.</p><p>Our results also revealed the involvement of a mechanism downstream of Pcdh20, namely, RhoA signaling, in the regulation of cell positioning of the future L4 neurons. We observed that the effect of dominant-negative RhoA mimicked the failure in neuronal positioning induced by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown, and that CA-RhoA was able to restore the phenotypes of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons. The relationship between protocadherin and RhoA has also been shown in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Unterseher et al., 2004</xref>). Although we do not yet know the mechanism underlying the activation of RhoA by Pcdh20, a mechanism similar to that observed in the regulation of Rho downstream of other protocadherins, such as paraxial protocadherin, may be operative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>How does Pcdh20-RhoA regulate the laminar positioning of the “future L4 neurons”? We assume that the loss of Pcdh20 primarily leads to dysregulation of dendritic morphogenesis, followed by malpositioning of the L4 neurons, which is supported by several lines of evidence. First, <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown in an in vitro culture, where cell positional effects are ignorable, resulted in increased dendritogenesis without altering L4 fate specification. In vivo, Pcdh20- and Dcx double-knockdown neurons tended to exhibit pyramidal morphology even if they were in L4, especially those located near the margin of L4, also suggesting the primary effect, to some extent at least, of Pcdh20 on cell morphology. Regulation of dendritic morphogenesis by another protocadherin was also reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shima et al., 2004</xref>). Second, in the time-course experiment of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown, we noticed that loss of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> first affected the dendrite morphology leading to extensive dendritic arborization, when the control cells already started to exhibit simplification of their complex apical primitive dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>). Finally, active RhoA rescued the malpositioning caused by <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown with reduced arborization of the apical dendrites of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because the arborized dendrites were predominantly found in the MZ, it is possible that the abnormal dendrites might have caused the knockdown neurons to become ‘stuck’ to the MZ.</p><p>How the Pcdh20-RhoA signaling is activated is yet to be defined. Considering that several members of the protocadherin family exhibit homophilic binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morishita and Yagi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takeichi, 2007</xref>), it is conceivable that homophilic interactions may regulate laminar formation through gathering neurons that share the adhesion activity. However, since the interactions through protocadherins, including Pcdh20, are usually very weak or undetectable (K.O. and K.N. unpublished data), there may be other ligands that activate Pcdh20 to regulate neuronal positioning.</p><p>Then, what is the mechanism that gives positional cues to immature L4 neurons to exhibit cell-position-dependent subtype specification? Since the acquisition of the L4-specific characteristics (e.g., simplification of apical dendrites) by the “future L4 neurons” coincided with the arrival of the TCAs into the lower part of the CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003</xref>), we hypothesized that these axons could positively regulate the L4 identity specification. We demonstrated here that TCAs might be involved in correct subtype specification of L4 neurons by the analysis of TCA-deficient <italic>Pcdh10 (OL-pc</italic>) knockout mice. The results of other studies also suggested that defects in TCAs misspecify L4 identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>) and that TCAs instruct the development of modality-specific properties of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pouchelon et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we showed that TCA absence resulted in loss of L4 identity and, surprisingly, instead acquisition of some L2/3 characteristics, which recapitulated the phenotypes observed in <italic>Pcdh20</italic> or <italic>Dcx</italic> knockdown, suggesting that TCAs might provide a positional cue to immature L4 neurons. Molecular mechanisms underlying this action still remain to be determined. Although neuronal transmission from TCAs to L4 neurons is an attractive candidate, it may not be required for this action. It was reported that defects in synaptic activity from TCAs to cortical neurons did not appear to be involved in subtype specification of L4 neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iwasato et al., 2000</xref>). A more recent study showed that complete blockade of thalamocortical neurotransmission resulted in perturbed development of L4 neurons. Initial specification of cortical neurons, however, appeared largely normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>), which occurs through the first week after birth, at the stage when specification failure was already observed in our mouse model.</p><p>Finally, another intriguing finding of this study was the apparent involvement of a transmembrane protein in the subtype specification in the post-migratory stage. This suggested that the environment around the immature neurons could also influence the subtype specification of the neurons. Although postmitotic expressions of fate determinants, such as subtype-specific transcription factors, have been observed in the immature CP, it is not known whether these factors are induced intrinsically downstream of the fate determinants in the progenitor cells or in response to the extracellular environment. Therefore, it will be important to examine the role of the environment in the subtype specification of the postmitotic/post-migratory neurons in other contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Pregnant ICR mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan).

<body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Identity of neocortical layer 4 neurons is specified through correct positioning into the cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph G Gleeson (Reviewing Editor) and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While we are favorably inclined there are some significant shortcomings in the study that need to be fully addressed for acceptance. The goal of <italic>eLife</italic> is to avoid requesting revisions that would take more than 2 months, and the reviewers estimated that these suggestions should be possible to address within this time frame.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This is an interesting study that seeks to alter the longstanding paradigm used for understanding cortical neuron fate. Authors provide evidence to show that <italic>Pcdh20</italic> has a role in regulating the ultimate fate of L4 neurons and that this action is a) post-mitotic and b) acts via controlling laminar positioning. The authors provide a spectrum of evidence to support these ideas, however, all reviewers believe that there are some significant shortcomings in the study.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>The main criticism focuses on three points that should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p> <p>The reliance on shRNA has left reviewers with doubt that the protein is inactivated. The authors rely very heavily on shRNA knockdown of <italic>Pcdh20</italic>. They show that they can knock this down in vitro but the effect is far from complete. The authors show that the cells still express 20% residual protein. This is in the optimal conditions of transfection of cells in cell culture with tagged <italic>Pcdh20</italic>. The authors never show the degree of protein knockdown in the cortex when they use this approach. They simply must develop a way to show that their key manipulation (on which they base the majority of their results) actually has the intended effect of decreasing expression in the relevant cells. Without this demonstration it is hard to really know what is going on. The reviewers would like to see experiments that show that protein levels of PCDH20 are indeed reduced. One possible independent way, which the authors may like to consider, is the following: Late in the study the authors use a mouse with genetic disruption of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic> locus. We realize that these mice are hard to interpret due to the disruption of TCA fibers but the authors could perhaps consider using a cell transplantation approach using cells from these mutants. This would further establish the role for <italic>Pcdh20</italic> rather than shRNA manipulation in the phenotype.</p> <p>We have important concerns about the Rho experiments, which require tempered interpretation, because the use of DN and CA constructs is likely to lead to many migratory effects that are distinct from the <italic>Pcdh20</italic> loss-of-function effects. These molecules are downstream of many proteins that act at various stages in the migrating neurons. This makes these experiments difficult to interpret. While one possibility, only slightly better, is that the authors could transfect with T1-α promoter driving these constricts. Consistent with these likely global effects, these manipulations lead to somewhat different abnormal cellular distributions (according to the authors; own data). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> the electroporated cells with DN-RhoA are more widely distributed, including into deeper layers. This implies a migration phenotype from this manipulation. This could be a major problem with this portion of the study and needs to be carefully addressed by altering the interpretation so that these concerns are well reflected and conclusions tempered.</p> <p>PCDH20 could function directly on fate or indirectly on fate through an effect on positioning. We suggest testing the effects of PCDH20 on neurons ex vivo (in culture). The authors looked at dendritic patterns (which are altered), but not at molecular fate marker patterns: they should do this, as if PCDH20 does not alter molecular fate markers in ex vivo experiments, it would strongly suggest that neuronal positioning is the crucial event, while if the fate is somehow altered (more expression of layer 4 markers) it would be more compatible with a direct effect on PCDH20. This could be combined with BrdU birthdating to label only cohorts of neurons to maximize specificity and sensitivity.</p></body> </sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10907.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>The reliance on shRNA has left reviewers with doubt that the protein is inactivated.

We now have performed Western blot analysis using primary cortical cultures to see if the endogenous protein levels of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> are affected by knockdown. The result showed that the <italic>Pcdh20</italic> protein level is indeed reduced in the <italic>Pcdh20</italic> knockdown cells (presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As you may notice, there are still remaining <italic>Pcdh20</italic> proteins in the knockdown cells probably due to imperfect transfection efficiency in this experiment (roughly 80% transfection efficiency) as well as incomplete knockdown effects.</p> <p>We also conducted another independent shRNA experiment using another shRNA targeting <italic>Pcdh20</italic>. The result showed that this shRNA phenocopied the original shRNA phenotype (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>).</p> <p>We believe that these new results as well as the original ones strongly support the notion that the phenotypes observed here is actually by the reduction of <italic>Pcdh20</italic> protein levels but not due to off-target effects.</p> <p><italic>We have important concerns about the Rho experiments, which require tempered interpretation, because the use of DN and CA constructs is likely to lead to many migratory effects that are distinct from the Pcdh20 loss-of-function effects.

While one possibility, only slightly better, is that the authors could transfect with T1-</italic>α <italic>promoter driving these constricts. Consistent with these likely global effects, these manipulations lead to somewhat different abnormal cellular distributions (according to the authors; own data). For example, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> <italic>the electroporated cells with DN-RhoA are more widely distributed, including into deeper layers. This implies a migration phenotype from this manipulation. This could be a major problem with this portion of the study and needs to be carefully addressed by altering the interpretation so that these concerns are well reflected and conclusions tempered.</italic> </p> <p>We constructed several expression vectors based on the Cre-loxP system, in which DN-RhoA is expressed under the CAG promoter only after a loxP-stop-loxP cassette is excised by the Cre recombinase, which is driven by Talpha1 promoter in this case. However, in any of these cases, the levels of RhoA expression were found to be very low compared to the original pCAGGS-DN-RhoA construct for some reason. So, unfortunately we could not address the issue using this system.</p> <p>Instead, we examined the effect of DN-RhoA at E18.0, when future L4 neurons just finished migration and started to mature. We found that there was no significant difference in cell positioning between control and DN-RhoA expressing cells at least at the concentration/condition we used (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p> <p>The role of RhoA signaling in neuronal migration is controversial; inhibition of RhoA interfered with neuronal migration in some studies (Pacary et al., 2011, PMID:21435554; Xu et al., 2015, PMID: 26511243), but it promoted migration in other cases (Cappello et al., 2012, PMID:22405202; Nguyen et al., 2006, PMID:16705040; Ge et al., 2006, PMID:16432194). These previous discrepancies might have been caused by the differences in their experimental conditions. From our new analysis, the DN-RhoA expressing neurons appeared to settle in the ridge of the CP very similarly to normal cells after radial migration, although they could have migrated differently. Therefore, we think that the phenotype observed at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) is most probably due to the event after radial migration is completed by around E18.0 rather than mainly caused by the migration difference.</p> <p>However, we do not exclude the possibility that there might be an additional effect of migration difference on subtype specification, especially in the case of enhanced migration, because there tended to be more cells in deeper layers with DN-RhoA at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; this is not statistically significant though). One might suspect that accelerated neuronal migration could cause premature differentiation, which would result in more cells in deeper layers at P7. This effect of DN-RhoA, if any, was thought to be minor, though. It would be interesting to address this issue in future studies by looking at subtype specification of the cells that migrate much faster than normal cells by some treatment. We have added this point in the text (subsection “Involvement of RhoA signaling in the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-dependent positioning of L4 neurons”, third paragraph). We highly appreciate this important comment by the reviewers/editor.</p> <p> <italic>PCDH20 could function directly on fate or indirectly on fate through an effect on positioning. We suggest testing the effects of PCDH20 on neurons ex vivo (in culture). The authors looked at dendritic patterns (which are altered), but not at molecular fate marker patterns: they should do this, as if PCDH20 does not alter molecular fate markers in ex vivo experiments, it would strongly suggest that neuronal positioning is the crucial event, while if the fate is somehow altered (more expression of layer 4 markers) it would be more compatible with a direct effect on PCDH20. This could be combined with BrdU birthdating to label only cohorts of neurons to maximize specificity and sensitivity.</italic></p> <p>This suggestion is very helpful to further clarify whether <italic>Pcdh20</italic> indeed functions indirectly for subtype specification. We cultured future L4 neurons (E14.0-born) from E18.0 cortex, when they are not yet matured, and looked at the subtype specification after 4 days in vitro, when these cells become <italic>Rorb</italic>-positive in vivo. To label future L4 neurons and introduce knockdown vectors, electroporation with control or <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown vector was performed at E14.0, and these cells were utilized for further in vitro cultures. We did not find any difference of <italic>Rorb</italic> expression between control and <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons in this condition (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R</xref>; subsection “<italic>Pcdh20</italic> specifies L4 identity through controlling cell positioning“, last paragraph). Together with the result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S-U</xref> that <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons in a similar condition had more arborized dendrites, this result further supports the notion that <italic>Pcdh20</italic> directly regulates cell morphology rather than cell fate. This discussion was also added in the text (Discussion, second and sixth paragraphs).</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
