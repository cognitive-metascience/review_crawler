junction degeneration is a prominent aspect of sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle integrity. Previously, we showed that muscle stem cells activate and contribute to mouse neuromuscular junction regeneration in response to denervation (Liu et al., 2015). Here, we examined gene expression profiles and neuromuscular junction integrity in aged mouse muscles, and unexpectedly found limited denervation despite a high level of degenerated neuromuscular junctions. Instead, degenerated neuromuscular junctions were associated with reduced contribution from muscle stem cells. Indeed, muscle stem cell depletion was sufficient to induce neuromuscular junction degeneration at a younger age. Conversely, prevention of muscle stem cell and derived myonuclei loss was associated with attenuation of age-related neuromuscular junction degeneration, muscle atrophy, and the promotion of aged muscle force generation. Our observations demonstrate that deficiencies in muscle stem cell fate and post-synaptic myogenesis provide a cellular basis for age-related neuromuscular junction degeneration and associated skeletal muscle decline.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26464.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26464.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>satellite cell</kwd><kwd>sarcopenia</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>Sprouty</kwd><kwd>denervation</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AG051456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakkalakal</surname><given-names>Joe V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-14-1-0454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakkalakal</surname><given-names>Joe V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C026877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Wenxuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Liu et al., 2015), it is shown that depletion or rescue of adult skeletal muscle stem cells is sufficient to induce or attenuate age-associated neuromuscular junction deterioration respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related neuromuscular junction (NMJ, synapse between motor neuron and skeletal muscle cells) declines in rodents and humans manifest as altered pre-synaptic nerve terminal and abnormal post-synaptic morphology indicative of degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oda, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wokke et al., 1990</xref>). Although these disruptions are often associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction and disease, whether age-associated NMJ remodeling primarily reflects deterioration of target muscle cells or the peripheral nervous system is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kang and Lichtman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banker et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that adult skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable capacity for regeneration endowed by a population of adult resident stem cells, satellite cells (SCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>).

In our previous study, we examined SC fate during NMJ denervation and reinnervation, and found that SCs contribute to NMJ regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Recently contributions of SCs and derived progenitors to myofibers have been observed during sedentary aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive studies have shown that SC number and function decline with age; however, whether this loss is connected to age-associated NMJ degeneration is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</xref>).

Although we observed a high proportion of degenerated NMJs in aged muscles, very few were completely denervated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). To further examine the extent to which aged skeletal muscles are denervated we performed genome-wide RNA-seq analysis on synaptic (Syn) and extra-synaptic (ExS) regions of adult (6-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) diaphragms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To confirm the fidelity of our samples, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) between 6M-Syn and 6M-ExS samples using gene sets derived from the Gene Ontology Molecular Function (GOMF).

Examination of NMJ integrity revealed that age-related NMJ deterioration was attenuated in Spry1OX muscles, demonstrated by a reduction in the proportion of pre/post-synaptic degenerated NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Also, an increase in the size of post-synaptic myonuclear clusters was observed in aged Spry1OX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>). Since we observed improvements in NMJ integrity and robust increases in the size of post-synaptic myonuclear clusters, we wondered if these findings were associated with improvements in skeletal muscle function. Therefore, we analyzed time or distance to exhaustion with treadmill exercise as an initial readout of muscle performance. Aged Spry1OX mice ran a significantly longer time/distance than Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Next, we specifically examined skeletal muscle function through testing EDL <italic>ex vivo</italic> tetanic force generation capacity. Significant increases were detected in peak absolute force generated by aged Spry1OX muscles in comparison to Ctrl muscles upon stimulation at frequencies of 100, 125 and 150 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). However, no significant difference was observed when force was normalized to physiological cross-sectional area (specific force), which accounts for modifications in muscle girth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Indeed, we observed increased EDL myofiber cross-sectional area without significant changes in myofiber type composition or number in aged Spry1OX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Therefore, preventing age-related SC loss, through stimulation of Spry1 expression in SCs without direct peripheral nerve manipulation, was associated with the prevention of post-synaptic myonuclear loss, myofiber atrophy, and force generation capacity decline in aged skeletal muscles.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26464.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prevention of age-related SC loss by <italic>Spry1</italic> overexpression is associated with attenuation of sarcopenia-related declines in NMJ and skeletal muscle integrity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme demonstrating time of tamoxifen treatment and harvest of tissue for Ctrl or Spry1OX mice.

Specifically, SCs are a source of post-synaptic myonuclei. With age SC-derived contribution of myonuclei to the post-synaptic region is compromised, which accordingly links to age-related NMJ degeneration. Remarkably, SC depletion was sufficient to accelerate the onset of sarcopenia-related declines in post-synaptic myonuclei, NMJ integrity, and myofiber size. In contrast, attenuating SC loss during aging through SC-specific Spry1 overexpression was associated with improved NMJ integrity and force generation capacity in aged muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Intuitively, denervation is considered to be a mechanism that contributes to age-related skeletal muscle decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2014</xref>). Although denervation is sufficient to trigger extensive skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction, the proportion of completely denervated aged NMJs is modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oda, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wokke et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banker et al., 1983</xref>). Denervation with subsequent reinnervation can lead to degenerated NMJ morphology. For instance we previously demonstrated, in adult mice, sciatic nerve disruption-mediated denervation at a considerable distance from the target lower limbs and subsequent reinnervation leads to a high fraction of NMJs with degenerated morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, insults in relatively close proximity to nerve terminals that lead to reinnervation, even in aged skeletal muscle, result in efficient repair without degenerated morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kang and Lichtman, 2013</xref>). Although loss of NMJ-organizers such as Agrin or Laminin-α4 is sufficient to induce denervation, these molecules are not lost with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Samuel et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, denervation stemming from sciatic nerve injury in adults or through genetic disruption of critical NMJ regulators in the embryo leads to robust elevation or induction of extra-synaptic expression of synapse-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). In aged skeletal muscles we did not observe characteristics of robust denervation, therefore denervation is likely not a principal mechanism driving age-related NMJ degeneration.</p><p>Recently SCs have been shown to contribute to sedentary aging myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>). Through the use of a distinct SC fate tracking strategy and single myofiber analysis at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, we were able to address at which ages SC-derived contributions near NMJs prevail and when they decline. Such contributions could reflect severe myofiber degeneration and regeneration, as observed with myofiber insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li and Thompson, 2011</xref>). Although laser ablation adjacent to endplate regions leads to local myofiber degeneration and regeneration with NMJ fragmentation, whether this insult affected the number, function, or recruitment of SCs or other skeletal muscle resident stem and progenitor cell types is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li and Thompson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentzinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Judson et al., 2013</xref>). Central nucleated myofibers, an indicator of degeneration and regeneration, have been observed in aged muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Valdez et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, degenerative-regenerative events have been observed along the length of aging myofibers; however, such events leading to degenerated NMJ morphology in aged muscles are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, we observed SC derived progenitor fusion into myofibers without appreciable central nucleation, consistent with previous reports during aging, adolescent maturation, and denervation atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pawlikowski et al., 2015</xref>). During natural aging or upon SC depletion, loss of SC contribution is associated with NMJ degeneration. Correspondingly, we found correlations between indices of NMJ degeneration and reduced post-synaptic myonuclear cluster size. Post-synaptic myonuclear cluster size can be influenced by dissociation through the manipulation of proteins that anchor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grady et al., 2005</xref>). Aging is associated with loss of total number and normal spatial arrangement of myonuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruusgaard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brack et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that both loss and dissociation contribute to reductions in the size of post-synaptic myonuclear clusters with age.</p><p>Stimulation of Spry1 expression has been shown to prevent age-related SC loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigot et al., 2015</xref>). In primary cultures of aged human myoblasts, stimulation of Spry1 expression through global epigenetic modification promoted SC maintenance at the expense of myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigot et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, forced expression of the related Spry2 during embryonic myogenesis favored retention of renewal competent as opposed to terminally committed myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lagha et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, based on restoration of post-synaptic myonuclei, prevention of age-related atrophy, and improved force generation, we demonstrate that SC-specific Spry1 overexpression attenuates age-related SC decline without compromising myogenic differentiation. In the context of aging, Spry1 modifies FGF activity to regulate SC pool size at homeostasis; however, the mechanisms of Spry1-mediated regulation of adult and aged post-synaptic myogenic differentiation are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, fusion of SC derived Spry1OX myogenic progenitors could lead to suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, which is elevated in skeletal muscle biopsies from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) patients and sedentary aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lemire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williamson et al., 2003</xref>). Although it is unclear which resident cell(s) within COPD or aged biopsies possessed the heightened ERK activity, it would be of interest to determine sarcopenia outcomes upon myofiber-specific Spry1 overexpression. Regardless, in addition to maintaining skeletal muscle regenerative potential, Spry1 manipulation provides a viable approach for counteracting sarcopenia-related NMJ deterioration and aged muscle function decline. Collectively, our observations, obtained through multiple lines of query, demonstrate that loss of myofiber regenerative potential endowed in SCs is a significant mediator of age-related NMJ degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type C57BL/6J mice were obtained from National Institute on Aging; <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (017763), <italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> (007576), <italic>Rosa26<sup>nTnG</sup></italic> (023035) and <italic>Rosa26<sup>DTA</sup></italic> (009669) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine); mice carrying a transgene encoding a Cre-inducible expression construct for <italic>Spry1</italic> controlled by a chicken β-actin gene (CAG) promoter were used for Spry1-overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic>, <italic>Rosa26 <sup>nTnG</sup></italic>, <italic>Rosa26<sup>DTA</sup></italic> and <italic>CAG<sup>Spry1</sup></italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice to generate <italic>Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>; Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> (P7mTmG), <italic>Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>; Rosa26<sup>nTnG/+</sup></italic> (P7nTnG), <italic>Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>; Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic> (P7DTA), <italic>Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>; CAG<sup>Spry1/+</sup></italic> (Spry1OX) mice and control CreER negative (Ctrl) littermates.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Amy J Wagers (Reviewer #3), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gregorio Valdez (Reviewer #1) and Colin Crist (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In a previous study published in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2015, this group used elegant genetic tools to inducibly label or deplete muscle stem cells (MuSCs). By doing so, they showed that MuSC depletion leads to an increase in muscle atrophy, fibre type transitions and fibrosis, with a corresponding decrease in the generation of muscle force. Furthermore, MuSC depletion followed by denervation resulted in decreased reinnervation, decreased myonuclei at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and poor post-synaptic morphology. MuSC labeling experiments demonstrated that MuSCs contribute directly to NMJs. This Research Advance submission builds on this previous work using similar genetic strategies to investigate satellite cell incorporation into myofibers as a function of age and its effect on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) integrity. The authors report reduced integrity of NMJs with advancing age and use an mT/mG fluorescence tracing system (described in their earlier <italic>eLife</italic> publication) to correlate the presence of these degenerated junctions with reduced incorporation of satellite cells in the region of the NMJ. Finally, they show using a diphtheria toxin ablation system to deplete muscle satellite cells endogenously that loss of satellite cells causes precocious loss of NMJ integrity and that overexpression of Spry1 using a Pax7CreER driven induction system protects from age-associated NMJ degeneration and promotes maintenance of muscle mass and strength. Altogether, the work provides a number of novel and important observations relevant for understanding the detrimental effects of aging on skeletal muscle and physical performance and highlights a previously unappreciated role for satellite cells in these effects. There are, however, a few remaining questions about some of the authors' conclusions that need to be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript lacks data showing directly that postsynaptic myonuclei originate from muscle stem cells. The most relevant data for this idea is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; however, it is impossible to conclude that postsynaptic nuclei emanate from satellite cells based on these data alone. The presence of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) only proves that satellite cells are present throughout a given muscle fiber, including proximal to the postsynaptic region. Additional approaches (e.g. generation of mice with nuclear rather than membrane GFP, or tagging of satellite cells with a nuclear marker ex vivo and injection into the synaptic region to see where their nuclei end up in already formed muscle fibers) would be needed to prove that a postsynaptic myonuclei emanate from satellite cells and thus are lost following depletion of this cell population. If such data are available, they should be added to the manuscript. If not, then the authors should soften their conclusion as stated in the Discussion – &quot;Specifically, SCs are a source of post-synaptic myonuclei&quot; of matured muscle fibers, as there is simply no data directly showing this.</p><p>2) The authors state that little denervation (&quot;no gross denervation&quot;) occurs in aged animals. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the majority of NMJs are either completely or partially denervated, and this data is represented as partially missing nerve (Inn). These findings appear to support published data showing that most aged NMJs are partially denervated and a smaller population completely denervated. While the authors argue that their supplemental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) that the transcriptional program of myonuclei in aged muscle differs from that seen at a single time point after sciatic nerve transection further supports a lack of denervation in aged muscle, it is unclear how this time point was chosen and what sort of overlap one might expect that could have led to the opposite conclusion, given that the sciatic nerve transection model is obviously a much more severe, and also very different, surgical model. Thus, the conclusion that there is limited denervation in aged muscle is not particularly compelling, and the authors are advised to change the &quot;Inn&quot; label in this <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to partially innervated (PI) or partially denervated (PD).</p><p>3) Since the loss of myonuclei is proposed to cause aging of NMJs, it is important to show that myonuclei disappear prior to aging of NMJs. However, there is no data supporting that this sequence of events occurs during aging. Instead, it is shown that a similar number of nuclei are present at NMJs of 12 compared to 6 months of age, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Since perisynaptic Schwann cells are also affected by aging, it is important to determine their contribution to NMJ-associated nuclei in young and old muscles. Answer to these questions would better establish the relationship between aging of NMJs and loss of myonuclei specifically derived from stem cells.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> suggests reduced incorporation of new satellite cells overall (reduced total number of mGFP+ fibers) with aging. This is a bit counterintuitive, however, given the increased frequency of centrally nucleated fibers normally detected in aged muscle (e.g., Valdez et al. 2010). Can the authors explain/ comment on this?</p><p>5) It is plausible that NMJ-associated myonuclei dissociate from the postsynaptic region in atrophying muscle fibers. This possibility should be explored or discussed.</p><p>6) Incorporation of satellite cells into myofibers in the Spry1OX system will lead to Spry1 overexpression in differentiated fibers as well. Thus, some of the effects the authors see with respect to protection from age-related NMJ dysfunction in this system may relate to Spry1 functions in fibers. It is therefore important to evaluate the level of transgene expression in muscle fibers over time, and ideally this issue should be addressed experimentally by analysis of an overexpression system in which fiber-specific Spry1 overexpression is induced, or possibly by transplantation of WT satellite cells not their existing Spry1OX system (though this may be technically challenging). This issue is particularly relevant as Spry1 has been reported as a negative regulator of ERK signaling and ERK activation has been associated with muscle atrophy in certain settings (e.g., Lemire et al., 2012). Thus, it is possible that introduction of Spry1 into myofibers via satellite cell fusion in the Spry1OX system protects them from subsequent age-related atrophy. If the authors are unable to provide direct experimental evidence addressing this point, they must then provide an explicit discussion of this possibility and revise their conclusions accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26464.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The manuscript lacks data showing directly that postsynaptic myonuclei originate from muscle stem cells.

At 4.5 months P7nTnG mice were injected with tamoxifen and EDL single myofibers were collected immediately or 6 weeks thereafter. Immediately after tamoxifen administration only Pax7+ SCs were nGFP labeled. Through analysis of NMJs 6 weeks after tamoxifen administration nGFP+ post-synaptic myonuclei were observed. These results are included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and accompanying text included in the Methods (subsection “Animals”) and Results (subsection “SCs contribute to adult and middle-aged, but not aged NMJs”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) The authors state that little denervation (&quot; no gross denervation&quot;) occurs in aged animals.

We agree sciatic nerve injuries are more severe than age-related muscle decline; however, such models have been used to study muscle aging (Xu et al., J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle, 2017). The denervation/reinnervation regimen for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> was chosen based on the Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015 study where it was demonstrated that such a model does lead to full or partial innervation with degenerated NMJ morphology akin to what is observed in aged muscle. The overlap between our denervation/reinnervation regimen and aging is the persistence of degenerated NMJ morphology. We have included statements for the above where <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> is reported (subsection “Complete denervation is not a prominent feature of aged skeletal muscles”).</p><p><italic>3) Since the loss of myonuclei is proposed to cause aging of NMJs, it is important to show that myonuclei disappear prior to aging of NMJs. However, there is no data supporting that this sequence of events occurs during aging. Instead, it is shown that a similar number of nuclei are present at NMJs of 12 compared to 6 months of age, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Since perisynaptic Schwann cells are also affected by aging, it is important to determine their contribution to NMJ-associated nuclei in young and old muscles. Answer to these questions would better establish the relationship between aging of NMJs and loss of myonuclei specifically derived from stem cells.</italic> </p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are conducted with ANOVA. As requested to compare 6 and 12 month-old Ctrl NMJs we have conducted pair-wise t-test. Pair-wise comparison demonstrates that at 12 months there is a significant increase in the proportion of NMJs with 0-2 post-synaptic myonuclei, or post-synaptic degenerated NMJs. In contrast we there was no significant difference in pre-synaptic degenerated (i.e. partially innervated) NMJs at 12 compared to 6 months. We have now included these results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>It is well established that Schwann cells are on the nerve terminal side and as far as we know do not contribute to post-synaptic myonuclei or have myogenic potential (subsection “Complete denervation is not a prominent feature of aged skeletal muscles”, last paragraph). Conversely, we have not observed GFP labeled pre-synaptic nuclei in P7mTmG or P7nTnG mice during aging (this study) or denervation/reinnervation muscle atrophy (Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015). Since satellite cells are the principal source of myonuclei during repair or regeneration we focused on post-synaptic myonuclear number.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> suggests reduced incorporation of new satellite cells overall (reduced total number of mGFP+ fibers) with aging. This is a bit counterintuitive, however, given the increased frequency of centrally nucleated fibers normally detected in aged muscle (e.g., Valdez et al. 2010). Can the authors explain/ comment on this?</italic> </p><p>As requested we have commented on satellite cell derived contribution in relation to central nucleation, see the last paragraph of the Discussion. Central nucleation is often used as an indicator of a myofiber that has at some point undergone a major bout of degeneration and regeneration. Therefore, Figure 6 of the Valdez et al. 2010 study would indicate that at some point between 5 and 23-24 months a small fraction of myofibers underwent a severe bout of degeneration and regeneration, the cause and timing of which is unknown. Regardless, SC derived progenitor fusion into myofibers has been observed without appreciable central nucleation, see Keefe et al., Nat Comm, 2015; Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015; Pawlikowski et al., Skeletal Muscle, 2015.</p><p><italic>5) It is plausible that NMJ-associated myonuclei dissociate from the postsynaptic region in atrophying muscle fibers. This possibility should be explored or discussed.</italic> </p><p>We agree it is possible that post-synaptic myonuclei may have been displaced with age (Bruusgaard et al., J Appl Physiol, 2006), however given the overall declines in myonuclei number starting at 12 months (Brack et al., J Cell Sci, 2005) it is likely that both loss and displacement contribute. As suggested, we have included a discussion of the above (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) Incorporation of satellite cells into myofibers in the Spry1OX system will lead to Spry1 overexpression in differentiated fibers as well. Thus, some of the effects the authors see with respect to protection from age-related NMJ dysfunction in this system may relate to Spry1 functions in fibers. It is therefore important to evaluate the level of transgene expression in muscle fibers over time, and ideally this issue should be addressed experimentally by analysis of an overexpression system in which fiber-specific Spry1 overexpression is induced, or possibly by transplantation of WT satellite cells not their existing Spry1OX system (though this may be technically challenging). This issue is particularly relevant as Spry1 has been reported as a negative regulator of ERK signaling and ERK activation has been associated with muscle atrophy in certain settings (e.g., Lemire et al., 2012). Thus, it is possible that introduction of Spry1 into myofibers via satellite cell fusion in the Spry1OX system protects them from subsequent age-related atrophy. If the authors are unable to provide direct experimental evidence addressing this point, they must then provide an explicit discussion of this possibility and revise their conclusions accordingly.</italic> </p><p>Similar to the Lemire et al. study in muscles of chronic obstructive pulmonary patients, elevated p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and <italic>JNK</italic> have been reported in sedentary aged muscles (Williamson et al., J Physiol, 2003). In either study it is not clear which cell(s) (i.e. myofibers, SCs, interstitial cells, blood vessels, etc.) contained the elevated activities. Unfortunately, we do not have the myofiber specific Spry1OX system. Accordingly, we have provided more discussion to include the possibility of SC-derived Spry1OX myofiber activity as an alternative (subsection “Animals”). In addition, we have also modified our statements and conclusions to account for this possibility (Results subsection “Aged NMJ and skeletal muscle integrity is improved upon Spry1 overexpression in SCs”, Discussion, second paragraph, subsection “Animals” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend title).</p></body></sub-article></article>
