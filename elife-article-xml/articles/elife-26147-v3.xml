CIM0216. Here, we show that activation of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins inhibits TRPM3 channels. This inhibition was alleviated by co-expression of proteins that bind the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Gβγ). Co-expression of Gβγ, but not constitutively active Gαi or Gαo, inhibited TRPM3 currents. TRPM3 co-immunoprecipitated with Gβ, and purified Gβγ proteins applied to excised inside-out patches inhibited TRPM3 currents, indicating a direct effect. Baclofen and somatostatin, agonists of Gi-coupled receptors, inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals induced by PregS and CIM0216 in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen also inhibited inward currents induced by CIM0216 in DRG neurons, and nocifensive responses elicited by this TRPM3 agonist in mice. Our data uncover a novel signaling mechanism regulating TRPM3 channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26147.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26147.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TRPM3</kwd><kwd>G-protein</kwd><kwd>sensory ion channel</kwd><kwd>DRG neuron</kwd><kwd>TRPA1</kwd><kwd>TRPM8</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mirshahi</surname><given-names>Tooraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM093290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS055159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological experiments, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and behavioral studies in mice identify the TRPM3 ion channel as a novel target of G-protein βγ subunits.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channels are activated by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), and a number of chemical ligands such as pregnenolone sulphate (PregS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oberwinkler and Philipp, 2014</xref>) and the newly described synthetic agonist CIM0216 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Held et al., 2015</xref>). These channels were shown to act as heat sensors in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons; mice lacking TRPM3 had altered behavioral responses to noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). TRPM3 is also expressed in a variety of other tissues, including the brain, kidneys and pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oberwinkler and Philipp, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins were originally thought to be scaffolds for the Gα subunits, keeping them inactive in non-stimulated cells. Seminal work on cardiac G-protein activated K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels demonstrated important direct physiological roles for Gβγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Logothetis et al., 1987</xref>). All GIRK channels (Kir3.1–3.4) are activated by cell surface receptors that couple to heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins, via direct binding of Gβγ to the channel. This effect plays roles in slowing the heart rate by muscarinic stimulation, and in the analgesic effects of opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We and others have shown recently that in various cellular expression systems PregS-induced TRPM3 activity requires the presence of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>), which is a common feature of most TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohacs, 2014</xref>). Stimulation of plasma membrane receptors that induce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis via phospholipase C (PLC) activation, was shown to inhibit both heterologously expressed TRPM3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>) and endogenous TRPM3 in insulinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>). The purified TRPM3 protein in planar lipid bilayers also required PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for activity induced by PregS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>). Other activators of the channel, nifedipine, or the combination of PregS plus clotrimazole, however, could induce activity in bilayers in the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, showing that the requirement for this lipid may be modality dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that dialysis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> via the patch pipette did not alleviate inhibition of PregS-induced TRPM3 currents by Gq-coupled receptors, but co-expression of a protein that binds Gβγ, thus acts as a ‘Gβγ sink’, significantly attenuated it. TRPM3 currents were also robustly inhibited by activation of various Gi-coupled receptors, and that effect was also attenuated by Gβγ sinks. Coexpression of Gβγ, but not Gαi or Gαo, in intact cells inhibited TRPM3 currents. TRPM3 co-immunoprecipitated with Gβ, and application of purified Gβγ to excised inside-out patches inhibited the channel, indicating a direct effect. PregS-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in DRG neurons were inhibited by stimulating Gi-coupled receptors with somatostatin or by the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen. Baclofen also inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and currents evoked by CIM0216, as well as nocifensive behavioral responses induced by this TRPM3 agonist in vivo. Our data identify TRPM3 as a novel ion channel target of Gβγ subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of TRPM3 by Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors via Gβγ</title><p>It was recently shown by two different laboratories that TRPM3 channels require PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for activity, and that depletion of phosphoinositides using various inducible phosphatases inhibited PregS-induced TRPM3 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we also found that stimulating M1 muscarinic receptors that couple to PLC inhibited TRPM3; interestingly, this inhibition was faster and more robust than inhibition by the inducible phosphoinositide phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To assess the involvement of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion in PLC mediated inhibition, here we performed whole-cell patch clamp measurements in HEK293 cells cotransfected with the Gq-coupled M1 muscarinic receptors and TRPM3. We supplemented the patch pipette with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and compared carbachol-induced inhibition to control cells without the lipid in the patch pipette. We used this maneuver earlier to alleviate inhibition of the activity of several different ion channels by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lukacs et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a whole-cell patch clamp measurement, using a ramp protocol from −100 to 100 mV; current values at −100 and +100 mV are plotted.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate PLCβ isoforms via heterotrimeric G-proteins in the Gq/11 family. To test the possible involvement of G-protein subunits, we co-expressed the C-terminal domain of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK-CT), which binds Gβγ subunits and has been used earlier to ‘sink’ Gβγ and thus alleviate effects mediated by this subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamauchi et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref> shows that co-expressing the βARK-CT construct significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of M1 receptor activation by 5 μM Acetylcholine (ACh).</p><p>Gβγ subunits are not specific to Gq-coupled receptors, indeed most Gβγ-mediated biological effects, such as GIRK channel activation, are initiated by activation of receptors that act via the Gi/o family. Thus, we co-expressed TRPM3 and the Gi-coupled M2 muscarinic receptors in HEK293 cells, and tested the effect of activating those receptors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows that ACh quickly and completely inhibited PregS-induced TRPM3 currents in cells expressing M2 receptors. Next, we tested if Gi-mediated inhibition involves Gβγ. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref> shows that co-expression of βARK-CT significantly attenuated ACh-mediated inhibition. The inhibitory effect of ACh was also alleviated by a different Gβγ sink, the inactivated G203A mutant of the Gαi3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ogier-Denis et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested if overexpressed Gi-coupled M2 receptors induce any detectable PLC activation. We transfected HEK293 with M1, or M2 receptors, and a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> sensors, the CFP- and YFP-tagged tubby domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quinn et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that application of carbachol induced a significant decrease in FRET in cells transfected with M1 receptors, indicating a decrease in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, whereas in cells transfected with M2 receptors, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels did not change. These data show that overexpressed M2 receptors do not signal to PLC and that endogenous Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors in HEK cells do not express at sufficiently high levels to induce a significant decrease in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. These results show that PLC activation is not necessary for inhibition of TRPM3 upon GPCR activation.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of muscarinic M1 or M2 receptor activation on TRPM3 did not depend on the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as ACh and carbachol inhibited PregS-induced TRPM3 currents in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). TRPM3 channels have an alternative permeation pathway that is open when clotrimazole and PregS are co-applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>). This alternative pathway displays lower level of inward rectification, and thus higher current levels at negative voltages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> shows that currents induced by clotrimazole/PregS were also fully inhibited by ACh. We also tested if activation of the Gi-coupled D2 Dopamine receptors inhibited TRPM3 currents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref> shows that application of quinpirole to cells expressing D2 and TRPM3 resulted in complete inhibition of TRPM3 currents induced by either PregS, or the combination of PregS and clotrimazole. Overall, these data show that activation of the Gi-coupled M2 muscarinic, or D2 dopamine receptors inhibit TRPM3 currents under a variety of experimental conditions and channel activation modalities.</p><p>Our data so far suggest that G-protein βγ subunits play an important role in TRPM3 current inhibition upon M1 muscarinic receptor activation. We found no clear evidence for the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis, potentially due to the masking effect of the robust inhibition by Gβγ. To test the effect of PLC activation on TRPM3 currents without the release of Gβγ subunits, we co-expressed TRPM3 with the receptor tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β receptor (PDGFRβ), which couples to PLCγ. As a negative control, we co-expressed TRPM3 with the Y1009F-Y1021F mutant of PDGFRβ that does not activate PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ridefelt and Siegbahn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rohács et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows that PDGF inhibited PregS-induced currents in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing TRPM3 and PDGFRβ, but not in cells expressing the Y1009F Y1021F mutant. These data show that in principle, PLC activation is sufficient to inhibit TRPM3 activity in the absence of G-protein activation. For the rest of this study, we focus on Gi-coupled receptor activation to avoid confounding effects of PLC activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inhibition of TRPM3 by Gβγ but not Gαi or Gαo subunits</title><p>Our data so far indicate the involvement of Gβγ subunits in inhibiting TRPM3 channels.

To maximize our chances to obtain TRPM3 currents, we selectively patched small GFP positive neurons, most of which responded to PregS in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments. Average capacitance in the control group was 7.55 pF, and in the baclofen-treated group, it was 8.63 pF; the majority of the selected cells (41 out of 43) responded to CIM0216. We focused on baclofen, as this agent induced inhibition in the highest proportion of neurons in our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments.

The effect was robust, and showed no receptor specificity; activation of every recombinant and native Gi/o-coupled receptor we tested inhibited TRPM3 activity. Activation of heterologously expressed Gq-coupled receptors also inhibited TRPM3 via Gβγ, but we focused on Gi-coupled receptors here to avoid confounding effects of concurrent PLC activation.</p><p>We found that in DRG neurons Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by TRPM3 agonists were inhibited in a subset of cells by activating Gi-coupled receptors with somatostatin, or the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen. The presence of non-responding cells for both agonists likely reflect cells not expressing the receptor, it is consistent with the high level of heterogeneity of DRG neurons, and also indicates that neither somatostatin nor baclofen is a direct inhibitor of TRPM3 channels. A much larger portion of DRG neurons responded to baclofen than to somatostatin, which correlates with the much higher expression level of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thakur et al., 2014</xref>). Baclofen also inhibited TRPM3 in a heterologous system co-expressing GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> receptors, in a Gβγ-dependent manner. Baclofen also inhibited current responses to the TRPM3 agonist CIM0216 in DRG neurons, and in vivo nocifensive behavioral responses evoked by this TRPM3 agonist. Gβγ likely inhibits TRPM3 via direct interactions, because application of purified Gβγ protein to excised inside-out patches inhibited TRPM3, and we could detect biochemical interaction between the two proteins.</p><p>Gi-coupled receptors have two well-established ion channel targets, GIRK channels and N-type VGCC, both expressed in DRG neurons. Did the effect on those channels contribute to the effects of baclofen in behavioral experiments? While GIRK1 (KCNJ3) and GIRK2 (KCNJ6) channels expressed at relatively low levels in mouse DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thakur et al., 2014</xref>), we did not detect any outward currents in our patch clamp experiments in DRG neurons upon the application of baclofen. This may indicate that GIRK channels are not expressed at substantial levels in the same neurons as TRPM3, which is consistent with the finding that RNA for GIRK2 channels is enriched in the tyrosine hydroxylase expressing subpopulation of DRG neuron, which do not express TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Baclofen was also shown to inhibit both high- and low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in rat DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), but the effects were relatively modest, 32% and 22% inhibition, respectively. Interestingly, we did not detect any inhibition of high-potassium-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in DRG neurons by baclofen, in sharp contrast to the robust inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by TRPM3 agonists. Among VGCCs, the N-type channels are classical targets of Gi-signaling; those channels are expressed in the central termini, and play role in transmitter release. We administered baclofen peripherally, thus it is unlikely that the behavioral effect of baclofen was due to inhibition of VGCC. We conclude that baclofen activates GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in the peripheral processes and inhibits TRPM3 activity, and this inhibition is most likely responsible for the behavioral effect of baclofen.</p><p>Baclofen evoked a robust inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals induced by the TRPM3 agonists PregS and CIM0216. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by the TRPM8 agonist WS12 (1 μM) and the TRPA1 agonist AITC (25 μM) were not inhibited by baclofen. While AITC was also shown to activate TRPV1 channels at higher concentrations (&gt;100 μM), at 25 μM this compound does not activate TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Everaerts et al., 2011</xref>). Nocifensive responses to hind paw injection of AITC were also not significantly affected by co-injection of baclofen. Similarly, activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors by baclofen had no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, inward currents and nocifensive responses evoked by the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hanack et al., 2015</xref>). These data together show that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation by baclofen, under basal conditions, specifically affects TRPM3 among thermosensitive ion channels in DRG neuron. Baclofen on the other hand was shown to inhibit inflammatory sensitization of TRPV1, as well as TRPV1-mediated thermal hyperalgesia during inflammation, in a non-G-protein-mediated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hanack et al., 2015</xref>). Exploring the potential effect of baclofen on TRPM3 and other sensory ion channels in inflammatory conditions will require further research.</p><p>GIRK channels are activated by Gi/o-coupled receptors via direct binding of Gβγ subunits to the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Logothetis et al., 1987</xref>). Gq- or Gs-coupled receptors on the other hand do not activate GIRK channels in native cells or in expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobrinsky et al., 2000</xref>), despite the general assumption that their activation also liberates Gβγ. The mechanism of this selectivity between different G-protein pathways has been a subject for intensive research for more than two decades. The prevailing view by now is that GIRK channels form macromolecular complexes with Gi heterotrimers, and Gβγ rather than fully dissociating from Gαi, remains in the complex and activates the channel via a ‘local conformational switch’ and a surface masked by Gαi in the non-stimulated state, interacts with the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bünemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riven et al., 2006</xref>). We find that TRPM3 inhibition does not show the G-protein isoform specificity characteristic of GIRK channels, as TRPM3 activity was inhibited by not only Gi-coupled receptors, but also by Gq-coupled receptors, at least in expression systems, and Gβγ sinks alleviated the inhibition by both groups of agonists. In this work, we focused on inhibition by the Gi/o pathway, and show that several endogenous Gi-coupled receptors in DRG neurons inhibit native TRPM3 currents. Exploring the effects of Gq-coupled receptor activation in native systems will require further studies.</p><p>An additional difference from GIRK channel activation is the following: GIRK channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes display basal currents, which are due to free Gβγ, and those basal GIRK currents are inhibited by co-expressing Gαi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 1999</xref>). In our hands PregS-induced TRPM3 currents were neither inhibited nor potentiated by the co-expression of Gαi3. GIRK channels are potentiated by Gβ1, β2, β3, and β4, but not by β5 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mirshahi et al., 2002</xref>); in our hands, TRPM3 was inhibited by Gβ1 but not by Gβ5. Overall, our data indicate that Gβγ inhibition of TRPM3 proceeds via a mechanism different from GIRK channel activation, but the two also share some common characteristics.</p><p>The closest relative of TRPM3 is TRPM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapham, 2003</xref>), which is expressed in retinal ON-bipolar cells, and its mutations in humans cause congenital stationary night blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Irie and Furukawa, 2014</xref>). In the dark, TRPM1 is kept closed by mGlur6 metabotropic glutamate receptors, which couple to heterotrimeric Go proteins. Upon light exposure decreasing glutamate levels lead to opening of TRPM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Irie and Furukawa, 2014</xref>). Both the Gαo and Gβγ subunits have been implied in inhibition of TRPM1, but their respective roles are controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koike et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). These controversies could be due to the fact that TRPM1 channels cannot be expressed reliably in heterologous systems, and native TRPM1 currents are small and difficult to differentiate from other endogenous channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lambert et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>TRPM3 channels require PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for activity, and inducible phosphatases that reduce the levels of this lipid inhibited TRPM3 activity, but this inhibition was partial and developed relatively slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>). We found that Gq-coupled receptor-mediated inhibition was not significantly alleviated by supplementing the whole-cell patch pipette with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, even though activation of the receptor decreased PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. The Gβγ ‘sink’ βARK-CT on the other hand clearly attenuated the inhibitory effect of Gq-coupled receptor activation. While this result may sound puzzling, it indicates that upon GPCR activation Gβγ dominates over the reduction of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in inhibiting TRPM3 activity. Additionally, it is also possible that PI(4)P, which decreases much less upon GPCR-mediated PLC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>) may provide sufficient support to channel activity such that the additional PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> provided in the patch pipette will have no influence on channel activity. We found that activation of PDGFR, but not its PLC defective mutant, inhibited TRPM3 activity, indicating that, in principle, PLC activation alone may inhibit TRPM3 in conditions where Gβγ subunits are not released.</p><p>The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen inhibited TRPM3 activity in the vast majority of neurons we tested, and also inhibited behavioral nocifensive responses to a TRPM3 agonist. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are highly expressed in DRG neurons, and their activation has been shown to inhibit sensitization, but not basal activity of the heat and capsaicin sensitive TRPV1 channels in a non-G-protein mediated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hanack et al., 2015</xref>). Various α-conotoxins such as Vc1.1, RgIA and PeIA were shown to inhibit N-type VGCC via a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation in rat DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2012</xref>). Baclofen is often used as an adjuvant therapy in lower back pain; its effect is attributed to its central muscle relaxant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dapas et al., 1985</xref>). The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists baclofen however has significant side effects such as drowsiness, mental confusion, muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowery, 2006</xref>), and even paralysis and coma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caron et al., 2014</xref>), which is not surprising, given the abundance of these receptors in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padgett and Slesinger, 2010</xref>). Accumulating data showing that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors inhibit activation or sensitization of nociceptive ion channels in DRG neurons raise the possibility of targeting this pathway for pain relief in the periphery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole-cell electrophysiology in HEK cells</title><p>Whole-cell patch clamp measurements were performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>).

Myc-tagged-TRPM3 and Flag-tagged-Kir3.1 channels were immunoprecipitated by incubating pre-cleared cell lysates with primary anti-Myc (Cell Signaling, 2276S) or anti-Flag (Sigma, F3156) antibodies, respectively. The immune-complex was incubated with pre-washed protein G agarose beads overnight at 4°C with gentle-rocking. Immunoprecipitates were then used for Western blotting. After three washes, precipitates were eluted from the beads by incubating at 37°C for one hour in Biorad XT loading buffer and XT reducing agent. Protein samples were run on 4–12% Bis-Tris Criterion gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked at room temperature in TBS-T with 5% milk for 1 hr and then probed overnight at 4°C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gβ antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mirshahi et al., 2002</xref>), recognizing Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3 Gβ4 (T-20, SC-378, Santa Cruz) diluted 1:500 in TBS-T with 5% milk. Secondary antibody used was donkey-anti-rabbit HRP (Thermo-Fisher, A16035) 1:5000 in 5% Milk. All blots were processed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged with a Fuji Imager.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DRG neuron isolation and culture</title><p>Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. DRG neurons were isolated using the protocol based on Malin et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malin et al., 2007</xref>), with slight modifications as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lukacs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yudin et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, DRG neurons were isolated from adult mice of either sex (2–4 months old) from the TRPM8-GFP mouse line in C57/Blk background, expressing GFP driven by the promoter of TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takashima et al., 2007</xref>), see results for rationale. Mice were kept in a barrier facility under a 12/12 hr light dark cycle, with the light cycle starting at 7AM, a maximum of 4 mice were kept in the same cage, they were not subjected to any procedure, or drug administration before the experiments. Animals were anesthetized and perfused via the left ventricle with ice-cold Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) followed by decapitation. DRGs were collected from all spinal segments after laminectomy and maintained in ice-cold HBSS during the isolation. After isolation and trimming of dorsal and ventral roots, ganglia were incubated in an HBSS-based enzyme solution containing 2 mg/ml type I collagenase (Worthington) and 5 mg/ml Dispase (Sigma) at 37°C for 25–30 min, followed by repetitive trituration for dissociation. After centrifugation at 80 × g for 10 min, cells were resuspended and plated on round coverslips pre-coated with poly-l-lysine (Invitrogen) and laminin (Sigma), allowed to adhere for 1 hr and maintained in culture in in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS for 12–36 hr before measurements (Thermo Scientific), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were kept in a tissue-culture incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophysiology on DRG neurons</title><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings on DRG neurons were performed similar to that on HEK cells; we used small GFP-expressing neurons, and the external solution temperature was adjusted to 28–29°C. Neurons were perfused with a nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup> free bath solution containing 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Intracellular solutions contained 140 mM K-Gluconate, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.25 with KOH. In all experiments, cells that had a passive leak current more than 100 pA were discarded. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed at a holding potential of −60 mV and inward currents were evoked by 5 μM CIM0216.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavioral test</title><p>One day before experiments, animals (2–4 months old) were transferred to the experimental room for acclimatization, separated in individual cages and provided food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Experiments were performed during the day (light cycle). Stock solutions of CIM0216 (100 mM) alone or in mixture with Baclofen (25 mM) were diluted 20x in a sterile vehicle solution of 10% PEG-200 (Sigma-Aldrich), 2% Tween-80 (Amresco) in 0.9% NaCl. Hind paw subcutaneous dorsal injection of 10 μL was performed using a 30G needle coupled to a Hamilton syringe, and duration and numbers of nocifensive behavior (licking and lifting of injected paw) were recorded for a period of 10 min by an observer blind to the tested substances. Every animal was subject to random order injections of CIM0216 or its mixture with Baclofen in one paw followed 7 days later by the other reagent in opposite paw. A similar procedure was used for AITC and baclofen. We used both male and female animals and the data were pooled, as there was no significant difference between the two sexes. The final injected dose was 50 nmol/paw for CIM, 100 nmol/paw for AITC and 12.5 nmol/paw for Baclofen. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the requirements of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data analysis was performed in Excel and Microcal Origin. Data collection was randomized. Behavioral experiments were blinded. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed by the field. The normality of the data was verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data were analyzed with t-test, or Analysis of variance *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.005. Data are plotted as mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) and scatter plots for most experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Voets (Reviewer #1); László Csanády (Reviewer #2); Alexander Chesler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is one of three that reports exciting new findings on the mechanism of inhibition of TRPM3 channel activity in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although all three manuscripts received favorable reviews, the essential revisions will require different amounts of time to address, and we encourage the authors to coordinate submission of their revised manuscripts.</p><p>This is an exciting study reporting that inhibition of TRPM3 ion channels by Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins through a direct protein-protein interaction, and investigating the relevance of this inhibition to heat and pain sensation. The conclusion is that G-beta1-gamma2 dissociating from either Gα-i/o or Gα-q subunits is capable of inhibiting TRPM3 channels by a mechanism that is independent of membrane phosphatidyl-inositol-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels. The study employs a combination of co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, FRET, and behavioral studies in heterologous expression systems, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and live animals. Strengths of the study are the logical buildup of hypotheses, the rigorous testing of each hypothesis by extensive experiments aimed at verifying possible alternatives, and the design of appropriate control experiments (e.g., ruling out involvement of PIP2 or Gα subunits in the studied phenomenon). Overall, this is an exciting and thorough study that is very appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is missing in this manuscript is an indication of the selectivity of the receptor activation towards TRPM3-dependent pain signals. To correlate the reduced pain response in the presence of baclofen to the inhibition of TRPM3 function, it is essential to show that other TRPM3-independent pain responses are not affected. This would involve demonstration that neuronal calcium signals and pain evoked by e.g. capsaicin or mechanical stimuli are not affected by baclofen.</p><p>2) To fully evaluate the quality and robustness of calcium imaging data it is helpful to have representative images as well as traces. This would allow the reader to appreciate the density and health of the cells and neurons as well as the robustness of the responses. Also, glia vs neurons in the culture should not be highlighted. Absence of KCl response is a poor proxy for glial identification – if this is the only criterion, then calling those cells KCl<sup>-</sup>negative cells is more appropriate.</p><p>3) In general, the scatter of data used to general bar graphs is unclear. These should be included on all summary plots throughout the manuscript to provide a better sense of the effect size and variability.</p><p>4) The description of the DRG imaging results in the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is a bit confusing. It would be helpful to have these data plotted (e.g. as stacked bar or pie charts) so that the reader can more readily grasp what the total number of PS responsive sensory neurons is and what percentages are inhibited by the various GPCR agonists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26147.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) What is missing in this manuscript is an indication of the selectivity of the receptor activation towards TRPM3-dependent pain signals.

This would involve demonstration that neuronal calcium signals and pain evoked by e.g. capsaicin or mechanical stimuli are not affected by baclofen.</italic> </p><p>The effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation by baclofen on TRPV1 channels in DRG neurons have been extensively characterized by Hanack et al., 2015. They demonstrated that in the basal, non-sensitized state, capsaicin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (Figure S3B) and inward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) were not affected by baclofen treatment in DRG neurons, and behavioral responses in mice (FigS6H) were also not affected by local injection of baclofen. Figures refer to Hanack et al. We cite these aspects of that paper in detail now in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To test additional pain modalities, we also show in the revised version that amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothyocyanate (AITC, or mustard oil) (25 µM) were not reduced by baclofen in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Baclofen also did not have a significant effect on nocifensive responses evoked by hind paw injection of AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).</p><p>We did not test mechanical responses, as it is difficult to evoke mechanically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals reliably in DRG neurons. Also, besides Piezo2, which is responsible for the rapidly adapting mechanically induced currents, the molecular identity of other mechanically activated currents, especially those responsible for mechanical nociception, is not yet established.</p><p><italic>2) To fully evaluate the quality and robustness of calcium imaging data it is helpful to have representative images as well as traces.

We note this in the revised version, and call them KCl non-responsive, or non-neuronal cells.</p><p> <italic>3) In general, the scatter of data used to general bar graphs is unclear.
