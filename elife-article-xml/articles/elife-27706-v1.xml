pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27706.001</object-id><p>The expression of the transcription factor <italic>SOX4</italic> is increased in many human cancers, however, the pro-oncogenic capacity of SOX4 can vary greatly depending on the type of tumor. Both the contextual nature and the mechanisms underlying the pro-oncogenic SOX4 response remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that in mammary tumorigenesis, the SOX4 transcriptional network is dictated by the epigenome and is enriched for pro-angiogenic processes. We show that SOX4 directly regulates endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression and can thereby promote tumor-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in breast tumors, SOX4 expression correlates with blood vessel density and size, and predicts poor-prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Our data provide novel mechanistic insights into context-dependent SOX4 target gene selection, and uncover a novel pro-oncogenic role for this transcription factor in promoting tumor-induced angiogenesis. These findings establish a key role for SOX4 in promoting metastasis through exploiting diverse pro-tumorigenic pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group

control of gene expression networks is crucial during embryonic development and thereafter for tissue homeostasis. Consequently, dysregulation of transcription factor function has been observed to result in a wide-variety of developmental defects and is often responsible for the pathogenesis of disease. A restricted subset of transcription factors is often expressed in human cancers, aberrantly re-activating developmental pathways which then contribute to tumor-progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darnell, 2002</xref>).</p><p>SOX4 is a prominent cancer-associated transcription factor and its mRNA expression is elevated in a large number of human cancers, being part of a general human cancer-associated gene expression signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>). It is a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors that have important roles in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, for example by controlling differentiation and maintaining adult tissue stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lourenço and Coffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>). Sox4-deficient mice die during embryogenesis due to defective cardio-vasculature development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schilham et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, SOX4 controls the development of specific tissues, including lymphoid, pancreatic, brain and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>). In contrast to its wide-spread expression during embryogenesis, the expression of SOX4 in adult tissues is mostly restricted to adult stem- and progenitor cell populations including intestinal and hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p><italic>SOX4</italic> expression in human cancers has been positively correlated with tumor-progression in a wide-variety of solid and hematopoietic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lourenço and Coffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>).

A recurring theme is that SOX4 endows tumor cells with a more migratory and invasive phenotype. This has been shown using in vitro assays employing a large variety of different tumor types, such as breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 2008</xref>), ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yeh et al., 2013</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, SOX4 expression correlates with increased depth of invasion in clinical specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). For a limited number of tumor types, downstream targets of SOX4 have been identified that were important for invasion such as NRP1 and SEMA3C (hepatocellular carcinoma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 2008</xref>), TEAD2 and RBP1 (lung cancer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castillo et al., 2012</xref>) and EGFR, Tenascin C (prostate cancer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scharer et al., 2009</xref>).

Moreover, SOX4 has been shown to control the TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with increases in tumor-initiating cells, in invasive and migratory capacity, in metastasis and in drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tiwari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalluri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vervoort et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lourenço and Coffer, 2017</xref>).

The context-dependent nature of the SOX4 transcriptional response can in part be explained by cell-type-specific expression of cooperating transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson and Koopman, 2002</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated in murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) that, the cell-type-specific expression of KLF5 can redirect the SOX4-mediated TGF-β transcriptional network from a pro-apoptotic to a pro-tumorigenic response, thus preventing lethal EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2016</xref>). However, the wider relevance of this process in tumor progression remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Despite these observations, the transcriptional network and molecular mechanisms through which SOX4 contributes to the pathogenesis of breast cancer remain largely unknown. Moreover, SOX4 protein expression in both primary and metastatic tumor-tissue of patients with breast cancer has not been systematically studied. Here, by using an integrative genome-wide analysis approach, we provide novel insight into the mechanisms determining SOX4 target gene selection. We define a ‘core’ SOX4-transcriptional network in mammary epithelial cells that reveals an unexpected role of SOX4 in tumor-induced angiogenesis through direct regulation of Endothelin-1 (ET-1). Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate a novel pro-oncogenic function of SOX4 in mammary tumor development as a promoter of tumor-induced angiogenesis, and furthermore we show that SOX4-high breast tumors are highly vascularized, aggressive and therapy-resistant. These findings provide both a resource for understanding SOX4 function as well as defining a novel role for this transcription factor in regulating tumor-induced angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SOX4 is an epigenome-guided transcriptional activator</title><p>To better understand the functional role of SOX4 in tumorigenesis, it is imperative to understand how target gene specificity and activation are achieved.

To this end, we examined the genes associated with angiogenesis more closely, and 13 genes were found to be induced upon conditional SOX4 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We chose to further evaluate the role of Endothelin-1 (<italic>EDN1</italic>) since its expression has been demonstrated to positively correlate with breast cancer tumor-grade and distant metastasis, and has been suggested to promote tumor-induced angiogenesis, migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wülfing et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>EDN1</italic> encodes preproendothelin, which through intra-cellular cleavage by convertases and Endothelin Converting Enzyme-1 (ECE-1) is converted into a 21-amino acid mature form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosanò et al., 2013</xref>). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) directly induces angiogenesis by binding to its cognate receptors (ETAR and ETBR) expressed on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosanò et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>EDN1</italic> and its converting enzyme <italic>ECE-1</italic> were observed to be transcriptionally induced, indicating that SOX4 targets dual aspects of this pro-angiogenic pathway.</p><p>In line with our previous observations, analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles of <italic>EDN1</italic> locus indicated a strong increase in POL2 and H3K27ac upon DOX-mediated activation of SOX4 in HMLE-S4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and an increase in mRNA expression of <italic>EDN1</italic> upon conditional activation of SOX4 in ERSOX4 HMLE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Indeed upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of SOX4 in these two cell lines we also observed that <italic>EDN1</italic> expression was decreased (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B for MDA-MB-231 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> for HCC1954).</p><p>Closer examination of the <italic>EDN1</italic> promoter overlapping SOX4 and H3K27ac profiles identified two conserved SOX4 binding sites at 70 bp and 350 bp from the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To assess whether the SOX4 binding region (−961 bp - + 3 bp) upstream of the TSS is sufficient for transcriptional activation of EDN1 by this factor, luciferase assays were performed using a reporter construct containing the <italic>EDN1</italic> promoter region. Ectopic expression of SOX4 strongly induced luciferase expression as compared to the empty vector (EV) control, which could be inhibited by the co-transfection of a dominant negative truncated SOX4 lacking the transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Activation of the luciferase reporter was significantly inhibited when the SOX4 binding site at −350 bp was mutated, whereas no significant reduction was observed upon mutation of the −70 bp site, indicating that transcriptional activation of <italic>EDN1</italic> by SOX4 under these conditions is mediated by the site at −350 bp from the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To determine whether SOX4 can indeed directly bind these sites, pull-down assays were performed with biotinylated DNA-probes containing the identified <italic>EDN1</italic> promoter binding sites or a consensus SOX4 binding site (positive control) and mutated versions thereof. SOX4 was found to specifically bind to the conserved motifs at −350 bp from the <italic>EDN1</italic> TSS, which could be inhibited by mutation of this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether transcriptional induction of <italic>EDN1</italic> by SOX4 also results in increased production of the mature ET-1 peptide, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed. Conditional activation of SOX4 in HMLE resulted in a significant increase in ET-1 secretion by these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

The SOX4-activated conditioned media (SCM+) was subsequently tested for its ability to affect pro-angiogenic processes in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) in three distinct in vitro assays assessing cell migration, network formation, and sprouting. In parallel, we investigated the pro-angiogenic function of synthetic ET-1 in these systems to ascertain whether this could phenocopy any effects observed in SCM+.</p><p>The functional effects of SCM+ on HMEC-1 cells were first investigated in a wound-healing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Balkom et al., 2013</xref>).

In the presence of pro-angiogenic stimuli, HMEC-1 cells form angiogenic sprouts that penetrate the matrigel layer. In this assay both ET-1 and SCM+ treatment of HMEC-1 cells resulted in a marked increase in sprouting, although less pronounced than full medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–J</xref>).

SOX4 KD tumors had significantly lower vascularization as illustrated by the reduction in total blood vessel area, blood vessel count and blood vessel size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These findings demonstrate that SOX4 expression is required for tumor-associated ET-1 expression in vivo, and SOX4-depletion correlates with reduced tumor blood vessel density. Importantly, SOX4 depletion in this orthotopic xenograft model also significantly reduced the development of lung metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

These observations indicate that SOX4 expression is a clear marker of poor-prognosis in breast cancer and underscore the important role of SOX4 in tumor-progression and metastasis observed in breast cancer model systems. Interestingly, no significant benefit to patient survival was observed for adjuvant radio- or chemotherapy-treated SOX4-high tumors as compared to untreated tumors, whereas a significant treatment response was observed for SOX4-low tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that SOX4 may also contribute to therapy resistance.</p><p>To investigate whether SOX4 expression is also associated with increased angiogenesis in patients with human breast cancer, we examined CD34 expression (a marker for small and newly formed blood vessels) in 17 SOX4-low (SOX4<sup>LO</sup>) and 17 SOX4-high (SOX4<sup>HI</sup>) ductal carcinomas from our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Quantitative analysis of CD34-staining revealed that tumors expressing high levels of SOX4 had a significantly increased total blood vessel area and size, with an apparent but non-significant increase in the total number of blood vessels, thus suggesting that SOX4 can influence tumor-induced angiogenesis in human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p><p>Taken together our integrative genome-wide analysis of the SOX4 transcriptional network has uncovered a novel role for SOX4 in tumor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo as well as in breast tumors, revealing a novel mechanism by which SOX4 may contribute to breast cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments utilizing multiple epithelial-derived breast cell lines, <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models, and analysis of patient tumor samples, we show that SOX4-mediated transcriptional regulation can affect breast cancer progression by promoting tumor-induced angiogenesis. SOX4 activation promotes ET-1 expression and controls the angiogenic behavior of endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo, thus affecting tumor-progression in a non-cell autonomous manner. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated SOX4 expression correlates with increased blood vessel density in patient tumors and predicts poor-prognosis.</p><p>Despite observations of increased <italic>SOX4</italic> expression in a wide variety of tumors, effects can differ greatly between cancer-types resulting in cellular transformation, increased proliferation, EMT and metastasis, or even tumor-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>). The cell-type and context dependent effects underlying this differential SOX4 response are poorly understood. Our findings indicate that SOX4 acts as an opportunistic transcription factor directed by a pre-existing chromatin landscape, which upon recruitment to open chromatin further enhances the active chromatin-state. In addition to the epigenome, co-factors may determine SOX4 target gene selection as indicated by the co-occurrence of consensus-binding sites for AP-1, ETS-1 and SMAD3 in SOX4-bound sites. Cooperative binding appears to be a common theme in the SOX-family, as highlighted by SOX2 and OCT4 in embryonic stem cells, which results in the specific regulation of pluripotency genes including NANOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamachi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>). These observations indicate that both the specific cell-type epigenome and the expression of co-factors are important in shaping the SOX4 transcriptional network, providing an explanation for the relatively minor degree of overlap in SOX4 target genes between cancer-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>). The context dependent nature of SOX4 transcriptional networks is of particular importance in heterogeneous diseases such as breast cancer. An important finding is that the SOX4 core-signature is strongly predictive for survival specifically in the Claudin<sup>low</sup> breast cancer subtype. Previous studies have identified distinct clusters of genes that distinguish Claudin<sup>low</sup> breast cancers from other subtypes. The nature of these gene clusters suggest that Claudin<sup>low</sup> breast tumors are characterized by cells that have undergone EMT, have extensive immune cell infiltration and also exhibit activation of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prat and Perou, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennessy et al., 2009</xref>). These are all processes that we observe can be regulated by SOX4 and is reminiscent of other EMT-transcription factors such as TWIST1 and SNAIL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prat et al., 2013</xref>) that can induce an acquisition of Claudin<sup>low</sup> traits in HMLE cells. MDA-MB-231 is a Claudin<sup>low</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prat et al., 2013</xref>), and thus our findings in the xenograft model may mimic the effects SOX4 has in Claudin<sup>low</sup> tumors.</p><p>SOX4 has been demonstrated to contribute to the TGF-β-induced EMT response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lourenço and Coffer, 2017</xref>). Accordingly, we find that EMT and TGF-β associated genes are significantly enriched in our SOX4 target gene dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), although major EMT associated transcription factors <italic>SNAI1, SNAI2</italic> or <italic>TWIST1</italic> were not observed to be regulated (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vervoort et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tiwari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Despite a previous report that SOX4-mediated induction of EMT occurs through upregulation of EZH2 levels, we did not detect significant regulation of <italic>EZH2</italic> upon conditional SOX4 activation in HMLE cells (data not shown). This suggests that the direct transcriptional network of SOX4 is not dependent on the induction of <italic>EZH2</italic> in these cells. Nonetheless, it is possible that SOX4-mediated regulation of <italic>EZH2</italic> occurs upon prolonged activation of SOX4, thus contributing to EMT. These findings indicate that SOX4 may contribute to EMT and the TGF-β response in breast cancer on multiple levels.</p><p>We provide the first evidence of a potential role for SOX4 in tumor-induced angiogenesis. Primary tumor-growth was not consistently affected in vivo by SOX4 depletion, as we observed little consistent difference in tumor growth after SOX4 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, we did observe that SOX4 KD tumors consistently exhibit fewer blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It should be noted that these experiments utilize the ‘aggressive’ MDA-MB-231 cell line where loss of SOX4 may not be sufficient to reduce primary tumor growth. However, even in this context the effects on metastasis and vascularization are clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). SOX4-induced tumor angiogenesis may also contribute to metastatic dissemination. We have shown that depletion of SOX4 leads to a reduced number of spontaneous lung metastases in a xenograft model, which correlated with decreased ET-1 expression and blood vessel density. It has been previously reported that gene signatures associated with vascular activation in Claudin<sup>low</sup> tumors were predictive for metastatic dissemination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrell et al., 2014</xref>). Our SOX4-regulated RNAseq data in HMLEs showed enrichment for one of these vascular signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>) suggesting that SOX4 may drive tumor angiogenesis in Claudin<sup>low</sup> tumors by regulating these genes in addition to <italic>EDN1</italic>. This may contribute to the poor survival of patients with the SOX4 signature in patients with Claudin<sup>low</sup> tumors.</p><p>Thus, our study may signify a potential connection between SOX4-mediated alterations in the tumor-microvasculature and the ability of cells to metastasize. Based on our current data however we cannot determine the degree to which tumor angiogenesis contributes to the pro-metastatic effects of SOX4, since it is not possible to exclude other processes such as EMT and invasiveness. While previous studies have reported that SOX4 can directly modulate tumor cell transcription, our study has demonstrated for the first time that SOX4 can impact tumorigenesis in a non-cell-autonomous fashion.</p><p>In agreement with a role in tumor-progression, ET-1 expression has been demonstrated to positively correlate with tumor-grade and the formation of distant metastasis in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wülfing et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to promoting angiogenesis, SOX4 induced ET-1 may also promote tumor-progression in an autocrine manner by inducing EMT or for example by affecting T-cell infiltration, both of which have demonstrated in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckanovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosanò et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosanò et al., 2013</xref>). SOX4-ET-1 induced autocrine and paracrine signaling may thus affect multiple tumor-promoting processes. It would be interesting to evaluate whether restoration of ET-1 expression is sufficient to restore the metastatic capacity of SOX4-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo. Since SOX4 does affect multiple processes that affect tumor progression we envision that ET-1 depletion would strongly reduce metastasis formation, but would most likely not abolish metastatic outgrowth completely.</p><p>In the last decade a number of anti-angiogenic therapies, mostly targeting the VEGF-receptor pathway, have been tested in clinical trials with limited success due to unwanted side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain, 2014</xref>). These include the inhibition of effective delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics, but also the induction of pro-metastatic processes such as EMT, activated by nutrient deprivation and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain, 2014</xref>). As a driver of both EMT and tumor-induced angiogenesis, SOX4 is an interesting therapeutic target in breast cancer, allowing for the simultaneous inhibition of multiple biological processes required for tumor metastasis. Alternatively, ETAR and ETBR receptor inhibitors such as Bosentan are currently used to treat pulmonary vascular hypertension, and based on our results could potentially be repurposed to specifically treat aggressive SOX4<sup>HI</sup> breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosanò et al., 2013</xref>). Although success of ET-1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of advanced cancers, including glioma and melanoma, has been limited, promising results were obtained in a number of ovarian cancer patients when combined with standard chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosanò et al., 2013</xref>). Based on our findings, patients with SOX4<sup>HI</sup> tumors are more likely to profit from treatment with ET-1 receptor antagonists, thus arguing for the specific monitoring of this subgroup in future clinical studies. A caveat here is that considering the context-dependent nature of SOX4 transcriptional activity it is possible that <italic>EDN1</italic> regulation is also dependent on the expression of co-factors and on the presence of open chromatin. Despite our finding that <italic>EDN1</italic> was one of the few genes commonly regulated by SOX4 in the different breast epithelial cell lines used in this study, future work will have to uncover whether this regulation is conserved in all breast cancer cells and subtypes.</p><p>Taken together, our global-transcriptional analysis provides mechanistic insight into the contextual nature of SOX4 responses and uncovers a novel role for SOX4 in tumor-induced angiogenesis by direct regulation of ET-1 expression. The identification of this novel SOX4 controlled pathway underscores the validity of our approach and highlights the value of our dataset as a resource to uncover further novel functions for SOX4 in cancer and potentially to understand its role in developmental biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC-1) were obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ades et al., 1992</xref>) and maintained in MCDB 131 medium containing 10% FCS, 10 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (All from Life Technologies, USA), 50 nM hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 10 ng/ml rhEGF (Invitrogen, USA) up to passage 27 at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and ambient oxygen level (20%).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Green as the Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Vervoort et al. report on the identification of a SOX4 breast cancer transcriptional gene set associated with angiogenesis. Using a conditional system where SOX4 is induced and immunoprecipitated, the authors identify potential transcriptional targets of SOX4 identified in a human mammary epithelial line and two breast cancer lines. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis reveals Gene Ontology categories such as migration, extracellular matrix, and angiogenesis. The authors focus on one target gene – endothelin-1 – and provide data consistent with direct transcriptional targeting by SOX4. Consistent with an angiogenic role for SOX4, conditioned media from SOX4-over-expressing mammary epithelial cells exhibit modestly enhanced angiogenic activity, which is partially dependent on endothelial 1. Implantation of the SOX4-over-expressing mammary epithelial line and SOX4-depleted MDA-MB-231 breast cancer line in zebrafish reveal a pro-angiogenic role for SOX4 in this system. SOX4 depletion is also found to reduce tumor angiogenesis and orthotopic metastasis in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Finally, human tumor tissue-microarray analyses reveal a positive association between SOX4 protein levels and metastatic relapse and tumor blood vessel density. These observations are consistent with angiogenesis promotion constituting one phenotype downstream of SOX4 and reveal endothelin-1 to represent a potential direct target and downstream mediator of SOX4's role in angiogenesis and metastasis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In multiple experiments, the authors employ a single RNAi or shRNA to draw conclusions. One cannot exclude such observations representing off-target effects. Ideally, all experiments should be done with an independent RNAi. However, I'm willing to accept the use of a second independent RNAi in a single study that I deem most germane to the conclusion of the paper: Figure 6. The authors should generate a second SOX4 hairpin expressing breast cancer line and conduct a primary tumor growth and metastasis assay. In these same cells, when the authors validate the knockdown, they should validate reduction in expression of endothelin-1. In Figure 6A-B, the impact of SOX4 depletion on endothelin-1 is not that robust. A second hairpin with potentially better knockdown may reveal a greater effect. Moreover, Figure 6A-B appears to represent technical replicates. Biological replicates are essential. Moreover, the authors should generate pre-mRNA primers to ensure that the effects of SOX4 depletion also impact pre-mRNA transcript levels rather than solely SOX4 mRNA levels.</p><p>2) The endothelin-1 mutant reporter and its wildtype variant should be transfected into a breast cancer line (such as the cells generated above in (1)-along with its 2 SOX4 depleted lines) to demonstrate that endogenous SOX4 depletion leads to reduced endothelin-1 transcriptional reporter expression. This is essential, since the over-expression studies are non-physiological.</p><p>3) Citing of literature on prior papers on SOX4 and transcriptional targets regulating invasion.</p><p>4) When SOX4 was originally implicated in loss-of-function studies as a promoter of breast cancer metastasis, its associated phenotype implicated was invasiveness. Many subsequent papers have shown SOX4 to promote invasion in a number of systems. The authors should be commended for identifying an additional phenotype downstream of SOX4, but the Introduction does not discuss invasion as a key aspect of SOX4's biology in cancer. They mention EMT being associated, but in past work, enhanced invasiveness rather than EMT has been repeatedly implicated. This past work is consistent with the authors' identification of migration, ECM, and lack of observations of genes such as <italic>SNAI1, SNAI2</italic>, or <italic>TWIST1</italic> being modulated. The authors should cite the many prior papers by multiple groups on SOX4 describing its roles in invasiveness, including studies that identify transcriptional targets of SOX4 as pro-invasive genes and promoters of metastasis, including studies in breast cancer.</p><p>5) One major issue is whether the pro-angiogenic function of SOX4 is a conserved function of SOX4 in biology. Figure 1 shows that SOX4 mainly binds to regions of open chromatin, and then Figure 1—figure supplement 1H-I show that there is very little overlap between ChIP-seq data from HMLE, MB-231 and HCC1954. Therefore, the authors concluded that SOX4-target genes are very context dependent. Most of data on the connection of SOX4 with <italic>EDN1</italic> and angiogenesis is based on overexpressing SOX4. Only endogenous SOX4 knockdown was performed in MB-231 cells with a single shRNA and showed very limited data (no SOX4 or <italic>EDN1</italic> protein expression by western). A large panel of cancer cell lines should be examined to determine whether there is a correlation between SOX4 and <italic>EDN1</italic>. Figure 3— figure supplement 2C attempts to show that there is a correlation between SOX4 and EDN-1 in TCGA data. However, R=0.139 suggests that 80% samples show no correlation, further weakening the argument that SOX4 and EDN-1 is correlated at the RNA level. Therefore, data presented in the paper are not sufficient to conclude whether the link between SOX4 and <italic>EDN1</italic> pays a major role in angiogenesis.</p><p>6) Another major issue is whether the observed phenotypes of SOX4 in cancer is due to defects in angiogenesis. Figure 6 is the only data to look at the effects of knocking down endogenous SOX4 on tumor formation and metastasis. Given the major role of angiogenesis in promoting primary tumor formation, it is surprising that SOX4 knockdown has no effect on primary tumor growth despite increases in vessel area and vessel count. As the authors discussed in the Introduction, previous studies show that SOX4 induces EMT in various tumor cells. Therefore, the observed decrease in lung metastasis could be due to an EMT defect. Similarly, the correlation between SOX4 upregulation and poor prognosis in human breast cancer in Figure 7 could also be due to an EMT defect, instead of angiogenesis.</p><p>7) Figure 4A-4E show very mild effects of SCM from SOX4-overexpressing cells. In Figure 4D, since siEDN alone without SCM already affected cell migration, it is unclear whether siEDN with SCM indeed regulates the effect of SOX4 or independent of SOX4.</p><p>8) The authors convincingly show that Sox4 induces an angiogenic phenotype on endothelial cells, and that it is primarily mediated by endothelin-1. However, in the in vivo studies, the link between this angiogenic phenotype and metastatic dissemination is merely correlative. Sox4 knock down in MDA-MB-231 cells has been already shown to reduce metastatic dissemination through a cell migration and invasion defect. Is restoration of ET-1 in the context of Sox-4 knockdown sufficient to restore metastatic ability, as the authors suggest?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27706.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In multiple experiments, the authors employ a single RNAi or shRNA to draw conclusions. One cannot exclude such observations representing off-target effects. Ideally, all experiments should be done with an independent RNAi. However, I'm willing to accept the use of a second independent RNAi in a single study that I deem most germane to the conclusion of the paper: Figure 6. The authors should generate a second SOX4 hairpin expressing breast cancer line and conduct a primary tumor growth and metastasis assay. In these same cells, when the authors validate the knockdown, they should validate reduction in expression of endothelin-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the experiment suggested using a second short hairpin RNA against SOX4 in MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B the new cell line that has been generated to express a second shRNA against SOX4 also shows a strong reduction in expression endothelin-1. These cells were subsequently transplanted into NSG-mice and primary tumor growth and metastasis formation was assessed. In this experiment SOX4 reduction led to a modest decrease in primary tumor growth (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). Importantly, SOX4 reduction induced a robust and significant decrease in the number of metastases in the lungs (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F). Supporting our previous data, the SOX4 depletion also led to a decrease in vascularization (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). These important data confirm our earlier findings in Figure 6 and support a role for SOX4 in the regulation of endothelin-1, tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6A-B, the impact of SOX4 depletion on endothelin-1 is not that robust.

We apologize for the misunderstanding which may have stemmed from the fact that there are no error bars for the scrambled control cell line. These graphs represent relative expression for <italic>SOX4</italic> and <italic>EDN1</italic> similar to the other qRT-PCR data in the paper.

This is essential, since the over-expression studies are non-physiological.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed this experiment multiple times under a variety of conditions but we do not see a consistent difference between the activation of the endothelin-1 reporter in the MDA-MB-231 scrambled control cell line and the two SOX4 depleted cell lines. There could be a variety of explanations for this. By using an artificial transcriptional system such as a luciferase reporter construct, the reporter may not be appropriately regulated in MDA-231 cells. It is possible that low levels of SOX4 remain despite the knockdown and these are sufficient to activate the reporter under these artificial conditions. We would argue that we have shown that endogenous SOX4 binds the endothelin-1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3B) as the ChIP for MDA-MB-231 cells has been performed for endogenous SOX4. Secondly, we have now also shown with two different shRNAs that <italic>EDN1</italic> expression is also strongly reduced in the SOX4 shRNA lines (Figure 6A-B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B). These data strongly support our hypothesis that endogenous SOX4 regulates <italic>EDN1</italic> expression. While we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, we don’t think that transfection of the reporter construct is a more physiological approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When SOX4 was originally implicated in loss-of-function studies as a promoter of breast cancer metastasis, its associated phenotype implicated was invasiveness. Many subsequent papers have shown Sox4 to promote invasion in a number of systems. The authors should be commended for identifying an additional phenotype downstream of SOX4, but the Introduction does not discuss invasion as a key aspect of SOX4's biology in cancer. They mention EMT being associated, but in past work, enhanced invasiveness rather than EMT has been repeatedly implicated. This past work is consistent with the authors' identification of migration, ECM, and lack of observations of genes such as SNAI1, SNAI2, or TWIST1 being modulated. The authors should cite the many prior papers by multiple groups on SOX4 describing its roles in invasiveness, including studies that identify transcriptional targets of SOX4 as pro-invasive genes and promoters of metastasis, including studies in breast cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have now added this discussion to the manuscript Introduction (fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One major issue is whether the pro-angiogenic function of SOX4 is a conserved function of SOX4 in biology.

In Figure 4 we have shown this effect of different mammary cell lines in in vitroassays. These same cell lines have also been used in zebrafish and in mice to show the angiogenic effects of SOX4 in vivo(Figure 5, Figure 6F, Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). In this revised version of the manuscript we show angiogenic effects of the overexpression system but also of the knockdown system with two independent shRNAs in separate experiments. Finally, in an entirely unrelated set of human mammary tumor samples we have shown that high SOX4 protein expression correlates with more vascularization (Figure 7G).</p><p>As to the concerns regarding the conserved nature of the regulation of <italic>EDN1</italic> by SOX4 we have also generated (additional) knockout cell lines for SOX4 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B) and for HCC1954 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). In both these lines downregulation of endogenous SOX4 leads to a downregulation of <italic>EDN1</italic>. Since <italic>EDN1</italic> was one of a limited set of genes that is commonly bound by SOX4 in HMLE, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 cells, these data support the idea that EDN1 regulation by SOX4 is a conserved function.</p><p>We have also analyzed co-expression of SOX4 and <italic>EDN1</italic> in other databases. While there is a significant correlation (p-value) in both the TCGA and METABRIC database the correlation coefficient is not very high (TCGA R= 0.14; METABRIC R= 0.10). We have removed the previous Figure 3—figure supplement 2C from the revised manuscript. The absence of a strong correlation in these datasets could be due to a myriad of reasons. SOX4 gene expression does not always correlate with protein expression and we have previously demonstrated that the SOX4 protein can be stabilized by Syntenin (Beekman et al., 2012). Moreover, <italic>EDN1</italic> expression can be regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental cues. The <italic>EDN1</italic> promoter has been demonstrated to be responsive to TGFβ, Hypoxia and FOXO and NFKb mediated regulation (Stow et al., 2011). Importantly, these large scale RNA-seq efforts such as TCGA and METABRIC indiscriminately sample both tumour and stromal components including vasculature, which makes it difficult to interpret which cell type gave rise to the correlation.</p><p>Collectively our data shows that SOX4 can control <italic>EDN1</italic> expression in a variety of cellular systems and contexts. <italic>EDN1</italic> belongs to a subset of genes that was bound by SOX4 in three different mammary epithelial cell lines. Therefore it would appear likely that <italic>EDN1</italic> is one of the ‘core’ SOX4 target genes. However large-scale datasets do not provide clarity on the interrelated expression of these two genes. Therefore it is conceivable that regulation of <italic>EDN1</italic> by SOX4 is context dependent, similar to the majority of SOX4 target genes, which potentially rely on the expression of co-factors, distinct transcription factors, signaling input or a permissive chromatin state. We have included this notion in the Discussion (sixth paragraph). Importantly we have “softened” the conclusion that SOX4 is a major regulator of tumor-induced angiogenesis, but rather can be a regulator depending on context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Another major issue is whether the observed phenotypes of SOX4 in cancer is due to defects in angiogenesis. Figure 6 is the only data to look at the effects of knocking down endogenous SOX4 on tumor formation and metastasis. Given the major role of angiogenesis in promoting primary tumor formation, it is surprising that SOX4 knockdown has no effect on primary tumor growth despite increases in vessel area and vessel count.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed in the initial mouse experiment we were also surprised that the knockdown of SOX4 in MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect primary tumor growth despite its clear effects on vascularization. However, these cells are highly aggressive and perhaps are therefore better able to compensate for the loss of SOX4 in the primary tumor. In our second mouse experiment (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C) loss of SOX4 does lead to a modest reduction in primary tumor size, and this correlates with better SOX4 knockdown. Angiogenesis is a process that is executed when pro-angiogenic factors are able to overcome the effects of anti-angiogenic factors. These are in vivo experiments with tumors that exhibit natural variability in gene expression. Therefore it is conceivable that loss of SOX4-induced expression of pro-angiogenic factors is compensated by the expression of other pro-angiogenic factors in some of the experiments. We have now discussed this in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors discussed in the Introduction, previous studies show that SOX4 induces EMT in various tumor cells. Therefore, the observed decrease in lung metastasis could be due to an EMT defect. Similarly, the correlation between SOX4 upregulation and poor prognosis in human breast cancer in Figure 7 could also be due to an EMT defect, instead of angiogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and clearly also show that SOX4 affects multiple processes, such as migration and cell cycle in our ChIP-seq data (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The main message of our study is that SOX4 <italic>can</italic> regulate tumor angiogenesis. This is an important finding since angiogenesis impacts multiple stages of tumor development. In contrast to suggesting that SOX4 mediates metastasis solely by inducing tumor angiogenesis we would rather argue that SOX4 has such a major impact on (breast) cancer because it affects multiple pro-oncogenic processes. One of these is tumor angiogenesis, which we define here for the first time. This will be of major interest to the fields of breast cancer, EMT and SOX4.</p><p>It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to dissect how much the angiogenic defect contributes to metastatic dissemination since EMT and angiogenesis are linked through a variety of mechanisms. For example, it has been demonstrated that EMT itself can induce the upregulation of VEGF and that this is an integral component of the EMT-mediated pro-tumorigenic effects (Fantozzi et al., 2014). Moreover, <italic>EDN1</italic> inhibition (either pharmacologically or using genetic approaches) would still be able to affect both processes as <italic>EDN1</italic> has been associated with EMT before (Rosanò et al., 2013). Alternatively, using general pharmacological inhibitors of angiogenesis (such as avastin) would not really add anything as it wouldn’t be clear whether any effect one sees has any relationship with SOX4.</p><p>We have now stressed more clearly in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion that we cannot distinguish how SOX4-induced tumor angiogenesis contributes to the pro-oncogenic effects of SOX4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4A-4E show very mild effects of SCM from SOX4-overexpressing cells.

We observe that there is also a reduction of cell migration also in the SCM- + si<italic>EDN1</italic> condition. It should be noted that we use conditioned medium from ERSOX4 HMLE cells without the addition of 4-OHT, but not “without SCM” as mentioned by the reviewers. This is of relevance since we find in our qRT-PCR analyses that there is already baseline <italic>EDN1</italic> expression in the HMLE ERSOX4 cells without 4-OHT (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), which likely reflects low-level of leakiness of the inducible construct. Therefore, by depleting <italic>EDN1</italic> in this condition one would expect that this also leads to a reduction in endothelial cell migration.</p><p>Our new analyses further show that in the improved experimental setup loss of <italic>EDN1</italic> expression is comparable in HMLE ERSOX4 with and without 4-OHT (SCM- vs SCM+). This is also reflected in a similar degree by which the migration of endothelial cells is inhibited. Thus, collectively these data suggest that loss of <italic>EDN1</italic> can inhibit SOX4-dependent stimulation of endothelial migration.</p><p><italic>7) The authors convincingly show that Sox4 induces an angiogenic phenotype on endothelial cells, and that it is primarily mediated by endothelin-1.
