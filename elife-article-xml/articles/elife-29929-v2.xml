Long-sought transporters involved in mitochondrial calcium influx and efflux have recently been identified. To obtain a unified picture of mitochondrial calcium utilization, a parallel advance in understanding the forms and quantities of mitochondrial calcium stores is needed. We present here the direct 3D visualization of mitochondrial calcium in intact mammalian cells using cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (CSTET). Amorphous solid granules containing calcium and phosphorus were pervasive in the mitochondrial matrices of a variety of mammalian cell types. Analysis based on quantitative electron scattering revealed that these repositories are equivalent to molar concentrations of dissolved ions. These results demonstrate conclusively that calcium buffering in the mitochondrial matrix in live cells occurs by phase separation, and that solid-phase stores provide a major ion reservoir that can be mobilized for bioenergetics and signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>cryo-STEM microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1285/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>Sharon Grayer</given-names></name><name><surname>Elbaum</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fass</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005386</institution-id><institution>Israeli Centers for Research Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1775/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fass</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammalian mitochondria in living cells store calcium phosphate in solid form.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells use ion gradients for information transfer and energy storage. A widely known example is the proton gradient in mitochondria, which allows for oxidative phosphorylation in the production of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saraste, 1999</xref>). Calcium gradients have an equally prominent role in cell physiology, and mitochondria are central players in calcium storage and utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabadkai and Duchen, 2008</xref>). Calcium ions affect mitochondrial physiology by regulating respiratory chain complexes, tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins, and metabolite transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glancy and Balaban, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, substantial potential energy is stored in the calcium gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glancy and Balaban, 2012</xref>). Calcium uptake by mitochondria also influences cellular calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>) and, in excess, can trigger apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giorgi et al., 2012</xref>). For all these reasons, a thorough understanding of how calcium is handled by mitochondria is immensely important.</p><p>Despite the progress in identifying and characterizing the molecules responsible for mitochondrial calcium uptake and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Stefani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>), an appreciation for the quantities, forms, and availability of calcium in mitochondria has been hampered by inadequate preservation of ions with typical imaging and detection methods. Although fluorescent indicators are widely used in the study of mitochondrial calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pendin et al., 2015</xref>), these sensors inevitably perturb the soluble ion pool. Moreover, they are blind to solid-phase stores or tightly bound species. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of metal-stained thin cell sections has for decades provided details on mitochondrial morphology and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palade, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), but ions and other unfixed contents are likely to be flushed from the organelle during sample preparation.</p><p>Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a technique that allows for mapping of samples with sensitivity to atomic number and has a long history of applications in materials science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pennycook, 2012</xref>). STEM tomography of cryo-preserved samples is currently being developed for its unique applications to biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolf et al., 2014</xref>). Following a study of polyphosphate bodies in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>), we used cryo-STEM tomography (CSTET) to examine ion deposition in mammalian cells. We report that CSTET provides a faithful view of ion storage in mitochondria, revealing the quantities and organization of accumulated calcium in natural intracellular contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-STEM tomography reveals morphology and interactions of whole mitochondria within cells</title><p>For CSTET visualization, cells were grown in standard culture conditions and prepared for electron microscopy by vitrification. Unless otherwise noted, cells were vitrified 2 or 3 days after seeding onto microscopy grids, when they were well-adherent and showed evidence of proliferation but were still sub-confluent. Tomographic data were collected without further manipulation, preserving native interactions among organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murley and Nunnari, 2016</xref>) and the physiological distribution of chemical constituents. We note that CSTET is well suited to provide deep views (up to &gt;1 μm) into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rez et al., 2016</xref>). For comparison, conventional cryo-TEM tomography is restricted to thin cell regions (preferably less than 300 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Villa et al., 2013</xref>) or requires technically challenging processing of thicker regions by cryo-microtomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ladinsky et al., 2006</xref>) or focused-ion beam milling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahamid et al., 2016</xref>). Conventional metal-stained thin sections of fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are approximately 70-nm thick and unavoidably display staining artifacts. The value of imaging thick cell regions in unperturbed cells is emphasized by a CSTET reconstruction and segmentation from a region of a WI-38 fibroblast cell with a depth of 750 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>).

Granule diameters ranged from about 20 to 100 nm, varying with cell type.

STEM mode enables one to take advantage of the relation between atomic number and the angular distribution of electron scattering; bright-field (BF) images are generated from electrons transmitted in the forward direction, while dark-field (DF) images are formed from electrons scattered to higher angles in the same experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolf et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strong high-angle scattering by mitochondrial granules (i.e. black appearance in the BF image and white in the DF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) is consistent with a composition biased toward elements heavier than the oxygen dominating the surrounding aqueous medium. Ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) also appear dark in the BF and are moderately bright in the DF due to their density and content of relatively heavy elements, including phosphorus. For comparison, lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) are characteristically dark in both the BF and the DF images due to their dense composition of the light element carbon. In addition to containing granules, mitochondrial matrices are darker in the BF than the surrounding cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), suggesting the presence of dissolved heavy ions. Due to the high background in fully hydrated cells, we were not able to obtain sufficient EDX signal from mitochondrial regions lacking granules to compare soluble mitochondrial ion content to cytosol using this method. This limitation was not surprising, considering that the concentration of matrix calcium ions would reach a maximum of only 100 mM at electrochemical equilibrium, and actual steady-state levels are considerably lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pozzan et al., 2000</xref>), whereas the concentrations of ions in solid deposits are much higher, as shown below. The intensity differences seen in CSTET reconstructions of mitochondrial matrix compared to cytosol therefore provide information difficult to obtain using other techniques.</p><p>The substantial heterogeneity of intensities observed in 3D within individual matrix granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) is consistent with a composition of ‘micro-packets’ of solid calcium phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehninger, 1970</xref>). It remains to be determined whether proteins or metabolites associate with these packets to regulate their growth and dissolution. For comparison with granules formed in mitochondria, biomimetic amorphous calcium phosphate particles were prepared in solution as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habraken et al., 2013</xref>). These particles, embedded in a thin film of vitreous ice, were compared with mitochondrial granules in a particularly thin region of a fibroblast cell (220 nm) using zero-loss energy filtered cryo-TEM (zlTEM) tomography recorded on a direct electron detector in movie mode. Mitochondrial and synthetic particles both display granularity and appear to be composed of smaller subparticles of about 4 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). The general features and appearance of the mitochondrial and synthetic granules are similar, as are the EDX spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,J</xref>).</p><p>Voxel intensities in STEM reconstructions were used to obtain quantitative information on the mass densities within matrix granules, using the known composition of ribosomes as a reference.

After treatment of human primary embryonic lung fibroblasts with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, CSTET revealed dramatically increased organelle fragmentation and formation of autophagosomes/autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as well as instances of mitochondrial aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), reported to occur in early-stage apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haga et al., 2003</xref>).

Notably, these two mitochondria showed striking differences in granule size and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), likely reflecting their distinct energetic states and diverging fates. Both the large and small granules consisted of amorphous material. In contrast, in a different cell region showing particularly severe damage and organelle degradation, structures that may have been fragmented mitochondria contained dense clusters of fibers or crystalline needles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Calcium uptake depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabadkai and Duchen, 2008</xref>), and the dye JC-1, commonly used as a membrane potential reporter, enabled visualization of mitochondria by cryo-fluorescence followed by CSTET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, JC-1 damaged mitochondrial ultrastructure and disrupted granules, likely by perturbing the potential it reports on. This experiment demonstrated the feasibility of correlative fluorescence/CSTET studies but also emphasizes that fluorescent sensors may perturb organelle chemistry and morphology, effects that are readily seen in CSTET. Intentional depolarization of mitochondria by treating cells with carbonyl cyanide p-[trifluoromethoxy]-phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) eliminated calcium deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,C</xref>), demonstrating the relevance of the proton gradient to matrix granule formation in cells. As granules were found consistently in untreated non-confluent fibroblasts and thus presumably existed before FCCP treatment, this experiment also showed that ion deposition is reversible, though the rate of mobilization remains to be determined. The matrices of some FCCP-treated mitochondria showed contrast similar to cytosol, indicating depletion of soluble heavy elements as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,C</xref>). Remarkably, neighboring mitochondria, including some sharing contiguous outer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), displayed very different matrix densities, revealing that variations in soluble ion concentrations, and not only the presence of dense deposits, can be detected by CSTET.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29929.024</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Correlative imaging of mitochondria using fluorescence from a membrane-potential reporter.</title><p>Mitochondria in WI-38 fibroblasts were stained with JC-1, cryo-preserved, and imaged successively by fluorescence microscopy and CSTET.

However, certain observations suggested situations that may deplete solid calcium stores. In one instance, we observed granule-free mitochondria in MCF10A breast epithelial cells that were undergoing a burst of proliferation at the time of vitrification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). It was difficult to visualize these cells when rapidly proliferating because the dense cell clusters that formed rarely presented regions 1 μm or less in thickness. Nevertheless, an effort was made to image an MCF10A cell on the edge of a cluster. A group of mitochondria in this case were observed to display the dark matrix observed in BF images of other mitochondria, suggesting that they remain polarized and have a high content of soluble calcium, but they were clearly devoid of granules. Mitochondria from other cells in the same culture were rich in granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). It therefore appears that sequestration and mobilization of calcium occurs according to local signaling and energetic requirements and can exhibit substantial heterogeneity within certain cell populations.</p><p>We also observed that WI-38 fibroblast cells grown for longer periods and allowed to reach 90% to 95% confluence on grids often contained mitochondria with few or no granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, imaging fibroblasts near confluence is challenging, as large fractions of the cultures were too thick even for CSTET, but certain areas were still accessible. Notably, confluent fibroblasts are highly metabolically active, using substantial energy to produce and secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemons et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, substantial extracellular matrix was detected in the fibroblast cultures imaged under these conditions (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Establishing the proton gradient and synthesizing ATP are textbook functions of mitochondria, for which the chemiosmotic hypothesis is the accepted mechanism. By contrast, the observation that calcium uptake by mitochondria may take precedence over ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi, 1999</xref>) is not widely appreciated. Formation of solid calcium phosphate complexes in mitochondria has been described in the context of bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boonrungsiman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sutfin et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerschnitzki et al., 2016</xref>), but our study points to broader purposes for mitochondrial granules, beyond calcification. CSTET visualization of calcium sequestration in a variety of unfixed and unstained whole cells strengthens the notion that solid-state storage must be considered in a general accounting of cellular calcium, even for non-mineralizing cells. This direct and readily appreciable view of calcium deposition in intact cells is valuable for re-focusing attention on the role of ion phase separation and remobilization in mitochondrial function. Suggestions of granule depletion in highly metabolically active cells should be further investigated. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of electron scattering using CSTET data should be further developed to provide information on elemental content and concentrations that cannot readily be obtained by other methods. With the remarkable ability to reveal organelle organization and elemental distribution in intact mammalian cells with no sample manipulation other than cryo-preservation, CSTET promises to be a pioneering technology for cell biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>WI-38</td><td>Coriell Institute</td><td>NA06814</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>Human Dermal Microvascular <break/>Endothelial Cells (HDMEC) <break/>juvenile foreskin</td><td valign="bottom">Promocell</td><td>C-22020</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>U2OS</td><td valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td>HTB-96</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>MCF10A</td><td valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td>CRL-10317</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>mouse embryonic fibroblasts</td><td valign="bottom">Weizmann Institute <break/>Stem Cell Core Unit</td><td>MEFs</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MCU -/-)</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2013</xref></td><td>MEFs MCU -/-</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MCU +/+)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2013</xref></td><td>MEFs MCU +/+</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture and sample preparation</title><p>WI-38 embryonic lung fibroblasts were purchased from Coriell and maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.

MCF10A breast epithelial cells, obtained from the laboratory of Yosef Yarden at the Weizmann Institute, were grown in DMEM:F12 medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 5% horse serum, L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 10 µg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma). U2OS cells, obtained from the laboratory of Benjamin Geiger at the Weizmann Institute, were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Human dermal endothelial cells (HDMEC) supplied by Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany) were obtained from the laboratory of Ronen Alon at the Weizmann Institute and grown in the endothelial cell growth medium purchased from Promocell. WI-38 and MCF10A cell cultures were tested for mycoplasma every 3 weeks.</p><p>Gold Quantifoil R3.5/1 grids were subjected to glow-discharge treatment and immediately immersed in water by placing them carbon-side up onto a glass (fibroblasts) or tissue-culture treated plastic (other cell types) coverslip affixed to the bottom of a tissue culture dish to facilitate manipulation of grids with surgical tweezers. Grids in the open tissue culture dishes filled with water were then UV sterilized for half an hour in a tissue culture hood. Grids for MCF10A, U2OS, and HDMEC cells were coated with fibronectin after sterilization. For all cell types, water was replaced with the appropriate culture medium, and cells were plated onto the grids. Cultures on grids were grown to 30–70% confluence, typically over 2 or 3 days. Immediately prior to vitrification, grids were lifted from the coverslip platform in the tissue culture dish, 1 μl colloidal gold (10 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duchesne et al., 2008</xref>) at a concentration of 120 nM in phosphate buffered saline was added to provide fiducial markers, and 4 μl of cell culture medium at 37°C was placed on the cell side of the grid. The grids were blotted at 21°C and &gt;90% humidity for 2–4 s from the side opposite the cells, flash-frozen in liquid ethane using a Leica EM-GP plunger, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use.</p><p>FCCP (Sigma) was prepared as a 1 mM stock in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 into the medium of WI-38 fibroblasts cultured on grids to give a final concentration of 1 μM. Cells were grown for a further 24 hr before vitrification. Doxorubicin (Sigma) was prepared as a 2 mM stock in DMSO and diluted 1:2000 into WI-38 fibroblasts cultured on grids to give a final concentration of 1 μM. Samples were vitrified 16 hr after doxorubicin treatment. JC-1 was prepared as a 1 mg/ml stock in DMSO and diluted 100-fold into warm medium, which was then mixed 1:1 with the medium of cells cultured on grids. After 30-min incubation, cells were washed with PBS and vitrified.</p><p>The following is an accounting of the number of tomograms collected and the number of mitochondria observed for the different cell types and treatments. Mitochondria were counted as distinct if they did not share matrix content. During the course of this study, about 22 tomograms of untreated WI-38 fibroblasts that had grown 2 to 4 days on grids were collected. Altogether 66 mitochondria were observed in reconstructions of these tomograms, and all these mitochondria contained granules. In addition, 13 tomograms were collected from WI-38 fibroblasts that had grown for 6 or 7 days on grids without exchange of medium and were near confluence. Thirty mitochondria were observed in these tomograms, 15 of which contained granules. Seven tomograms of wild-type MEFs yielded 33 mitochondria, all containing granules, whereas 3 tomograms of MCU-/- MEFs showed 17 mitochondria, 7 of them lacking granules). Two tomograms of U2OS (eight mitochondria, all with granules), 6 tomograms of HDMEC (26 mitochondria, all with granules) and 3 tomograms of MCF10A cells (14 mitochondria, 7 of which had no granules) were acquired. Nine tomograms of WI-38 (59 mitochondria, 10 of which had no deposits) were taken after doxorubicin treatment, and 8 tomograms (68 mitochondria, none of which contained deposits) were taken after FCCP treatment. In addition to full tomograms, numerous single STEM images of cell regions were taken during this study. Due to the time investment in collecting tomograms, cell regions were not chosen randomly for tomography but were rather selected for ideal depth (600 nm to 1 μm) and for the likelihood of containing mitochondria, as assessed by the presence in single STEM images of organelles that appeared slightly darker than bulk cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cryo-light microscopy</title><p>Fluorescence imaging of JC-1 treated cells cryopreserved on Quantifoil grids was done using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a cryostage (Linkam). LED excitation was at 470 nm. Emission was collected between 515 and 555 nm for the green channel and between 575 and 635 for the red channel. After fluorescence imaging, grids were stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography</title><p>Vitrified cell samples were observed with a Tecnai F20 S/TEM instrument at 200 kV. STEM was performed with extraction voltage = 4300 V, gun lens = 3 or 6, and spot size = 5, with 10 or 20 μm condenser apertures, yielding probe diameters of 2 or 1 nm and semi-convergence angles of 1.3 or 2.7 mrad, respectively. The camera length was set either to 320 or to 520 mm so that the acceptance cone semi-angle at the bottom-mounted bright-field detector (BF; Gatan model 805, later upgraded to 806) was slightly larger than the illumination cone semi-angle, providing conditions for on-axis BF signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rez et al., 2016</xref>). Simultaneous dark-field data were collected on a Fischione HAADF detector located at the 35 mm port of the microscope column. The geometry imposes a gap between the outer cutoff angle of the BF and the inner cutoff angle of the HAADF detectors; the ratio between these angles is approximately 4. Images of 1024 × 1024 or 2048 × 2048 pixels were recorded with probe dwell times between 5 and 20 µs, yielding frame exposure times of approximately 10 to 20 s. Spatial sampling was set between 1 and 4 nm/pixel. Doses, measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolf et al., 2014</xref>), were limited to 1–3 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup> per dwell spot. Single-axis tilt series were recorded using either FEI Xplore3D software or SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>), with angular sampling from ±60° in 2° steps. Data collection schemes were either sweeping from −60° to +60°, or collecting from +20° to −60°, and then from +22° to +60°. Dynamic focus adjustment was employed to maintain focus conditions perpendicular to the tilt axis at all tilt angles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Tomogram reconstruction and segmentation</title><p>The tomographic tilt series were aligned using fiducial markers and reconstructed using weighted back projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frangakis and Hegerl, 2001</xref>) as implemented in the IMOD software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Reconstructions are displayed after non-linear anisotropic diffusion filtering within IMOD. Tomograms will be deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank.

Briefly, 10 mM stocks of calcium chloride and potassium phosphate were prepared in Tris-buffered saline and mixed. At 1.5 min after mixing and every 5 min following, 5 μl were removed, placed on Quantifoil Multi A copper 200 mesh grids, and vitrified. Samples at several timepoints were inspected using CSTET and zero-loss energy-filtered cryo TEM tomography.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Zero-loss energy filtered cryo TEM tomography</title><p>Vitrified cell samples were observed with the same Tecnai F20 S/TEM instrument as used for CSTET, which is equipped with a Gatan Quantum 967 ‘special’ energy filter and K2 summit direct electron detector. Experiments were performed at 200 kV, with extraction voltage = 4300 V, gun lens = 4, and spot size = 5, a condenser aperture of 30 μm, and a zero-loss energy slit of 20 eV. Dose was set to 0.12 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>/sec, with 9 s exposures divided over 18 frames in movie mode. Motion correction was performed using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). The data collection scheme was the same as used for CSTET. TEM tilt series were corrected for CTF using phase-flipping routine in IMOD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>TEM imaging of thin cell sections</title><p>For preparation of thin cell sections, WI-38 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed using 2.5% gluteraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at room temperature, washed in cacodylate buffer at 4°C, and stained with 1% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate. Samples were dehydrated in cold ethanol and then embedded in Epon. After removing the glass coverslips with liquid nitrogen, ultrathin sections of the monolayer Epon blocks (~70 nm) were cut parallel to the cover slip surface and transferred to 200-mesh copper grids. Thin plastic sections were imaged in a FEI Tecnai Spirit T-12 operated at a 120 kV. Images were recorded with a 2 k Eagle CCD camera (FEI, Eindhoven).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Estimate of calcium/phosphate densities</title><p>For quantitative analysis, reconstructions were performed using the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) as implemented in the Tomo3D program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agulleiro and Fernandez, 2015</xref>). SIRT compares projections of the reconstructed volume with the raw data to minimize numerical differences. BF data, which showed greater signal-to-noise than DF data, were used for the analysis presented here. A band-pass filter with lower and upper cutoff of 1 and 100 pixel widths, respectively, was imposed to reduce minor shading artifacts.</p><p>The known composition of ribosomes and water were used to scale the image intensities. To estimate the expected scattering away from the BF detector by ribosomes, differential scattering cross-sections were integrated from the BF outer cutoff angle (five mrad) up to π rad according to the densities of constituent elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to the scattering of whole ribosomes, scattering of ribosomal RNA was calculated separately, since the RNA component will scatter more strongly than the protein and solvent components. The integrated cross-section for TCP with chemical formula Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and density 3.14 gm/cm<sup>3</sup> was calculated similarly.</p><p>Five intensity levels were measured from a representative tomogram: two for the granules (peak and inclusive levels), two for ribosomes (peak and inclusive levels), and one for cytosolic fluid, used to approximate water (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These intensities were determined by adjusting a threshold using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) until the objects of interest were selected. Measured intensities in the tomographic reconstruction include an additive background <italic>x</italic> from unscattered illumination, which can be estimated by imposing predicted intensity ratios between known components. For example, the ratio of ribosomal RNA (peak ribosomal intensities) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voss and Gerstein, 2005</xref>) to water would be (5.3-<italic>x</italic>)/(16-<italic>x</italic>)=2.29, yielding <italic>x</italic> = 24.3. The choice of total ribosomes (inclusive ribosome intensities) and the corresponding predicted intensity ratios, (7.5-<italic>x</italic>)/(16-<italic>x</italic>)=1.56, yields a value of <italic>x</italic> = 30.9. Using these background values and the predicted scattering for TCP, which is 6.06 times that of water, the expected intensity for TCP in tomogram images was calculated. On the scale from background to TCP thus obtained, the maximal and typical densities of the granules were found to be in the range of 34% to 48% and 31% to 42% of TCP density, respectively. The corresponding mass densities are 1.1 to 1.5 and 1.0 to 1.3 gm/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. These values can be compared with a density of 2 gm/cm<sup>3</sup> for amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) prepared in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fawcett, 1973</xref>).</p><p>For mitochondrial volume fraction estimates, MEF mitochondria were segmented in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) applying conservative intensity thresholds to define granule boundaries. A rectangular prism was selected within a mitochondrion. The ratio of the sum of the volumes of the segmented granule regions within the rectangular prism to the volume of the prism was about 0.2, indicating that about 20% of the mitochondrial volume is occupied by granules in this case. Taking as a lower estimate a density 31% that of TCP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), a density of 3.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> mol/cm<sup>3</sup> is obtained for calcium phosphate within the granules. The equivalent liquid concentration based on the 20% vol estimate would be about 0.64 M, corresponding to 1.9 M calcium ions and 1.3 M phosphate ions. These concentrations are compatible with the solubility of calcium ions (e.g. from CaCl<sub>2</sub>) in aqueous solution but exceed by a factor of ~10<sup>4</sup> the solubility of Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in aqueous solution.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N Elad from the Department of Chemical Research Support for assistance with sample vitrification and T Finkel (NIH) for providing fibroblasts from MCU knockout mice.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Werner Kühlbrandt as the Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript using an advanced method to investigate the amount and distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mitochondrial matrix (CSTET). The authors have advanced CSTET as a useful approach to imaging frozen, unstained cells of greater thickness than specimens accessible to more widely applied electron cryotomography methods. The present study is therefore an important application. The combination of BF and DF shows a sensitivity to atomic number. In their images, the darkness of the mitochondrial matrix itself is attributed to ion concentration. Furthermore, the authors have applied EDX spectroscopy to identify the granule content.</p><p>By the CSTET approach, the authors demonstrate that mitochondria contain molar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and postulate that their participation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering depends on the phase separation between soluble and complexed Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The concept of amorphous Ca-Pi precipitates in the mitochondrial matrix dates back to the sixties. However, this is the first direct measurement of these stores, together with their quantification. The discovery of such important Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoirs, the fact that they appear to be MCU independent but dependent on membrane potential opens new avenues in cell biology and mitochondrial research.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The demonstration of MCU independence for granule formation is strong, but is there anything known about what happens to these granules in the absence of the Pi carrier, or when it is mutated?</p><p>2) Are these stores also retrieved in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that lacks MCU and where the ER is not a Ca<sup>2+</sup> store?</p><p>3) The demonstration of calcium and phosphorus signal by EDX for the mitochondrion shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is convincing. But given that the authors also observe increased density for the mitochondrial matrix compared to cytoplasm by CSTET and attribute this to ions, the study should show the EDX signal for a mitochondrion that does not possess dense granules. Also, can imaging and spectroscopy be performed directly on amorphous calcium phosphate for comparison?</p><p>4) In reporting observations on granule presence and distribution in normal cells and after treatment with doxorubicin or FCCP, the authors should give the number of mitochondria imaged and the number with/without granules or specific granule variations (e.g. size variation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is the only way a reader can assess whether the changes shown in the image examples are really of significance.</p><p>5) The importance of the JC-1 staining experiment to the paper overall should be made clear.</p><p>6) The number of replicates of experiments should be reported directly in the manuscript and not just in the <italic>eLife</italic> transparent report form.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29929.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] By the CSTET approach, the authors demonstrate that mitochondria contain molar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and postulate that their participation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering depends on the phase separation between soluble and complexed Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Our understanding is that a total deletion of SLC25A3 in mice is embryonic lethal. An inducible cardiac-specific knockout has been made (Kwong et al., Cell Death Diff.21, 1209-1217 (2014)), but we have not yet been able to grow beating cardiac cells on grids, complicating a comparison of wild-type and PiC knockouts in this cell type.</p><p>We did investigate a SLC25A3 knockdown in primary fibroblasts. The knockdown was strong as assessed by RT-PCR, and a SLC25A3 knockdown cell culture grown on glass slides showed slightly increased red fluorescence (hyperpolarization) after JC-1 staining compared to mock-transfected cells. Though we performed a survey of a SLC25A3 knockdown cell culture using CSTET, we cannot guarantee that all cells imaged had lower levels of the carrier, nor did we know the amount of residual carrier remaining even for cells in which SLC25A3 transcript was depleted. We observed elongated and apparently fusing mitochondria containing granules in the SLC25A3 knockdown cultures, but control cell cultures subjected to the knockout procedure with a random oligo did not look appreciably different. Due to the lack of insight provided by these experiments, we did not include them in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are these stores also retrieved in S. cerevisiae that lacks MCU and where the ER is not a Ca<sup>2+</sup> store?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not examine yeast because they are not amenable to CSTET without cryo-FIB milling, which is outside our current capabilities. However, others do not observe granules in yeast mitochondria inside cells (E Villa, personal communication, August, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The demonstration of calcium and phosphor-us signal by EDX for the mitochondrion shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is convincing. But given that the authors also observe increased density for the mitochondrial matrix compared to cytoplasm by CSET and attribute this to ions, the study should show the EDX signal for a mitochondrion that does not possess dense granules. Also, can imaging and spectroscopy be performed directly on amorphous calcium phosphate for comparison?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the EDX is performed on fully hydrated samples, there is insufficient signal-to-noise to distinguish soluble mitochondrial matrix contents from cytoplasm. Only when granules were present was a difference over background cytosol observed. To clarify, the following statement has been added to the Results section:</p><p>“Due to the high background in fully hydrated cells, we were not able to obtain sufficient EDX signal from mitochondrial regions lacking granules to compare soluble mitochondrial ion content to cytosol using this technique. This limitation was not surprising, considering that the concentration of matrix calcium ions would reach a maximum of only 100 mM at electrochemical equilibrium, and actual steady-state levels are considerably lower (Pozzan et al., 2000), whereas the concentrations of ions in solid deposits are much higher, as shown below.”</p><p>At the reviewer’s request, we have performed imaging and spectroscopy on amorphous calcium phosphate for comparison. The thin film of vitreous ice in which the amorphous calcium phosphate was embedded was suitable for cryo-TEM, so we performed the comparison in TEM mode. Results have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and the following text has been added to the Results:</p><p>“For comparison with granules formed in mitochondria, biomimetic amorphous calcium phosphate particles were prepared in solution as described (Habraken et al., 2013). […] The general features and appearance of the mitochondrial and synthetic granules are similar, as are the EDX spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,J</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In reporting observations on granule presence and distribution in normal cells and after treatment with doxorubicin or FCCP, the authors should give the number of mitochondria imaged and the number with/without granules or specific granule variations (e.g. size variation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is the only way a reader can assess whether the changes shown in the image examples are really of significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the accounting that the reviewers requested and added the information to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The importance of the JC-1 staining experiment to the paper overall should be made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentence has been added to clarify:</p><p>“This experiment demonstrates that correlative fluorescence/CSTET studies are feasible but also emphasizes that fluorescent sensors may perturb organelle chemistry and morphology, effects that are readily seen in CSTET.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The number of replicates of experiments should be reported directly in the manuscript and not just in the eLife transparent report form.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the accounting that the reviewers requested and added the information to the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
