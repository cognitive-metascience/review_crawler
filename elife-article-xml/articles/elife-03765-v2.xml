Here, we use genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to directly probe the role of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in modulating calcineurin activity dynamics in insulin-secreting MIN6 β-cells. We show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations induce distinct temporal patterns of calcineurin activity in the cytosol and plasma membrane vs at the ER and mitochondria in these cells. Furthermore, we found that these differential calcineurin activity patterns are determined by variations in the subcellular distribution of calmodulin (CaM), indicating that CaM plays an active role in shaping both the spatial and temporal aspects of calcineurin signaling.

When calcium ions are used for these communications, the concentration of the ions typically rises and falls in a wave-like pattern. The size and shape of these ‘calcium waves’ contains information that is needed by organs as diverse as the heart and the brain.</p><p>Most cells detect calcium waves using a sensor molecule called calmodulin. This, in turn, activates an enzyme called calcineurin. However, relatively little is known about the ways in which calcium waves shape the activity of calcineurin, even though calcium signaling is very common.</p><p>Mehta et al. have now clarified this relationship by studying how calcium ions affect the activity of calcineurin molecules inside pancreatic cells. The response of calcineurin to calcium depends on position inside the cell. In the cytosol and at the plasma membrane that encloses the cell, calcium waves trigger a very fast ‘step-like’ increase in calcineurin activity. By contrast, at the surface of certain organelles within the cell, the calcium waves cause the calcineurin activity to rise and fall in a wave-like pattern.</p><p>Experiments designed to identify the molecular mechanism behind this difference revealed that the answer lies in the distribution of calmodulin, the intermediate between calcium and calcineurin. At the surface of organelles, there is less calmodulin available to activate calcineurin than in the cytosol or at the plasma membrane. As a result, calcineurin activity in the vicinity of organelles is vulnerable to being canceled out by the actions of other enzymes. When more calmodulin is available, this canceling out does not occur, which is how wave-like input can lead to step-like output.</p><p>By identifying the mechanism by which a single signal—a calcium wave—generates distinct responses in the same target molecule—calcineurin—depending on subcellular location, Mehta et al. have identified a process that is relevant to a wide range of biological systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03765.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03765.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK073368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Director's Pioneer Award, DP1 CA174423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of calcium waves to exert different effects on calcineurin activity depending on subcellular location is mediated by the distribution of calmodulin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is a ubiquitous and universal intracellular signal whose remarkable biological versatility is a product of diverse patterns of spatial and temporal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Thomas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>), most notably in the form of repetitive, transient elevations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. In general, oscillatory signals are thought to function as a critical biological regulator by allowing a single message to encode multiple types of information through variations in the frequency, amplitude, and spatial characteristics of the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheong and Levchenko, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ganesan and Zhang, 2012</xref>), thereby promoting specificity in the regulation of downstream targets. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in particular are known to regulate numerous processes including gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Negulescu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lewis, 2003</xref>), exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tse et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pasti et al., 2001</xref>), and excitation-contraction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Viatchenko-Karpinski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maltsev and Lakatta, 2007</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations have been shown to significantly enhance the specificity and efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kupzig et al., 2005</xref>). Cells are primarily dependent on a single effector protein, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor calmodulin (CaM), to transduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM sits at the epicenter of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, modulating the activity of a vast array of target proteins throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Persechini and Stemmer, 2002</xref>). CaM is also thought to play a prominent role in the decoding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, largely via the differential activation of target proteins such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Song et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parekh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Slavov et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One of the major targets of CaM in almost all eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hilioti and Cunningham, 2003</xref>), calcineurin is involved in regulating diverse physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, as well as gene expression, secretion, immune function, learning, and memory (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rusnak and Mertz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aramburu et al., 2004</xref>). However, the precise spatiotemporal regulation of calcineurin signaling remains poorly understood. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations have previously been shown to enhance calcineurin-mediated transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tomida et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), and studies have also shown that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillatory frequency is a critical determinant of calcineurin-dependent hypertrophic signaling in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</xref>) and long-term depression in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mehta and Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujii et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and calcineurin signaling has yet to be elucidated. Similarly, calcineurin dephosphorylates multiple target proteins located throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cameron et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cereghetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tandan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bollo et al., 2010</xref>), and although spatial compartmentalization is suspected to play an important role in regulating calcineurin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heineke and Ritter, 2012</xref>), this phenomenon has yet to be directly examined.</p><p>Both Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and calcineurin signaling are known to play important roles in pancreatic β-cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are responsible for driving the pulsatile secretion of insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hellman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2008</xref>), and the chronic inhibition of calcineurin, which is a common form of immunosuppressive therapy, is often accompanied by the onset of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heisel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chakkera and Mandarino, 2013</xref>). In the present study, we use a variety of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters to directly investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcineurin signaling in response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in MIN6 β-cells. We were able to observe distinct subcellular patterns of calcineurin activity in the cytosol and plasma membrane, where calcineurin appeared to integrate the oscillatory input, vs at the ER and mitochondrial surfaces, where calcineurin activity was observed to oscillate. Furthermore, an exploration of the molecular determinants involved in regulating calcineurin activity revealed that significant differences in the subcellular distribution of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are responsible for generating these discrete activity patterns. Our findings provide the first evidence that oscillatory signals are capable of differentially regulating calcineurin activity and suggest a more active role for CaM in transducing oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct zones of subcellular calcineurin activity in MIN6 cells</title><p>To investigate the spatiotemporal regulation of calcineurin signaling in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in β-cells, we engineered an improved version of our previously described FRET-based calcineurin activity reporter (CaNAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman and Zhang, 2008</xref>) by optimizing the donor and acceptor fluorescent protein pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We then targeted this reporter, called CaNAR2, to the cytosol (cytoCaNAR2), plasma membrane (pmCaNAR2), mitochondrial outer membrane (mitoCaNAR2), and ER surface (erCaNAR2) via in-frame fusion with a C-terminal nuclear export signal (NES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ullman et al., 1997</xref>), an N-terminal motif derived from Lyn kinase (Lyn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao and Zhang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Depry et al., 2011</xref>), an N-terminal motif derived from DAKAP1a (DAKAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DiPilato et al., 2004</xref>), and an N-terminal motif derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Szczesna-Skorupa et al., 1998</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>).

We have seen previously that the FRET signal from CaNAR, which is based on calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of nuclear-factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), is not easily reversed and can remain elevated even after cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> has returned to basal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman and Zhang, 2008</xref>). Indeed, these observations appear to confirm previous reports suggesting that calcineurin and NFAT behave as signal integrators to form a working memory of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, owing to the rapid dephosphorylation and slow rephosphorylation kinetics of NFAT family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tomida et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colella et al., 2008</xref>). To our surprise, however, mitochondrial and ER-targeted CaNAR2 both exhibited far more reversible responses to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This difference was particularly striking for erCaNAR2, which exhibited almost perfect calcineurin activity oscillations upon TEA stimulation. Furthermore, these response patterns were independent of the CaNAR expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that they reflect genuine differences in endogenous calcineurin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PKA opposes localized calcineurin signaling at the ER</title><p>Our findings suggest the existence of two discrete subcellular zones (e.g., cytosol/plasma membrane and ER/mitochondria) with distinct calcineurin signaling activities in MIN6 β-cells. We therefore investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for defining these differential signaling zones. In particular, we focused on the reversibility of the CaNAR response at the ER surface, which suggested that calcineurin activity within this region of the cell is being precisely balanced by the action of endogenous kinases. A number of kinases have been shown to re-phosphorylate NFAT (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hogan et al., 2003</xref>) and are thus potentially capable of reversing the response from CaNAR.

This reporter features a modified version of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding sequence from avian smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase that binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of 2 nM. Calcineurin has been shown to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM with sub-nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hubbard and Klee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quintana et al., 2005</xref>), therefore we reasoned that BSCaM-2 should offer a fair approximation of how much Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is locally accessible by calcineurin. Our model predicts that free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is less abundant in the vicinity of the ER compared with the bulk cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, left), and indeed we observed a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) FRET response when BSCaM-2 was tethered to the ER surface than when it was able to diffuse freely through the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that less Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is present near the ER. These responses are similar to those observed by Teruel and colleagues, who reported smaller increases in free nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels compared with the cytosol in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teruel et al., 2000</xref>). Our results also appear to reflect actual differences in subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels as opposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM buffering, given that biosensor expression levels did not appear to affect the FRET responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). More importantly, we found that overexpressing mCherry-tagged CaM was able to rescue most of the difference between the ER and cytosolic FRET responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, ‘ER+CaM’).</p><p>Our model suggests that lower levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM will result in weaker calcineurin activation near the ER surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, red and green curves), which would in turn translate into lower levels of calcineurin activity that are more susceptible to antagonism by PKA activity. To test this model directly, we reasoned that if calcineurin activity is in fact being affected by local Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels, it should then be possible to generate cytosol-like CaNAR responses with erCaNAR2 by overexpressing CaM. Remarkably, combining mCherry-tagged CaM overexpression with the application of repeated, KCl-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in CaNAR-expressing cells reveals that this is indeed the case. In contrast to cells expressing erCaNAR2 alone, which exhibit oscillatory FRET responses in response to repeated KCl stimulation and washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), the co-expression of CaM-mCherry alongside erCaNAR2 clearly results in integrated calcineurin activity responses similar to those seen in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Conversely, reducing the amount of available Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM should lead to ER-like CaNAR oscillations in the cytosol. Indeed, pretreating cells with a low dose (20 μM) of the CaM antagonist W7 gave rise to oscillatory responses from cytoCaNAR2, in contrast to integrating responses in cells lacking W7 pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref>). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that free concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are limiting near the ER surface and thus significantly modulate the local, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation-induced calcineurin activity dynamics in this subcellular region.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The spatiotemporal regulation of calcineurin signaling has come under increased scrutiny of late. Recently, calcineurin responses in cortical neurons treated with the amyloid-β peptide were shown to differ subcellularly, with more rapid calcineurin activation occurring in dendritic spines than in the cytosol and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Calcineurin dynamics are also predicted to differ significantly within the dyadic cleft and cytosol in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</xref>). In keeping with these findings, our investigation revealed subcellular differences in the temporal pattern of calcineurin activity in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in pancreatic β-cells. Specifically, cytosolic and plasma membrane calcineurin activity was observed to integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations evoked intermittent, oscillating calcineurin activity at the ER and mitochondria. Given the wide variety of cellular functions regulated by calcineurin signaling and the significant role of subcellular compartments in modulating signaling molecule behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mehta and Zhang, 2010</xref>), this phenomenon is likely to shape calcineurin activity patterns in other cell types as well.</p><p>Our investigation into the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcineurin signaling turns on the use of a pair of FRET-based biosensors, each giving distinct responses based on its specific properties and thereby offering a multifaceted view of calcineurin behavior in living cells. The CaNAR family, including CaNAR2 and its precursor CaNAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman and Zhang, 2008</xref>), utilizes the well-characterized dephosphorylation of NFAT to report on the substrate-level dynamics of calcineurin activity and is sensitive to multiple cellular factors, such as both phosphatase and kinase activity. We also generated CaNARi, which reports on the activation of calcineurin upon the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. The CaNARi response is exclusively determined by the intrinsic affinities between Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM, and calcineurin, and CaNARi revealed largely uniform subcellular calcineurin activation patterns during Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. On the other hand, CaNAR was able to detect clear subcellular variations in calcineurin activity, which stems from the fact that CaNAR monitors the net endogenous calcineurin activity at each location. The enzymatic nature of CaNAR, wherein calcineurin dephosphorylates many probe molecules, also makes it more sensitive for detecting weak calcineurin signals. However, given the somewhat peculiar dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation behavior of NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tomida et al., 2003</xref>), CaNAR may not reflect calcineurin activity towards all targets. Additional approaches, including redesigned CaNARs, are therefore needed to provide a more complete picture.</p><p>The differential calcineurin activity dynamics suggest that different cellular compartments are tuned for regulating distinct calcineurin targets. For example, mice specifically lacking calcineurin in β-cells show impaired insulin production and decreased expression of several critical genes, all of which are regulated by the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heit et al., 2006</xref>). The efficient activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations requires periods of sustained calcineurin activity to produce a cytoplasmic pool of dephosphorylated NFAT that is available for nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tomida et al., 2003</xref>). Correspondingly, the sustained, integrating calcineurin activity patterns we observed in the cytosolic and plasma membrane regions of MIN6 cells indicated that this signaling domain is optimized for the oscillatory control of transcriptional regulation. In fact, the plasma membrane may play a particularly crucial role in promoting calcineurin/NFAT signaling. The scaffolding protein AKAP79/150 has specifically been shown to recruit calcineurin into a signaling complex located at the C-terminus of the L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC) in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oliveria et al., 2007</xref>), and the presence of anchored calcineurin within this complex was required for proper NFAT-dependent nuclear signaling in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oliveria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2012a</xref>). Both Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the L-type VGCC and AKAP anchoring of calcineurin are also important for insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bokvist et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wiser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lester et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hinke et al., 2012</xref>), therefore it is possible that an AKAP-calcineurin-VGCC complex is similarly involved in calcineurin/NFAT signaling in β-cells.</p><p>In contrast to the cytosol and plasma membrane, however, the oscillatory calcineurin activity we observed near the ER and mitochondria in MIN6 cells suggests weak and intermittent NFAT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tomida et al., 2003</xref>). As such, transcriptional signaling via NFAT is likely not the primary function of calcineurin in these subcellular regions. Our previous findings indicate that oscillatory signals can spatially restrict enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ni et al., 2010</xref>); thus, calcineurin activity oscillations may alternatively be directed towards local ER and mitochondrial targets. For instance, calcineurin was recently shown to dephosphorylate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chaperone calnexin and interact with the ER kinase PERK to modulate protein folding and ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bollo et al., 2010</xref>), while calcineurin and PERK also jointly regulate insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cereghetti et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Slupe et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, Drp1-mediated mitochondrial division involves direct contact between the outer mitochondrial membrane and ER tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). It is conceivable that such contact points are hotspots for local calcineurin signaling; the ER and mitochondria are in fact characterized by extensive physical and functional coupling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Brito and Scorrano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Further analyses revealed that PKA, which opposes calcineurin activity towards Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>), antagonizes calcineurin at the ER and helps give rise to calcineurin activity oscillations. Curiously, inhibiting PKA in TEA-stimulated MIN6 cells led to steadily increasing ER calcineurin activity, despite cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> apparently returning to basal levels. This effect was blocked by calcineurin inhibition and may be due to residual activity from ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels or to passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camello et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Szlufcik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammadi et al., 2013</xref>). However, PKA activity was not sufficient to produce calcineurin activity oscillations, as even saturating amounts of PKA activity did not lead to CaNAR oscillations in the cytosol. AKAPs may be involved in locally promoting the PKA-mediated antagonism of calcineurin signaling, and DAKAP1 (AKAP121), which binds calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrenica et al., 2009</xref>), in fact targets to both the mitochondrial and ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma and Taylor, 2008</xref>). AKAP79 is also known to anchor PKA and calcineurin to the plasma membrane in β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lester et al., 2001</xref>), yet calcineurin responses nevertheless appear integrative in this region. We also detected less free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM near the ER surface compared with the cytosol, and CaM overexpression led to integrating rather than oscillating ER calcineurin activity, whereas inhibiting CaM produced the opposite effect in the cytosol. Both of these results are consistent with a model in which limited access to CaM at the ER leads to weak calcineurin activity. Since excess calcineurin activity can lead to β-cell dysfunction and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernal-Mizrachi et al., 2010</xref>), often involving ER stress and apoptosis, this combination of PKA activity and limited access to CaM may help constrain local calcineurin signals within physiologically permissible limits.</p><p>Our results clearly show that the distribution of CaM directly determines subcellular calcineurin activity during β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. CaM acts as both a dedicated regulatory subunit and a promiscuous binding partner depending on the specific target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saucerman and Bers, 2012</xref>), and whereas promiscuous CaM is free to associate with and dissociate from target proteins as a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, dedicated CaM remains bound irrespective of changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Subcellular variations in the amounts of dedicated CaM targets may therefore affect the levels of promiscuous CaM that can activate calcineurin in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding kinetics of CaM limit its range of action and potentially require CaM to be activated within Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saucerman and Bers, 2012</xref>). In β-cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are often driven by VGCCs in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hellman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bokvist et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mears, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2008</xref>), and CaM has been found to be locally enriched near these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mori, 2004</xref>), ready to be activated by local Ca<sup>2+</sup>. AKAP79 has also been shown to bind CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gold et al., 2011</xref>), thereby serving as another potential source for local Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and also perhaps lowering the ability of anchored PKA to antagonize local calcineurin activity. However, additional studies are needed to unravel the precise mechanisms underlying the spatial differences in CaM levels.</p><p>In neurons and cardiomyocytes, calcineurin is implicated to behave as an integrator or peak number counter in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Song et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujii et al., 2013</xref>). In these cells, rapid (i.e., &gt; 1 s<sup>−1</sup>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, combined with the slow dissociation of calcineurin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, facilitate persistent calcineurin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Song et al., 2008</xref>). This also engenders the preferential activation of calcineurin at lower oscillatory frequencies compared with other targets (e.g., CaMKII), resulting in frequency decoding. In β-cells, on the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are slow (i.e., &lt; 1 min<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hellman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2008</xref>), and our results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM fully dissociates from calcineurin in between each Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak, suggesting that frequency modulation may not be a prominent feature in β-cell calcineurin signaling. Rather, we found that CaM plays a critical role in spatial signaling under these conditions, which has been hinted at previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teruel et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the frequency decoding observed in neurons and cardiomyocytes is based entirely on the intrinsic kinetics of CaM-target interactions where CaM plays a passive role. Conversely, our analyses highlight a novel mechanism whereby cells utilize CaM to actively encode spatial information, which is then decoded by calcineurin to ensure that oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are transduced properly within specific local contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>CaNAR2 construction</title><p>Each CaNAR variant was generated by sandwiching the substrate domain of CaNAR1, which corresponds to amino acids 1–297 from the N-terminus of NFAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman and Zhang, 2008</xref>), between different cyan (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) variants.

All time-courses were normalized by dividing the emission ratio or, in the case of RCaMP, the intensity at each time point by the basal value immediately preceding drug addition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Loren Looger, Fan Pan, Takeharu Nagai, and Anthony Persechini for generously providing plasmids used in this study.

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this time.</p><p>The research is novel, with sophisticated use of FRET reporters. The finding that calcineurin activity is restricted in the vicinity of the ER/mitochondria is interesting and unexpected. However, there were a number of substantive concerns raised by the reviewers that mean that substantial revision, including new experiments, would be required before further consideration. These concerns are detailed below. Regrettably, <italic>eLife</italic> policy is to reject papers requiring major revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The authors show that NFAT phosphorylation state integrates calcium waves in the cytosol but oscillates with calcium waves at the ER (measured with a calmodulin reporter). Oscillation is expected if each wave of calcium-dependent dephosphorylation (by calcineurin) is fully reversed (by PKA) during the ensuing low calcium period, while integration is expected if reversal is incomplete. Differential NFAT phosphorylation kinetics might be explained if PKA were less active in the cytosol than ER. However, the authors found that PKA activity oscillations are of similar magnitude at the ER and cytosol, so this explanation is unlikely. Alternatively, less calcineurin may be activated near the ER, so it may be more readily antagonized by PKA. Calmodulin is known to be much less abundant than its effectors. To test whether calmodulin is limiting for calcineurin activation near the ER, they over-expressed calmodulin and found that this switched ER calcineurin activity from oscillating to integrating modes. Based on this, the authors conclude that calmodulin competition explains the observations. Another finding is that, even though NFAT phosphorylation kinetics are different in cytosol and at ER, calcineurin conformation changes, which require calcium-calmodulin, oscillate in both localizations.</p><p>1) Given that calmodulin is limiting, over-expressing calmodulin-binding reporters will likely upset the normal balance. How does CaNAR2 level compare with endogenous NFAT? If CaNAR2 is more highly expressed at ER than cytosol, that could explain the difference. Similarly, the conformation detector, CaNARi, could be expressed at lower level. Expression levels need to be measured and confirmed to be equivalent.</p><p>2) Roles for calcium stores in the ER should be excluded, e.g, using appropriate drugs.</p><p>3) The co-oscillation of PKA and calcium is not unexpected, but hinders clear interpretation of the data. The results would be more compelling if PKA activity was buffered to prevent oscillation.</p><p>4) Effect of over-expressing calmodulin should be complemented by inhibiting calmodulin. Low doses of W7 or calmodulin siRNA should cause oscillations of NFAT phosphorylation in the cytosol as well as the ER.</p><p>5) It is not clear from the model why the calcineurin conformation sensor oscillates at the ER. The magnitude of FRET oscillation is similar at ER and cytosol in the traces shown. If calmodulin were limiting, less magnitude would be expected. The explanation is unclear and needs to be resolved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>The work of Zhang et al attempts to analyze spatial differences in calcium oscillation profiles with intact beta cells. The authors chose pancreatic beta cells likely because of their known ability to produce massive calcium oscillations, although the connection to insulin secretion was not investigated in this work. The authors employ improved and locally acting sensors (CaNAR2 and CaNARi) to measure calcineurin activity, BSCaM-2 to sense Ca/CaM levels, and an intensiometric genetically encoded calcium sensor. One of the major findings in the present work is that calcineurin oscillations distant from ER membranes are less dynamic ('integrating') than those close to the ER.</p><p>1) I don't understand why the mitochondria region differs from the cytosol response.</p><p>2) I also wonder if the calcium oscillations close to the plasma or the ER membrane, respectively, differ in a similar way as the calcineurin responses. Strong support comes from experiments where CaM is overexpressed and the ER-located sensor mimics the cytosol and plasma membrane location. What is missing is the alternative experiment, where calcineurin should be blocked by modest levels of W-7. This should lead to perfect oscillations of calcineurin everywhere.</p><p>The difference in the oscillation patterns could also be driven by activities in the respective membranes such as calcium influx close to the plasma membrane or more efficient calcium uptake by SERCA close to the ER. These possibilities have not been investigated and are not discussed.</p><p>3) Similarly, effects of the PKA and PKC inhibitors might strongly influence calcium channels including the IP3 receptor and might therefore change the threshold calcium level required for successful oscillations. The hypothesis that there is calcium leakage close to the ER is a weak explanation for the steady increase in calcineurin activity after Goe6983 and H89.</p><p>4) The model presented is based on the fact that Ca/CaM activates calcineurin. However, it was previously shown that activation of non-calcium-dependent phosphatases such as PP1 suffice to induce calcium oscillations in the absence of depolarization, likely by changing the phosphorylation level of the IP3 receptor (Reither et al., 2013). Is calcineurin activation also inducing calcium signals? If this were the case, the model would need to be much more complicated.</p><p>5) I trust the statement that CaM might be scarce in some cells but how abundant is it in Min6 cells? At least an estimate from the transcriptome should have been provided as the conclusion on subcellular differences in Ca/CaM is based on the scarcity assumption. Further, if the CaM concentration were indeed in the sub 100 nM range, then overexpression of a CaM binding protein (usually in the micromolar range) will definitely buffer CaM close to its location on the ER membrane. There is a chance that either there is enough CaM or if not that the sensor produces an artifact. I fear the authors can't win on this one. Was BSCaM-2 also attached to the plasma membrane and used to determine the CaM concentration there?</p><p>In conclusion, although very interesting, there are too many open questions and too many experiments that needed to be done to accept this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03765.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>A number of changes, including several new experiments, have been incorporated into the new submission, and we believe that these changes fully address the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>1) Given that calmodulin is limiting, over-expressing calmodulin-binding reporters will likely upset the normal balance.

Similarly, the conformation detector, CaNARi, could be expressed at lower level. Expression levels need to be measured and confirmed to be equivalent</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raises an important point regarding the biosensor expression levels. Unfortunately, after searching the literature and consulting with outside experts, we were unable to find any concrete data on the endogenous expression levels of the various NFAT isoforms. Nevertheless, we used purified YFP to calibrate the intensity counts generated on our microscope, and based on this calibration, we were able to estimate that the intracellular concentration of cytoCaNAR2 ranged between approximately 45 nM and 4 μM in our experiments. Importantly, we also found that the response patterns reported by each subcellularly targeted CaNAR2 variant held steady over similar ranges of biosensor expression levels, and the Results section has been updated to reflect this finding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, we found no meaningful correlation between the expression levels of the calcineurin conformation sensor (CaNARi) or the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM probe (BSCaM-2) and their observed FRET ratio changes. Based on these data, we conclude that biosensor expression did not influence our reported observations.</p><p><italic>2) Roles for calcium stores in the ER should be excluded, e.g. using appropriate drugs</italic>.</p><p>We investigated this using subcellularly targeted versions of GCaMP3 co-transfected along with diffusible RCaMP, and we observed no differences between local Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the cytosol, at the ER surface, or even at the plasma membrane compared with global Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. The ER and cytosol data have been added to the revised manuscript. Furthermore, although ER-targeted GCaMP3 showed that basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels near the ER drift upwards during oscillations, this basal drift does not impact the erCaNAR response, suggesting that ER stores are not playing a significant role in the differential calcineurin activities. We did detect a minor difference in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude at the ER surface versus the cytosol, and the manuscript has been updated to reflect this observation; however, the fact that altering calmodulin alone, either via overexpression or by W7 inhibition, can change the calcineurin activity patterns points to a more direct role for calmodulin.</p><p><italic>3) The co-oscillation of PKA and calcium is not unexpected, but hinders clear interpretation of the data. The results would be more compelling if PKA activity was buffered to prevent oscillation</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with experiments in which the PKA activity was clamped at a steady level. To do so, we pretreated cells with the pan-phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, which led to maximal PKA activity, and then treated these cells with repeated doses of KCl followed by wash out. We observed no differences in the CaNAR response patterns under these conditions compared with conditions in which PKA activity was allowed to oscillate – i.e., cytoCaNAR2 had an integrating response and erCaNAR2 had an oscillating response.</p><p><italic>4) Effect of over-expressing calmodulin should be complemented by inhibiting calmodulin. Low doses of W7 or calmodulin siRNA should cause oscillations of NFAT phosphorylation in the cytosol as well as the ER</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment. We indeed found that pretreating MIN6 cells with a submaximal dose (20 μM) of W7, followed by repeated doses of KCl, produces completely oscillatory responses from cytoCaNAR2. This new data has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) It is not clear from the model why the calcineurin conformation sensor oscillates at the ER. The magnitude of FRET oscillation is similar at ER and cytosol in the traces shown. If calmodulin were limiting, less magnitude would be expected. The explanation is unclear and needs to be resolved</italic>.</p><p>Given that the activation, and hence the conformation, of calcineurin is strictly controlled by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are still expected to induce oscillatory calcineurin activation even if less calcineurin is being activated. In addition, because the FRET response from this sensor is small, it may not be able to reliably report differences in calcineurin activation amplitude. Nevertheless, based on this comment, we compared the response amplitudes more closely and found that the responses from mitochondrial and ER-targeted CaNARi were in fact smaller on average than those from cytosolic and plasma membrane CaNARi. These data are now summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> of the revised manuscript. Although the difference was not statistically significant, the observed trend supports our model, and we thank the reviewer for prompting this closer look at our data.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>1) I don't understand why the mitochondria region differs from the cytosol response</italic>.</p><p>We have chosen to focus on the different activity dynamics between the ER surface and the cytosol. The activity dynamics on the outer mitochondrial membrane were similar to what was observed at the ER, and the underlying mechanism(s) will be examined in future studies.</p><p><italic>2) I also wonder if the calcium oscillations close to the plasma or the ER membrane, respectively, differ in a similar way as the calcineurin responses. Strong support comes from experiments where CaM is overexpressed and the ER-located sensor mimics the cytosol and plasma membrane location.

These possibilities have not been investigated and are not discussed</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned above in response to reviewer 1, we observed no differences between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the cytosol, at the ER surface, or at the plasma membrane (measured using subcellularly targeted GCaMP3) and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (measured concurrently using diffusible RCaMP), suggesting that local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not the determining factor for the differential calcineurin responses. The GCaMP/RCaMP curves for the cytosol and ER have been added to the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment. As mentioned above, we indeed found that pretreating MIN6 cells with a submaximal dose (20 μM) of W7, followed by repeatedly adding and washing out KCl, produces completely oscillatory responses from cytoCaNAR2. These new data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Similarly, effects of the PKA and PKC inhibitors might strongly influence calcium channels including the IP3 receptor and might therefore change the threshold calcium level required for successful oscillations. The hypothesis that there is calcium leakage close to the ER is a weak explanation for the steady increase in calcineurin activity after Goe6983 and H89</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the inhibition of PKA or PKC could alter the behavior of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. For example, PKA has been shown to stimulate the activity of both the L-type VGCC and the IP3 receptor; thus, inhibiting PKA should lead to decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which is in fact what we observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Conversely, PKC has been shown to inhibit both of these channels, and we also see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> that inhibiting PKC leads to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and, potentially, increased calcineurin activity (see responses to reviewer 1 above). Whereas the increase in calcineurin activity after PKC inhibition is clearly due to the elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we attributed the increased calcineurin activity after PKA inhibition to Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak because of the decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and the likely decrease in IP3R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, though the latter may still be having an effect.</p><p><italic>4) The model presented is based on the fact that Ca/CaM activates calcineurin. However, it was previously shown that activation of non-calcium-dependent phosphatases such as PP1 suffice to induce calcium oscillations in the absence of depolarization, likely by changing the phosphorylation level of the IP3 receptor (Reither et al., 2013). Is calcineurin activation also inducing calcium signals? If this were the case, the model would need to be much more complicated</italic>.</p><p>Calcineurin has been shown to interact with ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels, such as the IP3 receptor, and may potentially modulate their activity, though this remains somewhat controversial. In addition, calcineurin is known to inhibit influx through plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Therefore, it is more likely that calcineurin is modulating existing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals rather than inducing them per se. It is possible that calcineurin exerts other effects to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; however, there is currently no firm evidence that would lead us to pursue this direction.</p><p><italic>5) I trust the statement that CaM might be scarce in some cells but how abundant is it in Min6 cells? At least an estimate from the transcriptome should have been provided as the conclusion on subcellular differences in Ca/CaM is based on the scarcity assumption. Further, if the CaM concentration were indeed in the sub 100 nM range, then overexpression of a CaM binding protein (usually in the micromolar range) will definitely buffer CaM close to its location on the ER membrane. There is a chance that either there is enough CaM or if not that the sensor produces an artifact. I fear the authors can't win on this one. Was BSCaM-2 also attached to the plasma membrane and used to determine the CaM concentration there? In conclusion, although very interesting, there are too many open questions and too many experiments that needed to be done to accept this paper</italic>.</p><p>We have not used this BSCaM-2-based approach to determine free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM concentrations; rather, our aim was simply to compare the relative Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels in different compartments, as has been previously done using these probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teruel et al., 2000</xref>). To our knowledge, this type of information is difficult to obtain using other methods. Both cytosolic and plasma membrane-targeted BSCaM-2 showed identical responses (80.61 ± 0.03% vs. 79.15 ± 0.04% FRET ratio change), whereas the response at the ER surface is lower (50.74 ± 0.03%), suggesting that the free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM level is lower in this compartment. No downstream signaling processes were monitored in the BSCaM-2 experiments, thereby limiting the potential for buffering effects, and we also found no correlation between probe expression and the FRET response over a large range of expression levels, which we would have expected to see were the biosensor levels impacting the results. Furthermore, overexpressing CaM or inhibiting CaM using W7 clearly modulated the ER and cytosolic CaNAR responses, respectively, not to mention the fact that overexpressing CaM rescued the BSCaM-2 response at the ER surface (70.03 ± 0.03%). These observations in particular strongly suggest that free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels are limiting near the ER surface, resulting in weaker calcineurin activation at this location. Similar observations were made by Teruel and colleagues, who reported smaller increases in free nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels compared with the cytosol in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teruel et al., 2000</xref>). We have now cited their study in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
