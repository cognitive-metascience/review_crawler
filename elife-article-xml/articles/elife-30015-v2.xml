Here, we identify a new function of Cdc48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1. We demonstrate that Cdc48 integrates the activities of these two DUBs, which are themselves ubiquitylated. First, Cdc48 promotes proteolysis of Ubp12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. Second, loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2 and thereby facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 inhibiting fusion. Thus, Cdc48 synergistically regulates the ubiquitylation status of Fzo1, allowing to control the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion. In conclusion, we unravel a new cascade of ubiquitylation events, comprising Cdc48 and two DUBs, fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of Fzo1.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30015.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are little compartments within a cell that produce the energy needed for most biological processes. Each cell possesses several mitochondria, which can fuse together and then break again into smaller units. This fusion process is essential for cellular health.</p><p>Two proteins in the cell have a major role in controlling mitochondrial fusion: Ubp12 and Ubp2. Ubp12 prevents fusion, while Ubp2 activates it. These molecules carry out their roles by acting on a third protein called mitofusin, which is a key gatekeeper of the fusion mechanism.</p><p>Cells often ‘tag’ proteins with small molecules called ubiquitin to change the protein’s role and how it interacts with other cellular structures. Depending on how they are ‘tagged’, mitofusins can exist in two forms. One type of tagging means that the protein then promotes fusion of the mitochondria; the other leads to the mitofusin being destroyed by the cell.</p><p>It is still unclear how Ubp12, Ubp2 and the different forms of mitofusins interact with each other to finely control mitochondrial fusion. Here, Simões, Schuster et al. clarify these interactions in yeast and show how these proteins are themselves regulated.</p><p>Ubp2 promotes fusion by attaching to the mitofusin that is labeled to be destroyed, and removing this tag: the mitofusin will then not be degraded, and can promote fusion. Ubp12 prevents fusion through two mechanisms. First, it can remove the ‘pro-fusion’ tag on the mitofusin that prompts mitochondrial fusion. Second, Simões, Schuster et al. now show that Ubp12 also inhibits Ubp2 and its fusion-promoting activity.</p><p>In turn, the experiments reveal that a master protein called Cdc48 can control the entire Ubp12-Ubp2-mitofusin pathway. Cdc48 directly represses Ubp12 and therefore its anti-fusion activity. This inhibition also leaves Ubp2 free to stimulate fusion through its action on mitofusin.</p><p>The molecules involved in controlling mitochondrial fusion in yeast are very similar to the ones in people. In humans, improper regulation of mitofusins causes an incurable disease of the nerves and the brain called Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2A. Understanding how the fusion of mitochondria is controlled can lead to new drug discoveries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Fzo1</kwd><kwd>Ubp2</kwd><kwd>Ubp12</kwd><kwd>Cdc48</kwd><kwd>fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES338/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escobar-Henriques</surname><given-names>Mafalda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universität zu Köln</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>German Excellence Initiative and Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escobar-Henriques</surname><given-names>Mafalda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB635</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escobar-Henriques</surname><given-names>Mafalda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1218TPA03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escobar-Henriques</surname><given-names>Mafalda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A signaling pathway—comprising a linear sequence of the ubiquitin-selective chaperone Cdc48/p97 and the deubiquitylases Ubp12 and Ubp2—synergistically regulates mitochondrial fusion, thereby fine-tuning ubiquitylation of the mitofusin Fzo1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fusion and fission events, modulated by a variety of post-translational modifiers including ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escobar-Henriques and Langer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Due to their pathological relevance, <italic>e.g.</italic> for Parkinson’s disease, these processes are subject to intense investigation. For example, Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation of mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) proteins modulates the elimination of the damaged organelles by mitophagy, or <italic>via</italic> mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDV) that fuse with the <italic>late</italic> endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugiura et al., 2014</xref>). Most fusion processes, including the Parkin-MDV pathway, rely on SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McLelland et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and of mitochondria depend on large dynamin-related GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escobar-Henriques and Anton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hu and Rapoport, 2016</xref>). In mitochondria, they are named mitofusins (Mfn1/Mfn2 in mammals, Fzo1 in yeast). Deficiencies in Mfn2 cause the type 2 subset of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the most common degenerative disorder of the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Züchner et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The ubiquitin-specific chaperone Cdc48/p97 is required to maintain mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esaki and Ogura, 2012</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of how Cdc48 regulates mitochondrial dynamics is not understood. Cdc48 is an essential AAA-ATPase and one of the most abundant proteins in the cell, which recognizes many ubiquitylated substrates and is involved in a myriad of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer and Weihl, 2014</xref>). Cdc48 segregates ubiquitylated substrates from protein complexes, or from membranes, thus allowing their proteolysis by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franz et al., 2014</xref>). For example, Cdc48 is important for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), modulates the turnover of mitochondrial OM proteins (OMMAD), participates in apoptosis responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laun et al., 2001</xref>) and mediates clearance of damaged lysosomes by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avci and Lemberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zattas and Hochstrasser, 2015</xref>). On the other hand, Cdc48 also binds E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases (DUBs) thereby regulating substrate ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer and Weihl, 2014</xref>).</p><p>DUBs are proteases that catalyze the reversion of the ubiquitylation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Love et al., 2007</xref>), critically contributing to ubiquitin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amerik and Hochstrasser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimura and Tanaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park and Ryu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swatek and Komander, 2016</xref>). DUBs activate ubiquitin by releasing it from ubiquitin precursor polypeptides but are also determinants for the modification status of ubiquitylated substrates, allowing to dampen ubiquitin-mediated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clague et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, DUBs are associated with a number of human diseases and represent promising drug targets, whose regulation and mechanism of action need to be explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heideker and Wertz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahtoe and Sixma, 2015</xref>). Two deubiquitylases, Ubp2 and Ubp12, were found to have opposite effects on mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that are recognized and cleaved by Ubp12 activate mitochondrial fusion. In contrast, other ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that instead are recognized and cleaved by Ubp2 target Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, although it is clear that ubiquitin is a double-faced regulator of mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escobar-Henriques and Langer, 2014</xref>), how Ubp2 and Ubp12 exert opposite effects on Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion remained poorly studied.</p><p>Here, we identify a role of Cdc48 in mitochondrial fusion, as part of a novel enzymatic cascade consisting of Cdc48, Ubp12 and Ubp2. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cdc48 promotes mitochondrial fusion and prevents Fzo1 turnover</title><p>Although it is clear that Cdc48 affects mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esaki and Ogura, 2012</xref>), the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The role of Cdc48 for mitochondrial morphology was investigated in the hypomorphic mutant <italic>cdc48-2</italic>, expressing GFP targeted to mitochondria. In this allele, Cdc48 is mutated for A547T, in its ATPase domain D2, whereas in the most commonly used <italic>cdc48-3</italic> strain, Cdc48 is instead mutated in R387K, in the D1 ATPase (C. Hickey and M. Hochstrasser, p. communication). Both <italic>cdc48-3</italic> and <italic>cdc48-2</italic> mutations impair typical Cdc48-dependent processes for transmembrane proteins, like ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hitchcock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latterich et al., 1995</xref>). We observed that <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells presented fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with the mitochondrial phenotypes observed upon impairment of the ATPase activity of Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esaki and Ogura, 2012</xref>). This suggested problems in mitochondrial fusion and prompted us to evaluate the role of Cdc48 on Fzo1, present at the outer membrane of mitochondria. Mitochondrial fusion is abolished in the absence of Fzo1 ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with mitochondrial fragmentation, we observed a decrease of Fzo1 ubiquitylation in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> mutant cells, when compared to wild-type (wt) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, black arrows). We have previously shown that pro-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 increases its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, the steady state levels of Fzo1 and its ubiquitylated forms were decreased in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and B</xref>), to a similar and not significantly different extent (data not shown). Consistent with the <italic>cdc48-2</italic> allele, the levels of Fzo1 were slightly decreased in the <italic>cdc48-3</italic> mutant or in cells deleted for the Cdc48 co-factors Npl4, Ufd1 and Ufd3/Doa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). It was previously shown that Ubc6, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, is degraded by the proteasome <italic>via</italic> ERAD, a process dependent on Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lenk et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we also analyzed the steady state levels of Ubc6 in the same <italic>CDC48</italic> mutant strains. As expected, and in contrast to Fzo1, the steady state levels of Ubc6 were increased upon impairment of Cdc48 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). This suggested that Cdc48 regulates Fzo1 by a mechanism different from OMMAD or ERAD. Since both Fzo1 and Ubc6 were mostly affected in the <italic>cdc48-2</italic> mutant, we decided to use this strain for further analysis. However, it is unclear why <italic>cdc48-2</italic> affects Ubc6 and Fzo1 stronger than <italic>cdc48-3</italic>. We investigated why <italic>cdc48-2</italic> mutant cells have lower levels of Fzo1, by testing with cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments if Cdc48 regulates Fzo1 stability. Moreover, to simultaneously test the role of the proteasome, we deleted the efflux pumps Snq2 and Pdr5. We observed that Fzo1 degradation was inhibited by the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating that the decreased levels of Fzo1 observed in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells were due to proteasome-dependent turnover of Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, proteasome inhibition did not affect Fzo1 turnover in wt cells consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escobar-Henriques et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, all these phenotypes could be rescued by expression of the wt Cdc48 protein but not by expression of the Cdc48<sup>A547T</sup> variant, mimicking the specific mutation in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In conclusion, Cdc48 is required to maintain the Fzo1 protein, thus promoting mitochondrial fusion events.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30015.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cdc48 regulates Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondrial morphology of <italic>CDC48</italic> mutant cells.

Given that stress conditions disrupt mitochondrial tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knorre et al., 2013</xref>), it was important to show that Cdc48 directly regulates Fzo1 and mitochondrial morphology. First, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Cdc48 physically interacted with Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We previously showed that the formation of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, black arrows), which are linked to lysine 398, requires previous ubiquitylation of its lysine 464 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, Fzo1 ubiquitylation is lost in the mutant Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed that the interaction between Cdc48 and the non-ubiquitylated variant Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), in agreement with ubiquitin being recognized by Cdc48. To assess the specificity of the <italic>cdc48-2</italic> effect on Fzo1 protein levels, we tested if this depended on Fzo1 ubiquitylation. Thus, the non-ubiquitylated variant Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> was used. We observed that the steady state levels of Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> were largely insensitive to the <italic>cdc48-2</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This points to a direct regulatory role of Cdc48 on Fzo1, only after its ubiquitylation. These pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 are recognized by Ubp12. In addition, we previously identified other ubiquitin forms on Fzo1, that inhibit fusion. They are removed by Ubp2 and can be detected only in the presence of the catalytically inactive variant Ubp2<sup>C745S</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Input, red arrows). Therefore, we investigated binding of Cdc48 to Fzo1 under these conditions, where both pro-fusion and anti-fusion forms are present. We noticed that despite the clear increase in ubiquitylation of Fzo1 upon Ubp2<sup>C745S</sup> expression (2.44 times), Cdc48 binding to Fzo1 was not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the additional presence of ubiquitin chains inhibiting fusion does not increase Cdc48 binding. Consistently, for the Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> variant, which in the presence of Ubp2<sup>C745S</sup> is ubiquitylated to a similar level as the wt protein (0.96 times, despite the absence of pro-fusion ubiquitylation), no binding to Cdc48 above background can be detected. Thus, similar to Ubp12, Cdc48 recognizes specifically the pro-fusion ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30015.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cdc48 specifically affects ubiquitylated Fzo1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Physical interaction between Cdc48 and ubiquitylated Fzo1.

Consistently, Ubp12 and Cdc48 also present opposing phenotypes regarding mitochondrial tubulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>]). Given that Cdc48 controls Ubp12 levels, we speculated that Cdc48 regulates mitochondrial morphology and Fzo1 <italic>via</italic> Ubp12. We monitored mitochondrial morphology in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells in presence or absence of <italic>UBP12</italic>, expressing mitochondrial-targeted GFP. Strikingly, deletion of <italic>UBP12</italic> in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells rescued mitochondrial tubulation, resembling Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Mitochondrial fusion is also required to maintain the cellular growth on respiratory media, <italic>i.e.</italic> media containing the non-fermentable carbon sources glycerol or lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hermann et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, to further support the physiological importance of Cdc48 and Ubp12, we analyzed the respiratory capacity of <italic>cdc48-2</italic> in presence or absence of <italic>UBP12</italic>. In agreement with restored tubulation of mitochondria, we observed that the growth defect of <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells at 37°C on lactate media could be improved upon deletion of <italic>UBP12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Given that Δ<italic>fzo1</italic> cells irreversibly loose mitochondrial DNA, we investigated if this is also the case for <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells. Consistent with the respiratory reversibility of <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells upon further deletion of <italic>UBP12</italic>, we observed that <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells did not lose mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Importantly, the respiratory defect of <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells could be complemented by expression of Cdc48 but not of Cdc48<sup>A547T</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Finally, <italic>cdc48-2</italic>Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells also showed improved ubiquitylation of Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Together, these results show that Cdc48 maintains Fzo1 ubiquitylation and activates mitochondrial fusion by downregulating Ubp12. However, two pieces of evidence suggest that Cdc48 might have other functions in this pathway, apart from regulating Ubp12. First, we observed that the physical interaction between Fzo1 and Cdc48 is not mediated by Ubp12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that Cdc48 directly recognizes ubiquitylated Fzo1.

Therefore, Ubp12 and Ubp2, which affect the stability of Fzo1 in opposite manners, are also interdependent. Next, we analyzed if Ubp2 and Ubp12 also presented other opposing and interdependent phenotypes related to ubiquitin. First, we analyzed cellular growth of cells lacking <italic>UBP2</italic>, <italic>UBP12</italic> or both, in the presence of sub-lethal doses of CHX, a phenotype commonly tested to monitor imbalances in ubiquitin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerlinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006</xref>).

We observed that indeed Ubp2 and Ubp12 had opposite phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the consistent interdependence of these two enzymes suggested a DUB hierarchy, which prompted us to test a possible regulation of the Ubp2 protein by Ubp12. We tested if Ubp2 is an unstable protein and whether Ubp12 is involved in its degradation, after inhibition of protein synthesis with CHX. The levels of genomically tagged Ubp2 decreased over time and Ubp2-turnover was regulated by Ubp12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Ubp2 interacted with Ubp12, suggesting a direct regulation between both DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We therefore investigated if Ubp2 could be ubiquitylated, in a Ubp12-dependent manner. After immunoprecipitation of Ubp2-Flag, and consistent with recent observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavellini et al., 2017</xref>), we observed the presence of slowly migrating forms of Ubp2 during electrophoresis, in wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>) but mostly in Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel).

To characterize the deubiquitylation reaction of Ubp12 in more detail, we analyzed the ubiquitin linkages on Fzo1 and Ubp2 accumulating in Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells. Overexpression of ubiquitin mutated in K48R strongly decreased Fzo1 and Ubp2 ubiquitylation, revealing that their ubiquitin chains are linked <italic>via</italic> K48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). However, the ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that destabilize it and inhibit fusion, which are not bound by Ubp12, are also K48-linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, differences in ubiquitin chains cannot explain why Ubp12 stabilizes its substrates. To further analyze Ubp12, its ubiquitin chain preference was tested using <italic>in vitro</italic> deubiquitylation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hospenthal et al., 2015</xref>). As a substrate, we used either K48-linked or K63-linked ubiquitin, present in the form of either di-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) or ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, in all cases, Ubp12 revealed no chain preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). This suggested that it is not Ubp12 but rather the chains themselves on the substrates that prevent their turnover. Thus, we determined the number of ubiquitin moieties present on Fzo1, upon co-expression of tagged and non-tagged ubiquitin molecules. We observed that co-expression of ubiquitin and Myc-ubiquitin decomposed the first ubiquitylated form of Fzo1, <italic>i.e</italic> running closest to non-modified Fzo1, into two bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This corresponds to the presence of either ubiquitin or Myc-ubiquitin attached to Fzo1 and confirms that this form corresponds to mono-ubiquitylated Fzo1. Interestingly, however, for the two other ubiquitylated forms with lower electrophoretic mobility, we observed that only two additional bands could be observed above each of them. They correspond to either the presence of two Myc-ubiquitin molecules or one ubiquitin and one Myc-ubiquitin conjugated to Fzo1. These results suggest that the K48 chains on Fzo1 consist of two ubiquitin moieties. In conclusion, Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a very small number of ubiquitin moieties. We therefore propose that Ubp12 does not stabilize its substrates because their ubiquitin chains are too short to target proteasomal turnover.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30015.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the deubiquitylation reaction by Ubp12.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of ubiquitin chain-type composition of Fzo1.

Ubp12 binds ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that stabilize Fzo1 and promote mitochondrial fusion. In turn, Ubp2 recognizes other ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1, that instead signal Fzo1 turnover thus preventing mitochondrial fusion. Given that Ubp12 acts upstream of Ubp2, we speculated that the pro-fusion ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1, Ubp12-specific, would also precede its Ubp2-specific anti-fusion forms. This predicts an impairment of anti-fusion forms in the absence of pro-fusion forms. Therefore, as previously, the mutant Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> was chosen as a tool, because it loses the pro-fusion ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, inset, black arrows, compare lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the catalytically-inactive Ubp2<sup>C745S</sup> protein was expressed additionally. This allows visualization of the Ubp2-specific anti-fusion forms as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, inset, red arrows, lane 3), resulting in a massive increase in overall ubiquitylation of Fzo1 (compare lanes 1 and 3). As predicted by our hypothesis, much of this increase was lost when K464 was mutated to R (compare lanes 3 and 4). This shows that Ubp2-dependent ubiquitylation largely requires previous K464-dependent ubiquitylation . Therefore, pro-fusion ubiquitylation, which stabilizes Fzo1, primes Fzo1 for the formation of anti-fusion ubiquitylation. These anti-fusion forms, instead, signal Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation, so that in Δ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells Fzo1 is less abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Taking this into consideration, the steady state levels of Fzo1 were used as a read-out for the presence of anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. We noticed that whereas the steady state levels of Fzo1 decreased by 91% inΔ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells, as expected, the steady state levels of Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> only decreased by 47% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This shows that Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> is much less sensitive to the deletion of <italic>UBP2</italic> than wt Fzo1, consistent with a lower abundance of the anti-fusion ubiquitylation. To confirm this result, the levels of Fzo1 were also tested upon further deletion of <italic>MDM30</italic> inΔ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells, which encodes the E3 ligase-component responsible for pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escobar-Henriques et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>).

Ubp12 prevents mitochondrial fusion by two means. On the one hand, it removes the ubiquitylation on Fzo1 that is required for fusion. On the other hand, it promotes degradation of Ubp2. This leaves the anti-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 unopposed, resulting in Fzo1 degradation. Therefore, by supporting turnover of Ubp12, Cdc48 dually preserves mitochondrial fusion events. In contrast, when only a non-functional variant of the protein is present, as is the case in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> cells, Cdc48 cannot protect the pro-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1. In this case, the cascade will synergistically converge in degradation of Fzo1 and thus inhibition of mitochondrial fusion will occur. The interdependence between these two pathways contributes to a coordinated cellular decision by Cdc48 to either fuse mitochondria or instead prevent it by degrading Fzo1. Moreover, the Cdc48-Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows fine-tuning of substrate ubiquitylation and modulation of the biological processes thereof, as exemplified for Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Roles of Cdc48 on mitochondrial dynamics</title><p>Cdc48/p97 extracts ubiquitylated substrates from membranes, thus allowing their recognition and degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rape et al., 2001</xref>).

Although it is clear that ubiquitin critically determines mitochondrial fusion events, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 cleave different ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that either promote or repress mitochondrial fusion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). Here, given that Ubp12 regulates Ubp2, we show that these two ubiquitylation pathways are connected. Consistently, on Fzo1, Ubp12-specific ubiquitylation also precedes Ubp2-specific ubiquitylation. In fact, unopposed anti-fusion ubiquitylation, as it is the case in Δ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells, disrupts mitochondrial tubulation. This renders the role of Ubp2 in mitochondrial dynamics quite clear, namely protecting mitochondrial fusion.

Now, the Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows to understand the purpose of Ubp12, solving the paradox of why inhibition of the pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 is required: in fact, too much pro-fusion ubiquitylation also means too much anti-fusion ubiquitylation, a problem counteracted by the deubiquitylation activity of Ubp12 on Fzo1. We conclude that this cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation at levels sufficient to allow mitochondrial fusion but preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that instead targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Which E3 ligases and DUBs modify Fzo1?</title><p>The cascade between Ubp12 and Ubp2 also allows revising recent results linking Ubp2 and Mdm30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavellini et al., 2017</xref>).

This shows that the anti-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 largely depend on its pro-fusion forms. Therefore, it is not surprising that anti-fusion, Ubp2-specific, ubiquitylation on Fzo1 also largely depends on Mdm30. Nevertheless, future studies are required to clarify if Mdm30 itself catalyzes the formation of this high molecular weight fraction of the anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. Moreover, it is clear that Mdm30 is not the ligase responsible for the anti-fusion low molecular weight forms on Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>), which therefore remains to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Novel DUB cascade controlling ubiquitin homeostasis</title><p>Our results unravel for the first time a regulatory cascade of two DUBs, Ubp12 and Ubp2, with opposing functions in ubiquitin homeostasis. A 20–40% depletion in ubiquitin levels leads to cellular growth defects under various stress conditions in yeast, to lethality or infertility in mice, and to neurological diseases like ataxia, gracile axonal dystrophy or Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimura and Tanaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park and Ryu, 2014</xref>). The level of free ubiquitin is adjusted to the cellular needs, and is critically regulated by deubiquitylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chernova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Swaminathan et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we reveal distinct roles of two DUBs - Ubp2 and Ubp12 - for the maintenance of ubiquitin homeostasis. Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells are hyperresistant to cycloheximide (CHX), a chemical inhibitor of protein translation. Similar observations were previously reported in proteasome mutants, with impaired proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerlinger et al., 1997</xref>). Consistently, just like proteasome mutants, also Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells accumulate conjugated ubiquitin, without affecting the levels of free ubiquitin. In turn, Δ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells showed a 40% depletion of free ubiquitin and hypersensitivity to CHX, consistent with similar observations in strains presenting decreased free ubiquitin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanna et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, along with reduced free ubiquitin, deletion of <italic>UBP2</italic> also clearly led to increased levels of ubiquitin conjugates, as observed upon DmUsp5 depletion in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kovács et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, the importance of free ubiquitin pools versus ubiquitin conjugates for cellular growth is not well understood. Our analysis of Δ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells sheds light on this question, demonstrating that depletion of free ubiquitin is epistatic over the accumulation of ubiquitylated conjugates for cellular growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Differences in DUB behavior</title><p>What could justify the opposite behavior of Ubp2 and Ubp12 in ubiquitin homeostasis and substrate turnover? The removal of ubiquitin from a substrate is generally expected to increase its stability, as observed for Fzo1 in Δ<italic>ubp2</italic> cells. Consistently, Ubp2 appears as a general quality control deubiquitylase recognizing both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains that signal for turnover, both by the UPS and by the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the turnover of both Fzo1 and Ubp2 is decreased in Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells. Moreover, Ubp12 does not stabilize Rad23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gödderz et al., 2017</xref>) and Gpa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> its two other known substrates. Ubp12 exhibits a broad substrate specificity in vitro recognizing both K48- and K63-linked chains, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schaefer and Morgan, 2011</xref>). Thus, it is not Ubp12 but the substrate that behaves unexpectedly. Notably, the ubiquitin signals that accumulate in Fzo1, Ubp2, Rad23 and Gpa1 are all composed of a limited number of discrete bands, instead of the high molecular weight smear, typical for polyubiquitylated substrates. For Fzo1, we find that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated forms that only contain two ubiquitin moieties that are linked <italic>via</italic> K48. We propose that the presence of a short number of ubiquitin molecules on the ubiquitin chains recognized by Ubp12 could explain why they do not serve as a good signal for proteasomal degradation. The protein Met4 was also shown to be ubiquitylated with a a limited number of discrete bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuras et al., 2002</xref>). In this case, intramolecular association with a ubiquitin binding domain in Met4 shields the ubiquitin chains, thus preventing their elongation and protecting Met4 against proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tyrrell et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Regulation of DUB activity by ubiquitin</title><p>How deubiquitylation is controlled is poorly understood. Our findings suggest that this involves ubiquitylation of the DUBs themselves, because both Ubp2 and Ubp12 are regulated by ubiquitylation. This consequently renders DUBs interdependent, as exemplified with Ubp12 being the DUB of Ubp2. Interestingly, several examples in the literature illustrate a big diversity of DUB regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michel et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, additional mechanisms to proteolysis for the atypical function of Ubp2 ubiquitylation can be proposed. For example, Ubp2 ubiquitylation could induce a conformational change favouring catalytic activity, as observed for the DUB ATXN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Todi et al., 2010</xref>). This is supported by the observation that Ubp2 is among the largest yeast DUBs. In addition, several residues of Ubp2 were found to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that coordinated ubiquitylation/phosphorylation events could increase its activity. Finally, given that many DUBs often act as part of protein complexes, Ubp2 ubiquitylation could favor its interaction with Ubp12 and/or Cdc48. This could release autoinhibition by a conformational change, as observed for the DUB Ubp6 upon binding to the proteasome, i.e. a AAA+ ATPase like Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanna et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, Cdc48 has been shown to associate with several DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uchiyama et al., 2002</xref>) but also recognizes ubiquitylated proteins, consistent with its interaction with both Ubp12 and Ubp2. Therefore, DUB ubiquitylation could allow recruitment of Cdc48 and provide a platform guiding DUBs to their relevant substrates. This would also justify the need for Fzo1-Cdc48 physical interaction. In fact, a local regulation of Fzo1 by Cdc48 could allow increased efficiency of the Cdc48-DUB cascade on Fzo1 regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that Cdc48 serves as a binding platform allowing cross-talk regulation between DUBs, bringing new insights into the knowledge of ubiquitin biology. These general findings open new perspectives to address some poorly understood questions, <italic>e.g.</italic> how Cdc48 regulates homotypic fusion events and how DUBs are interdependently regulated, possibly accounting for the multitude of DUBs present in a cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆fzo1</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 9483801</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>cdc48-1</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 21441928</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA230</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>cdc48-2</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 21441928</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA231</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>cdc48-3</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 21441928</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA232</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆ubp2</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 9483801</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA260</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆ubp12</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 9483801</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA269</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆fzo1 ∆ubp2</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 23317502</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA362</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆ubp2 ∆ubp12</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 23317502</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA382</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆ubp12 ∆mdm30</td><td>this study</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA390</td><td><italic>UBP12</italic>::kanMX4; <italic>MDM30</italic>::kanMX4;obtained by crossing</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>HA-Fzo1<sup>int</sup> in wt</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 23317502</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA407</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>HA-Fzo1<sup>int</sup> in ∆ubp2</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 23317502</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA415</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>HA-Fzo1<sup>int</sup> in ∆ubp2 <break/>∆mdm30</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 23317502</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA427</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>∆fzo1 ∆ubp12</td><td>this study</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA432</td><td><italic>FZO1</italic>::kanMX4; <italic>UBP12</italic>::kanMX4;obtained by crossing</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>HA-Fzo1-K464R<sup>int</sup> in wt</td><td>this study</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: FA451</td><td>HA-Fzo1<sup>K464R</sup> genomically integrated with NatNT2 into RS140</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">wt (BY4741)</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 9483801</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: RS140</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">cdc48-2 ∆fzo1</td><td>this study</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: RS430</td><td><italic>FZO1</italic>::natNT2 in FA231</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">cdc48-2 ∆ubp12</td><td>this study</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: RS466</td><td><italic>FZO1</italic>::hphNT1 in <break/>FA231</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">cdc48-2 ∆ubp2 ∆ubp12</td><td>this study</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: RS499</td><td><italic>UBP12</italic>::natNT2; UBP2::hphNT1 in <break/>FA231</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">∆doa1</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 9483801</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: RS518</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">∆pdr5 ∆snq2</td><td>other</td><td>Escobar_lab_stock_number: RS527</td><td>gift by J.

For the DUB assay, per reaction, one aliquot of purified Ubp12-flag, 3 µM USP2 or 5 µM USP21 were pre-incubated with 1x DUB dilution buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl) for 10 min at RT.</p><p>After pre-incubation, the DUBs were mixed with di- or multi-Ub chains to a final concentration of 5 µM in 1x DUB buffer (10x DUB buffer: 500 mMTris pH 7.5, 500 mMNaCl, 50 mM DTT). Different incubation conditions were used: Ubp12 was incubated with the Ub chains for 45 min at 30°C, USP2 and USP21 for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by adding 4x Laemmli buffer. These mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 40°C shaking and further run on an 11% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Ponceau S was used to stain the membrane and after destaining with methanol for 5 min, the membrane was incubated in denaturing solution (6M guanidium chloride, 20 mMTris pH 7.5, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min. Extensive washing was done in TBS-T before blocking the membrane over night with 5% milk in TBS. Results were analyzed by immunoblotting using a Ub-specific antibody.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank T Sommer for the Cdc48 and Ubc6 antibodies, B Westermann for the plasmid pYX142-mtGFP and for the strain Δ<italic>fzo1</italic> Δ<italic>dnm1</italic>, J Dohmen for the Tpi1 antibody, for the strain YGA58 and for stimulating discussions, K Tanaka for the Ubiquitin plasmid and corresponding mutant variants, T Ogura for the Cdc48 plasmid, K Hofmann for stimulating discussions, S Altin, T Hermanns and K Hofmann for the USP21 enzyme and the purified di-ubiquitin chains and M Hospenthal and D Komander for help with the DUB assay protocol.

The authors focus specifically on how the conserved AAA ATPase Cdc48 together with two deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), Ubp12 and Ubp2, control Fzo1 ubiquitination status and its activity in mitochondrial fusion. It is shown that the two DUBs not only control the activity of Fzo1 but also of each other. In particular, Ubp2 levels are controlled by Ubp12. On the other hand, Cdc48 regulates Ubp12 stability suggesting that a cascade of ubiquitination events finely tunes Fzo1 fusogenic activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While all three reviewers find the results potentially interesting the following points must be addressed to solidify the key conclusion of this study.</p><p>1) The main claims of this manuscript rely on the degradation of DUBs under strong overexpression.

Cdc48 is a ubiquitin selective segregase chaperone that assists proteasomal degradation of a myriad of substrates, including proteins localized to the mitochondrial outer membranes. It was previously shown that in Parkin-mediated mitophagy in mammalian cells, the Cdc48 homologue p97 can directly target mitofusin for degradation. This process is required for fragmentation of mitochondrion and subsequent mitophagy. In this study, the authors report a distinct function of Cdc48 in mitochondrial dynamics. In this case, the regulation is executed through two deubiquitynases (DUBs) that appear to form a cascade. The genetic evidence presented are nice and convincing, but there are some technical concerns on the biochemical part of the study. The major issue is that the study relies too much on using overexpressed DUBs as Cdc48 substrate. In addition, the integrity of the proposed model depends on some assumptions that are uncertain.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The conclusions of this study rely heavily on overexpression of tagged deubiquitylases as the substrate of Cdc48. Considering the reported role of Cdc48 in diverse protein quality control processes, the authors need to exclude the possibility that overexpressed Ubp12 and Ubp2 are short-lived because of a potential misfolding issue caused by protein overexpression. One way to address this is to tag these DUBs endogenously and analyze their stability in wild type and Cdc48 mutant cells by cycloheximide chase.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors show an interaction between Cdc48 and Fzo1 that is dependent on Fzo1 ubiquitination. However, it is unclear what is the functional consequence of this interaction. Is it also unclear whether the interaction is direct or indirect. In the subsection “Cdc48 supports turnover of ubiquitylated Ubp12”, the conclusion that Cdc48 specifically interacts with pro-fusion ubiquitin is not supported by any data.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors try to demonstrate that Ubp12 is an unstable protein that is degraded in a Cdc48 dependent manner. All the experiments were done with overexpressed Ubp12. The authors should analyze the stability of endogenous Ubp12. In addition, several experiments shown are incomplete (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). These experiments should include a cdc48 mutant for comparison.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that the stability of Ubp2 is regulated by Ubp12. Once again, only overexpressed Ubp2 was studied. It is also puzzling why loss of Ubp12 can stabilize Ubp2, because DUB deficiency usually leads to increased ubiquitination and turnover. The quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> needs to be improved.</p><p>5) The authors argue that there are two forms of ubiquitinated Fzo1; one supports mitochondrial fusion while the other mitigates it, but the nature of the pro-fusion ubiquitination is unclear. The authors should consider analyzing the ubiquitin linkages on Fzo1 that is accumulated in Ubp12 mutant cells. This is an important issue because it is a bit hard to understand how Ubp12 can act on two different kinds of ubiquitin signals; the one on Fzo1 is incompetent for degradation, but the one on Ubp2 seems to influence its stability in a way that is counter-intuitive. Thus, in my opinion, to make the model convincing, the authors need to characterize the Ubp2-mediated deubiquitination reaction in more detail. What kind of linkage is preferred by Ubp12? Are Ubp2 and Fzo1 conjugated with the same type of ubiquitin chains preferred by Ubp12? Do these chains increase protein stability as oppose to target them for degradation?</p><p>6) &quot;Fzo1 ubiquitination requires its lysine 464.&quot; If Fzo1 carries two types of ubiquitin chains, are they both attached to lysine 464? If yes, how are these processes coordinated? If not, where is the pro-fusion ubiquitin chain attached?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Simoes et al. describes a novel function of the evolutionary highly conserved AAA-ATPase Cdc48, which is a potent modulator of neurodegenerative diseases. The authors convincingly demonstrate that Cdc48 controls mitochondrial fusion by a novel deubiquitylase (DUB) cascade at the level of the mitochondrial fusion factor Fzo1. Cdc48 is needed for mitochondrial fusion, and its mutation interferes with the formation of the mitochondrial network. Cdc48 and two DUBs control Fzo1 levels by discrete ubiquitylation patterns: A stable pro-fusion ubiquitylation pattern and an instable pro-degradation ubiquitylation pattern. The pro-fusion ubiquitylation pattern is removed by the DUB, Ubp12, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial fusion. The pro-degradation ubiquitylation pattern is removed by the DUB, Ubp2, thereby stabilizing Fzo1 and promoting mitochondrial fusion. The level of complexity is increased by the fact that Ubp12 is required for UPS-dependent degradation of Ubp2. Thus, high levels of Ubp12 interfere with mitochondrial fusion by two mechanisms: First, the removal of the pro-fusion ubiquitylation pattern from Fzo1, and second the induction of Ubp2 degradation, which results in the degradation of Fzo1. Therefore, controlling Ubp12 activities by Cdc48 enables the fine-tuning of Fzo1-dependent mitochondrial fusion.</p><p>This study is of outstanding interest for researchers working on mitochondrial dynamics and the UPS-dependent control of mitochondrial activities. Since the human homolog of Cdc48 is a modulator of human disease, this study is potentially also important for the elucidation of novel disease mechanisms. Publication of this very well written manuscript can be recommended after the authors address the concerns outlined below.</p><p>1) Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggest that a DUB, Ubp12, is required for degradation of Ubp2. The authors show that Ubp2 is ubiquitylated and stabilized in the absence of Ubp12. In the presence of Ubp12, the ubiquitylated form of Ubp2 cannot be found and Ubp2 is degraded by the proteasome. In other words, the authors propose a model in which deubiquitylation of Ubp2 by Ubp12 promotes its degradation by the proteasome. It is very surprising that removal of ubiquitin from a substrate, rather than its addition to it, triggers proteasome-dependent degradation. In my eyes, this requires further explanations, ideally with additional experiments. I consider this an essential point, because the negative regulation of Ubp2 by Ubp12 is a central point of the authors' model.</p><p>2) The term &quot;ubiquitin homeostasis&quot; should be removed from the title, as this has not been addressed in the paper.</p><p>3) The authors did not use any statistical analysis (like Student's t-test or ANOVA) to substantiate their numerous quantifications. Moreover, they used standard errors instead of standard deviations for error bars. Since standard errors underrepresent the variance of data the authors have to show all their quantitative data with standard deviation. Alternatively, they can keep standard errors as error bars but must then provide appropriate statistical analysis.</p><p>In particular, the effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> are rather moderate and must be substantiated by a more rigorous statistical analysis. If these results turn out to be not significant, the associated statements and conclusions have to be toned down accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their work entitled “Cdc48 regulates a deubiquitylase cascade critical for ubiquitin homeostasis and mitochondrial fusion&quot;, Escabor-Henriques and coworkers investigate the mechanism by which the ATPase Cdc48 regulates Fzo1 mediated mitochondrial fusion. The major claims are that (1) Cdc48 action stabilizes so-called &quot;pro-fusion&quot; ubiquitylation of Fzo1 by promoting the degradation of the deubiquitylase Ubp12. (2) Concomitantly, reduced Ubc12 levels result in a stabilization of Ubp2 which in turn reduces &quot;anti-fusion&quot; ubiquitylation, contributing to Fzo1 stability.</p><p>The findings presented in this manuscript are certainly interesting as they give more mechanistic detail on the earlier finding by the same group that the two DUBs Ubp2 and Ubp12 regulate mitochondrial fusion (Anton et al. 2013), and provide an explanation for the observation by Esaki and Ogura (2012) that Cdc48 plays a role in mitochondrial fusion.</p><p>I do have some concerns though that should be addressed before publishing:</p><p>1) An important finding of this work is that the DUB Ubp12 is degraded in a Cdc48-dependent manner. Data for this is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In these experiments (and in others in which a DUB is expressed from a plasmid), Ubp12 is strongly overexpressed from a 2µ plasmid with the strong ADH promoter (as described in Anton et al., 2013). It is possible that degradation occurs because of the overexpression, e.g. because of then sub-stoichiometric amounts of a binding partner that normally stabilizes Ubp12. There are many examples in the literature for the degradation of orphan subunits in the literature, that are otherwise stable proteins (e.g. 1: Braun and Jentsch, 2007, EMBO Rep. 8(12):1176-82; 2: Habeck et al., 2015, JCB 209(2):261-73). I suggest that either this experiment is repeated using a chromosomally tagged version of Ubp12 under its endogenous promoter or that the possibility of an artifact due to overexpression is at least discussed. The latter would suffice in my opinion because the interplay of Cdc48 and Ubp12 is nicely shown in the following <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplement.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the authors provide evidence that Cdc48 is physically interacting with Fzo1, depending on ubiquitin(-chains) on K464. What is the proposed function of this interaction?</p><p>3) Cdc48 seems to have other functions in this pathway, apart from regulating Ubp12, since steady state levels of Fzo1 are not restored in cdc48-2/ ubc12Delta cells. Please comment.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref> are insufficiently explained. Especially panel D is difficult to understand since Dnm1 is not introduced and the rationale for the experiment is missing.</p><p>5) A table providing information on plasmids used in this study would be helpful, especially since information about expression of DUBs (overexpression, ADH promoter) is somewhat hidden by merely referencing Anton et al. (2013).</p><p>6) The discussion about a role of Cdc48 in membrane fusion remains rather superficial. The proposed mechanism for the role of ubiquitination in Syntaxin 5-mediated fusion is rather different, namely that it prevents SNARE pairing. Here, p97 would mediate deubiquitination of Syn5 and thereby activate Syntaxin 5 (Huang et al. 2016). Furthermore, there is otherwise little evidence for a &quot;general role of Cdc48&quot; in membrane fusion. I suggest rephrasing of this paragraph.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cdc48 regulates a deubiquitylase cascade critical for mitochondrial fusion&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In particular, given the small changes in the turnover of endogenous Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) it is important to test whether they are statistically significant. Moreover, the authors should discuss alternative mechanisms of Ubp2 regulation and that may be independent of its proteolysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a revised manuscript that addresses the role of Cdc48, an AAA ATPase in mitochondria dynamics using yeast as a model. In the first-round review, a major problem identified by all referees is that the analyses of protein stability are based entirely on overexpressed Usp12 and Usp2. The authors now tagged Ubp12 and Ubp2 endogenously and analyzed their turnover in different genetic backgrounds. However, the newly collected data do not seem to support the authors’ main conclusions.</p><p>1) Subsection “Cdc48 supports turnover of ubiquitylated Ubp12” – the authors concluded that the stability of endogenous Ubp12 is regulated by Cdc48. However, the phenotype in my opinion is quite weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the authors provide quantification results, the representative gel does not convince me that endogenous Ubp12 is unstable. Compared to Ubc6, a previously documented Cdc48 substrate, the accumulation of Ubp12 in cdc48-2 mutant cells is marginal, and the turnover is not as obvious as that of overexpressed Ubp12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that overexpressed Ubp12 may not be properly folded and thus becomes a Cdc48 substrate. Given that there may be only a small increase in Ubp12 protein level in cdc48-2 mutant cells, I am not convinced that the role of Cdc48 in regulation of mitochondria dynamics is achieved through controlling the stability of Ubp12.</p><p>2) Another major conclusion of the study is that the two DUBs form a regulatory &quot;cascade&quot; with the stability of Ubp2 being controlled by Ubp12. The new result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> does show that endogenous Ubp2 is unstable, but intriguingly, although the degradation of Ubp2 appears to be inhibited when Ubp12 gene was deleted, there is no obvious accumulation of Ubp2 in ubp12 deficient cells. Thus, it is unclear how Ubp12 could regulate the stability of Fzo1 in a Ubp2 dependent manner.</p><p>Other issues:</p><p>3) Subsection “Cdc48 promotes mitochondrial fusion and prevents Fzo1 turnover” – &quot;Consistent with…&quot;. The authors conclude that the levels of Fzo1 were slightly decreased in the cdc48-3 mutant or in cells deleted for the Cdc48 co-factor factors Npl4, Ufd1 and Ufd3/Doa1. Given the huge error bars in these figures, the authors should perform statistical analyses to show whether the difference is significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have responded to my major concerns in an adequate manner, and the quality of the manuscript has been significantly improved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their revised manuscript, Escobar-Henriques and co-workers have addressed all my concerns appropriately. The somewhat counter-intuitive observation that UBP12 deletion stabilises Ubp2p (and Fzo1p) is now sufficiently discussed. Concerns regarding over-expression of DUBs have been addressed. The Discussion is improved. The Materials and methods section now contains the requested tables.

We tackled this particularity using Fzo1. We find that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated forms on Fzo1 that only contain a very small number of ubiquitin moieties, which might explain why they do not serve as a good signal for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Consistently, the ubiquitin signals that accumulate in all Ubp12 substrates are composed of a limited number of discrete bands, instead of the high molecular weight smear, typical for polyubiquitylated substrates that are degraded by the proteasome. In the case of the protein Met4, also with short ubiquitin chains, these are shielded and therefore not recognized for degradation.

One way to address this is to tag these DUBs endogenously and analyze their stability in wild type and Cdc48 mutant cells by cycloheximide chase.</p></disp-quote><p>Both Ubp12 and Ubp2 have now been genomically tagged. Cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that both Ubp12 and Ubp2 are unstable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). Moreover, Ubp12 degradation depended on Cdc48 and Ubp2 degradation depended on Ubp12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors show an interaction between Cdc48 and Fzo1 that is dependent on Fzo1 ubiquitination.

On the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>, we show that this is not the case. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude an indirect interaction between Cdc48 and Fzo1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the subsection “Cdc48 supports turnover of ubiquitylated Ubp12”, the conclusion that Cdc48 specifically interacts with pro-fusion ubiquitin is not supported by any data.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that Cdc48 binds to Fzo1 depending on its pro-fusion forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and also show that the additional presence of the anti-fusion forms does not increase binding of Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, we now show that the exclusive presence of the anti-fusion bands does not allow Cdc48 binding to Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> – extended from the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data support the specificity of Cdc48 for the pro-fusion bands. We have also revised the corresponding text, to make this point clear (subsection “Cdc48 supports turnover of ubiquitylated Ubp12”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors try to demonstrate that Ubp12 is an unstable protein that is degraded in a Cdc48 dependent manner. All the experiments were done with overexpressed Ubp12. The authors should analyze the stability of endogenous Ubp12. In addition, several experiments shown are incomplete (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). These experiments should include a cdc48 mutant for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show turnover of endogenous Ubp12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Once again, only overexpressed Ubp2 was studied. It is also puzzling why loss of Ubp12 can stabilize Ubp2, because DUB deficiency usually leads to increased ubiquitination and turnover. The quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> needs to be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>The stability of genomic Ubp2 in dependence of Ubp12 has now been analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> had been improved by providing lower exposed blots. We agree that DUB deficiency usually leads to increased ubiquitylation and turnover. However, this is not the case for any of the four known substrates of Ubp12 – Fzo1, Ubp2, Rad23 (Gödderz JCS 2017) and Gpa1 (Wang JBC 2005). As discussed below, on point 5, we propose that those ubiquitylated forms, recognized by Ubp12, are too short to be a good proteasomal tag.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors argue that there are two forms of ubiquitinated Fzo1; one supports mitochondrial fusion while the other mitigates it, but the nature of the pro-fusion ubiquitination is unclear. The authors should consider analyzing the ubiquitin linkages on Fzo1 that is accumulated in Ubp12 mutant cells. Are Ubp2 and Fzo1 conjugated with the same type of ubiquitin chains preferred by Ubp12?</p></disp-quote><p>We show now, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, that both Fzo1 and Ubp2 accumulate K48-linked chains in D<italic>ubp12</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is an important issue because it is a bit hard to understand how Ubp12 can act on two different kinds of ubiquitin signals; the one on Fzo1 is incompetent for degradation, but the one on Ubp2 seems to influence its stability in a way that is counter-intuitive.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the effect of Ubp12 on Fzo1 and on Ubp2 might have been unclear in the previous version. We now show that the ubiquitin signals that Ubp12 recognizes on Fzo1 resemble the ones that Ubp12 recognizes on Ubp2: in both cases it slows down their turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We agree that this is counter-intuitive and therefore have further investigated it. In fact, the ubiquitin signals that accumulate in Fzo1, Ubp2, Rad23 and Gpa1 are all composed of a limited number of discrete bands, instead of the high molecular weight smear, typical for polyubiquitylated substrates. We have explored this for Fzo1 and found it to be composed of a di-ubiquitin chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This might explain why accumulation of these chains, in Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells, does not increase substrate turnover.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, in my opinion, to make the model convincing, the authors need to characterize the Ubp2-mediated deubiquitination reaction in more detail. What kind of linkage is preferred by Ubp12? Are Ubp2 and Fzo1 conjugated with the same type of ubiquitin chains preferred by Ubp12?

So, we propose that the presence of short ubiquitin chains on its substrates explains why they are not targeted for the UPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;Fzo1 ubiquitination requires its lysine 464.&quot; If Fzo1 carries two types of ubiquitin chains, are they both attached to lysine 464? If yes, how are these processes coordinated? If not, where is the pro-fusion ubiquitin chain attached?</p></disp-quote><p>Fzo1 is ubiquitylated at lysines 464 and 398. Fzo1 is first ubiquitylated at lysine 464 and then induces the formation of pro-fusion ubiquitin chains on lysine 398. Therefore, upon mutation of lysine 464 all pro-fusion ubiquitylation is lost (Anton 2013 Mol Cell). We have now briefly introduced this in the second chapter of the Results, subsection “Cdc48 binds and regulates ubiquitylated Fzo1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggest that a DUB, Ubp12, is required for degradation of Ubp2. The authors show that Ubp2 is ubiquitylated and stabilized in the absence of Ubp12. In the presence of Ubp12, the ubiquitylated form of Ubp2 cannot be found and Ubp2 is degraded by the proteasome. In other words, the authors propose a model in which deubiquitylation of Ubp2 by Ubp12 promotes its degradation by the proteasome. It is very surprising that removal of ubiquitin from a substrate, rather than its addition to it, triggers proteasome-dependent degradation. In my eyes, this requires further explanations, ideally with additional experiments. I consider this an essential point, because the negative regulation of Ubp2 by Ubp12 is a central point of the authors' model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that DUB deficiency usually leads to increased ubiquitylation and turnover. In contrast, Ubp12 deficiency decreases turnover of Ubp2 and Fzo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have addressed this point by performing additional experiments on Fzo1. We found that the ubiquitin forms bound by Ubp12 are composed of a di- ubiquitin chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Therefore, we propose that they are too short to be a good signal for proteasomal degradation. So far there are 4 substrates known for Ubp12: Fzo1, Ubp2, Rad23 (Gödderz JCS 2017) and Gpa1 (Wang JBC 2005). Importantly, in all these 4 substrates, the ubiquitin signals that accumulate in Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells are composed of a limited number of discrete bands, instead of the high molecular weight smear, typical for polyubiquitylated substrates. Consistently, Ubp12 also does not stabilize any of these 4 substrates.</p><p>Additional experiments analyzing Ubp12 have been performed. First, we show that Ubp12 regulates K48-linked chains on both Fzo1 and Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). Second, we analyzed the DUB activity of Ubp12 in vitro.

Moreover, they used standard errors instead of standard deviations for error bars.

Alternatively, they can keep standard errors as error bars but must then provide appropriate statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present standard deviations in all graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, the effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> are rather moderate and must be substantiated by a more rigorous statistical analysis.

Data for this is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In these experiments (and in others in which a DUB is expressed from a plasmid), Ubp12 is strongly overexpressed from a 2µ plasmid with the strong ADH promoter (as described in Anton et al., 2013). It is possible that degradation occurs because of the overexpression, e.g. because of then sub-stoichiometric amounts of a binding partner that normally stabilizes Ubp12. There are many examples in the literature for the degradation of orphan subunits in the literature, that are otherwise stable proteins (e.g. 1: Braun and Jentsch, 2007, EMBO Rep. 8(12):1176-82; 2: Habeck et al., 2015, JCB 209(2):261-73). I suggest that either this experiment is repeated using a chromosomally tagged version of Ubp12 under its endogenous promoter or that the possibility of an artifact due to overexpression is at least discussed. The latter would suffice in my opinion because the interplay of Cdc48 and Ubp12 is nicely shown in the following <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>This essential point was analyzed and is also now addressed in the Results section.

Briefly, in absence of Fzo1 no hypertubulation has been observed upon deletion of <italic>UBP12</italic>. However, in Δ<italic>fzo1</italic> cells mitochondria are no longer tubular. We wanted therefore to exclude that the effect of Ubp12 depends on the shape of mitochondria, rather than on the role of Ubp12 in Fzo1. To this aim, the effect of Ubp12 was tested in Δ<italic>fzo1</italic> Δ<italic>dnm1</italic> cells, lacking Fzo1 but resembling wt cells in mitochondrial shape, so that the starting point would be tubular mitochondria.

The proposed mechanism for the role of ubiquitination in Syntaxin 5-mediated fusion is rather different, namely that it prevents SNARE pairing.

In the first-round review, a major problem identified by all referees is that the analyses of protein stability are based entirely on overexpressed Usp12 and Usp2. The authors now tagged Ubp12 and Ubp2 endogenously and analyzed their turnover in different genetic backgrounds. However, the newly collected data do not seem to support the authors’ main conclusions.</p><p>1) Subsection “Cdc48 supports turnover of ubiquitylated Ubp12” – the authors concluded that the stability of endogenous Ubp12 is regulated by Cdc48. However, the phenotype in my opinion is quite weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the authors provide quantification results, the representative gel does not convince me that endogenous Ubp12 is unstable., The turnover is not as obvious as that of overexpressed Ubp12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that overexpressed Ubp12 may not be properly folded and thus becomes a Cdc48 substrate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the turnover rate is higher for the overexpressed Ubp12 than for the endogenous protein, as shown in the quantifications presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Nevertheless, upon Cdc48 impairment, the stabilization of endogenous Ubp12 is much more obvious than the one presented by overexpressed Ubp12. This convinces us that Ubp12 is a Cdc48 substrate, independently of its expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Compared to Ubc6, a previously documented Cdc48 substrate, the accumulation of Ubp12 in cdc48-2 mutant cells is marginal. Given that there may be only a small increase in Ubp12 protein level in cdc48-2 mutant cells, I am not convinced that the role of Cdc48 in regulation of mitochondria dynamics is achieved through controlling the stability of Ubp12.</p></disp-quote><p>The observation of a smaller increase in Ubp12 endogenous protein level in <italic>cdc48-2</italic> mutant cells is expected, given the lower degradation kinetics discussed above. Ubc6 was used here just as a positive control of the CHX chase experiments.

The new result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> does show that endogenous Ubp2 is unstable, but intriguingly, although the degradation of Ubp2 appears to be inhibited when Ubp12 gene was deleted, there is no obvious accumulation of Ubp2 in ubp12 deficient cells. Thus, it is unclear how Ubp12 could regulate the stability of Fzo1 in a Ubp2 dependent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present statistical analysis clearly demonstrating that Ubp2 is an unstable protein, and that its turnover is reduced in Δ<italic>ubp12</italic> cells.

So, as suggested, we propose now in the Discussion subsection “Regulation of DUB activity by ubiquitin” that ubiquitylation could additionally regulate Ubp2 by proteolysis-independent means. For example, it could increase its activity by favoring further PTMs, consistent with the identification of phosphorylated sites on Ubp2 (Swaney, 2013). Moreover, Ubp2 ubiquitylation could favor allosteric conformational changes. This could occur autocatalytically – supported by the observation that Ubp2 is among the largest yeast DUBs – or as part of a protein complex with Cdc48, in agreement with our observation that Cdc48 and Ubp2 co-immunoprecipitate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues:</p><p>3) Subsection “Cdc48 promotes mitochondrial fusion and prevents Fzo1 turnover” – &quot;Consistent with…&quot;.
