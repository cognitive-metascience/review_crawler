Here, we report that peripheral administration of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin improves the survival of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxin shock, a well-studied septic shock model. The effect is accompanied by a suppression of excessive cytokine production and an increase of catecholamines and corticosterone. We found that peripherally administered orexin penetrates the blood-brain barrier under endotoxin shock, and that central administration of orexin also suppresses the cytokine production and improves the survival, indicating orexin’s direct action in the central nervous system (CNS). Orexin helps restore body temperature and potentiates cardiovascular function in LPS-injected mice. Pleiotropic modulation of inflammatory response by orexin through the CNS may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for septic shock.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21055.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21055.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21055.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The body has a range of defenses to fight infection, which play a crucial role in keeping us healthy. However, sometimes the response to infection may damage the body’s own tissues and organs, leading to a life-threatening condition called sepsis. In the most severe stage of sepsis – known as septic shock – blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and the individual often dies.</p><p>There is currently no effective therapy for septic shock. Recent studies have revealed how the brain regulates immune responses via chemical signals and nerve impulses. A molecule called orexin is made in the brain and regulates the activity of a group of neurons that control sleep. Orexin can also alter heart rate and body temperature in rats, which suggests that it may have potential to be developed as a treatment for septic shock.</p><p>To test this idea, Ogawa, Irukayama-Tomobe et al. injected orexin under the skin of mice with septic shock. The experiments show that the injected orexin is able to enter the brain, where it helps the mice to survive and recover from septic shock by restoring normal body temperature and boosting heart rate. Further experiments suggest that orexin is likely to regulate immune responses through multiple signaling pathways in the brain.</p><p>The next step following on from this work is to find out the precise mechanism through which orexin regulates the responses of the immune system. This orexin treatment strategy should also be tested on primates with septic shock before planning any clinical trials in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21055.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21055.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>orexin</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>central nervous system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WPI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanagisawa</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 26220207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanagisawa</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FIRST Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanagisawa</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When the neuropeptide orexin is peripherally administered in mice with septic shock, it penetrates the blood-brain barrier and acts in the brain to improve survival through multiple autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by infection, or sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dellinger et al., 2013</xref>), can lead to a life-threatening medical emergency requiring intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin et al., 2003</xref>). Septic shock is defined as cardiovascular dysfunction triggered by sepsis, representing the most severe stage of the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram negative bacteria, plays a central role in sepsis as the endotoxin inducing a systemic inflammatory response, and LPS-induced endotoxin shock is one of the several well-studied animal models of septic shock. Recent advances have started to reveal the highly complex pathophysiology of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2002</xref>). However, researchers have failed to translate the advances in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis into effective new therapies, and the mortality of sepsis still remains high. To improve the outcome of patients with sepsis, new therapeutic strategies and agents are essential.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed the regulation and integration of inflammatory responses by the central nervous system (CNS) through the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tracey, 2002</xref>). For example, vagal afferents activated by endotoxin and cytokines in sepsis stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and exert anti-inflammatory effects through the release of glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tracey, 2002</xref>). A cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway has also been reported, in which the activation of efferent vagus nerves suppresses systemic inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borovikova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Acetylcholine attenuates cytokine production from LPS-activated macrophages in the spleen through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Vagus nerve stimulation also leads to the activation of the splenic nerve and release of norepinephrine in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vida et al., 2011</xref>). Norepinephrine inhibits cytokine production in the spleen and suppresses systemic inflammation in experimental sepsis through β2-adnenoceptors on lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vida et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the anti-inflammatory effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems seem to be synergistic.</p><p>The hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin, which plays a crucial role in controlling sleep/wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakurai, 2007</xref>), regulates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis by activating the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuru et al., 2000</xref>) and integrates autonomic functions by interacting with brainstem centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zheng et al., 2005</xref>). Recent reports show that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin modulates heart rate and body temperature, and increases the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in a murine sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deutschman et al., 2013</xref>). ICV orexin also partially increases locomotor activity suppressed by a low dose of LPS in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grossberg et al., 2011</xref>). However, no information is available as to whether orexin actually improves the survival and/or suppresses the systemic inflammation. Moreover, CNS administration of therapeutic agents in human patients may often be unfeasible; clinical applications of orexin in humans require a tactic to deliver orexin into the brain. Systemic inflammation, the hallmark of sepsis, enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kowal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xaio et al., 2001</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballabh et al., 2004</xref>); some peptides and proteins, including insulin, albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xaio et al., 2001</xref>), and antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kowal et al., 2004</xref>), can enter the brain under the condition of systemic inflammation. In this study, we deliver orexin into the brain by taking advantage of the enhanced BBB permeability under the condition of systemic inflammation, rescuing mice with endotoxin shock by targeting the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Peripherally administered orexin improves survival of mice with endotoxin shock</title><p>Orexin cannot normally penetrate the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujiki et al., 2003</xref>).

We measured the levels of 32 cytokines in serum from LPS-injected mice. Whereas LPS elevated the levels of most cytokines, SC infusion of OXA (1 mg/mouse/24 hr) significantly inhibited the increase of a number of cytokines at 4 hr and 22 hr after LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Simultaneously, OXA ameliorated hypothermia induced by LPS at 4 hr and 22 hr after LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Particularly, in the early stage of endotoxin shock, the levels of cytokines produced by LPS-activated macrophages (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α, also termed CCL3), and MIP-1β [CCL4]) were significantly decreased by OXA treatment. In the later stage, the levels of many more cytokines produced by macrophages and/or lymphocytes were significantly decreased, including the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), of which the decrease by OXA treatment was particularly robust. In healthy mice injected with saline instead of LPS, peripherally administered OXA did not affect the cytokine levels in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To examine the inflammatory state of the CNS, we measured the levels of the same set of 32 cytokines in homogenized brains of LPS-injected mice. LPS increased the levels of most cytokines in the brain, and peripherally administered OXA significantly inhibited the increase of certain cytokines in the brain at 4 hr and/or 22 hr after LPS injection, particularly the microglia-derived chemokines such as MIP-1α/1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Our findings suggest that orexin may regulate LPS-induced macrophage activation either by acting through the CNS or by acting directly on macrophages. To examine the latter possibility, we prepared peritoneal macrophages from wild-type or OXRKO mice, and then activated cultured macrophages by LPS in the absence or presence of OXA (1 nM and 100 nM). Levels of IL-17, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA in cultured macrophages from both wild-type and OXRKO mice were increased after LPS addition. We found no evidence for orexin’s direct action on macrophages, however, since the induction of these mRNAs was not affected in the presence of OXA (1 nM and 100 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Catecholamines and corticosterone could be the possible immune modulators mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of orexin through the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tracey, 2002</xref>).

IL-17 produced during sepsis is implicated in the ‘cytokine storm,’ in which the inflammatory response is amplified, increasing the lethality of septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flierl et al., 2008</xref>). IL-17 synergistically potentiates LPS-induced activation of peritoneal macrophages in vitro and increases the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. In our study, orexin did not directly inhibit the increase of cytokine production in LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages, although TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated microglia, the primary immune cells in the CNS, is reported to be decreased by OXA pretreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). Together with the findings that centrally administered orexin was effective at a lower dose in improving the survival of mice with endotoxin shock and in suppressing MIP-1α levels in their peripheral blood, our results indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of orexin are through its action in the CNS rather than in the peripheral tissues.</p><p>We found that orexin increases blood corticosterone levels of mice with endotoxin shock, which is consistent with the report that ICV administration of orexin increases the expression of ACTH in CLP-induced septic shock model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deutschman et al., 2013</xref>). The blood corticosterone level is increased in mice with LPS-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Landgraf et al., 2014</xref>), and even a slight upregulation of corticosterone by exogenous leptin may improve LPS-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Landgraf et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the increase of corticosterone levels in endotoxin shock may play a role in the anti-inflammatory effects of orexin, although further studies with glucocorticoid agonists/antagonists are necessary to substantiate this possibility. Indeed, glucocorticoids are sometimes used for human patients with sepsis and effective in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dellinger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also found that orexin increased the levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood of mice with endotoxin shock: Further studies with adrenergic antagonists would fully qualify the role of these neuroendocrine changes in the observed improvements in survival. The increases of catecholamines might not only stabilize hemodynamics by potentiating cardiovascular function, but also modulate inflammation through adrenoceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spengler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vida et al., 2011</xref>). However, although catecholamines are used to stabilize hemodynamics in human patients with sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dellinger et al., 2013</xref>), their effects are often limited because vascular responsiveness to catecholamines is reduced during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parker and Parrillo, 1983</xref>). Also, adrenergic modulation of inflammation is complicated. The adrenergic anti-inflammatory effects are mostly mediated by β2-adrenoceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vida et al., 2011</xref>), while stimulation of α2-adrenoceptors induces pro-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spengler et al., 1990</xref>). Moreover, systemically administered catecholamines act on all tissues without coordination. In contrast, catecholamines endogenously released under the CNS command are localized in the specific target tissues and their actions on each target are integrated by the CNS. This may be why the life-supporting effects of orexin administration on sepsis may be longer lasting and more effective than those of catecholamine administration alone. Indeed, in the rat septic shock model, administration of norepinephrine for 24 hr improves the survival rate by only 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, administration of orexin for 24 hr showed 70–80% and 40% improvements in the survival rate for prophylactic and post-hoc protocols, respectively, in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Furthermore, it is reported that the treatment with both catecholamines and glucocorticoids synergistically attenuates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-17 during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There has been no report showing the role of the raphe nuclei in septic shock. Raphe nuclei are reported to be an orexin-regulated region for brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and heart rate modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tupone et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, our findings show that orexin improves the survival of mice with endotoxin shock through a multitude of pathways, including the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system, by targeting the CNS (hypothesized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The precise mechanism through which CNS orexin modulates inflammatory responses merits further investigation. The present study suggests that a coordinated intervention through the CNS against the complex pathophysiology of systemic inflammation can be a novel therapeutic approach for septic shock. While we therapeutically exploited the leakiness of BBB under sepsis in this study, BBB dysfunction may also permit cytokines and inflammatory cells to freely enter into the CNS, which may constitute an additional element of pathophysiology of sepsis, such as ‘sepsis-associated encephalopathy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Widmann and Heneka, 2014</xref>). The failure of traditional therapy (e.g., catecholamines) in septic shock has been commonly attributed to defects in peripheral response mechanisms. Our study suggests that it may be the CNS regulatory machinery that is dysfunctional, which could be partially restored by orexin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight- to 10-week-old male mice from four genotypes (<italic>Hcrtr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>Hcrtr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Hcrtr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Hcrtr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and wild-type, on a C57BL/6J background, generated by crosses between homozygous mice) were randomly assigned to experimental groups.

Subcutaneous infusion started at a rate of 8 µl/hr for 24 hr at the same time of implantation of the pump. To investigate the post-hoc therapeutic effect of peripherally administered orexin on survival, mice were implanted subcutaneously with a programmable microinfusion pump (iPRECIO, SMP300, Primetech, Japan) containing 1 mg orexin-A dissolved in 100 µl saline (or containing 100 µl saline as a control) under anesthesia at 30 min before LPS injection. These pumps are wirelessly controlled by an external scheduler. The infusion schedule was programmed with iPRECIO Management Software ver 1.1. At 30 min after LPS injection, subcutaneous infusion started at a rate of 8 µl/hr for 24 hr. The next day iPRECIO was refilled with orexin A (1 mg orexin-A dissolved in 100 µl saline) or 100 µl saline. To investigate the effect of centrally administered orexin on survival, mice were intracerebroventriculerly (ICV) administered with 0.06 mg orexin-A dissolved in 3 µl saline (or 3 µl saline as a control) in 5 min and implanted subcutaneously with an osmotic pump containing 200 µl saline as transfusion (at a rate of 8 µl/hr) under anesthesia at 30 min before LPS injection. At the same time of LPS injection, ICV infusion was started at the rate of 0.5 µl /hr (orexin-A concentration was 0.02 mg/µl). To investigate the effect of warming up to the same degree as orexin-treated mice on survival, mice were warmed on a heat pad at 30°C for 24 hr at the same time of LPS injection. In all the survival experiments, body temperature was monitored for seven days after LPS injection. We assessed survival as primary endpoint, and body temperature at 24 hr after LPS injection as secondary endpoint. Observation was stopped in seven days or by death. Relationship between survival and body temperature was expressed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, plotting true positive rate (Y-axis; sensitivity) against the false positive rate (X-axis; one minus specificity) at various body temperature values. The ROC curve was assessed by area under the curve (AUC), and an optimal cut-off values was determined, which gave maximum AUC. The sample size was calculated on the following assumptions; α is 0.05, power is 0.8, the usual survival rate in control group at two days is 0.2 and the expected survival rate in the treatment group at seven days is 0.6–0.9.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and Richard D Palmiter (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, Matthew Carter (Reviewer #2), and Chris Madden (Reviewer #3).

We recognize the desire to understand the mechanism by which orexin acting centrally might mitigate the effects of sepsis and the intriguing possibility that serotonin might be involved; however, the current experiments are incomplete and do not prove that they are relevant. Furthermore, we believe that it would require substantial effort to define the neural substrates of orexin in this context, especially if there are several. We believe that the experiments presented in the first part of the paper are sufficiently novel and important that they can stand on their own.</p><p>Hopefully the comments below will help you revise the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors of this paper provide a compelling set of experiments demonstrating that peripheral administration of orexin can ameliorate the consequences of sepsis induced by a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). They show that administration of orexin is beneficial even when administered after LPS, suggesting that it could have therapeutic applications. They demonstrate that orexin gains access to the brain due to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier during sepsis and that it acts there to mitigate the effects of LPS. They go on to show that one target of orexin action is the ventral raphe serotonergic neurons. Overall, this paper makes important contributions to understanding sepsis and provides a novel therapeutic avenue.</p><p>In their attempts to define the CNS targets of orexin action, the authors zero in on serotonergic neurons in the ventral raphe. They performed an experiment in which they inhibited ventral raphe serotonergic neurons and show that prevented the rise in body temperature normally observed with orexin treatment. The effect of orexin on body temperature is rather small – only 1 or 2 °C; thus, while statistically significant, it is not clear that is sufficient to prevent lethality. These experiments would be more compelling if the authors could show that orexin activation of serotonergic system contributes to survival after LPS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript studies the effects of peripheral and central injection of orexin on the inflammatory response that follows a relatively high dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The authors show that peripherally administered orexin can increase survival following LPS injection, that it can inhibit cytokine production, and that it can keep body temperature and heart rate near normal levels. Importantly, they show that these effects are absent in orexin receptor double knockout mice. They further show that orexin can cross the blood brain barrier during endotoxin shock, and that orexin mediates increases in body temperature by activating the serotoninergic raphe nuclei.</p><p>This manuscript makes two fundamental and interesting discoveries: (1) peripherally administered orexin has therapeutic effects on endotoxin-mediated inflammation; (2) that peripherally administered orexin can cross the blood brain barrier under conditions of endotoxin shock and cause the activation of CNS systems. These results are novel and have therapeutic implications for peripherally-injected neuropeptides. The experiments are well executed and the results are convincing. My main concern stems from overall conclusions that don't seem justified by the results provided. I would suggest either adding further experiments to justify these conclusions, or revising the main conclusions of the paper (including the title) to better represent the scope of the data presented.</p><p>1) The major conclusion of this paper (i.e., the title), is that &quot;peripherally administered orexin improves survival of mice with endotoxin shock by acting in the central nervous system.&quot; To me, the results of the manuscript are consistent with this statement but not conclusive. To show that orexin exerts protective effects by acting on the central nervous system, somehow the authors would need to block orexin signaling only in the brain. Because centrally injected orexin only recapitulated some (but not all) of the effects of peripherally injected orexin, it is possible that the central nervous system mediates some, but not necessarily all of these effects. I suggest refining the title because it is still unknown if orexin in the CNS specifically mediates survival (see comment #2 below).</p><p>2) The authors present a valid but precarious argument as to the mechanism by which orexin attenuates the inflammatory response: orexin crosses the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); orexin in the brain activates thermoregulatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); survival in mice following endotoxin shock correlates with higher body temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); and inhibiting the raphe nuclei attenuates orexin-mediated stabilizing of body temperature. All of these experiments are well done, but the only conclusion that can be drawn is that &quot;peripheral injection of orexin depends on the raphe nuclei to stabilize body temperature.&quot; Given the title of the paper, it would be excellent to repeat the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref> (inhibiting the raphe nuclei during orexin injection) while performing a survival experiment. This experiment would clearly show that orexin enhances survival rates by raising body temperature, as is implied by the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>3) The authors also suggest that orexin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by modulating levels of peripheral catecholamines or corticosterone. The authors could provide much more conclusive evidence for these claims by repeating these experiments in the presence of catecholamine antagonists or a corticosterone agonist. These experiments would demonstrate that modulation of catecholamines or corticosterone is necessary for the actions of orexin on endotoxin shock. Otherwise, the authors should be careful to note that the observed effects of orexin on catecholamines and corticosterone don't show necessity or sufficiency on these endocrine systems for orexin's actions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript explores the potential for peripheral administration of orexin in the treatment of endotoxin shock and the role of an action within the central nervous system in the therapeutic effect of this treatment.

Our experiments do not conclusively show that CNS mediate all of orexin’s effects on the survival.

However, such experiments with agonists/antagonists may often be tricky.

Nonetheless, these data should provide important bases for future studies addressing the mechanism(s) involved in the increased survival in mice treated with orexin during endotoxin shock.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that further investigation is required for revealing the mechanism(s).</p></body></sub-article></article>
