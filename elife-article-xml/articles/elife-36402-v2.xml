pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36402.001</object-id><p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neuropathological disorder that belongs to the class of synucleinopathies, in which the protein alpha-synuclein is found at abnormally high concentrations in affected neurons. Its hallmark are intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We here report the structure of cytotoxic alpha-synuclein fibrils (residues 1–121), determined by cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.4 Å. Two protofilaments form a polar fibril composed of staggered β-strands. The backbone of residues 38 to 95, including the fibril core and the non-amyloid component region, are well resolved in the EM map. Residues 50–57, containing three of the mutation sites associated with familial synucleinopathies, form the interface between the two protofilaments and contribute to fibril stability. A hydrophobic cleft at one end of the fibril may have implications for fibril elongation, and invites for the design of molecules for diagnosis and treatment of synucleinopathies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36402.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People with Parkinson’s disease have damaged cells in a part of the brain involved in movement, learning and reward-seeking behaviors. These cells contain blob-like aggregates that contain abnormally high amounts of a protein called alpha-synuclein. It is generally believed that, within these blobs, this protein clusters together into small needles called fibrils.</p><p>Discerning the structure of a fibril could help researchers to understand both how alpha-synuclein damages brain cells and how diseases like Parkinson’s spread. Biophysicists have attempted to reveal the fibril structure previously. But many of these efforts only looked at short segments of the alpha-synuclein protein. Researchers still need more detailed imagery of the fibrils to confirm previous findings regarding their architecture and ultimately to identify ways to counteract the damage they cause.</p><p>Guerrero-Ferreira et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to capture images of frozen fibrils made from a version of human alpha-synuclein that readily aggregates and that is only slightly shorter than the full-length protein. Processing these high-resolution images with computer software then revealed a three-dimensional model of the fibril structure, in which fine details are clearly visible. In the fibril, the proteins cluster to form a helix, similar to a flight of stairs. Each turn of the helix is formed by two alpha-synuclein molecules, facing each other but rotated by almost 180 degrees from one another. The three-dimensional model displays which parts of the protein lie at the core of the helix and thereby stabilize the fibril structure. Guerrero-Ferreira et al. speculate that fibrils may also take alternative forms because common alpha-synuclein mutations, which correlate with disease, would destabilize the observed helical structure.</p><p>In the future, researchers may be able to use the features of this three-dimensional model to help design molecules that would make the fibrils detectable via medical imaging. This could help doctors to diagnose people with Parkinson’s disease at an earlier stage. Further research is also needed to understand where and how fibrils form, if differences in fibril structures exist within or between patients, possibly leading to different sub-classes of the disease, and how such fibrils interact with and possibly damage human brain cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>alpha-synuclein</kwd><kwd>fibril</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_154461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero-Ferreira</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Nicholas MI</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008947</institution-id><institution>Stiftung Synapsis - Alzheimer Forschung Schweiz AFS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stahlberg</surname><given-names>Henning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII5_177195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero-Ferreira</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Nicholas MI</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The alpha-synuclein fibril structure reported here buries residues 50-57 at the interface between its two protofilaments, suggesting that familial Parkinson's disease associated mutations in these residues lead to a structure not compatible with the one presented here.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillantini et al.

The position of a given ß-sheet in a protofilament is produced by the rotation of 179.5° of one sheet around its axis (helical twist), followed by a vertical translation of 2.45 Å (helical rise). This ß-sheet arrangement results in a spacing of 4.9 Å between α-Syn subunits in successive rungs of a single protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The quality of the EM map allowed an atomic model of the region between residues L38 and V95 to be built.</p><p>Each α-Syn(1-121) molecule comprises eight in-register parallel β-strands (i.e. residues 42–46 (β1), 48–49 (β2), 52–57 (β3), 59–66 (β4), 69–72 (β5), 77–82 (β6), 89–92 (β7), and 94-(~102) (β8)), which are interrupted by glycine residues (i.e. G41 before β1, G47 between β1 and β2, G51 between β2 and β3, G67 and G68 between β4 and β5, G73 between β5 and β6, G84 and G86 between β6 and β7, and G93 between β7 and β8) or an arch (i.e. E57-K58 between β3 and β4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,F and G</xref>). The β-strands β2-β7 wind around a hydrophobic intra-molecular core composed of only alanine and valine residues and one isoleucine (i.e. V48, V49, V52, A53, V55, V63, A69, V70, V71, V74, A76, V77, A78, I88, A89, A90, A91). Considering that these hydrophobic clusters are maintained along the fibril, they are likely to contribute to the stability of the protofilament. The hydrophobic core is surrounded by two hydrophilic regions (i.e. (i): Q79, T81, and (ii): T72, T75, T54, T59, and E61) both still within the core of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The less well defined β1 and β8 strands are attached to the core, while the first 37 N-terminal residues and the last ~20 C-terminal residues of α-Syn(1-121) are not visible in the 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating a disordered structure in line with quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange – solution-state NMR (H/D exchange NMR) and limited proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vilar et al., 2008</xref>), which showed these terminal segments to be unprotected in nature. Together with our results, this suggests that approximately 40 residues of both the N- and C-terminal ends of full-length human α-Syn are flexible, and surround the structured core of the fibril with a dense mesh of disordered tails, similar to the ‘fuzzy coat’ recently described in the cryo-EM tau structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36402.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Hydrophobicity of α-Syn(1-121) fibrils.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top view (fibril axis) of the hydrophobic regions (brown) in a fibril where the hydrophobic pocket at the interface between two protofilaments is evident.

As a consequence, two α-Syn molecules per fibril layer are stacked along the fibril axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The side chains of residues A53 and V55 form the inter-molecular surface contributing to the interface between the two protofilaments, which is further stabilized by a surface-exposed salt bridge between E57 and H50 that might be sensitive to pH, as an unprotected histidine has a pK of ~6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H</xref>). The same structure with a steric zipper topology was found in micro-crystals of the peptide comprising residues G47-A56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the β-strand β6 that is sandwiched between β-strands β2/β3 and β7 is also aligned with a neighboring molecule but shifted by one monomer along the fibril axis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Thus, hetero and homo steric zippers are both present in the 3D structure. Of these, the homo steric zipper at the inter-molecular interface has an extensive and well-packed β-strand interface, forming a very densely packed fibril. This stacking generates an asymmetric fibril with two distinct ends. Furthermore, the hydrophobic core of the fibril is composed of β-strands that interact with each other in a half-stacked zipper topology, contrasting with the hydrophilic core comprised of β-strands β4 and β5, which are non-stacked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The latter confirms previous results from site-directed spin labeling experiments, which show that the region including residues 62–67 at the beginning of the NAC region, has a pronounced lack of stacking interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The outer surface of the ordered region of the fibrils is mostly hydrophilic, with a few exceptions (i.e. L38, V40, V82, A85, A90, F94, V95) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The side chain of V66 should probably not be classified as surface exposed because of its interaction with β-strand β8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). If we ignore the influence of the non-polar alanine residues due to the small size of their side chains, the surface of the fibrils has two highly hydrophobic regions formed by residues L38 and V40, and by residues F94 and V95. Other interesting properties of the surface are the salt bridge formed by the side chains of E46 and K80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>) and the rather highly positive clustering of K43, K45, K58, H50 that requests the binding of a counter-ion, as it is supported by an observed density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The familial PD mutations in the context of the 3D fibril structure</title><p>Six familial mutations in α-Syn are known to be associated with PD and other synucleinopathies (i.e. A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E, and A53T). Of these, all but A30P are located in the heart of the core of the fibril structure presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). E46 forms a salt bridge with K80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>). The mutation of the glutamic acid E46 to a positively charged lysine in an E46K mutant would thus induce a charge repulsion between β-strands β1 and β6, likely destabilizing this α-Syn fibril structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>). The familial PD/DLB-causing mutation E46K was found to enhance phosphorylation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mbefo et al., 2015</xref>), and its toxic effect was increased by the triple-K mutation (E35K, E46K, E61K) in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dettmer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous high-resolution structures of α-Syn only included small peptides or single protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>). Our 3D map suggests structural contributions of some familial mutations to fibril stability, since H50, G51 and A53 are all involved in the inter-molecular contact between the two β-sheets from adjacent protofilaments at the core of the here studied α-Syn(1-121) fibrils. Mutation of the positively charged histidine 50 into a polar, uncharged glutamine in the H50Q mutant would likely interfere with the salt bridge established between residues E57 and H50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H</xref>). Adding to the absent side-chain of glycine 51 a negatively charged aspartic acid in mutant G51D, or transforming the small side-chain of alanine A53 into a larger threonine in mutant A53T, would likely disrupt the steric zipper interaction between the two protofibrils, whereby the A53T mutation would in addition change the highly hydrophobic surface at the zipper to partly hydrophilic one. In our α-Syn(1-121) fibril structure, A53 is part of a hydrophobic pocket that defines the interaction of protofilaments and likely contributes to fibril stability as the hydrophobic interactions exist along the fibril axis. Mutations at the core of this α-Syn fibril would compromise the formation of the structure presented here. This suggests that a different fibril structure (i.e. fibril strain) could be formed from α-Syn containing the above discussed familial PD mutations.</p><p>Several features of our structure, such as non-functional hydrophobic surface patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a hydrophilic tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), and a positively charged side chain arrangement like the one comprised of residues K43, K45, K58, H50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>) are not found in functional amyloid structures such as that of HET-s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wasmer et al., 2008</xref>). However, similar structural characteristics have been previously observed for pathological tau filaments obtained from Alzheimer’s disease brains where (i): lysine and tyrosine residues play a similarly stabilizing role in the interface region of two protofilaments of the straight filaments (SF), and (ii): the area in the center of the protofilaments is dominated by hydrophilic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>). It is plausible that these structural features might arise because folding to form the amyloid fibril structure is dictated by the need to bury the maximum number of hydrophobic side-chains as efficiently as possible, as is also the case for the Aβ(1-42) amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The artificial, highly toxic, but not synucleinopathy-related mutant E57K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winner et al., 2011</xref>) is interesting to mention in the context of the 3D structure presented, because E57 is also at the inter-molecular interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The presence of a positive lysine side chain at this position in the E57K mutant would significantly interfere with the formation of the interface and even the amyloid fibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winner et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, this mutant was designed in a successful structure-based attempt to interfere with amyloid fibril formation (at least under some conditions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winner et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, both in a lentivirus-rat system as well as in a transgenic mouse model, the E57K mutant formed a significant amount of oligomers and was highly toxic, resulting in a large decay of TH-sensitive neurons in the <italic>substantia nigra</italic> of rats and a motor phenotype reminiscent of PD in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winner et al., 2011</xref>).

S87 is the only phosphorylation site located within the NAC region. The previous solid-state NMR structure of α-Syn placed the side chain of this residue towards the inside of the protofilament core, leading to the assumption that phosphorylation of S87 might be the only modification occurring at a region not accessible in the fibrillar state. However, in our cryo-EM structure, S87 faces the outside of the fibril and hence remains accessible for disease-associated modification in α-Syn fibrils.</p><p>We also observed the arrangement of G47 and A78 described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tuttle et al.

The conservation of the geometry adopted by these residues confirms their role in facilitating backbone-backbone interactions. In addition, our structure also confirms that residues A69 and G93 (and likely G68) help to stabilize the distal loop in a protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>).</p><p>A microED structure obtained from crystals produced from a 10-residue peptide simulating the core of α-Syn fibrils (PreNAC, from 47 to 56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and including a threonine instead of an alanine at position 53 (i.e. A53T), also proposed that residue 53 forms the hydrophobic core within a protofilament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the microED model suggested that the interaction between adjacent protofilaments would occur through residues 68 to 78 (referred to as NACore) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). However, their short peptides did not include most residues responsible for the α-Syn monomer topology that we observed. Instead, our cryo-EM structure reveals that the PreNAC is responsible for the interaction between protofilaments, and places the NACore at the very center (i.e.the core) of a single protofilament.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Possible mechanism of fibril elongation</title><p>Our 3D structure allows us to hypothesize a mechanism for fibril elongation (fibril growth). Because two different stacking modes are present (i.e. the half-stack at the intermolecular interface and the stacking of β-strand β6), the two ends of the fibrils are distinct, suggesting an end-dependent growth of the fibrils, as documented and also suggested for other amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lührs et al., 2005</xref>). One end of the fibril includes a hydrophobic cleft formed between β-strands β2/ β3 on one side and β7 on the other side (residues V49, V52, A88, I89), providing a hydrophobic entry point for the next incoming molecule, with the matching segment consisting of 5 hydrophobic residues (V74-V82, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that the initial binding event of fibril elongation might be a hydrophobic interaction involving residues V74-V82. This peptide segment is the central part of the NAC region and strong experimental evidence suggests that it is critical for fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giasson et al., 2001</xref>).

Finally, the inter-molecular stacking may also play a role in fibril elongation, since the zipper interaction is of hydrophobic nature. Furthermore, it is likely that fibril growth alternates between the two protofilament structures at the level of monomer addition. Failure thereof may result in the growth of a single protofilament with little stability, yielding a dynamic on- and off-binding of monomers and larger oligomers, which has been observed for other amyloid fibril systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carulla et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we present the structure of recombinant α-Syn(1-121) fibrils determined at a resolution of 3.4 Å by cryo-EM. Our structure encompasses nearly the complete protein (residues 38 to 95), and includes the NAC region (residues 61 to 95) of α-Syn. We determined that various residues associated with familial forms of PD and other synucleinopathies are located in the interacting region between two protofilaments, suggesting their involvement in fibril formation and stabilization. The cryo-EM structure presented here reveals how two protofilaments interact to form a fibril, and how the NAC region contributes to protofilament formation and stability. Our structure also presents novel insights into how several PD-relevant mutations of α-Syn would compromise the structure of this fibril, suggesting that in the case of certain familial forms of PD, a different structure of α-Syn than this fibril strain might be involved. Our findings on protofilament interaction and our hypothesis on the mechanism of fibril elongation invite for the design of molecules for diagnostics or treatment of synucleinopathies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Recombinant full-length α-Syn was expressed from the pRT21 expression vector in BL21(DE3) competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>).

Endotoxins were removed from all α-Syn strains by Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removing Gel (Thermo Scientific) usually in one run or until endotoxin levels were below detection level. The sequence of the expressed α-Syn strains was verified by tryptic digestion followed by MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) or HPLC/ESI tandem MS for total mass was performed. Purity and monodispersity was determined by Coomassie blue or Silver staining of the SDS PAGE gel and analytical ultracentrifugation and the concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Dialyzed and lyophilized α-Syn(1-121) was prepared by dialyzing the purified protein in a 2 kD Slide-A-Lyzer unit (Thermo Scientific, for max. 3 ml) against HPLC-water (VWR). 500 µg protein aliquots were pipetted into 1.5 ml tubes, frozen on dry ice, and lyophilized for 2 hr using an Eppendorf concentrator (Eppendorf).

Filaments were manually selected using the helix picker in RELION 2.1. Filament segments were extracted using a box size of 280 pixels (233 Å) and an inter-box distance of 28 pixels. A total of 18,860 segments were extracted from 792 fibrils manually picked from 118 micrographs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). 2D classification was carried out with a regularization value of T = 10, and 2D class averages with a clear separation of β-strands were selected for further data processing. Power spectra of 2D class averages show the layer line at 1/ (4.9 Å) with peak intensities on both sides of the meridian (Bessel order n = 1). This is the result of an approximate 2<sub>1</sub> screw symmetry between α-Syn subunits on the two protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Segments assigned to the best 2D classes were used for 3D classification using a regularization value of T = 8 and with optimization of the helical twist and rise.

An initial reconstruction was calculated using a cylinder generated via the helix toolbox in RELION 2.1 as initial model. This reconstruction was low-pass filtered to 60 Å and employed as the initial model for a 3D classification with a single class (K = 1) and T = 20, an approach that allowed the successful reconstruction of amyloid filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>). The handedness of the reconstruction was determined by comparison with atomic force microscopy images, which showed left-coiled surface patterns for the fibrils.</p><p>Refinement was carried out by the auto-refine procedure with optimization of helical twist and rise. This resulted in a structure with overall resolution of 3.8 Å. Post-processing with a soft-edge mask and an estimated map sharpening <italic>B</italic>-factor of −82.6 Å gave a map with a resolution of 3.4 Å (by the FSC 0.143 criterion). An estimation of local resolution was obtained using RELION 2.1 and a local-resolution-filtered map was calculated for model building and refinement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>A model of the α-Syn(1-121) fibril was built into the Relion local resolution-filtered map using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>), with the PDB ID 2N0A as an initial model for the early interpretation of the map. The structure helped to determine the directionality of the protein chain and facilitated the assignment of densities in the map to specific residues. However, due to the large differences between the NMR structure and our EM map, major rebuilding was necessary. The high quality of the EM map allowed us to unambiguously build residues 38–95. A comparison was also carried out between our structure and X-ray structures of α-Syn fragments 69–77 (PDB ID 4RIK), 68–78 (PDB ID 4RIL) and 47–56 (PDB ID 4ZNN; with the mutation A53T).</p><p>The structure (10 monomers, 5 on each protofilament) was refined against the RELION local resolution-filtered map with PHENIX real space refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2013</xref>). Rotamer, Ramachandran restraints, and ‘NCS’ constraints were imposed, and two <italic>B</italic>-factors per residue were used during refinement. For validation, we randomized the coordinates (with a mean shift of 0.3 Å) and refined (using the same settings) against one of the refinement half-maps (half-map 1). We then calculated the FSC between that model (after refinement against half-map 1) and half-map 1, as well as the FSC between the same model and half-map 2 (against which it was not refined). The lack of large discrepancies between both FSC curves indicates no overfitting took place.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Liz Spycher, Jana Ebner, Alexandra Kronenberger, Daniel Schlatter, Daniela Huegin, Ralph Thoma, Christian Miscenic, Martin Siegrist, Sylwia Huber, Arne Rufer, Eric Kusznir, Peter Jakob, Tom Dunkley, Joerg Hoernschmeyer, and Johannes Erny at Roche for their technical support to clone, express, purify and characterize the different recombinant forms of α-Syn, Kenneth N Goldie, Lubomir Kovacik and Ariane Fecteau-Lefebvre for support in cryo-EM, Shirley A Müller for support in manuscript preparation, and Sjors Scheres for help in image processing.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM structure of alphα-Synuclein fibrils&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Sjors HW Scheres as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marcus Fändrich (Reviewer #2); Dennis J Selkoe (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Guerrero-Ferreira and collaborators use helical reconstruction cryo-electron microscopy to report a near-atomic resolution structure of an α-synuclein (α-Syn) fibril. Unlike previous high-resolution structures of α-synuclein fibrils obtained with solid-state NMR and micro-ED, cryo-EM allowed the determination of an arrangement where two protofilaments form a polar fibril composed of β-strands. Interestingly, a region associated with mutations that predispose to familial forms of Parkinson's disease is in the interface between the two protofilaments, where the mutants could influence the formation and stability of fibrils.</p><p>Overall, this study is experimentally sound and provides further evidence of the power of cryo-EM to elucidate the structures of amyloid-like fibrils made from recombinant proteins in vitro. However, all three reviewers agreed that the current manuscript would need a very careful and major revision before being suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Besides adequately addressing the important conceptual points outlined by the three reviewers below, the manuscript should also be subjected to an extensive rewrite as the language used is often unclear and imprecise.</p><p>There is some overlap between point 2 by reviewer #3 and the paragraph with the request for additional evidence of seeding by reviewer #1. After deliberation among the reviewers it was agreed that it would probably be hard to find convincing arguments for the pathophysiological relevance of the solved fibrils at this point. Therefore, the revision should at least address the comments made by reviewer #3, i.e. to better explain the choice made for the 1-121 mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes a 3.4Å cryo-EM structure of in vitro aggregated α-synuclein fibrils (from a construct comprising residues 1-121). The authors built a near-atomic model of the α-synuclein fibril, which contains two protofilaments with a helical pseudo-two-fold screw symmetry. Each protofilament comprises eight parallel β-strands, forming a hydrophobic core with disordered random-coil-like tails on both ends. The authors describe the position of several familial Parkinson's disease (PD) mutations in the context of the 3D fibril structure, interpreting that the mutations would compromise the formation of the fibril structure presented here. The structure shares a similar topology with an NMR structure of in-vitro aggregated full-length α-synuclein fibrils that form single protofilaments. The manuscript also proposes a possible mechanism of fibril growth based on the observation of a hydrophobic cleft on one side of the fibril, which would then also be a potential target for fibril growth inhibitors or tracer compounds.</p><p>Although the structure presented is interesting and could in principle be worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the current manuscript is written very poorly. Moreover, there is no additional data to back up some of the claims made based on the structure. Therefore, this paper will need a very major revision before it will be suitable for publication.</p><p>The Introduction is very short, and does not do credit to the large body of literature existing on α-synuclein.</p><p>Being the result of an in-vitro aggregation experiment, the relevance of the structures in disease is questionable. This is further exacerbated by using a truncation construct instead of the wildtype protein. It is not entirely clear from Figure 1—figure supplement 1 why the authors did not actually perform structure determination of the wildtype protein. Because of this change, the experiments performed on wildtype protein before by others may not be relevant for this structure. Therefore, the authors should provide evidence that the fibrils they used can still seed aggregation in cell cultures or mouse models.</p><p>Subsection “The familial PD mutations in the context of the 3D fibril structure”, end of second paragraph: I cannot see how the observation that familial PD mutations lie at the interface between the protofilaments would suggest that this fibril has some sort of 'native function'. Then, that exact statement is refuted in the next line, where evolution towards a fibril with a hydrophobic patches is deemed unlikely. This second statement is also strange. Why would there be an evolutionary pressure to form fibrils in the first place, regardless of their hydrophobicity? And more importantly, what do the authors themselves think is the relevance of this structure?</p><p>The authors discuss differences with the solid-state NMR structure by Tuttle et al. It could be that the filaments are indeed different, but it is perhaps equally likely that the ssNMR model is wrong, as not enough restraints may have been acquired to define a unique structure. Therefore, it would be interesting to know whether the cryo-EM structure actually explains the NMR data, or whether some distances measured by NMR are incompatible with the cryoEM structure, and the two are indeed different. This possibility should at least be discussed.</p><p>Subsection “Possible mechanism of fibril growth”, first sentence: Now the fibrils are called 'the transmissible species' solely based on some similarities with the NMR structure (which is in fact rather different and comprises only a single protofilament). This is at least confusing, as previously it was suggested this fibril structure is different from the one relevant to PD.</p><p>The authors hypothesize a mechanism for fibril growth based on the observation of a cleft on one side of the fibril. Although interesting in principle, they refer to their 'findings on the mechanism of fibril elongation'. However, they present no additional data that actually provides proof of a single 'growing end' of the fibril, nor its directionality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study is well done. However, it contains a rather serious error in the β-sheet nomenclature, and it requires some further clarifications regarding the analysis before publication can be recommended.</p><p>1) There is a misclassification of the β-sheet structure, which does <italic>not</italic> possess a Greek key topology. Richardson defined a Greek key as a (+3) -1 -1 (+3) topology of 5 hydrogen bonded strands from the SAME β-sheet, with the exception that the first or the last strand can be missing. In the present case, however, the strands belong to β-sheets that are clearly different, and the strands do not interact with one another through backbone hydrogen bonds but rather via their side chains. Unfortunately, this misclassification was introduced previously to the amyloid field by another paper, but it is now important that we now avoid an error propagation. The term Greek key is misleading in the present context and needs to be deleted.</p><p>2) Which features in the original cryo-EM images show that the fibril possesses a screw axis? Please clarify through a new figure in the supplementary information.</p><p>3) The manuscript currently does not describe well how the obtained 3D density corresponds to the original experimental data? This should also merit a figure.</p><p>4) Please present evidence that the model is an adequate description of the 3D map or original cryo-EM data, for example, by comparing class averages with 2D projections of the density or by comparisons of the power spectra obtained with class averages, 3D maps and models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Guerrero-Ferreira and collaborators use helical reconstruction cryo-electron microscopy to report a near-atomic resolution structure of an α-synuclein (α-Syn) fibril.

Regardless of the interpretation of the molecular details of this 3D fibril structure, there are some major conceptual issues (numbered below) about their report that the authors should address in order to support the relevance of this aa1-121 fibril generated in vitro to the normal in vivo biology of α-Syn and the role of α-Syn fibrils in human synucleinopathies, particularly PD.</p><p>1) Already in the Abstract and Introduction, the authors should explain to readers whether they view the fibrils they elegantly analyze by cryoEM as modeling normal or pathological assembles. This is not really made clear until a rather speculative discussion where they write (somewhat ambiguously) &quot;this suggests that this fibril structure might have a native function, and that a different fibril structure could be involved in the toxicity of the disease&quot;. Then, in the next sentence, they state an apparently contradictory opinion: &quot;it seems likely that the fibril structure presented here doesn't have a native or mechanistic function by itself&quot;, and shortly thereafter, they state that &quot;similar, rather unique [meaning?] structural characteristics have been previously observed for tau&quot;. Are those tau structures believed by those respective authors and also by the current authors to be normal or pathological? It is widely assumed in the neurodegenerative field that α-Syn and tau are normally soluble and functional proteins in neurons, and that amyloid-like fibrils or protofilaments do not occur normally and are pathological. But in the Results and Discussion, and elsewhere in the manuscript, the authors seem unclear about the precise disease-relevance of this wild-type α-Syn fibril. An example of this ambiguity is the sentence: &quot;The here presented structure therefore hints at the possibility that a different structure or mechanism might be the causative agent for PD, at least for familial PD&quot;. This sentence sounds vague, and the term &quot;causative agent for PD&quot; seems overreaching. Such statements may be confusing to α-Syn biologists trying to interpret the meaning and impact of this structural work.</p><p>2) At the beginning of Results, the authors show Ems of &quot;several preparations of recombinant human α-Syn fibril&quot;, including those formed by full-length (FL) unmodified α-Syn and N-terminally acetylated α-Syn. They then say that &quot;the fibrils formed by α-Syn(1-121) were straight, between 20 and 500 nm long and the only ones consistently 10 nm in diameter&quot;. They conclude &quot;for this reason, α-Syn(1-121) was used to proceed with structural analysis by cryo-EM&quot; For what reason? Why do these in vitro characteristics justify choosing the α-Syn(1-121) variant to focus their work on? This seems arbitrary or at least not well justified. The authors should explain this and further state why an N-acetylated FL α-Syn (filaments of which are nicely shown by EM in Figure 1C) would not have been more biologically relevant, since the vast majority of α-Syn in human neurons is in this state, both in healthy people and in PD subjects. An example of this concern arises in the first paragraph of the subsection “Comparison with earlier structural data”, where the authors contrast their new structure of α-Syn(1-121) to that of Tuttle et al. of a ssNMR structure of a pathogenic fibril of FL α-Syn; this contrast raises the question of why the authors' α-Syn(121) fibril is a more biologically relevant structure.</p><p>3) The authors state already in the Abstract and in several places throughout the paper that human PD has as a major feature the cell-to-cell propagation of α-Syn. While this is a popular and much studied hypothesis, there is no direct evidence to date that physical passage of α-Syn between neurons occurs – and is required for – in the human disease, i.e., occurs in patients with PD and DLB. This is especially true as regards fully formed amyloid-like fibrils of α-Syn, despite the authors' claim that &quot;the fibril species presented here is likely to be the transmissible species.&quot; Even those championing the pathogenic spread hypothesis do not claim that fully formed, 10 nm fibrils such as are examined here are the likely form of α-Syn that spreads from neuron to neuron. More readily diffusible soluble oligomers of α-Syn are more likely to be candidates for inter-neuronal passage. The authors would be wise to reserve their speculations about this to the end of their paper, assuming they believe that neuron-to-neuron transport of the 10 nm fibrils they characterize will turn out be biologically true in PD patients, rather than assuming this outcome already in the second sentence of the Abstract and in the Introduction (third paragraph). The authors should also clarify for readers that their statement &quot;our 3D structure reveals some detailed insight into the mechanism of fibril replication&quot; is distinct from the mechanisms of any fibril propagation or &quot;transmissibility&quot;, which they mention just 3 lines earlier. These terms (&quot;replication&quot; and &quot;transmissibility&quot;) should not be conflated in the reader's mind.</p><p>4) A related question of biological interpretation and PD-relevance is whether the authors assume the 10 nm amyloid-type fibrils they define would occur intra- or extracellularly. If intraneuronal, do they then believe their fibrils are similar to the α-Syn filaments that accumulate in Lewy bodies and neurites? In this context, the authors emphasize that their fibrils are of wild-type α-Syn and that PD-causing mutations (e.g., H50Q, G51D, A53E, A53T) would each alter &quot;the inter-molecular contact between two β-sheets from adjacent protofilaments at the core of the fibrils&quot; they study, including the disruption of the stearic zipper interaction they postulate on the basis of their 3D structure. So, while an additional structure determination of an α-Syn mutant is probably beyond the scope of this study, it would be very interesting to at least have a rough a priori reconstruction of any of the fPD mutants occurring at the interface between the protofilaments – especially in light of their strong claims about the importance of this interface. Would the authors expect to observe a radically different structure?</p><p>5) The advance of Fitzpatrick and collaborators' determination of the structure of tau filaments derives from the fact that the material came from human patients. Would the authors expect fibrils within Lewy bodies in patients suffering from synucleinopathies to maintain the same overall structure they report here?</p><p>6) Compelling ssNMR data suggest the existence of only minor structural differences between wt α-synuclein and the A53T mutant. How would this affect the authors' assumption that the mutations are clustered at the core of the interacting protofilaments and therefore have major effects on the structure of the wt fibrils prepared here?</p><p>7) The α-synuclein fibril diameter reported by some labs within Lewy bodies is ~5 nm, akin to a single protofilament of the current structure. How do the authors justify the importance of a two-protofilament fibril made here from bacterially expressed, non-acetylated recombinant α-Syn?</p><p>8) Any comment on why the authors find that α-Syn(1-119) is unable to form fibrils (Figure 1D), despite the fact that the C-terminal residues remain dynamic even in the fibrillar state?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36402.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Although the structure presented is interesting and could in principle be worthy of publication in eLife, the current manuscript is written very poorly.

Richardson defined a Greek key as a (+3) -1 -1 (+3) topology of 5 hydrogen bonded strands from the SAME β-sheet, with the exception that the first or the last strand can be missing. In the present case, however, the strands belong to β-sheets that are clearly different, and the strands do not interact with one another through backbone hydrogen bonds but rather via their side chains. Unfortunately, this misclassification was introduced previously to the amyloid field by another paper, but it is now important that we now avoid an error propagation.
