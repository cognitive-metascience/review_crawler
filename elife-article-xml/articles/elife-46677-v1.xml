We investigated this question in a mouse model of recurrent urinary tract infection and found that a prior bladder infection resulted in an earlier onset of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFɑ)-mediated bladder inflammation upon subsequent bacterial challenge, relative to age-matched naive mice. However, the duration of TNFɑ signaling activation differed according to whether the first infection was chronic (Sensitized) or self-limiting (Resolved). TNFɑ depletion studies revealed that transient early-phase TNFɑ signaling in Resolved mice promoted clearance of bladder-colonizing bacteria via rapid recruitment of neutrophils and subsequent exfoliation of infected bladder cells. In contrast, sustained TNFɑ signaling in Sensitized mice prolonged damaging inflammation, worsening infection. This work reveals how TNFɑ signaling dynamics can be rewired by a prior infection to shape diverse susceptibilities to future mucosal infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mucosal bacterial infections are very common, accounting for over 42 million outpatient visits and a majority of the 270 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong and Pinner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">May et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, 2011</xref>). Of these, respiratory and urinary tract infections (UTI) can be highly recurrent, the latter leading to over $2 billion in direct and indirect costs annually in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foxman, 2010</xref>). Over 80% of community-acquired UTI are caused by uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta and Bhadelia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ronald, 2003</xref>), and the vast majority of these infections involve the lower urinary tract and specifically the urinary bladder, causing cystitis (bladder infection). Women are disproportionately affected: over 60% of women will experience at least one UTI during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foxman et al., 2000a</xref>), and of these women, 20–30% will experience a recurrence (rUTI) within 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foxman et al., 2000b</xref>). Some individuals experience recurrent UTI to such a high degree that they resort to taking daily suppressive antibiotic therapy to prevent further recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikäheimo et al., 1996</xref>). In sexually active young women, one of the single biggest independent risk factors for developing an acute UTI is a history of two or more UTIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hooton et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, placebo studies of UTI patients show that the natural course of infection and symptoms can vary greatly: for some women, infections resolve spontaneously within a few days, while others may develop persistent bladder infections lasting for weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christiaens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mabeck, 1972</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that disease history may impact the nature of the future interaction of UPEC with the urinary tract mucosa of patients in a way that alters susceptibility to symptomatic rUTI.</p><p>In C3H/HeN mice, a dichotomy of self-resolving vs. chronic infection, similar to the natural course of UTI in women, occurs after experimental UPEC infection in an infectious dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, the outcome of the initial infection polarizes future susceptibility to rUTI: mice that spontaneously resolve the initial infection are highly resistant to rUTI upon challenge, whereas those that develop an initial chronic infection (persistent high-titer bladder bacterial colonization and bladder mucosal inflammation) lasting two weeks or longer prior to antibiotic therapy are highly sensitive to rUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Brien et al., 2015</xref>). These studies revealed an early immune checkpoint that determines whether the host spontaneously resolves the infection or goes on to develop chronic cystitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, at 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi), elevated serum cytokines (IL-5, IL-6, G-CSF, CXCL1), severe bladder inflammation with mucosal wounding, and pyuria (neutrophils in urine) are the hallmarks of checkpoint activation, which indicates severe acute UTI that predisposes to chronic infection. In mice that trigger the checkpoint, robust cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression by bladder epithelial (urothelial) cells at 24 hpi promotes neutrophil transmigration through the urothelium, causing mucosal damage and ultimately the development of chronic cystitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>). If chronic cystitis is permitted to go on for two or more weeks prior to antibiotic therapy, affected mice then become highly susceptible to developing severe rUTI upon subsequent challenge in a COX-2 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). C57BL/6J mice, though inherently resistant to chronic cystitis upon a single bladder inoculation of UPEC, can be induced to develop chronic cystitis by repeated bacterial inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>), and those with a history of chronic infection become susceptible to severe rUTI upon challenge, similar to C3H/HeN mice, demonstrating that acquired factors related to a prior chronic infection can overcome genetic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). Translating these findings to humans, we found that serum cytokine biomarkers associated with more robust granulocytic responses, similar to those associated with the development of chronic cystitis in naive mice, were also predictive of susceptibility to rUTI in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The diverging susceptibilities of mice to rUTI as a consequence of the outcome of a prior infection were found to be due in part to bladder remodeling that alters the pathophysiology of acute cystitis upon the second infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which this bladder remodeling impacted susceptibility to rUTI were unclear. Here, we leveraged the power of bladder transcriptomics and the C3H/HeN mouse model of rUTI to interrogate the molecular basis for the impact of UTI history on host susceptibility to rUTI. We discovered that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFɑ) signaling was a hallmark of bladder inflammation during acute UTI in mice. However, the temporal nature of the TNFɑ response differed according to UTI history and impacted the outcome of recurrent infection. Antibody-mediated depletion experiments showed that the polarizing rUTI susceptibility phenotypes (i.e. mice with a history of chronic UTI were susceptible to rUTI, whereas mice with a history of self-resolving UTI were resistant to rUTI) were each mediated by TNFɑ signaling, but with divergent dynamics and effects. Thus, these findings demonstrate the central role of TNFɑ in directing acute bladder inflammation and provide mechanistic insight into how UTI history affects host susceptibility to recurrent infection by modulating TNFɑ signaling dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Infection history alters acute bladder inflammation kinetics during recurrent UTI</title><p>To assess the contribution of host infection history to rUTI susceptibility, we utilized a previously described recurrent cystitis model in adult (16 weeks old) C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Relative to age-matched Adult Naive mice (no history of infection), C3H/HeN mice that spontaneously resolve an initial acute bladder infection are referred to herein as ‘Resolved.’ In contrast, mice with a history of chronic cystitis lasting two weeks or more prior to antibiotic therapy (which sterilizes the bladder) are referred to herein as ‘Sensitized.’ In response to challenge infection, the majority of Sensitized mice develop severe recurrent cystitis that often becomes chronic, whereas cystitis in Adult Naive mice is more moderate and few mice develop chronic cystitis.

Previous studies have found that this ‘convalescence’ period is sufficient for healing of the bladder mucosa and a return to a non-inflamed, though remodeled, state. In Sensitized mice this remodeling is evidenced by a hyperplastic urothelium that has a defect in terminal differentiation and the presence of persistent lymphoid follicles, which are not necessary for sensitization but often appear with extended (longer than two weeks) duration of initial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). Age-matched Adult Naive mice that were initially mock-infected with PBS in parallel served as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Histopathological analysis of the urinary bladder after challenge with 10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming units (cfu) of the UPEC strain UTI89 revealed significant differences in the severity and kinetics of bladder inflammation in the previously infected mouse groups relative to Adult Naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Whereas the majority of Resolved and Sensitized mice had severe bladder inflammation (median bladder histopathology scores of 5 for each group) at 6 hpi, none of the Adult Naive mice had severe bladder inflammation (median histopathology score of 2.5). By 24 hpi, the severity of bladder inflammation had waned significantly in Resolved mice and trended lower in Sensitized mice (median bladder histopathology scores of 1 and 2, respectively), but had increased in Adult Naive mice, though not to a severe level in most individuals, with a median bladder histopathology score of 3.5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Infection history alters the course of bladder pathophysiology during recurrent UTI</title><p>Consistent with previous work using a 10<sup>7</sup> cfu challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>), we observed significantly lower titers at 6 hpi in mice with a history of UTI relative to Adult Naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that the enhanced bladder inflammation at 6 hpi in previously infected mice was not a consequence of higher bacterial burdens. At 24 hpi, a bimodal distribution of bladder bacterial burdens was observed in mice with a previous history of UTI, with 11 of 14 Sensitized mice experiencing a bloom of UPEC to levels between 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/bladder. These titers are similar to or higher than those seen in Adult Naive mice, with an increase in overall median bacterial burden from 3.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> at 6 hpi to 8.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/bladder at 24 hpi. In contrast, the median bacterial burden in Resolved mice decreased from 1.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> at 6 hpi to 1.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/bladder at 24 hpi, though 6 of 17 mice had high bacterial burdens above 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/bladder at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, this subset of Resolved mice with higher bladder titers at 24 hpi did not reflect a propensity for chronic infection, as only one of 25 Resolved mice infected with 10<sup>8</sup> cfu UTI89 developed chronic infection lasting four weeks, levels similar to those seen in ‘resistant’ C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>). The pattern of bladder edema as indicated by the weights of these bladders mirrored the patterns of bladder inflammation observed by histopathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Most notably, previously infected mice, whether Resolved or Sensitized, had significantly increased bladder weights at 6 hpi (relative to mock-infected mice with the same infection history) that by 24 hpi had decreased significantly in Resolved mice but remained elevated in Sensitized mice. Bladder weights in Adult Naive mice were not significantly increased until 24 hpi. Bladder levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 followed similar patterns, with sharply increased levels at 6 hpi in previously infected mice relative to Adult Naive mice and waning of these levels by 24 hpi in Resolved, but not in Sensitized, mice. In Adult Naive mice, a gradual increase of these cytokines was observed from 6 hpi to 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that a prior UTI in C3H/HeN mice confers the ability to mount a robust early phase (first 6 hpi) inflammatory response to UPEC infection not seen in Adult Naive mice, and that this inflammation is more likely to be sustained in Sensitized mice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46677.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Infection history alters the course of bladder pathophysiology during recurrent UTI.</title><p>C3H/HeN Resolved and Sensitized mice, and Adult Naive mice as a control, were infected with 10<sup>8</sup> cfu UTI89 or PBS and sacrificed at 6 or 24 hpi.

Adult Naive, Sensitized, and Resolved mice were infected with 10<sup>8</sup> cfu UTI89 or mock-infected with PBS. Differential gene expression was then determined by comparing samples obtained from Adult Naive, Sensitized and Resolved mice at 3.5, 6 and 24 hpi to bladders with the same infection history but mock-infected with PBS for 3.5 hr. Gene fold changes in UPEC-infected mice were calculated relative to mock-infected counterparts using normalized reads. The transcriptomic profiles displayed patterns similar to those seen in the inflammatory profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In Adult Naive mice, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with time, starting low (291 genes at 3.5 hpi), increasing somewhat by 6 hpi (5309 genes), and peaking at 24 hpi (9249 genes). However, in both Resolved and Sensitized mice, the number of DEGs was relatively low at 3.5 hpi (127 and 944 genes, respectively), but peaked at 6 hpi (10872 and 10133 genes, respectively), and decreased somewhat by 24 hpi (7793 and 8252 genes, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To obtain a global view of the interplay among infection history, infection status, and gene expression, principal component analyses (PCA) were performed. The PCA plot of the mock-infected mice demonstrated that Resolved mice were similar to Adult Naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, Sensitized mice clustered separately, likely due in part to the presence of lymphoid follicles, similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>).

Combining all the experimental groups in one PCA shows that the mice infected for 6 or 24 hr clustered separately from mice infected for 3.5 hr or mock-infected on the PC1 axis, regardless of infection history. This clustering is likely driven by infiltration of immune cells into the bladder tissue between 3.5 and 6 hpi in all mice.

At 3.5 hpi, 3 of 8 Resolved and 7 of 8 Sensitized mice infected with UPEC had evidence of TNFɑ pathway activation, clustering separately from mock-infected controls and from UPEC-infected Adult Naive mice. At 6 hpi, all Resolved (3 out of 3) and Sensitized (3 out of 3) mice, but only 1 out of 3 Adult Naive mice, infected with UPEC had evidence of strong TNFɑ pathway activation, clustering apart (far left side of dendrogram) from both mock-infected mice and the remaining UPEC-infected Adult Naive mice, of which the latter were intermediate in activation status (to the left of the mock-infected mice). At 24 hpi, strong TNFɑ signaling (far left clustering on the dendrogram) was present in 4 of 6 UPEC-infected Sensitized mice, but not in any Adult Naive or Resolved mice. Nonetheless, the remaining UPEC-infected Adult Naive and Sensitized mice had varying levels of activation at 24 hpi that clearly set them apart from both mock-infected controls and UPEC-infected Resolved mice, neither of which showed evidence of TNFR pathway activation at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

We previously found that C3H/HeN mice that had experienced a prior UTI exhibit resistance to the stable formation of IBCs upon challenge infection: Resolved bladders harbored few if any IBCs at 6 hpi and none at 24 hpi, and no IBCs were observed in Sensitized bladders at either time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether TNFɑ signaling during the early phase (first six hpi) of infection mediates this intracellular colonization resistance, we used a single dose of anti-TNFɑ antibody to deplete TNFɑ prior to challenge with 10<sup>7</sup> cfu of UTI89. Bacterial colonization and IBC formation was compared to isotype-treated control mice in urine, bladders and kidneys, the latter because C3H/HeN mice are genetically prone to vesicoureteral reflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murawski et al., 2010</xref>). At 6 hpi, bladder bacterial burdens in Resolved mice given anti-TNFɑ antibody were increased relative to isotype-treated mice, while burdens in Adult Naive and Sensitized mice were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, TNFɑ depletion did not affect kidney colonization in any group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but TNFɑ-depleted Resolved mice had lower urine titers at 6 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Due to the combination of higher bladder bacterial burdens and lower urine titers at 6 hpi, we hypothesized that TNFɑ depletion may have blocked the intracellular colonization resistance phenotype in Resolved mice, thus allowing IBC formation. Using fluorescence microscopy after infection with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing UTI89, we found that TNFɑ depletion resulted in significantly more IBCs in Resolved bladders at 6 hpi, compared to isotype-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, TNFɑ depletion did not affect IBC counts at 6 hpi in Adult Naive or Sensitized mice. In Resolved mice, bladder, but not kidney, bacterial burdens remained elevated in the TNFɑ-depleted group at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). By 7 days post-infection, urine titers were elevated in TNFɑ-depleted Resolved mice relative to isotype-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that the increased IBC formation was allowing for more robust and longer-lasting infections. However, though TNFɑ depletion made Resolved mice more susceptible to acute cystitis upon challenge, a single dose of anti-TNFɑ antibody was insufficient to overcome their resistance to chronic infection, as 0 of 11 mice treated with anti-TNFɑ developed chronic cystitis lasting 4 weeks, compared to 0 of 11 mice treated with isotype. Nonetheless, TNFɑ depletion was sufficient to overcome intracellular colonization resistance during acute cystitis in Resolved, but not Sensitized mice.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46677.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>TNFα depletion increases intracellular bladder bacterial burdens in Resolved mice during acute rUTI.</title><p>Adult Naive (blue symbols), Resolved (gold symbols), and Sensitized (purple symbols) mice were treated with anti-TNFα (open circles) or isotype control (solid circles) antibody 18 hr prior to infection with 10<sup>7</sup> cfu UTI89 and sacrificed at indicated time points.

We found that TNFɑ depletion in Sensitized mice resulted in a significant reduction in bladder bacterial burdens at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), with a decrease in median bladder titer from 3.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/bladder in isotype-treated mice to 8.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/bladder in TNFɑ-depleted mice. The effect of TNFɑ depletion in Sensitized mice was specific to the bladder, as kidney and urine bacterial burdens were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). TNFɑ depletion also significantly reduced bladder inflammation (edema) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), but, unlike with Resolved mice, did not affect the degree of pyuria observed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>.

In immunocompetent individuals, an initial infectious disease episode—particularly one that can lead to chronic inflammation, such as upper respiratory infections (sinusitis, tonsillitis, and nasopharyngitis) and urinary tract infections—can act as a potent effector of tissue remodeling that predisposes to recurrent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hooton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nuhoglu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toews, 2005</xref>). In this work, we sought to understand the molecular basis for how the character of an initial mucosal infection may affect susceptibility to recurrent infection using an inbred immunocompetent mouse model of recurrent UTI. Based on our prior investigations of this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Brien et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that early host-pathogen interactions at the bladder mucosa trigger time-sensitive checkpoints that determine the outcome of infection, but that the character of a prior bladder infection can alter the kinetics and downstream effects of these disease checkpoints. By investigating the nature of acute inflammation during the first 24 hr of UPEC infection in isogenic mice that differed only in their disease histories, we identified distinct patterns of bladder inflammation that dictated the severity of recurrent cystitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The nature of an initial bladder infection – self-resolving vs. long-lasting – imparts upon the bladder different capacities for TNFɑ signaling in response to recurrent infection, which in turn lead to different host outcomes: i) a history of a self-resolving infection corresponds with robust, but transient, early-onset TNFɑ signaling that leads to resistance to severe recurrent infection; whereas ii) a history of a long-lasting infection corresponds with robust early-onset TNFɑ signaling that is sustained though 24 hpi and leads to susceptibility to severe recurrent infection. Others have shown that TNFɑ plays a role in the bladder’s response to UPEC infection in naive mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gur et al., 2013</xref>). However, our study demonstrates the centrality of this response and surprisingly shows that both the kinetics and the effects of this response can vary substantially based upon host infection history. These results have significance not only for our understanding of rUTI, but also of other recurrent mucosal infections.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46677.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The outcome of a prior infection alters the balance towards either protection or susceptibility to recurrent infection through alterations in the dynamics of TNFα signaling.</title><p>Upon bacterial challenge of Resolved mice, TNFα signaling (depicted as lightning bolts) is rapid, but transient (subsiding within the first 24 hr post-challenge), leading to rapid resolution of rUTI due to early exfoliation of infected bladder epithelial cells.

TNFɑ binds to TNFR1 (expressed in most tissues, including urothelial cells) and/or TNFR2 (typically expressed by immune cells) and can activate distinct signaling cascades based on the receptors it binds to and the local microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wajant et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Bjorling, 2011</xref>). To add further complexity, both TNFɑ and the TNFRs can exist in either membrane bound or soluble forms. Both forms of TNFɑ can activate TNFR1, which leads either to NF-κB activation, cell survival, and cytokine production on the one hand, or cell death by apoptosis or necroptosis on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The balance between cell survival and cell death, as well as the inflammatory nature of the cell death in response to stimuli such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g. LPS), is influenced by many factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast, only membrane-bound TNFɑ can activate TNFR2, thereby stimulating cell-mediated immunity, including activation of monocytes and lymphocytes, production of cytokines, and mediation of cytotoxic activity to promote host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horiuchi et al., 2010</xref>). Although the pathway analysis employed in this study cannot distinguish between the two TNFR signaling pathways because of substantial overlap in the downstream regulated gene sets, it is likely that both TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling are occurring in the bladder. Our use of whole bladder RNA-seq precludes us from identifying the cell types producing and responding to TNFɑ at this time.</p><p>The involvement of TNFɑ in both tissue damage and tissue regeneration represents an interesting functional duality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wajant et al., 2003</xref>), and consequently, the host must tightly regulate TNFɑ activation to prevent damaging inflammation. We found that a major distinction between the responses of Sensitized and Resolved mice to bacterial challenge was the duration of TNFɑ signaling. Whereas Resolved mice had largely shut down TNFɑ signaling and bladder inflammation by 24 hpi, effectively nipping the infection in the bud, Sensitized mice had sustained TNFɑ signaling pathway activation in the bladder at 24 hpi, which contributed to the development of more severe infection. Adult Naive mice also had evidence of sustained bladder TNFɑ signaling pathway activation, though it was slower to develop and not as robust as in Sensitized mice at 24 hpi. The dynamics of bladder inflammation in Resolved mice—that is, robust early phase that is rapidly quenched by 24 hpi—has also been reported in juvenile naive C57BL/6 mice, which are naturally resistant to severe acute and chronic cystitis with UPEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mulvey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingersoll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to our findings in Resolved mice, a prior study found no effect on overall neutrophil recruitment to the bladder in <italic>juvenile naive</italic> TNFR-/- vs WT C57BL/6J mice at 6 hpi, though transmigration of neutrophils across the bladder epithelium and exfoliation of infected bladder cells was impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiwon et al., 2014</xref>). While genotype can dictate these differences in the dynamics of host response in <italic>naive</italic> mice, our studies show that these dynamics are plastic and can be reshaped by non-germline factors such as prior infections and inflammation. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that superinfection of C57BL/6 mice can result in chronic cystitis, which subsequently sensitizes these mice to severe rUTI upon challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We elucidated that previously infected C3H/HeN mice, regardless of disease outcome, shared an accelerated pattern of robust TNFɑ signaling and bladder inflammation relative to age-matched naive mice in the first 6 hours of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In naive mice, a critical event in bladder disease pathogenesis in the acute stages of <italic>E. coli</italic> infection is the formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs), which allow the bacteria to rapidly increase in number while avoiding host defenses. However, previously infected C3H/HeN mice harbor very few, if any, IBCs at 6 hpi, a phenomenon we have termed ‘intracellular colonization resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). We found that in Resolved mice, abrogation of TNFɑ signaling disrupted intracellular colonization resistance by reducing the recruitment of neutrophils to the bladder and exfoliation of IBC-containing cells, thus resulting in abundant IBCs detected in the bladder epithelium at 6 hpi. TNFɑ induces downstream targets (e.g. neutrophil chemokines such as CXCL1) that stimulate neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection, supporting our observations of decreased neutrophil recruitment to the bladder and pyuria in TNFɑ-depleted Resolved mice. In contrast, Sensitized mice were unable to harbor IBCs in the presence or absence of TNFɑ signaling, likely due to the significantly smaller size of the superficial umbrella cells (average surface area approximately one eighth that of Adult Naive umbrella cells four weeks after the initiation of antibiotics), which likely restricts IBC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Brien et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we found that the mechanism of intracellular colonization resistance differs between Sensitized and Resolved mice.</p><p>We found that the kinetics of TNFɑ expression and pathway activation mirrored the kinetics of <italic>Ptgs2</italic> (COX-2) expression regardless of disease history, suggesting that TNFɑ signaling may be associated with <italic>Ptgs</italic>2 expression during bladder infection. COX-2 signaling is known to affect susceptibility to chronic and recurrent UTI in C3H/HeN mice, as COX-2-dependent severe inflammation and neutrophil transmigration through the bladder was shown to cause mucosal wounding leading to chronic cystitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>). Experimental suppression of COX-2-mediated acute inflammation with COX-2 inhibitors prevents chronic cystitis in naive mice and is a potent suppressor of recurrent UTI in Sensitized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2016</xref>). TNFɑ is capable of inducing COX-2 expression in some systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2001</xref>). However, whether COX-2 acts downstream of TNFɑ or both are activated by a common mechanism in mice during UPEC infection remains to be elucidated. While TNFɑ depletion in Sensitized mice phenocopied COX-2 inhibition in certain ways (e.g. reduced edema and reduced bacterial titers), unlike COX-2 inhibition, it did not affect pyuria, suggesting that neutrophil transmigration across the urothelium is independent of TNFɑ signaling in Sensitized mice. Taken together, these prior studies and our findings here elucidate an interesting dichotomy: whereas in Resolved mice, moderate, TNFɑ-mediated neutrophil recruitment to the bladder and subsequent exfoliation of IBC-containing urothelial cells allows for the clearance of infection, in Sensitized mice prolonged TNFɑ-signaling, coupled with COX-2 mediated transmigration of neutrophils across the bladder epithelium, exacerbates inflammation and mucosal wounding to promote severe acute cystitis. These different effects of TNFɑ signaling on the severity of recurrent cystitis may be a consequence of differences in epithelial remodeling that we previously demonstrated by quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>), and/or could be due to differences in bladder resident immune cell populations.</p><p>A question that this study was unable to answer is how the acute bladder inflammatory response is dampened so rapidly in Resolved mice. Although the RNA-seq pathway analysis gave some indication of activation of anti-inflammatory pathways in Resolved mice at 24 hpi, there was not a strong anti-inflammatory transcriptional signature that was also entirely absent in Sensitized mice. It may be that a unique, transient transcriptional signature arises in Resolved mice between the 6 and 24 hpi time points sampled, or alternatively, it may be that Resolved mouse bladders have additional inherent differences that are not evidenced by transcriptional changes. Previous ex vivo proteomics studies of urothelial cells isolated from convalescent mice suggested that the Sensitized urothelium is more susceptible to inflammatory cell death, neutrophil mediated damage, wounding, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hannan et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the rapid elimination of intracellular bacterial communities in Resolved bladders, coupled with an inherent increased propensity for the Resolved urothelium to heal relative to the Sensitized urothelium, may explain the differences seen at 24 hpi. Understanding the specific mechanisms that allow Resolved mice to quickly quench bladder inflammation is an avenue of research that requires further investigation.</p><p>In summary, we show here that the nature and pattern of the bladder mucosal inflammatory response to UPEC infection, and particularly the dynamics of TNFɑ signaling, can be shaped by a prior infection in a way that dramatically alters host resistance to rUTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our studies indicate that TNFɑ signaling is a critical central mediator of bladder mucosal immune response to UPEC but can have different effects on acute disease outcome in previously infected mice depending upon the character of the prior infection. This central role is supported by clinical data indicating that prolonged use of anti-TNFɑ therapy in patients increases the risk of UTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding the underlying host mechanisms that dictate patient susceptibility to recurrent infections is critical for developing effective new therapies that target the host inflammatory response as an alternative strategy to combat rapidly increasing antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, female)</td><td>C3H/HeN</td><td>Envigo</td><td>C3H/HeN Hsd</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>UTI89 pANT4</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0308125100">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0308125100</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Justice et al., 2004</xref>)</td><td/><td>Episomal enhanced GFP;

During this time, longitudinal urinalysis was continued weekly to confirm clearance of bacteriuria. Four to six weeks after the initiation of antibiotic therapy mice were challenged with 10<sup>7</sup> or 10<sup>8</sup> cfu of UTI89-<italic>SpcR</italic>. Mice were humanely euthanized at various time points and tissue titers determined as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>TNFɑ depletion in mice</title><p>Mice were administered anti-TNFɑ antibody (clone XT3.11) or isotype control (clone HRPN) (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) via intraperitoneal injection 18 hr before infection.

Bladder homogenates were obtained via bead beating as described above, and after cfu plating, the remaining homogenates were spun down at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and the supernatants were stored at −80°C. Cytokine expression in bladder homogenate supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using DuoSet kits (R and D Systems, DY406, DY453, DY479) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with the following modifications: incubation with the capture antibody was lengthened to overnight at 4°C, and washes between incubations were performed five times instead of 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Histopathology and immunofluorescence</title><p>Mice were infected with 10<sup>8</sup> cfu of UPEC or PBS and were humanely euthanized at indicated time points. For histopathology assessment, bladders were excised, fixed with Methacarn (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid), embedded in paraffin blocks, and cut into 5 µm sections. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining was performed and bladder sections were scored in a blinded fashion by a veterinarian using a semi-quantitative scoring system: 0 = normal, 1 = subepithelial cell inflammatory infiltration (focal and multifocal), 2 = edema and subepithelial inflammatory cell infiltration (diffuse), 3 = marked subepithelial inflammatory cells with necrosis and neutrophils in and on bladder mucosal epithelium, 4 = inflammatory cell infiltrate extends into muscle in addition to criteria for grade 3, 5 = loss of surface epithelium (necrosis with full-thickness inflammatory cell infiltration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hopkins et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Mice were infected with 10<sup>7</sup> cfu UPEC and were humanely euthanized at the indicated time point.

Cell surface markers were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (F4/80, CD11b, Ly6G from Biolegend and BD Biosciences) in FcR block (Biolegend). Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI) prior to analysis on a FacsCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Neutrophils were identified according to the following surface marker profile: CD45<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>-</sup> and relative abundance was reported as a percentage of live (PI<sup>-</sup>) cells.

Bladders were fixed in their native state (prior to harvest) using the ‘balloon method’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the body cavity was opened, a catheter was inserted transurethrally and bladders were inoculated with 50 ul freshly prepared SEM fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate, pH 7.4, warmed to 37°C). The bladder was clamped with a hemostat before the catheter was withdrawn, and then excised and placed in 1 ml EM fixative overnight. Bladders were then bisected, post-fixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, further dehydrated at 31.1°C and 1072 p.s.i. for 16 min in a critical point dryer, then sputter-coated with 10 nm iridium and imaged on a Zeiss Crossbeam 540 FIB-SEM or a Zeiss Merlin FE-SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Mice infected with 10<sup>8</sup> cfu of UPEC or PBS were humanely euthanized at indicated time points.

Briefly, fragmented, dephosphorylated total RNA was ligated to barcoded DNA adapters carrying 5’-AN<sub>8</sub>-3’ barcodes and a 3’ blocking group. Barcoded RNAs were pooled, depleted of rRNA using RiboZero (Illumina MRZG12324), then reverse transcribed using SMARTScribe (Clontech) as described to add an adapter to the 3’ end of the cDNA by template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>). Addition of Illumina P5 and P7 sequences to these cDNAs was achieved by PCR using tailed oligos targeting adapter sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The resulting libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Nextseq 2500 platform to generate paired end reads. Samples were processed for library construction and sequencing in two batches: PBS mock-infected and UPEC-infected bladder RNA samples taken at 3.5 hpi were included in batch one; whereas UPEC-infected 6 and 24 hpi bladder RNA samples were processed 5 months later using the same reagents in batch two. Sequencing reads from each sample in a pool were demultiplexed based on their associated barcode sequence using custom scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/split_merge_pl">https://github.com/broadinstitute/split_merge_pl</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/split_merge_pl">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/split_merge_pl</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandyopadhyay, 2019</xref>). Up to one mismatch in the barcode was allowed provided it did not make assignment of the read to a different barcode possible. Barcode sequences were removed from the first read as were terminal G’s from the second read that may have been added by SMARTScribe during template switching. Reads were aligned to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> Ensembl sequence GRCm38r94p6 mm10 using bbmap_37.10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/">https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/</ext-link>) and read counts were assigned to annotated transcripts using Salmon_0.8.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patro et al., 2017</xref>).

Statistical significance in gene expression differences were assessed by the Wald test and multiple comparison errors were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate correction (P<sub>adjusted</sub>). P<sub>adjusted</sub> &lt;0.05 was used as the cutoff for significantly differentially expressed genes without a fold-change cutoff. IPA employs a right-tailed Fisher’s exact test, with P<sub>adjusted</sub> &lt;0.05 deemed significantly enriched. A fold change cutoff of 2 was used in IPA analysis. Principal component analyses were performed with DESeq2 rlog counts using default settings in DESeq2 and including batch number as a variable to correct for any batch effect. 2) Microbiology, immunology, and pathology: statistical significance of bladder, urine, and kidney bacterial titers, histopathology scores, bladder edema, cytokine expression level, pyuria, IBC counts, and flow cytometry were assessed by Mann-Whitney U when comparing two groups or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons when comparing three or more groups. All the above items used two-tailed tests. 3) For all experiments, each data point came from an individual mouse, which is our definition of a biological replicate. For ELISA experiments, two technical replicates (bladder supernatant from the same mouse were applied to two wells of the ELISA plate) were assayed per biological replicate and the average value was plotted. 4) No specific computation of sample size was applied beforehand. Sample size for each experiment was determined a priori and following convention in the field: 3–7 mice per group per replicate experiment, with a minimum of 2–3 replicate experiments (except for RNAseq experiments).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Danielle Liu for technical assistance and Karen Dodson for editorial assistance. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 DK51406 to SJH, U01 AI95542 to MC, SJH and TJH, K08 AI083746 to TJH); the Office of Research on Women’s Health Specialized Center of Research (P50 DK64540), URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov">https://orwh.od.nih.gov</ext-link>; a National Institutes of Health Mucosal Immunology Studies Team consortium Young Investigator Award (U01 AI095776 to TJH), URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mucosal.org">https://www.mucosal.org</ext-link>; and the National Science Foundation (Graduate Research Fellowship #DGE–114395 to VPO), URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">https://www.nsfgrfp.org/</ext-link>. As well, scanning electron microscopy sample preparation and imaging was conducted at the Washington University Center for Cellular Imaging (WUCCI), which is supported by the Washington University School of Medicine, The Children’s Discovery Institute of Washington University and St. Louis Children’s Hospital (CDI-CORE-2015–505), and the Foundation for Barnes-Jewish Hospital (3770).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mucosal infection rewires TNFα signaling dynamics to skew susceptibility to recurrence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark A Schembri.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the present study, you elaborate on a strong model to study recurrent UTI to study how the outcome of a first infection impacts the outcome of a new one. Briefly, C3H/HeN mice initially exposed to UPEC can spontaneously resolve or develop a chronic cystitis requiring antibiotic treatment, each outcome predisposing a new infection to be mild or acute, respectively. You carried out a 24hr time course transcriptomics analysis on Naïve/Resolved/Sensitized UPEC infected and Naïve/Resolved/Sensitized mock mice allowing you to present strong evidence to show that TNFα plays a central role in this response. The robust early immune response (6hpi) was characterized by an increase in TNFα and Cox-2 signaling that resulted in increased neutrophil recruitment and urothelium exfoliation. However, those mice that had previously resolved a UTI were able to dampen this immune response by 24 hours, while sensitized mice were not, leading to enhanced inflammation and increased severity of infection.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the study is very well conducted and that findings are exciting with the potential to improve understanding of other mucosal infections that are also associated with high rates of recurrence. They deem the results convincingly supported by the experimental data, but request to see a few revisions to your work before it can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How do resolving mice dampen or control the TNFα response is an unanswered question. What differs between the two groups that allows resolving mice to dampen the response, but leaves sensitized mice activated? Did the RNA-seq allow to identify any pathways at 24 hour that might provide a clue?</p><p>2) Figure 3: Some technical aspects on the transcriptomics are missing like the RNA quality (to be added in the Materials and methods) and a supplementary file giving the detail of all the libraries generated (with the barcode associated).</p><p>3) Figure 3: It would be interesting to compare the results of 'adult Naïve PBS', 'Sensitized PBS' and 'Resolved PBS' with a PCA analysis. Since these are the baseline experiments, one would like to understand how the initial conditions vary between the different group of mice.</p><p>4) Figure 3: Similar experiments have been reported by the authors previously – in the supplementary materials, is it possible to compare the present results with those published before?</p><p>5) Figure 3: please integrate a PCA that compiles all the experiments to have a global view of the data.</p><p>6) Please include a model in the discussion detailing the disease progression for each group (Resolving vs. Sensitized).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46677.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How do resolving mice dampen or control the TNFα response is an unanswered question.

Nevertheless, there was some evidence of modest differential activation of anti-inflammatory pathways in Resolved mice at 24 hpi.
