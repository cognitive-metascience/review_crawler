needs minimal image registration and related post-processing. Obstacles blocking wider adoption of FIB-SEM include slow imaging speed and lack of long-term system stability, which caps the maximum possible acquisition volume. Here, we present techniques that accelerate image acquisition while greatly improving FIB-SEM reliability, allowing the system to operate for months and generating continuously imaged volumes &gt; 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>. These volumes are large enough for connectomics, where the excellent z resolution can help in tracing of small neuronal processes and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming human proofreading effort. Even higher resolution can be achieved on smaller volumes. We present example data sets from mammalian neural tissue, <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> to illustrate the power of this novel high-resolution technique to address questions in both connectomics and cell biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25916.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25916.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Precise three-dimensional imaging can help make sense of microscopic details in biology. These images are usually built up from many two-dimensional images stacked on top of each other. One approach for examining particularly fine details, such as the connections between nerve cells in the brain, is called focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (or FIB-SEM for short). This approach works by creating an image of the surface layer of a sample, which is then stripped away using a beam of charged particles to reveal the layer beneath. The new surface can then be imaged and so on, through the whole sample.</p><p>Unfortunately, FIB-SEM devices are currently slow and can only run for a short time, leading to a lack of continuity in the stack of images. FIB-SEM would allow faster, more accurate and detailed studies of connections between brain cells, and other elaborate biological systems, if the technology could be made faster and more reliable over months of continuous operation. The current technical challenge is to create a system that can, for example, successfully image and analyse all the connections between the more than 100 thousand cells that make up the brain of a fruit fly – a common model organism in neurobiology.</p><p>Xu et al. aimed to create a technique to image a complete fly brain, with gaps of just 8 nanometres between each image in a stack, within a reasonable timeframe. By improving how FIB-SEM signals are detected, making use of advances in ion beam controls, and by engineering ways to recover from system malfunctions, Xu et al. developed an enhanced FIB-SEM device. To demonstrate its value, the new technology was used to create images of a third of a fruit fly’s brain, parts of a mouse’s brain, and cells of a single-celled alga called <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>.</p><p>The results show that large and complex samples can be successfully imaged in their entirety to adequate detail, enabling high-quality reconstruction of the connections between nerve cells. The level of detail, which can be further increased for smaller samples, offers advantages in precision and image quality over other comparable techniques. As well as helping to study the brain, this approach could also be used to examine details inside cells. Future work to advance this technology will enable larger and more complete imaging of elaborate biological structures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25916.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25916.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>3D cellular structure</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>FIB</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>C Shan</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayworth</surname><given-names>Kenneth J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Zhiyuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>Krishna K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name><name><surname>Hess</surname><given-names>Harald F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division - SISGRKN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>Krishna K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>Krishna K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS-039444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complete neuronal circuits can be reconstructed, and whole eukaryotic cells imaged, at less than 10 nm isotropic resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many modalities of electron microscopy (EM) can probe cellular structure at the nanometer scale. However, despite considerable progress over the past decade in developing high-resolution 3D imaging, there remain important limitations, reflecting an inherent trade-off between resolution and the size of the 3D volume. Different currently available EM methods, and their advantages and disadvantages have been reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Titze and Genoud, 2016</xref>). For demanding applications such as tracing neuronal processes in three dimensions, high resolution in the z axis, in addition to the xy plane, is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lichtman and Denk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meinertzhagen, 2016</xref>). FIB-SEM offers exactly this capability, with x, y, and z resolution all &lt;10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu and Hess, 2011</xref>), in addition to other significant advantages, such as superior registration and fully automated operation. However, to date the FIB-SEM approach has seldom been used in neuroscience because of its severe volume limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmstaedter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denk et al., 2012</xref>), typically less than the extent of a single neuron.</p><p>FIB-SEM was originally developed for semiconductor and material research applications without requirements for imaging large volumes; only in the past decade has it been explored as a tool for 3D biological imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu and Hess, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Narayan and Subramaniam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). The typical 3D FIB-SEM procedure uses a focused ion beam to ablate a few nanometer layer from the specimen block-face, followed by SEM imaging of the freshly exposed surface. These steps cycle continually until the entire 3D volume is ablated and imaged. The distinctive advantage of FIB-SEM is the fine z thickness removed with each step, which gives z resolution down to a few nanometers. In contrast, the current state-of-the-art technologies based on diamond knife sectioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayworth et al., 2006</xref>) or diamond knife block-face removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wanner et al., 2015</xref>) lose consistency when attempting z steps between adjacent images below 20 nm. Deconvolution based on multiple images with varying landing energies can improve z resolution on thin sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boughorbel et al., 2012</xref>; FEI Teneo VS Technology: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fei.com/teneo-for-life-sciences/">http://www.fei.com/teneo-for-life-sciences/</ext-link>), but only to a limited extent. Electron tomography, based on tilting thin sections in TEM, provides excellent z resolution but becomes impractical for reconstructing thick samples due to the tedious stitching requirements of a long series of these tomograms from sequential sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Soto et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Most of these EM techniques yield very different resolutions in the x, y, and z directions, and reduced resolution in any one axis can introduce significant burden to subsequent image processing and analysis such as segmentation and proofreading in connectomics studies. Figure 2 and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> illustrate this shortcoming by comparing experimental isotropic 3D data and simulated 3D data with a 40 nm sampling interval in z. The anisotropic image stack was generated by averaging 10 frames of the nearly isotropic 4 nm voxel data set along the z-axis to emulate data from a 40 nm section. This emulation is not identical to a TEM image stack collected from 40-nm-thick sections due to different contrast mechanisms provided by backscattered and transmitted electrons. Nevertheless, it offers a first-order comparison between the two imaging modalities, showing the limitations of TEM’s anisotropic data, where details become poorly resolved in re-sliced non-imaging planes. For example, the xz and zy planes show much degraded resolution compared to the xy image planes, due to poor z resolution. This is particularly troublesome in connectomics (the study of neural connectivity), which needs to resolve fine neural processes parallel to the xy imaging plane. In an isotropic data set, there will be no degradation of resolution at any re-sliced planes at random angles. This feature has substantial benefits for tracing neuronal circuitry, where one needs to follow fine processes that are orientated at random angles. Accordingly, we use a unifying resolution metric, where resolution is defined by the worst case in the x, y, or z direction. To elucidate biological structure, it is helpful to render 3D images, without any axial bias, with isotropic resolution. The worst-case axial resolution then dictates the appropriate minimal isotropic voxel size for sampling and rendering.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-25916-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Three-dimensional x,y,z data showing 4 nm voxels over 600 nm range of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuropil with isotropic resolution (top row), and a section where the data is binned together in z to form 4 x 4 x 40 nm<sup>3</sup> voxels, to emulate standard TEM sections.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25916.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25916.003</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>The graphical summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which shows the operating regimes of the different EM methods in terms of sample volume and minimum isotropic resolution, identifies an important region of resolution-volume space that remains inaccessible with current techniques. FIB-SEM provides a logical probe for this region, but until now, technical obstacles have blocked its use. The most prominent such obstacle is the volume limitation, dictated by the limited imaging speed and the limited duration of smooth and consistent ablation. Because the process is destructive, there is little room for error in the ablation-imaging cycle, which requires virtually perfect continuity and consistency. Here, we describe a series of measures that address these limitations, thus transforming FIB-SEM into a tool capable of probing this ‘dark’ region of resolution-volume space. We also provide examples to illustrate the potential of large volume FIB-SEM for both neurobiology and cell biology.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A comparison of various 3D imaging technologies in the application space defined by resolution and total volume.</title><p>The resolution value indicated by the bottom boundary for each technology regime represents the minimal isotropic voxel it can achieve, while the size value indicated by the right boundary is the corresponding limit in total volume. An expansion in total volume and improvement in resolution of FIB-SEM would fulfill a desired space at the lower right corner, not yet accessible with any existing technology. The three red diagonal constant imaging time contours indicate the general trade-off between resolution and total volume during FIB-SEM operations of 3 days, 3 months, and 8 years, respectively, using a single FIB-SEM system. These contours are sensitive to staining quality and contrast. The yellow star indicates the intercept between the extrapolated 8-year contour and 1 mm<sup>3</sup> volume. Considering the hot-knife overhead and machine maintenance downtime, a more realistic estimate would be ~3 years using 4 FIB-SEM systems. The boundaries of the different imaging technologies outline the regimes where they have a preferential advantage, though in practice there is considerable overlap and only a fuzzy boundary.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25916.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25916.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25916-fig1-v3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Technological improvements</title><p>With connectomics in mind, we designed a customized FIB-SEM system to address the prevailing deficiencies in imaging speed and duration. Our new system incorporates many prior improvements in ion beam and electron microscopy, and new advances that represent key enabling features for large-volume 3D imaging. The two most important technological advances are imaging speed improvement and error detection followed by seamless recovery. Negative sample biasing, an established procedure in scanning electron microscopy, is typically used to improve resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouwer et al., 2016</xref>). However, we have found that a moderate positive bias provides a simple and straightforward way to filter out secondary electrons. This scheme transforms a traditional in-column (InLens) detector into an effective backscattered electron detector that captures a larger fraction of the backscattered electrons, resulting a ~ 10x improvement of imaging speed without contrast degradation compared to a traditional energy-selective backscattered (EsB) detector alone (see Figure 11j).</p><p>Considerable engineering effort is required to gain major improvements in system reliability. Most of the individual components, especially those achieved via software controls, are not themselves innovative, but their combined effect is transformative. First, multiple layers of error and disturbance protection, including refinements and additions in hardware, software, and utilities, were introduced to prevent catastrophic failures such as an uncontrolled sample ablation. Detailed descriptions of these strategies can be found in the Technology and Methods section. Second, an extension of the closed-loop control of the ion beam (first introduced by Denk and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boergens and Denk, 2013</xref>]) maintained stability, and enabled a seamless restart of the imaging cycle after interruptions. Third, the FIB column was repositioned to be 90 degrees from the SEM column instead of the standard 52–55 degrees; this enabled a shorter working distance, which enhanced the imaging quality. Together these modifications provide a speedy system with overall virtual reliability exceeding that of its individual components. Biological volumes as large as 1 million µm<sup>3</sup> containing biologically meaningful neuronal elements, such as individual modules in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, can now be routinely acquired in a few months. Furthermore, with a previously reported ultrathick partitioning technique, even larger volumes (e.g. an entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain) could potentially be subdivided into small pieces, then imaged with multiple FIB-SEM systems running in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayworth et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The capacity for sustained operation also opens an opportunity for cell biologists to explore research topics dependent upon the ability to resolve fine (&lt;5 nm) features in 3D. In such applications, a slower high-resolution imaging modality can acquire volumes up to tens of micrometers. By providing straightforward generation of large high-resolution isotropic FIB-SEM datasets, the strategies outlined here can provide clear visualization of complex fine-grained biological structures, permitting exploration of novel elements of cellular architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FIB-SEM for high-throughput connectomics</title><p>To assess the value of FIB-SEM’s superior z-axis resolution for connectomics research, a portion of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>) containing seven medulla columns was imaged at an isotropic resolution of 10 × 10 × 10 nm<sup>3</sup> voxels. The entire volume of 30 × 30 × 60 µm<sup>3</sup> was acquired over 2 weeks, and then segmented, annotated, and proofread. We compared these data with those from a previous study of equivalent material studied with classical serial-section TEM performed on 40 nm-thick sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). While TEM of sections can take beautiful images of dendrites and synapses, many important details will be obscured if they are oriented in the wrong direction, for example a fine dendrite with its axis running parallel to the image plane of a section is easily lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Accordingly, 50% more synaptic connections were detected within a single medulla column in the FIB-SEM data set than in the TEM image stack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>). These improvements in accuracy provided by FIB-SEM data analysis represent a gold standard, useful for understanding the level of completeness of a connectome derived from TEM sections. Furthermore, by imaging the intact block-face, registration and alignment is easy, unlike in serial section TEM where section tears, scratches, and distortions require complex corrections. Finally, the rate of volume reconstruction, which includes synapse identification, segmentation, and proofreading was ~3–5x faster for the FIB-SEM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Plaza, 2014</xref>), thanks to finer z resolution and better image registration.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Three orthogonal views of a (600 nm)<sup>3</sup> block of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuropil with isotropic 4 nm voxels and anisotropic (4 x 4 x 40 nm<sup>3</sup>) voxels derived from the isotropic data to emulate 40-nm section data.</title><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> corresponds to this Figure.

We encountered multiple unplanned system failures ranging from replacement of the SEM field emitter tip to complete pump failure, in addition to more than 20 planned interruptions reflecting the need to replenish the FIB source every 4–6 days. With a standard FIB-SEM system, these interruptions would have led to multiple gaps and other defects in the final image stack that would make it virtually impossible to perform any large-scale reconstructions of connectivity. However, our customized FIB-SEM system was designed to pause the system promptly when interruptions occurred, and to resume seamlessly after the system returned to normal operation. Only one noticeable imperfection associated with system shutdown and source replacement was passed down to the final 3D volume images. Data from this run are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>, which render x-z and y-z re-sliced views of a large volume that includes medulla, lobula, and lobula plate. Because the voxels were isotropic, re-slicing did not degrade image resolution. Plasma membranes, presynaptic T-bars, and postsynaptic densities were clearly visible in both renderings. Importantly, there were no visible discontinuities due to system interrupts other than the one noted above (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

We have addressed this by a hot knife partitioning method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayworth et al., 2015</xref>) that subdivides a larger sample into 20 µm-thick slabs. The method preserves sample quality to within ~20 nm of the cut surface, enabling effective stitching of 3D connectomic data across the cut slabs. An overview of hot knife partitioning and imaging results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

A complete fly brain of 30 slabs could be imaged in ~5 FIB-SEM-years of acquisition time; because the approach is scalable, multiple FIB-SEM machines could be used to reduce the total time required.

The ability to explore synaptic motifs and other details of neuropil at high resolution can be very helpful in interpreting the larger volume but poorer resolution data sets required to generate a full connectome. The operating conditions needed, including lower current to reduce chromatic and spherical aberrations, and lower electron landing energy to reduce point spread function size along z-axis, require lower acquisition rates, implying smaller sampled volumes. The typical trade-off between resolution and volume for a given time constraint is illustrated by constant time contours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (assuming our baseline <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples are used).

This high-quality data provides significantly more accurate estimates of synaptic connectivity than possible for lower-resolution stacks. Moreover, data of this quality will permit highly automated reconstruction, thus greatly reducing the time required for manual proofreading.

As an illustration of how further cellular details can be extracted from our FIB-SEM data set, we cropped out a thin spherical shell that starts at the nuclear envelope, extending 50 nm outward. By masking out backgrounds from inside the nucleus and those beyond 50 nm outside the nuclear envelope, we can restrict visualization to structures at or very close to the nuclear surface. This shell (rendered as a 3D section of a sphere in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>) reveals all the polyribosomes that decorate the exterior surface of the nucleus. Similar spirals of paired ribosome necklaces were seen previously in EM sections that happened to intersect the polyribosomes at just the right angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 1987</xref>). Here, by virtue of the isotropic character of the 3D data, one is no longer sampling a fortuitous section of the cell generated by the geometry of sectioning. Consequently, it is now possible to count all the polyribosomes on the whole nucleus. The insert of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref> shows the nuclear pores, with their eightfold symmetry, in relation to these polyribosomes.

This limitation deprives one of opportunities 1) to understand the true limits of SEM performance, 2) to optimize acquisition and identify inefficiencies, 3) to quantify absolute staining levels in samples, 4) to distinguish instrument vs sample factors, and 5) to cross-compare performance across different labs, samples, and FIB-SEM instruments. Initially, motivated by our desire to improve the speed of traditional SEM imaging, we needed to get a better understanding of the mechanisms by which backscattered electrons generate contrast, and to better define the ultimate limits of collection/detection efficiency. By comparing experimental results from specimens of known chemical compositions (gold, epoxy resin, and metal-organic compounds) with theoretical simulations using Monte Carlo methods for electron scattering (Figures 13, 15 and 17) and SIMION for electron optics (Figure 14), we characterized baselines under different sample biasing conditions (Figures 11 and 12). The general agreement between simulation and experimental results guided us to optimize SEM imaging with minimal artifacts (Figure 11). As a foundation for the experiments reported here, we also established two independent methods of quantifying the signal in terms of electrons detected. These explicit electron counts can be compared against models of electron scattering and also to reference standards, to establish best operating conditions (the results are detailed in the Technology and methods section).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Imaging large volumes</title><p>A current milestone in connectomics is to image a 1 mm<sup>3</sup> volume. This is a daunting task for FIB-SEM, given its slower imaging speed compared to other competing methods. With the current throughput used for <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, it would take approximately 100 years to acquire 1 mm<sup>3</sup> volume at 8 × 8 × 8 nm<sup>3</sup> voxel resolution with a single system. However, the task might not be as hopeless as it seems. First, we have seen less demand for resolution in applications requiring large volumes. For example, mammalian brains have relatively larger processes and synapses compared to those of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Mouse neuronal circuits should be traceable with minimal isotropic voxel of 16 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mikula and Denk, 2015</xref>). Secondly, protocols for mammalian sample preparation produce higher contrast than those for insects, which allows shorter imaging time. Being able to image with larger voxels benefits FIB-SEM volume throughput in two ways: fewer voxels (to the third power) and the ability to use larger imaging current, which allows shorter scanning dwell time to achieve the same shot noise, though the FIB milling overhead is increased. Based on limited data comparing <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse cortex samples acquired on the same FIB-SEM system, we estimate an 8x improvement on volume imaging speed with mammalian brain tissue. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, one could reach 1 mm<sup>3</sup> with 16 × 16 × 16 nm<sup>3</sup> voxels using a single FIB-SEM system in 8 years. Given that we can acquire samples from multiple systems running in parallel, one could expect a more feasible timeline: with our current capacity of four production systems, we estimate that a 1 mm<sup>3</sup> volume could be imaged in a total of 3 years, including hot-knife overhead and machine maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The technical developments reported here now make it feasible to extend the intrinsic advantages of FIB-SEM, including excellent z resolution, isotropic voxels, and easy 3D data acquisition to larger volumes, by allowing long-term imaging for weeks, months, or even years. These enhancements can be adopted by other labs or on commercial systems to transform FIB-SEM into an effective tool for connectomics, which demands both high data quality and large data sets. The higher resolution mode of SEM imaging (~4 nm isotropic) can also be harnessed to study volumes of 5–50 µm linear dimension, providing a more detailed view of neuropil to guide the connectomics effort. For cell biology, the access to fine resolution and complete eukaryotic cell-sized volumes make this a practical alternative to the difficult and tedious stitched serial section tomographic TEM approaches now available. Thus, the technical advances reported here open new vistas for the study of biological structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Technology and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>FIB-SEM limitations</title><p>SEM imaging is usually slower than that of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for several reasons. First, SEM acquires images pixel-by-pixel in series, whereas TEM acquires all pixels of the image in parallel, with orders of magnitude larger imaging current. Second, SEM detects backscattered or secondary electrons, emitted at a much smaller flux than the transmitted electrons measured by TEM. Third, the low SEM landing energy of &lt;2 keV typically used to reduce the electron penetration depth into the block-face (thus increasing z-axis resolution) can reduce contrast, especially below 800 eV (Figure 15). Fourth, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a pixel depends on the number of primary electrons devoted to it, which in turn is determined by the beam current. For resolution of &lt;10 nm at low landing energy, the incoming electron beam current must be limited to &lt;10 nA, since higher current beams require larger apertures, which are subject to greater spherical and chromatic aberrations as well as Coulomb repulsion, creating unacceptable blur in the beam spot. Finally, post-staining is commonly used in TEM and ATUM-SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayworth et al., 2006)</xref> sections to enhance contrast, whereas FIB-SEM must image the block surface without benefit of the extra contrast from post-staining. As a result of all these factors, FIB-SEM and other block-face scanning methods (e.g. serial block-face scanning electron microscopy) require a lower image acquisition rate than TEM to achieve the same SNR.</p><p>Along with slow throughput, the limited duration of continuous FIB-SEM data acquisition constrains the useable volume. FIB-SEM is destructive and does not allow re-imaging, imposing formidable requirements on system reliability. Interrupts have a direct impact on the total contiguous imaging volume. System drift, routine maintenance, facilities interrupts, or system failures can all terminate a 3D FIB-SEM operation. Focus or beam stigmation of SEM can drift from its optimal settings within 1–2 days, due to environmental or sample stage instability. A pause in the milling/imaging operation is normally needed to correct these drifts and restore image quality. Moreover, a FIB gallium source has a lifetime limited to 3–4 months of continuous operation, and requires reheat or ‘flashing’ every 3 to 5 days. Even without facility or system failures, these regular maintenance events impose hard limits on continuous data acquisition, and thereby the size of contiguous high-quality data sets that can be collected with standard FIB-SEM systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FIB-SEM system customization for continuous long-term acquisition</title><p>The ability to operate the system for long periods is crucial for imaging large volumes. Unfortunately, there are many potential interruptions to a FIB-SEM system, with intervals ranging from a few hours to a year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Some of them relate to system reliability, which is challenging to improve. Others are regular maintenance items that are impossible to eliminate, such as FIB source reheat (3 days) and replacement (3 months). Since FIB-SEM image acquisition is destructive, any interrupt could be detrimental. For example, a spike in room temperature may cause the SEM focus to drift, and the FIB beam-pointing position relative to the specimen to change, potentially damaging the sample and sabotaging the continuity required for neural tracing of fine processes across the brain. To address these frequent interrupts, we have developed a system that immediately pauses to prevent damage, and resumes seamlessly after restoration of normal operation. By providing high virtual reliability, this system greatly expands the total imaging volume possible.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Major challenges to long-term reliability and stability of FIB-SEM systems.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) System failure modes with different frequencies of occurrence and resume challenges.

For example, switching from a failed main air handler to an auxiliary unit will produce a transient in room temperature of &lt;0.5°C. Although costly, these facility upgrades are the foundation of stable long-term operation. A second layer of protection is achieved by monitoring environmental parameters like room temperature, so that the system can be paused quickly in the event of an anomalous excursion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>In-line image auto-optimization</title><p>During extended image acquisition, SEM focus, stigmation, and aperture alignment must be optimized periodically to correct drift of various components. Traditionally, these adjustments are performed manually off-line, causing interrupts to the continuous milling and imaging process. Besides increasing overhead, this approach introduces further errors by disturbing the steady state of milling and imaging cycles. The in-line optimization procedure described below effectively overcomes the deficiencies in conventional methods. Recognizing these problems, a functionally similar approach was previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">(Binding et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our approach, a ‘focus index’ (<italic>FI</italic>) based on the strength of the highest spatial frequency components is calculated to assess the focus quality for each acquired image. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow/><mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where the original 2D image <italic>I</italic> is smoothed by 2D Gaussian functions of a shorter (<italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub>) and a longer (<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>) length scale that straddles the resolution limit. Typical standard deviation values for Gaussian distributions <italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub> are 1 and 4 pixels, respectively. The total root mean square pixel-to-pixel difference between those two smoothed images averaged over the total number of pixels (<italic>n</italic>) is assigned to the original image as a focus index, where <italic>i </italic>is the index of each pixel. A higher focus index indicates more high spatial frequency content, and therefore a better-focused image. The focus index value depends upon the highest spatial frequency features of the sample, the actual focus of the electron beam spot, and the signal intensity. When comparing neighboring frames in a 3D FIB-SEM image stack, there proved to be only minimal variations in either sample features or signal intensity, so focus index is conveniently sensitive to the beam spot size. Alternatively, the <italic>FI</italic> can be obtained by other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binding et al., 2013</xref>) that quantify the ‘sharpness’ of an image.</p><p>To initiate an in-line auto focus procedure, a series of SEM images are taken (as part of the ongoing FIB-SEM acquisition) 1–2 µm over- and under-focus from the current value. A parabolic curve fit to the focus index vs. defocus is used to extract the optimal focus setting, maximizing the focus index. Upper and lower bounds of the optimal setting are specified to prevent outliers. This derived optimal setting is then applied to subsequent images (correcting for the anticipated z removal from milling that is incorporated into the target focus setting). Using the same basic approach, stigmation and aperture alignment settings for x and y axes are also optimized. After the system reaches steady state for milling and imaging (typically within 1–2 hr), a few iterations of the auto-focus, stigmation, and alignment routine are used to optimize SEM imaging condition. To continually correct subsequent slow drifts of the system, the routine is automatically triggered by software every 200 frames or every few hours. This infrequent sampling and almost imperceptible defocus minimizes any possible compromise in the data quality. Importantly, it does not introduce any throughput overhead or additional radiation damage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>Closed-loop control for FIB milling</title><p>The precision sectioning process is the most unforgiving component of FIB-SEM. Loss of control of the focused ion beam can destructively ablate as much as a full micrometer of material without the associated imaging, thereby destroying the continuity of large data sets with potential loss of months of invested imaging effort. Even small instabilities can nucleate waves and curtains of non-uniform milling. Beyond ensuring stable ion beam parameters such as current, stigmation, and focus as intrinsic aspects of the ion column, to ensure reliability, we found it necessary to provide a feedback mechanism to regulate the ion beam milling height.</p><p>A previously described feedback scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boergens and Denk, 2013</xref>) captures the part of the 30 keV focused ion beam that does not hit the sample in a Faraday cup. This non-occluded beam current is measured and subtracted from the total beam current as measured in the FIB column Faraday cup, providing an estimate of the total beam current impinging on the sample. An increase in this impinging current raises the beam (to lessen the occlusion), whereas a decrease in beam current lowers the beam into the sample, thereby increasing milling while reducing the Faraday cup current. We use a modified version of this concept to give two further monitored values and feedback options, as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. An inner Faraday cup captures the non-scattered ion beam, but with a smaller acceptance slot consistent with the beam spread and horizontal scanning. A second annular Faraday cup captures the more widely scattered ions and milled sample material, providing a more direct measure of milling rate. Finally, a current is generated on the sample by the milling beam, which should be proportional to the milling rate. A current preamplifier that could be biased to ±800 volts enabled measurements of these currents under a wide range of sample bias voltages.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.020</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Cross-sectional diagram of closed-loop control set-up for FIB milling, showing the inner and annular Faraday cups.</title><p>A beam deflector provides fine-tuning to steer the positively charged FIB beam into the inner Faraday cup.

If feedback is based on the inner Faraday cup, operation is simple, but variations in the ion source emission properties such as beam shape are not compensated and can lead to a non-uniform milling rate. To some extent, this can be corrected with post-processing software to normalize an estimated milling (z) increment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hanslovsky et al., 2014</xref>). The sample current is a composite of multiple components, including not only the impinging positive milling ions, but also secondary electrons, as well as any charge that the milled sample atoms remove. As a result, the value and sign of the feedback is poorly determined, and under certain beam shape condition, it can be even close to zero, potentially leading to milling instabilities. A third option–feeding back on a larger annular Faraday cup that captures scattered Ga<sup>+</sup> ions and any charged ions milled from the sample–yields the most uniform milling rate, displaying only minimal sensitivity to changes in the gallium source emission profile and ion currents. We find it the preferred mode of operation, but also use bounded checks on the other currents to allow continuation of milling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-4"><title>Prompt pausing and seamless restart</title><p>To foresee upcoming interrupts and react proactively, the health of the FIB-SEM system is monitored in real-time, recording machine and environment parameters, to generate trend charts. Standard statistical process control methods are used to construct control bands of these parameters (e.g. 3x the 25–75 percentile range for the trailing 100 data points) in real-time. In the event of any excursions beyond control band limits, control software alerts the operator through email or (depending on its magnitude) automatically pauses the operation. Parameters monitored include room temperature, specimen current during FIB milling and SEM imaging, FIB beam position, image X-Y shift, image focus index, and feature change between adjacent frames, etc.</p><p>A prompt pause of the system prevents damage to the specimen, but it proved challenging to resume the operation seamlessly after system restoration. The most difficult problem was how to re-aim the FIB beam back to the position just before the pause with nanometer precision, to avoid over or under-milling. In addition, during repeat cycles of milling and imaging, steady states of charge and temperature had been established on the block-face that required specific focus and stigmation settings for the SEM. These imaging parameters were optimized for the steady state, and thus would not be suitable for a cold start. Prior to our implementation of closed-loop FIB beam positioning, these two effects led to a large number of suboptimal images. It was not uncommon to perform tens or even hundreds of milling and imaging cycles before restoration of the steady state. This could lead to a gap as wide as 100 nm in the image stack, which would be devastating for tracing neural circuits. Besides instability during re-engaging from a cold start, material removal in each milling cycle often fluctuated due to various instabilities of the system.</p><p>To ensure correct milling rate in real time, we utilized the closed-loop control of FIB described above. The ability to detect and control the positioning of the FIB beam relative to the sample block-face with no delay and overhead effectively eliminated the uncertainty for FIB re-engagement, ensuring consistent milling at all times. Furthermore, we found that when the system deviated from steady state, the SEM focus and stigmation changes correlated nicely with the lateral image shifts, which were easily obtained by registering adjacent images. Standard image registration methods such as cross correlation, Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT), or Super Robust Feature Transformation (SRFT) could be used to calculate image shifts between adjacent frames. An empirical model was developed to apply offsets derived from image shifts to the optimal imaging parameters until the steady state was restored. The time to reach steady state was significantly shortened with the aid of a shutter underneath the SEM column (see Section &quot;FIB-SEM column configuration&quot;). We found that in most cases, no offset was needed after the SEM shutter was implemented. The FIB focus was also monitored before and after gallium source reheat, and controlled for smooth continuation. By implementing these measures, image focus could be restored immediately or within one frame after a restart, eliminating seams in the final image stack.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-5"><title>Multiple magnifications at user-selected intervals</title><p>Multiple resolutions are often needed to resolve different features in an image stack, and to provide context. One option is to image the entire volume using the highest resolution needed. However, it proved far more efficient to change imaging resolution at different locations. For example, in a sample of fly brain, small and dense neuropil structures are surrounded by large cell bodies. Instead of imaging everything at high resolution, only the smaller regions of interest containing the neuronal connections are imaged at high resolution, while the larger area image(s) could be acquired more quickly at lower x, y, and z resolutions. These ROI’s of different sizes and locations are first defined in the control software by boxes overlaid on a low-magnification image. The acquisition intervals of each ROI are also specified. Pre-programed gradual lateral shifts of these ROI’s are often needed to keep the features of interest within the imaging boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-6"><title>FIB-SEM column configuration</title><p>In most commercially available FIB-SEM systems, the SEM and FIB columns are mounted at an angle of 52–55 degrees. This versatile configuration allows a wide range of applications but is suboptimal for 3D volume imaging. Because the milled block-face is not perpendicular to the SEM column, the focus (also known as working distance) of the scanning electron beam needs to be dynamically adjusted as it scans across the tilted surface; this not only affects the SEM image quality near the top and the bottom edges but also constrains the flexibility of rotating a typical rectangular scanning area to accommodate sample shapes. Moreover, the coincident point between the SEM and FIB beam is limited to ~5 mm down from the bottom of SEM column, due to space constraints of the two columns. The resulting long working distance reduces the signal, due to the smaller solid of collection (especially using the InLens detection scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weimer and Drexel, 2002</xref>]), and degrades the resolution, due to the poorer focus at longer working distance. To overcome these difficulties, we mounted an FEI Magnum FIB column perpendicular to the SEM column, onto a Zeiss Sigma or Merlin SEM system. This combined system (which we term ‘Feiss’) permitted a working distance of &lt;3 mm, producing superior SEM images with greater flexibility. We found that the column mounting orientation affects the Magnum FIB emission characteristics, and closed-loop control is required to ensure milling stability. The bottom of the SEM column was prone to contamination by FIB-sputtered material over time due to its close proximity, reducing image quality and affecting system stability especially after a system pause. Contamination of the SEM column from FIB-sputtered material was further accelerated with shorter working distance. Accordingly, a mechanical shutter was installed to shield the SEM column during FIB milling. The shutter kept the bottom of SEM column debris-free even after hundreds of thousands of milling cycles, and also greatly reduced focus and stigmation drift when the FIB re-engaged. This shutter arrangement would be even more valuable if a beneath-the-lens electron detector were used.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-7"><title>Signal quantification</title><p>A quantified SEM image signal whose grey-scale values correspond to a known number of detected electrons is an important aid to understand the properties of the SEM detector and the staining level of a sample. To achieve this quantification for any specific brightness and contrast setting of the SEM, a background image is first collected by blanking the electron beam, defining the grey value corresponding to zero electrons. The response of the SEM detector can then be calibrated using two independent methods. The first method relies on a ‘total reflection mode,’ in which a spherical specimen (a 3-mm gold-coated ball) is biased to a negative voltage equal to or higher than the energy of the incoming electron beam, sending the full beam into the detector. This primary beam current is independently calibrated with a Faraday cup. The second method uses a shot noise estimate, based on the Poisson distribution of electron counts around a mean. However, the shot noise measurement contains contributions from other noise sources, including the photomultiplier tube (1 + 1/gain) and the amplifier (1/f noise). The bandwidth limitation of the amplifier may also skew the outcome at fast scanning speeds, and the entire measurement depends on the sample. Therefore, we prefer to use the total reflection mode approach. With detector signal intensities calibrated to the true number of detected electrons, specimen qualities such as the overall staining and contrast can be quantitatively monitored and compared.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-8"><title>SEM artifact reduction</title><p>The detected electrons include both energetic backscattered electrons and lower energy but more numerous secondary electrons. Because the backscattered detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a</xref>) provides clean and excellent material contrast, it is the de facto choice for FIB-SEM applications. In the Zeiss Gemini SEM column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weimer and Drexel, 2002</xref>), each signal can be detected separately with an EsB and an InLens detector. A larger solid angle of the secondary electrons can be collected by the InLens detector, allowing faster imaging.

Alternate epoxy embedding resins such as Durcupan are much less prone to such streaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11d</xref>).

Moreover, the signal from both detectors can be combined through a simple weighted average to further lower shot noise without degrading image contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Unser and Eden, 1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-9"><title>SEM signal-to-noise ratio</title><p>SEM imaging is usually the rate-determining step in a FIB-SEM procedure, since the milling procedure is faster (typically up to a voxel size of 24 nm or greater). To understand the limits of fast imaging, it is important to consider the SNR of the image. The signal is simply the number of electrons that backscatter into a detector from an osmium or other heavy-metal-rich stained membrane, <italic>N<sub>m</sub></italic>, minus those that scattered by the unstained cytosolic region, <italic>N<sub>c</sub></italic>.

We tested bias voltages ranging from 0 to 800 V, while adjusting electron beam energy accordingly to maintain a fixed landing energy of 1.2 keV. The distance between specimen and electron column was fixed at 3 mm. Electron counts from cell membrane and cytoplasm regions over a 2 µs sampling period for each pixel were obtained based on the detector calibration. SNR and contrast for each condition was calculated. The table of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11j</xref> summarizes the typical low electron count but excellent contrast for EsB detection and the lower contrast but larger signal for wider angle InLens detection at various bias voltages.</p><p>The total electron counts with the InLens detector increased as a function of bias voltage, reaching a broad maximum between 0 and +400 V before a sharp drop-off at 600 V and beyond. This initial increase of collected electrons was likely due to a lensing effect near the column entrance that allows more electrons to reach the ring-shaped InLens detector. The dramatic decrease of electron signal with bias voltage above +600 V indicated the threshold of secondary electron removal. This threshold bias is consistent with the formation of a ~ 50 eV axial potential barrier that is formed by proximity to an +8 kV electrode together with a grounded end cap and thus capable of blocking secondary electrons to the InLens detector (Figure 14). As expected, the threshold is a function of the distance between specimen and electron column. A shorter working distance requires higher bias voltage to effectively filter out secondary electrons. The main advantage of the EsB detector is the high contrast of ~40% to 50%, compared to ~10% provided by the InLens detector. However, the total number of electrons detected by EsB is only a small fraction (≲1%) of those recorded by the InLens detector. Adding a bias voltage of +600 V nearly doubled the contrast of the InLens signal up to around 20%, while the SNR stayed above 10, about twice of that provided by EsB.</p><p>Next, we sought to quantify mammalian neuropil that was undergoing the cyclical FIB-SEM imaging and milling.

The resulting ‘artifact-free’ images have sufficient contrast and SNR for high-quality automatic segmentation of neural tissue. With this approach, we were able to boost the throughput by a factor of 10 or more over EsB detection alone. However, when the steady state FIB-SEM imaging generated only limited and tolerable artifacts (e.g. streak artifacts, which could be removed by a simple mask on the Fourier transform), the 0 to +400 V sample bias and the larger aperture of the InLens detector gave the best signal-to-noise and throughput performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Signal and resolution: comparison to ion optic and Monte Carlo simulations</title><p>To gain more insight into mechanisms underlying the detection efficiency, its limits and imaging resolution, we modeled the physics of the electron/sample interaction and the scattered electron detection efficiency, validating the models by comparison with known ‘calibration’ samples. Only a small fraction of the electrons from the incoming primary electron beam will be scattered back and collected by the detector, and an even smaller variation of that signal corresponds to the contrast generated by the stained and unstained parts of the sample. Monte Carlo simulations can provide a useful perspective. The approach described by David Joy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joy, 1991</xref>) was adopted, using the Rutherford energy loss formula between scattering events, modified to use the angle- and energy-dependent elastic scattering cross-sections for the key elements H, C, N, O, P and Os.

If such a detector could detect all electrons up to 45 degrees from the axis, then the distribution could be integrated to get a corresponding ~50% detection efficiency. This estimated 50% collection efficiency is more accurately described by electrostatic ray tracing of backscattered electrons of different energies and angles. Our modeling results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scientific Instrument Services, 2011</xref>) are shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>. For the geometry of 3 mm working distance, the electrostatic potential near the end of the objective lens and +600 V sample bias, the model shows the energy/angle values of electrons that enter the objective aperture vs. those that do not. This shows a cut-off that can indeed be approximated by 45° threshold. Also, the +600 V sample bias ensures that the secondary electrons (whose energies are below 50 eV) are excluded from detection and do not contribute artifacts to the image. However, further increase in bias beyond +600 V would reduce signal intensity, as backscattered electrons are pulled away from the detector or even back onto the sample, depending on their energy.

Post-radiated resins are subject to milling artifacts, including ‘streaks’ (static line features parallel to the milling direction, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11c,f</xref>) and ‘waves’ (dynamic uneven milling bands perpendicular to and traveling along the milling direction). The radiation responses of various resins are drastically different. For example, acrylic-based resins such as LR White and regular Epon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11c</xref>) tend to generate severe streaks and waves, whereas Durcupan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11d</xref>) can sustain much higher electron beam dose without noticeable artifacts. Various other measures (e.g. protective hard coating as milling cap layer, smaller milling current, etc.) have been developed to mitigate these side effects of electron beam radiation. If an alternate embedding plastic such as Epon is needed, one can mitigate some of the milling artifacts by coating the front face (facing the ion beam) with a 5–10 µm layer of Durcupan. Nevertheless, there is a milling depth limit in order to maintain a uniform z-step thickness. We found that for a z-step of less than 10 nm, the FIB column has difficulty milling more than 100 µm in the beam direction on Durcupan resin (assuming a nominal SEM dose of 30 electrons per nm<sup>3</sup>). To permit large volume imaging using FIB-SEM, an ultrathick partitioning method has been developed, which not only removes this potential hard barrier for large volume acquisition, but also enables high-throughput parallel 3D imaging with FIB-SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayworth et al., 2015</xref>). These 20-µm-thick slabs also require a Durcupan coating on the front side.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-5"><title>Final trimming and preparation for FIB-SEM</title><p>Samples are mounted to the top of a 1 mm metal post, if possible with the metal in contact with the metal-stained sample for better charge dissipation. A small vertical sample post is trimmed to a width of &lt;300 µm and a depth of &lt;200 µm in the direction of the ion beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>). The trimming is usually guided by optical inspection under a microtome and X-ray tomography data obtained by a Zeiss Versa XRM-510. The limited block-face size ensures a complete removal of the block-face material, rather than forming a trench in the sample. This arrangement improves milling stability by eliminating sidewall effect and back sputtering. A thin layer of conductive material of 10- to 20-nm gold followed by 50- to 100-nm carbon is coated on the trimmed sample using a Gatan 681 High-Resolution Ion Beam Coater.

The probe current was set at ~3 nA and working distance at ~4.5 mm with imaging speed of 1.25 MHz. Images acquired on a Zeiss Merlin system (hybrid with 90 degree mounted FEI Magnum FIB) used slightly different conditions: landing energy was 1.2 keV with 0.6 keV electron beam energy with a sample bias of 0.6 kV.

A 10 Hz PID closed-loop algorithm written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controlled the line scan position relative to the specimen block-face. To minimize overhead, the milling time was typically set to be less than 20% of SEM imaging time. With a 200 × 200 µm<sup>2</sup> block-face specimen, the milling time was around 10 s or less for every frame (2 nm z-step) using a 27-nA FIB probe current.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>FIB-SEM control system customization</title><p>A customized hardware, control, and software package was developed to enable long-term acquisition on a FIB-SEM system. Major hardware components included a National Instrument signal generation and acquisition system, temperature sensors, a high-voltage isolation current amplifier, and a home-built computer with RAID6 storage. A National Instrument PXIe-1082 chassis, equipped with two PXI-5421, one PXIe-5122, one PXIe-6124, and one PXIe-6259, was connected to the RAID6 computer through a PXIe-PCIe8371 bridge card. Collectively, they provided scan signals for SEM imaging and FIB imaging/milling, as well as SEM image collection and storage. This system was able to acquire data from two SEM channels up to 32k x 32k pixel at 100 MHz. It also recorded machine vital signs, such as ambient temperature, specimen current, and Faraday cup currents, at 10 Hz. Software written in LabVIEW was used to control the entire FIB-SEM operation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Optimal voxel size and imaging speed</title><p>Voxel size is reciprocally related to imaging speed; the best compromise must be determined for each study. Smaller voxel size and lower imaging speed generate higher quality data sets, but can be impractically slow, depending on the specimen and the biologically relevant sample sizes. The optimal conditions also depend on the specimen preparation, especially the staining conditions and the resulting electron contrast. We performed experiments to determine the optimal-throughput balance between imaging and subsequent analysis for complete circuit reconstruction of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. First, we collected a high-quality image stack of <italic>Drosophila</italic> medulla at 5 × 5 × 5 nm<sup>3</sup> voxel size, with small current and slow scanning speed. Software binning and shot noise were then added to simulate datasets collected with larger voxels and at faster scanning speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19</xref>). Based on the automated segmentation and human proofreading speed and error rate, we determined that a voxel sampling of 8 nm was optimal for our <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectomics studies. This is at least 50% smaller then Nyquist sampling distance for beam blur associated with currents of up to 4 nA characterized by the edge signal intensity drop-off of gold nanoparticles on a carbon surface (Electron Microscopy Sciences, P.O. Box 550, 1560 Industry Road, Hatfield, PA 19440, USA, Part #79511–01).

For low-voltage (~1 keV) SEM’s operating with 0.1–10.0 nA on the primary beam, the resolution is a function of current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reimer, 1993</xref>). Spherical and chromatic aberration are prime contributors to beam blur, so smaller numerical apertures with smaller beam currents typically improve resolution. Unfortunately, the downside of better resolution is a longer image acquisition time; conversely, a reduced volume size will be accessible in a fixed time. As an example, we have 2.7 nm resolution (measured as 50% rise distance at a step edge) at 0.08 nA vs 5.5 nm at 4.0 nA. To keep the same sampling-to-resolution ratio, there will be a 2x shorter sampling distance or 8x more voxels for 2x higher resolution in a given volume. Furthermore, since the electron dose per voxel needs to be the same for constant signal-to-noise (assuming mainly shot noise), we need to integrate the current on each smaller voxel for ~50x longer. Together this means that doubling the resolution requires a 400x slower volume acquisition rate! Thus, instead of (100 µm)<sup>3</sup>, only a (14 µm)<sup>3</sup> cube can be acquired in 100 days. In general for constant signal-to-noise at a given beam current I(δ) and with voxels scaling with resolution δ, the volume rate is proportional to dV/dt = δ<sup>3</sup>*I(δ).</p><p>One should choose the trade-off between resolution and volume that is optimal for any given sample and line of enquiry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the relationship between imaging resolution and achievable volume with contours of required acquisition time. The vertical axis assumes isotropic x, y, and z resolution. Besides primary beam blur, the resolution must include the vertical and lateral extent of the exploration range of the back-scattered electron. The Monte Carlo trajectory simulation discussed previously shows that the landing energy of the primary electron must also be adjusted to lower energies to reduce the spatial spread to values consistent with the primary electron beam blur. This means landing energies of 600–1000 eV. As mentioned in the Monte Carlo discussion, contrast to the heavy metal stain is lost rapidly below 600 eV, setting a lower limit to the practical operating point. To maintain SNR at the lower contrast will require further reduction of imaging speed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Comparison with other EM approaches to high-resolution 3D imaging</title><p>How does the high-resolution/large volume approach to FIB-SEM imaging presented here compare with other forms of electron microscopy? It turns out to have a complementary application space. Electron tomography based on high-voltage transmission EM is a standard method used to obtain high-resolution 3D images, typically superior to that of lower energy FIB-SEM imaging. This methodology typically uses ~200–500 nm thick sections. Imaging of thicker volumes requires difficult and time-consuming manual registration of multiple sections. To image thicknesses requiring more than a few sections, FIB-SEM is usually a more practical alternative. If one can sacrifice resolution in one dimension and anisotropic voxels are useful, then either traditional serial section TEM or diamond knife-trimmed block-face SEM might be a more practical alternative. The z resolution of mechanical slicing with a diamond knife can be improved with de-convolution in which the sample is imaged using various landing energies. However, this virtual slicing approach adds a substantial burden in operation and reduces throughput and has not yet been demonstrated for large volume applications. In summary, the technological developments presented here enable FIB-SEM to probe a new domain of considerable biological significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the FLYEM team (Steven Plaza, Pat Rivlin, Lou Scheffer, Shinya Takemura, Gary Huang, Toufiq Parag, Juan Nunez-Iglesias, and Ting Zhao) for processing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectome and providing examples of the speed and completeness of reconstruction that FIB-SEM can enable.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Enhanced FIB-SEM Systems for Large-Volume 3D Imaging&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Stephen J Smith (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three experts reviewed your manuscript, and their assessments, form the basis of this letter. As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are many thoughtful, specific, and useful suggestions in them that we think will improve the presentation of your work. In particular, although reviewer #1 suggests changing the order of presentation, the other reviewers did not necessarily agree with this point, so this remains in his/her review for you to consider, but not as a requirement. We appreciate that the level of engineering detail required to fully describe the FIB-SEM system will not fit into the body of a conventional article. That said, we encourage you to take advantage of the generous availability of space for supplemental information and figure supplements that is part of the <italic>eLife</italic> ethos.</p><p>We also appreciate that some of the suggestions are substantive and others stylistic. You should, of course, feel free to use your judgment regarding the extent to which you would like to make changes in response to the stylistic suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Enhanced FIB-SEM Systems for Large-Volume 3D Imaging&quot; by Xu et al. describes an optimization of the focused Ion Beam Scanning EM (FIB-SEM) setup for high-resolution, high-throughput 3D-imaging with a special focus on the application in connectomics. The scope and goal of this work is of great importance to connectomics because high-resolution isotropic data obtained at sufficient speed could ameliorate many of the challenges in data analysis in the field. Furthermore, for certain species only such high-resolution data can provide full wiring diagrams. The authors plausibly document their advances and achievements and I think this is an important and crucial advance in the field.</p><p>However, I have a few more substantial concerns with respect to the presentation of the work:</p><p>1) I find it rather unfortunate for a methods paper to first have to go through some documentations of methodological success in which without first being introduced to the methodological advances it is not totally obvious where the improvements of the author's method lie. I suggest inverting the description and starting by clearly stating the methodological innovations and their relative significance for throughput, image quality and stability. I would be thrilled to learn about this in an instructive way and then at the end be convinced by successful applications of the methods.</p><p>2) The methods are by far not sufficiently detailed. In particular, it would not be possible to reproduce the system as it is described right now. For example – and this is just one of many examples – the computation of the focus index used to do inline image auto optimization (subsection “In-line image auto-optimization”, second paragraph), is only sloppily described, formulae are missing. Similarly, the prompt pausing and seamless restart automated control system is not described to any reproducible detail. It is in my view mandatory for a methods paper to provide all insights and details such that other labs could rebuild and use this system. I think it is also absolutely required to provide all the code used in these systems as a supplementary code base which I could not find in this submission.</p><p>3) A clear description of the methodological advances as requested in point 1 is also important because some of the results as presented here are actually not novel; e. g. the authors re-introduce the hot-knife-method which they have published before in Nature Methods. It should be absolutely clear that this is not a new contribution of this paper, even if it of course goes along with expanding the imaging range in the third dimension. Similarly, the closed loop control of the FIB beam is an original contribution by Boergens and Denk – this is cited properly, but still it would be very important to know upfront which innovations are the author's and which are extensions or usage of existing methods. As another example: reading the results one cannot judge the effect of detector optimization on imaging speed. In a methods paper, this should be possible, it's (potentially) a key result.</p><p>In summary, again, this is an important development, but as presented I cannot fully judge its advances in a precise and detailed way.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an extraordinarily clear, thorough and detailed description of numerous major and very important refinements to the FIB-SEM image acquisition modality. Since FIB-SEM is now widely considered supreme amongst volumetric EM image acquisition methods in important areas of imaging performance, the refinements described here are likely to be highly consequential in several fields of biology. The careful quantitation and modeling of imaging results it presents makes for a rather lengthy presentation, but these lengths are very welcome in view of the novelty of many of the methods introduced, the unfamiliarity of this imaging physics territory to most biologists, and the clear and well-documented absolute superiority of the imaging results this refined methodology brings into reach.</p><p>The first part of this manuscript provides fair and reasonable accounts of the strengths and weaknesses of the novel methodology to alternative 3D EM imaging methods. The authors make very compelling arguments that their &quot;enhanced FIB-SEM&quot; methods allow access to regions of a high-resolution vs. large-volume imaging space that are highly significant to current very active areas of neural network neuroscience (&quot;connectomics&quot;) and cell / tissue biology. Many of the example images in this methods-focused manuscript indeed reflect the field's first-ever views of previously inaccessible aspects of biological structure. This manuscript thus leaves little doubt that the enhancements introduced and analyzed here will have transformative impact.</p><p>One might at first question the need for such detailed description of engineering advances so numerous and imposing as to place the methodology beyond the reach of all &quot;normal&quot; biology laboratories (it is well known that the HHMI Janelia campus enjoys a uniquely high level of engineering support infrastructure). Even allowing, however, that replication and wide adoption of this methodology might be far off in the future, this description in my opinion is likely to be helpful to biologists and technology companies striving to advance the relevant technologies. It is also to be expected that unique reference datasets based on &quot;enhanced FIB-SEM&quot; will soon be published and made available by Janelia investigators, so it will be important for potential &quot;consumers&quot; of these datasets to understand thoroughly the means by which these datasets were acquired. Last but not least, even if &quot;enhanced FIB-SEM&quot; images remain for a time relatively rare, they are likely to serve immediately as &quot;gold standards&quot; against which more accessible volumetric EM methods can be evaluated (as the authors point out).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study the authors present new methods for high-resolution imaging with isotropic voxels using the FIB-SEM. This is an important contribution to the field of connectomics, and sharing information about the technique with the community will have high impact. The authors have presented the parameters that are crucial to the success of this imaging modality. They show that with careful monitoring of the ion beam and implementation of a closed loop feedback, it is possible to overcome some of the challenges of this method. They also introduce new methods to quantify signal in terms of electron counts. These advances are tested on a few different model organisms with great results.</p><p>Just a few suggestions for improvement of the text:</p><p>1) The authors mention multiple &quot;failure modes&quot; during operation of the FIB, for which different strategies were devised. It would be useful to list all these &quot;failure modes&quot; in table, with the appropriate solution and an estimate of the contribution of each of these failure modes during an example run.</p><p>2) A method for calculation of SNR is introduced. Here the SNR is proportional to the difference in detected electrons from membrane and cytoplasm. It is however unclear how pixels are classified as membraneous or cytoplasmic.</p><p>3) In Section 2 Detection efficiency model, the modeling shows that at a bias of +600V the path of 50eV secondary electrons (red) are shown to be deflected back to the stage. It would be useful to show that beyond the 600V bias, a further increase in bias will in fact start attracting higher-energy back scattered electron away from the detector, as is noticed experimentally in Figure 9.</p><p>4) Regarding the paragraph about competing methods in the Introduction, it would be better to slightly change the wording to make clear that these statements are about the current state-of-the-art. (One can't rule out further progress in the future.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25916.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] I have a few more substantial concerns with respect to the presentation of the work:</italic></p><p><italic>1) I find it rather unfortunate for a methods paper to first have to go through some documentations of methodological success in which without first being introduced to the methodological advances it is not totally obvious where the improvements of the author's method lie.

We agree that a traditional &quot;methods&quot; paper should begin with descriptions of methodological innovations followed by results. The problem is that the manuscript is directed toward multiple audiences. The majority of our readership is likely to constitute biologists, who are more interested in the new capabilities of our FIB-SEM system and “the clear and well-documented absolute superiority of the imaging results” (reviewer #2), rather than the nitty-gritty details of the engineering. Accordingly, we felt it best to leave the overall structure as is. Nevertheless, reviewer's point is legitimate. Accordingly, we have added an overview of the technological improvements of this work at the beginning of “Results and Discussion”, to provide readers with a clear picture of the novelty of our work relative to prior arts. Readers who are especially interested in the technical aspects can now find detailed descriptions in a later part of the manuscript and supplemental materials.</p><p><italic>2) The methods are by far not sufficiently detailed. In particular, it would not be possible to reproduce the system as it is described right now. For example – and this is just one of many examples – the computation of the focus index used to do inline image auto optimization (subsection “In-line image auto-optimization”, second paragraph), is only sloppily described, formulae are missing.

I think it is also absolutely required to provide all the code used in these systems as a supplementary code base which I could not find in this submission.</italic></p><p>We agree that some of the methods are not sufficiently detailed for a typical biology lab to replicate the FIB-SEM system presented in the paper. We have revised the “FIB-SEM system customization for continuous long-term acquisition” section to include more detailed descriptions. For example, the formula to calculate the focus index has been added, and description of the software implementation of prompt pausing and seamless restart has been expanded. However, most of the customization is through software control which is not itself innovative, but instead represents a specific implementation of standard engineering techniques. For example, statistical process control methods are common practice in industrial production environments. There are many ways to implement or tailor the control bands, based on end user’s specific need. Therefore, we only pointed out this is one of the many aspects one should include, without going into the exact details of our implementation. Focus index, for another example, is a generic index number to describe how “sharp” an image is. It too can be calculated in many different ways. Binding et al. presented yet another elegant method for this purpose in their work which we have cited. Concordant with HHMI Janelia's mission, our engineering solutions are open, and we encourage interested outsiders to email us or visit our facility to gain independent expertise.</p><p><italic>3) A clear description of the methodological advances as requested in point 1 is also important because some of the results as presented here are actually not novel; e. g. the authors re-introduce the hot-knife-method which they have published before in Nature Methods.

In a methods paper, this should be possible, it's (potentially) a key result.</italic></p><p>We have revised the manuscript to include an overview of the technological improvements of this work at the beginning of the paper. In this section, we distinguish novel developments versus prior arts (such as the hot-knife method and closed-loop control of the FIB beam), which are now explicitly identified and referenced.</p><p><italic>In summary, again, this is an important development, but as presented I cannot fully judge its advances in a precise and detailed way.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] Just a few suggestions for improvement of the text:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors mention multiple &quot;failure modes&quot; during operation of the FIB, for which different strategies were devised. It would be useful to list all these &quot;failure modes&quot; in table, with the appropriate solution and an estimate of the contribution of each of these failure modes during an example run.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> has been added to outline typical failure modes with different frequencies of occurrence. Corresponding customized solutions were also included.</p><p><italic>2) A method for calculation of SNR is introduced. Here the SNR is proportional to the difference in detected electrons from membrane and cytoplasm. It is however unclear how pixels are classified as membraneous or cytoplasmic.</italic></p><p>The derivation of detected electrons from membrane and cytoplasm is a somewhat subjective manual operation. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref> to explain the details. For example, in order to obtain electron counts of membranes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref> threshold red level was manually adjusted until about 50% of the cell membranes (outer boundaries) were covered in red. Assuming the membrane electron counts have a particular distribution, such threshold value would represent the median (also the mean if it is Gaussian) of that distribution. Similarly, the cytoplasm electron counts are obtained by a green threshold so that about 50% of the interior cell area (excluding mitochondria) are covered in green, approximately the median of electron counts originating from the cytoplasm. Due to non-uniformity and other issues, this approach is only an estimate. The comparison, though not rigorous, serves to demonstrate the changes in SNR as a function of sample bias voltage. In addition, it serves as an experimental reference for our Monte Carlo simulations.</p><p><italic>3) In Section 2 Detection efficiency model, the modeling shows that at a bias of +600V the path of 50eV secondary electrons (red) are shown to be deflected back to the stage. It would be useful to show that beyond the 600V bias, a further increase in bias will in fact start attracting higher-energy back scattered electron away from the detector, as is noticed experimentally in Figure 9.</italic></p><p>Reviewer is correct. We have added “However, further increase in bias beyond +600 V would reduce signal intensity as backscattered electrons are pulled away from the detector or even back onto the sample, depending on their energy. This prediction is consistent with experimental results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12b</xref>” at the end of Section 2 “Detection efficiency model” (old Figure 9 becomes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> after renumbering).</p><p><italic>4) Regarding the paragraph about competing methods in the Introduction, it would be better to slightly change the wording to make clear that these statements are about the current state-of-the-art. (One can't rule out further progress in the future.)</italic></p><p>We agree. We have revised to the manuscript to read “In contrast, the current state-of-the-art technologies based on diamond knife sectioning or diamond knife block-face removal, lose consistency when attempting z steps between adjacent images below 20 nm.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
