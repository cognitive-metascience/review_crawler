This activity is potentially harmful requiring mechanisms for tight repression and substrate-specific activation. The AAA+ chaperone ClpC with the peptidase ClpP forms a bacterial protease essential to virulence and stress resistance. The adaptor MecA activates ClpC by targeting substrates and stimulating ClpC ATPase activity. We show how ClpC is repressed in its ground state by determining ClpC cryo-EM structures with and without MecA. ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains (MDs). MecA converts this resting state to an active planar ring structure by binding to MD interaction sites. Loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. These findings unravel an unexpected regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30120.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>If a protein does not fold into the correct shape, it may be unable to act correctly and can harm cells. As a result, cells contain biological machines that refold or break down misfolded proteins. ATP-dependent AAA+ proteases are an example of such machines. Their activity needs to be tightly controlled because breaking down the wrong proteins can also harm cells.</p><p>ATP-dependent AAA+ proteases form ring-shaped assemblies that are composed of AAA+ proteins and an associated peptidase. In bacteria, the AAA+ protein called ClpC can be crucial for resisting stress and infecting host cells. Adapter proteins help to activate ClpC by binding to extra domains that are fused to or inserted into the protein. This method of activation also requires repressing elements that ensure that the activity of ClpC remains low when the adapter proteins are not present. It was not known how this repression works.</p><p>Carroni, Franke et al. have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structures of repressed and adapter-activated ClpC from pathogenic bacteria called <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. In the repressed state, 10 molecules of ClpC interact to form two assemblies that interact via regions called middle domains. The middle domains have a “coiled coil” structure, and they interact via their ends in a head-to-head manner. In the repressed state ClpC cannot interact with its partner peptidase and the shape of the assembly shields the sites where adapter proteins can bind. This renders ClpC inactive.</p><p>Carroni, Franke et al. also studied ClpC proteins that had mutations to the middle domain that prevented the repressed state from forming. The mutant proteins remain in a constantly active state that is highly toxic to bacteria.</p><p>Bacteria are increasingly evolving to resist the effects of the antibiotics commonly used to treat infections. This is a severe problem, and we need to develop new antibiotic drugs that will kill these bacteria. AAA+ proteases have been identified as possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. The results presented by Carroni, Franke et al. suggest that disrupting the repressing activity of ClpC middle domains could be an effective way for such drugs to work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>heat shock protein</kwd><kwd>AAA+ protein</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB617/17-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bukau</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name><name><surname>Mogk</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hartmut Hoffmann-Berling International Graduate School of Molecular and Cellular Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franke</surname><given-names>Kamila B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hannover School for Biomolecular Drug Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hantke</surname><given-names>Ingo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carroni</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007436</institution-id><institution>Familjen Erling-Perssons Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carroni</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MO970/4-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bukau</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name><name><surname>Mogk</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tu106/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turgay</surname><given-names>Kürşad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tu106/6-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turgay</surname><given-names>Kürşad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Head-to-head interactions of regulatory coiled-coil domains control activity of the central bacterial AAA+ protein ClpC by promoting formation of a reversible resting state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>AAA+ (<underline>A</underline>TPase <underline>a</underline>ssociated with a variety of cellular <underline>a</underline>ctivities) proteins control a multitude of essential cellular activities by converting the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into a mechanical force to remodel bound substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</xref>). They are key players in protein quality control by targeting misfolded and aggregated proteins to degrading and refolding pathways. ClpB/Hsp104 reactivates aggregated proteins in concert with a cognate Hsp70 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mogk et al., 2015</xref>). Other AAA+ proteins (e.g. ClpX, Rpt1-6) associate with peptidases (e.g. ClpP, 20S proteasome) to form AAA+ proteases, feeding protein substrates into associated proteolytic chambers for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Sauer, 2012</xref>). The unfolding activity of AAA+ proteins can, however, also be deleterious to cells, in particular if linked to protein degradation, and therefore needs to be tightly controlled. Accordingly, loss of the control mechanisms of AAA+ protein activity in mutant proteins can lead to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schirmer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>). Controlling substrate selectivity and AAA+ protein activity is therefore crucial to prevent deleterious activities. This task is frequently executed by adapter proteins that select substrates but can also regulate the ATPase activity of AAA+ proteins and couple substrate delivery to ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlothauer et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Activity control and adaptor action requires the ATPase activity to be repressed in the ground state, which is key to AAA+ chaperone mode of action. Repression can be achieved by regulatory coiled-coil domains inserted into an AAA module. In the ClpB/Hsp104 disaggregase a long coiled-coil middle domain (MD), consisting of two wings, is forming a repressing belt around the AAA ring to reduce ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heuck et al., 2016</xref>). Adjacent MDs bind to each other by head-to-tail interactions keeping the regulatory domains in place. ATPase repression is relieved by MD dissociation and binding to Hsp70 adaptors that prevent reassociation of MDs with the ClpB/Hsp104 ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial AAA+ chaperone ClpC associates with the peptidase ClpP to form a central proteolytic machinery of Gram-positive bacteria. The ClpC-ClpP machinery acts in regulatory and general proteolysis, controlling multiple cellular pathways and differentiation processes and is crucial for bacterial stress resistance and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turgay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frees et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trentini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capestany et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Msadek et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krüger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lourdault et al., 2011</xref>). ClpC activity crucially relies on cooperation with adaptor proteins including MecA, that target specific substrates while concurrently stimulating ClpC ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlothauer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turgay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turgay et al., 1998</xref>). MecA binds to N-terminal and middle domains of each ClpC subunit forming a separate layer on top of the ClpC AAA ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). How ClpC is kept inactive in adaptor absence, and how the adaptor activates the ATPase is largely unknown. Furthermore, ClpC harbors a coiled-coil MD consisting only of a single wing, as opposed to the two-wing MD of ClpB/Hsp104. A potential regulatory function of the ClpC MD has not been investigated, but its smaller size as compared to the ClpB/Hsp104 MD implies it must act differently if involved in ClpC activity control. Understanding ClpC regulation is particularly relevant as AAA+ protease machines including ClpC have attracted considerable attention as targets for antibacterial action in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brötz-Oesterhelt and Sass, 2014</xref>). Overruling AAA+ protease control by small molecules can lead to constitutive uncontrolled and toxic activation as best exemplified by acyldepsipeptide antibiotics of the ADEP class targeting the ClpP peptidase. ADEP-activated ClpP causes aberrant protein degradation and even allows for eradication of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> persister cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conlon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brötz-Oesterhelt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirstein et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding ClpC activity control therefore might open new avenues for antibiotics development.</p><p>Here, we report on an unexpected mode of AAA+ chaperone control involving transition between an inactive resting state and a functional hexamer as revealed by determining the cryoEM-structures of <italic>S. aureus</italic> ClpC in absence and presence of MecA. The ClpC resting state is composed of two helical ClpC assemblies stabilized by head-to-head MD interactions. MecA prevents MD interactions and thereby converts ClpC into a canonical and active hexamer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ClpC M-domain represses ClpC activity</title><p>To study the function of the M-domain (MD) in ClpC activity control we first purified <italic>S. aureus</italic> ClpC/ClpP and demonstrated functionality by determining high-proteolytic activity in presence of the adaptor MecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Next, we created a series of ClpC MD variants by mutating conserved residues not involved in coiled-coil structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we replaced the entire MD (N411-K457) by a di-glycine linker, allowing MD deletion without interfering with folding of the AAA-1 domain. Proteolytic activities of MD mutants were determined using Fluorescein-labeled casein (FITC-casein) as constitutively misfolded model substrate in absence and presence of MecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>). ClpC wild type (WT) together with ClpP exhibited only a low proteolytic activity in absence of MecA and FITC-casein degradation rates were 20-fold increased upon adaptor addition. In contrast, most MD mutants enabled for adaptor-independent FITC-casein proteolysis to varying degrees. ClpC-F436A, ClpC-R443A and ClpC-D444A showed highest activities with degradation rates close to those determined for ClpC WT plus MecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>). Similarly, MD deletion strongly increased ClpC activity, indicating that the single point mutants reflect a loss of M-domain function. MecA presence still stimulated FITC-casein degradation by ClpC MD mutants except F436A and ΔM, consistent with the crucial function of F436 in MecA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). To analyze whether M-domain mutants cause full activation of ClpC, we compared FITC-casein degradation rates of ClpC-F436A and ClpC/MecA under saturating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B/C</xref>). ClpC-F436A degraded FITC-casein with similar efficiencies as ClpC/MecA at all substrate concentrations tested and reached identical v<sub>max</sub>. ClpC-R443A and ClpC-ΔM also degraded FITC-casein at saturating concentrations like MecA-activiated ClpC, underlining complete activation of ClpC upon M-domain mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) Notably, we observed minor FITC-casein degradation by ClpC at higher substrate concentrations and indicating partial ClpC activation without adapter.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30120.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ClpC MD mutants exhibit adaptor-independent proteolytic activity.</title><p>(<bold>A/B</bold>) FITC-casein degradation was monitored in the presence of ClpP (P) only, or in presence of ClpC wild type and indicated MD mutants with or without MecA.

GFP-SsrA harbors the 11-meric SsrA tag, which is recognized by AAA+ chaperones pore sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinnerwisch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piszczek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siddiqui et al., 2004</xref>). GFP-SsrA degradation requires application of high unfolding force in contrast to FITC-casein, which is constitutively unfolded. ClpC WT/ClpP efficiently degraded GFP-SsrA in a MecA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, ClpC MD mutants did hardly exhibit autonomous degradation of GFP-SsrA in contrast to FITC-casein. ClpC-R443A was partially stimulated upon MecA addition demonstrating that the M-domain mutant can process GFP-SsrA in principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We speculated that differences in GFP-SsrA and FITC-casein binding modes might be the cause of the different degradation activities of ClpC MD mutants. Hsp100 N-domains contribute to casein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beinker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenzweig et al., 2015</xref>) while their position on top of the AAA-1 ring and central pore site could impede GFP-SsrA binding. We therefore determined GFP-SsrA degradation activities of N-domain deleted ΔN-ClpC and respective MD mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). GFP-SsrA remained stable in presence of ΔN-ClpC/ClpP, however, the substrate was rapidly degraded by ΔN-ClpC-F436A, ΔN-ClpC-R443A and ΔN-ClpC-ΔM (+ClpP) and degradation rates were identical to those determined for ClpC WT/ClpP with MecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We did not test for GFP-SsrA degradation by ΔN-ClpC/ClpP in presence of MecA, as the N-domain is essential for MecA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persuh et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>By determining GFP-SsrA degradation rates under saturating conditions we confirmed that ΔN-ClpC-F436A is as active as MecA-activated ClpC and degraded the substrate with similar or even faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

ClpC WT exhibits a very low basal ATPase activity (0.4 ATP/min/monomer), rationalizing its poor standalone degradation activity. Notably, all activated MD mutants (F436A, R443A, ΔM) exhibited strongly increased basal ATPase activities (3.3–5.4 ATP/min/monomer) that were further increased by substrate casein (1.64–2.47-fold stimulation) in contrast to ClpC WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/B</xref>). In presence of MecA, a minor stimulation (1,21-fold) of ClpC ATPase activity by casein was determined. In this setup lower MecA concentrations (0.2 μM) were used to minimize competition between casein and MecA as both can act as ClpC substrate. Casein-stimulated ClpC MD mutants reached 33% of total ATPase activity determined for MecA-activated ClpC WT. N-domain deletion also increased basal ATPase activity of ΔN-ClpC. Combining ΔN-ClpC with M-domain mutants had an additive stimulatory effect on ATPase activities, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are distinct from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We infer increased basal ATPase activities of ClpC MD mutants (in context of fullength ClpC and ΔN-ClpC) can explain adaptor-independent substrate degradation. However, ATPase activation alone is not sufficient to explain ClpC activation as ΔN-ClpC did not allow degradation of GFP-SsrA despite having increased basal ATPase activity.

In absence of ATP ClpC-DWB showed a broad elution profile, suggesting formation of variable assemblies ranging from monomers to hexamers. ATP addition caused formation of larger ClpC assemblies that eluted prior to ClpB hexamers and a 670 kDa standard protein, suggesting formation of ClpC complexes larger than hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This was confirmed by static light scattering (SLS) measurements, revealing a molecular mass of ≈ 956 kDa corresponding to a decameric complex, consistent with cryoEM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Presence of MecA sharpened the ClpC elution profile and shifted ClpC-DWB fractions to later elution volumes right after the 670 kDa standard protein and now overlapping with ClpB hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

This indicates that MecA binding shifts ClpC from a large, non-hexameric assembly to a ClpC<sub>6</sub>/MecA<sub>6</sub> complex. We next analyzed the elution profile of ClpC-DWB-F436A. In absence of ATP the MD mutant eluted as defined species right at the elution volume of a 158 kDa standard protein suggesting formation of monomers/dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This indicates that the formation of larger assemblies noticed for ClpC WT (- ATP) depends on the M-domain, consistent with results from glutaraldehyde crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) Unexpectedly, ClpC-DWB-F436A showed a broad elution profile upon ATP addition. While the ClpC-DWB-F436A peak fraction eluted right after the 670 kDa standard, larger assemblies at earlier elution volumes were also present. We speculated that activated ClpC MD mutants might be capable of recognizing themselves as substrate resulting in formation of larger complexes and explaining the elution profile. Indeed, we observed autodegradation of ClpC-F436A, ClpC-R443A and ClpC-ΔM but not ClpC WT in presence of ClpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). To prevent self-recognition of ClpC-DWB-F436A we repeated the size exclusion analysis in presence of substrate casein excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Presence of casein sharpened the ClpC-DWB-F436A elution profile that was comparable to ClpC-DWB/MecA complexes and distinct from ClpC-DWB, suggesting hexamer formation, which was confirmed by mass determination by SLS (587 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, casein addition did not cause formation of smaller ClpC-DWB complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To further prove ClpC-F436A hexamer formation, a small cryo-EM dataset of ClpC-F436A with casein and ATPγS was collected and analyzed via 2D classification. Classes indicate that the ClpC-F436A assembles in an hexamer similar to ClpC WT with MecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Together our findings demonstrate that ClpC-DWB forms large, non-hexameric assemblies in a MD dependent manner, supporting the derived ClpC WT cryo-EM structure. This large ClpC-DWB assembly should neither allow for efficient substrate binding nor association with the ClpP peptidase. This prediction was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography showing poor interaction with ClpP and negligible binding to substrate FITC-casein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

In contrast, the ClpC resting state is formed by head-to-head MD contacts, allowing for assembly of two open ClpC spirals. Adaptor proteins of ClpB (DnaK) and ClpC (MecA) break MD contacts by binding to MD sites crucial for MD interactions. This results in AAA+ protein activation by releasing MD repression on ATPase activity (ClpB) or allowing for formation of active hexamers (ClpC).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30120-fig7-v1"/></fig><p>ClpC MDs cannot function in the same manner due to their reduced size (~50 residues forming a single wing), which is too short to span the distance between neighboring subunits in a hexameric assembly. Instead, ClpC MDs form intermolecular head-to-head contacts allowing docking of two layers of ClpC molecules arranged in a helical conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The formation of this structure also involves ATP binding to AAA domains. We define this large ClpC assembly as inactive resting state, as it strongly restricts binding of substrates, ClpP and adaptor proteins and does not allow for efficient ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>Thereby ClpC MDs function as molecular switches, similar to ClpB/Hsp104 MDs, ensuring repression in the ground state and allowing for activation in presence of substrate recruiting adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This dual activity is best illustrated for MD residue F436 located at the tip of the coiled-coil structure. F436 is essential for both, intermolecular MD interaction and MecA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The N-terminal domain, though not being essential for resting state formation, appears to play an additional role in this switch of conformations, by going from a more hidden position in between MDs in the resting state to a more exposed one, available to MecA or other adaptors.</p><p>The interaction surface of MDs is limited (50 Å<sup>2</sup>) which has implications on the stability of the resting state complex. We speculate that multiple MD contacts provide sufficient stickiness to stabilize a resting state core, while providing dynamics to peripheral subunits, in agreement with our structural and biochemical analysis. As MecA-binding sites in N- and M-domains are not accessible in the resting state, we suggest that ClpC subunit dissociation is prerequisite for MecA binding. Additionally, MecA might bind to peripheral subunits of the ClpC storage state causing their displacement. We, however, do not exclude a scenario in which dissociation of the complete ClpC double-spiral takes place, allowing for more direct transition into hexamers upon MecA-binding to a single ClpC spiral.</p><p>Our newly derived model of <italic>S. aureus</italic> ClpC activity control differs from a former one, showing that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ClpC is monomeric and requires MecA for hexamer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirstein et al., 2006</xref>). Sequestering inactive ClpC subunits in a resting state structure might provide better protection against non-specific interactions with other cellular components or degradation by proteases as compared to freely accessible monomers. We realize that former ClpC analysis was performed in presence of high salt concentrations (300 mM NaCl), which likely interfere with MD head-to-head contacts involving charged residues (R443, D444). A regulatory model involving only monomer-hexamer transitions cannot explain activation and severe cellular toxicity of ClpC MD mutants shown here in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. However, we suggest that the oligomerization dependence of ClpC on MecA at high salt concentrations might represent a fail-safe system ensuring adaptor-dependent ClpC activation under conditions that do not allow for resting state formation (e.g. salt stress).</p><p>Once formed the hexameric ClpC<sub>6</sub>/MecA<sub>6</sub> complex is stable and does not dissociate spontaneously, raising the question how ClpC activation is turned off. Adaptor proteins are targeting themselves for degradation by ClpC/ClpP if substrates are no longer available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turgay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirstein et al., 2007</xref>). This mechanism couples substrate availability with ClpC activation and ensures fast ClpC inactivation in absence of substrate by causing dissociation of ClpC hexamers into monomers that are subsequently sequestered in the resting state. Notably, other chaperone machineries including the Hsp70 member BIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>) and the AAA+ protein Rca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller-Cajar et al., 2011</xref>) also form large, inactive resting states that are converted into active species depending on substrate availability. Sequestration of chaperones therefore seems a more widespread activity to tune their activities according to the physiological need.</p><p>Constitutively activated ClpC MD mutants exert strong toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, demonstrating an essential physiological need to tightly control ClpC function.

This suggests that adapters confer a higher degree of substrate specificity to ClpC as compared to activated ClpC MD mutants.

In fact, the deregulation of bacterial proteases represents a novel antibacterial strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malik and Brötz-Oesterhelt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Culp and Wright, 2017</xref>). Notably, the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ClpC N-terminal domain was recently identified as target of cyclic peptides with antibacterial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmitt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gavrish et al., 2014</xref>). Although the mode of these drugs and their effects on ClpC function are not understood it is likely that they interfere with ClpC activity control. Our findings presented here open a new route for toxic ClpC deregulation by identifying MDs as crucial regulatory elements and thus drug targets and offering a promising approach to attack multi-drug resistant bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids and proteins</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains used were derivatives of MC4100, XL1-blue or DH5α.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivak Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andreas Martin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eilika Weber-Ban (Reviewer #2); Gabriel C Lander (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Carroni and Franke et al. identify and characterize the resting state of <italic>Staphylococcus areus</italic> ClpC, in which the coiled coil middle domains (MDs) mediate a head-to-head interaction of two pentameric ClpC lockwashers. Comparison of cryo-EM reconstructions for ClpC in the absence and presence of the adaptor MecA gives intriguing structural insights into potential mechanisms for ClpC activation, where the disruption of the MD coiled-coil interactions by MecA splits the ClpC lockwashers apart and induces their reconfiguration into hexamers with robust ATPase and protein unfoldase activity.</p><p>The combination of these structural data with mutagenesis, biochemical analyses, and in vivo studies allows the proposal of a compelling model about the role of MDs in regulating the ClpC oligomeric state, MecA adaptor interactions, and the proteolytic activity of the ClpCP protease. So far, only structures of the active, MecA-bound ClpC hexamer had been available, whereas the mechanisms underlying ClpC's inactivation in the absence of MecA remained elusive. The present study thus significantly advances our understanding of ClpC regulation and unravels a new concept of AAA motor regulation by coiled coil middle domains.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern regarding the biochemical experiments is that none of the presented degradation assays were performed under true steady state or multiple turnover conditions. The authors used either 0.3 μm FITC casein or 0.2 μm GFP-SsrA substrate with 1 μm ClpC and 2 μm ClpP. Neither in the figure legends nor the Materials and methods it is specified whether the ClpC and ClpP concentrations refer to monomers or hexamers/tetradecamers, but assuming monomers, those concentrations would be equivalent to 166 nM ClpC6 and 142 nM ClpP14. There is not even enough ClpP to saturate all ClpC, and the substrate concentration is barely above the enzyme concentration. Consequently, degradation kinetics (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) strongly resemble exponential behavior, as expected for single-turnover reactions. Measuring the initial slopes of these curves, as done by the authors, may give a qualitative impression of enzyme activity, but is certainly not suited to determine quantitative degradation rates.</p><p>In addition, the substrate affinities of WT ClpC and its various MD and N-domain mutants remain completely elusive, and it is unclear whether the used concentrations reflect saturating conditions. This is particularly important when comparing ClpC mutations that differentially affect the ATPase activity or substrate affinity. For instance, it is proposed that the ClpC N-domain interferes with GFP-SsrA binding and therefore degradation. However, N-terminal deletion also leads to an almost 20-fold stimulation of WT ATPase activity and a &gt; 2-fold stimulation for the F436A and R443A mutants. It therefore remains unclear whether the N-terminal domain indeed inhibits GFP-SsrA binding or makes GFP unfolding less efficient due to lower ATPase activity.</p><p>In general, performing these measurements at just a single substrate concentration is certainly not sufficient to quantitatively compare the degradation activities of ClpC variants with mutations that differentially affect Km and Vmax.</p><p>To draw reliable conclusions about substrate binding and ClpC motor activity, the authors should perform Michaelis-Menten analyses for at least a couple of key mutants presented, and otherwise should perform multiple-turnover measurements with saturating concentrations of substrate to derive more reliable degradation rates. The reviewers agreed that this should be easy to accomplish with the FITC-casein and especially the GFP-SsrA model substrates that can be produced in high amounts.</p><p>2) Similarly, the concentrations used for measuring the stimulatory effects of casein substrate on the ATPase activity of WT ClpC/P are not ideal for quantitative analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Even though the authors confirmed a 1:1 complex of ClpC and MecA, they used only 0.2 μm MecA with 1 μm ClpC and 10 μm casein. Under these conditions, 80% of ClpC subunits would not be bound to MecA. In addition, the authors again used only 2 μm ClpP monomers, equivalent to 142 nM ClpP14 (while there is 166 nM ClpC6 present). Having not all ClpC saturated with ClpP and MecA thus leads to strongly convoluted ATPase rates, with contributions from free ClpC, ClpC/P, MecA-ClpC/P, and substrate bound MecA-ClpC/P, which doesn't allow accurate quantitative conclusions about the stimulatory effects of substrate. The authors should therefore repeat those experiments under saturating conditions, both for substrate and MecA.</p><p>3) The fact that the lockwasher is pentameric and not hexameric is intriguing – there does appear to be disordered density that might correspond to a sixth subunit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>. No mention is made of this density, and the reviewers wondered if the authors tried low-pass filtering the density or viewing the density at low iso-surface thresholds to assess the possibility that this is a transiently or flexibly associated sixth subunit. The SLS data suggest that the complex is decameric, but this region should nonetheless be investigated through further cryoEM analysis, such as by focused classification using a 3D mask in this area. There may be a subset of particles that more clearly resolved density. Or does the conformation sterically prevent the association of an additional subunit? This should be explored in more detail.</p><p>4) Based on their finding that the F436A-DWB mutant stayed monomeric in the absence of nucleotide, the authors propose that the ClpC decameric structure relies entirely on MD contacts. This is surprising, and given the presented structural data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>) it is hard to imagine how the MDs could provide sufficient lateral interactions to hold neighboring ClpC subunits together. Is there indeed no contribution of the AAA1 and AAA2 domains, which seem to have much more extensive interactions than the MD and neighboring N-domains?</p><p>Do the authors have information about whether or not deltaN ClpC can form an inactive higher order resting state like wt ClpC? Based on the structures, this seems unlikely, as the N-domains feature prominently in achieving the resting state.</p><p>In general, the authors should attempt to clarify the role of a potential interplay between N-domains and M-domains, and how much the effects observed for MD deletion or mutation might in fact stem from a MecA-mediated association of MD with the N-domain. Could the viability defects observed in vivo not also be explained by the fact that without MD, MecA cannot keep the N-domains away to the side?</p><p>5) Based on the observed effects of ClpC MD mutants on cellular viability, the authors propose that the M-domains are essential to control ClpC/P degradation activity by inactivating ClpC in the absence of MecA. The authors should test and confirm this model by co-expression of WT ClpC and MecA, which is expected to have the same phenotype/toxicity as delta-N ClpC F436A (unless MecA-bound WT ClpC has a much more restricted substrate specificity).</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Flexible fitting was stated as being used to generate the atomic model of the ClpC-MecA structure, but very few details are given regarding its generation, aside from the fact that iModFit was used. Why was flexible fitting not used to generate a model of the ClpC double lockwasher, which is at higher resolution? The fitting shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> has much of the atomic model out of density, and should not be used for detailed structural interpretation. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “Head-to-head interactions of M-domains mediate formation of an inactive ClpC resting state”, the authors state that the trans-acting arginine fingers are displaced away from the nucleotide binding pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), but given the limited resolution of the map and poor fitting of the atomic model, this cannot be claimed. The reviewers agreed that it is fine to include side chains in the models depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, as these data are supported by biochemistry. However, when depositing atomic models based on the presented intermediate resolution EM, the models should only include the C-alpha's of amino acids.</p><p>2) The ClpC-MecA structure is described as &quot;asymmetric&quot;, but is the structure organized as a spiral, as has been shown in numerous other AAA ATPases? If not, this is novel and should be described in more detail.</p><p>Also, the structures of Hsp104 and VAT in a steep lockwasher-like conformation were recently solved – are there any structural similarities with the resting state of ClpC?</p><p>3) It's puzzling that 3D classification was not performed at any point – this is regularly used before 3D refinement of a structure to identify a set of conformationally and compositionally homogeneous particles for processing, and then a classification without further alignment is performed after refinement to identify the subset of particles containing the highest resolution information. If these steps were performed and all 3D classes looked identical, this should be stated. Furthermore, it isn't clear which final density from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref> was used for the structural analyses. The final structure from cryoSparc appears to be at higher resolution than the RELION structures – what was the reported resolution of this structure? Was C2 symmetry applied?</p><p>4) The authors use glutaraldehyde crosslinking to analyze how MecA and the F436A mutation affect the formation of the decameric resting state of ClpC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Surprisingly, lane 9 shows that most of the double-Walker B mutant still forms the decamer (or even larger structure) in the presence of MecA. Was this trend also observed in the MecA-bound EM sample? In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;once formed, the ClpC6/MecA6 complex is stable and does not dissociate spontaneously&quot;. Why then does MecA-bound ClpC-DWB show any crosslinking larger than hexamers?</p><p>5) It is surprising that, based on gel filtration results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), the formation of ClpC decamers is ATP-dependent, whereas hexamer formation is not, and the authors should try to discuss this. Furthermore, how does the limited interaction surface of MDs (~ 50 A2) compare to the AAA interfaces? Is this interaction indeed substantial and strong enough to disrupt the interactions in a planar, ATP-bound AAA ring when MecA is absent?</p><p>6) MecA has been shown in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to promote assembly from a lower assembly state (monomeric/dimeric) to the active hexamer. Although the authors convincingly show the existence of an inactive higher order assembly of <italic>S. aureus</italic> ClpC, it remains unclear why such a complex is beneficial. This should be discussed.</p><p>The authors suggest that activation upon MecA association occurs via monomeric ClpC. Can they provide evidence for that? Can it be excluded that the double-spiral dissociates into two single spirals that then transition more directly into the hexameric state?</p><p>7) It is proposed that the MecA adaptor is degraded and ClpC consequently inactivated when substrates are no longer available. However, the strong cytotoxicity of MD mutants in <italic>E. coli</italic> would suggest that the substrate specificity of ClpC/P is rather broad. The authors also speculate that deregulated ClpC/P may go after newly synthesized proteins, which raises the question whether ClpC/P would indeed ever run out of substrates to then be inactivated. Is the assumption that MecA makes ClpC/P more specific and less promiscuous than MD mutants like F436A? The authors should try to address this in their Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30120.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) […] To draw reliable conclusions about substrate binding and ClpC motor activity, the authors should perform Michaelis-Menten analyses for at least a couple of key mutants presented, and otherwise should perform multiple-turnover measurements with saturating concentrations of substrate to derive more reliable degradation rates. The reviewers agreed that this should be easy to accomplish with the FITC-casein and especially the GFP-SsrA model substrates that can be produced in high amounts.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this major concern of the reviewers and determined degradation rates in presence of increasing substrate concentrations (FITC-casein, GFP-SsrA). For these experiments, we also increased the concentrations of MecA and ClpP to 2 and 4 μM (monomer), respectively, representing a 2- and 1,7-fold excess over hexameric ClpC (1 μM monomer). These new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) confirm that the ClpC F436A M-domain mutation causes full activation as the mutant degrades substrates under saturating conditions with similar efficiencies as compared to ClpC wild type in presence of MecA. To generalize this finding, the degradation activities of further ClpC M-domain mutants were analyzed under substrate-saturating conditions (FITC-casein) or in presence of 30-fold excess of substrate (5 μM GFP-SsrA) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Together these findings substantiate our former conclusion that ClpC M-domain mutants exhibit high and adaptor-independent activities.</p><p>We tried to analyze the impact of N-domains on GFP-SsrA binding but could not monitor interaction of GFP-SsrA with either ClpC wild type (plus MecA), ΔN-ClpC or ΔN-ClpC-F436A, neither by size exclusion chromatography nor fluorescence anisotropy or thermophoresis. Eventually initial unfolding of GFP-SsrA is required for tight binding, which is not possible in our binding assays performed in presence of ATPγS. A function of N-domains in preventing GFP-SsrA binding therefore remains to be explored. We cannot rule out that the two-fold higher ATPase activities of ΔN-ClpC M-domain mutants (as compared to ΔN-ClpC) allow for GFP-SsrA unfolding and now add his possible explanation to the revised manuscript. The finding that the increased ATPase activity of ΔN-ClpC does not allow for GFP-SsrA degradation, however, suggests that the consequences of N- and M-domain deletions/mutations on ClpC are qualitatively different. We show that ΔN-ClpC is still crosslinked to high molecular weight products in presence of ATPγS, whereas ΔN-ClpC-F436A only forms hexameric assemblies (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This confirms the dominant role of M-domains in ClpC resting state formation and activity control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the concentrations used for measuring the stimulatory effects of casein substrate on the ATPase activity of WT ClpC/P are not ideal for quantitative analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Even though the authors confirmed a 1:1 complex of ClpC and MecA, they used only 0.2 μm MecA with 1 μm ClpC and 10 μm casein. Under these conditions, 80% of ClpC subunits would not be bound to MecA. In addition, the authors again used only 2 μm ClpP monomers, equivalent to 142 nM ClpP14 (while there is 166 nM ClpC6 present). Having not all ClpC saturated with ClpP and MecA thus leads to strongly convoluted ATPase rates, with contributions from free ClpC, ClpC/P, MecA-ClpC/P, and substrate bound MecA-ClpC/P, which doesn't allow accurate quantitative conclusions about the stimulatory effects of substrate. The authors should therefore repeat those experiments under saturating conditions, both for substrate and MecA.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially titrated MecA concentrations in ATPase measurements to determine the MecA concentration that is sufficient for maximal stimulation of ClpC ATPase activities (1.5-fold excess of MecA, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We therefore consider our condition to determine ClpC ATPase stimulation by MecA to be well chosen. These initial assays were additionally performed in absence and presence of ClpP to test for potential impact of the associated peptidase on ClpC ATPase activity, which we found is marginal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). To avoid degradation of MecA and therefore reduction of ClpC ATPase stimulation during experiments we performed all subsequent ATPase activity measurements in absence of ClpP.</p><p>The reviewers are referring to an experiment that aimed at determining the impact of substrate (casein) binding on ClpC ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this particular experiment, we used lower MecA concentrations on purpose as MecA has dual roles by (i) serving as adapter that is delivering substrates to ClpC and (ii) acting as substrate at the same time as evident from its ClpC/ClpP-mediated degradation. To predominantly monitor the impact of MecA-mediated substrate transfer on ClpC ATPase activity, we lowered the MecA concentrations in this setup (0.2 μM) while offering casein excess (10 μM) at the same time. We have clarified this point in the revised manuscript. The reduced MecA concentrations still mediate efficient casein degradation, demonstrating that the adaptor is not limiting at the given concentration.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ATPase activity of ClpC (0.5 μM) was determined in presence of increasing MecA concentrations in absence and presence of ClpP (1.5 μM).</title><p>The ratio of MecA to ClpC is indicated.

No mention is made of this density, and the reviewers wondered if the authors tried low-pass filtering the density or viewing the density at low iso-surface thresholds to assess the possibility that this is a transiently or flexibly associated sixth subunit. The SLS data suggest that the complex is decameric, but this region should nonetheless be investigated through further cryoEM analysis, such as by focused classification using a 3D mask in this area. There may be a subset of particles that more clearly resolved density. Or does the conformation sterically prevent the association of an additional subunit? This should be explored in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, there might be additional subunits in the open part of the double helix, either transiently or flexibly associated. The lockwasher is not strictly pentameric as there is not full density for complete periphery subunits. We provide a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> with a gallery of the resting state subunits and the visible domains for each of them in the asymmetric reconstruction. In the asymmetric reconstruction, there are 4 full subunits, 4 subunits missing density only for the N-terminus and 2 subunits missing most density for both N-terminus and large AAA1 subdomains. We now discuss the heterogeneity of resting state subunits more precisely in the revised manuscript. In the symmetrized C2 maps the N-termini can be better resolved and there are 6 full subunits + 4 peripheral incomplete ones.</p><p>Additionally, we have tried to identify additional subunits within the disordered region by performing focused classification with signal subtraction on the “periphery” of the resting state. It was, however, not possible to separate a population with additional or more defined subunits in the periphery. Focused 3D classification was performed both with and without local alignment. We cannot exclude that a much larger dataset could help to isolate populations were peripheral subunits are more defined.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Four classes were generated after 3D focused classification with signal subtraction of the ClpC resting state periphery.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30120-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>To figure out whether resting state sterically prevents the incorporation of further subunits we generate a model of a closed double spiral. Applying the same shift and rotation that define the helical pitch new subunits were added to generate a closed double spiral. Up to 3 full subunits (with all subdomains) can be added plus an incomplete one (lacking the N-terminus that would otherwise clash). Thus a closed double spiral could theoretically include up to 14 subunits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We, however, exclude that this closed conformation stably exists in solution as the ab-initio SGD procedure in cryoSPARC only generated one single model, the open double helix, even when the option of generating 3 starting models was given. We have added a clarification to the manuscript stating that the resting state does not allow for infinite subunit incorporation as observed in e.g. Hsp104 crystal arrangements (subsection “Head-to-head interactions of M-domains mediate formation of an inactive ClpC resting state”, second paragraph).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Model of a closed ClpC double-helix generated by applying helical parameters.</title><p>In magenta are protomers for which there is some missing density in the cryo-EM map (either missing the N-terminus or small AAA subdomains).

This is surprising, and given the presented structural data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>) it is hard to imagine how the MDs could provide sufficient lateral interactions to hold neighboring ClpC subunits together. Is there indeed no contribution of the AAA1 and AAA2 domains, which seem to have much more extensive interactions than the MD and neighboring N-domains?</p><p>Do the authors have information about whether or not deltaN ClpC can form an inactive higher order resting state like wt ClpC? Based on the structures, this seems unlikely, as the N-domains feature prominently in achieving the resting state.</p><p>In general, the authors should attempt to clarify the role of a potential interplay between N-domains and M-domains, and how much the effects observed for MD deletion or mutation might in fact stem from a MecA-mediated association of MD with the N-domain. Could the viability defects observed in vivo not also be explained by the fact that without MD, MecA cannot keep the N-domains away to the side?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and performed additional experiments to clarify the raised issue. We analyzed the impact of N-domains on ClpC resting state formation by glutaraldehyde crosslinking (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In absence of ATP we hardly detect formation of large ΔN-ClpC complexes in contrast to ClpC wild-type pointing to a role of N-domains in stabilizing the resting state. This could be explained by N-domains interacting with neighboring AAA-1 domains in the resting state model. A major difference in crosslinking patterns between ΔN-ClpC and ClpC was, however, no longer apparent in presence of ATPγS as ΔN-ClpC was still crosslinked, to high molecular weight complexes. This indicates, as also pointed out by the reviewers, that contacts between neighboring, ATP-bound AAA-1 and AAA-2 domains play crucial roles for resting state formation which is now discussed in the revised manuscript. Analysis of ΔN-ClpC-F436A (+ ATPγS) revealed that the M-domain mutant does not adopt the resting state but readily forms hexameric assemblies (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This demonstrates a dominant, N-domain independent role of M-domains in controlling ClpC oligomerization and activity. Our new data argue against a crucial interplay of N- and M-domains in ClpC activity control (subsection “Obstructing head-to-head M-domain contacts allows for ClpC hexamer formation”, second paragraph). In agreement, deleting N-domains in ΔN-ClpC does not cause ClpC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>/E).</p><p>The reviewers are correct that the interaction surface between M-domains is limited (50 Å2 as pointed out in the original manuscript). We suggest that multiple MD contacts provide sufficient energy and stickiness to promote this particular resting state formation. At the same time, we suggest that the small-sized MD interaction site provides sufficient dynamics to the resting state allowing for constant ClpC subunit association and dissociation. This point has been clarified in the Discussion section (fifth paragraph).</p><p>In presence of MecA N- and M-domains do not interact as evident from the ClpC-MecA co-crystal structure. We therefore consider a scenario in which M-domains are required to push N-domains away to the side to prevent toxic ClpC activation as highly unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Based on the observed effects of ClpC MD mutants on cellular viability, the authors propose that the M-domains are essential to control ClpC/P degradation activity by inactivating ClpC in the absence of MecA. The authors should test and confirm this model by co-expression of WT ClpC and MecA, which is expected to have the same phenotype/toxicity as delta-N ClpC F436A (unless MecA-bound WT ClpC has a much more restricted substrate specificity).</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the suggestion of the reviewers and simultaneously expressed <italic>S. aureus</italic> ClpP, MecA and ClpC in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. We observe toxicity upon co-expression that was less pronounced as compared to e.g. ΔN-ClpC-F436A/ClpP co-expression (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Strong degradation of MecA upon ClpC co-expression demonstrates formation of an active MecA/ClpC/ClpP complex while potentially restricting toxicity at the same time (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This new finding substantiates our former observation that M-domain mutations cause adapter-independent ClpC activation. We suggest that MecA/ClpC exhibit restricted substrate specificity as compared to activated ClpC M-domain mutants, rationalizing an essential need for M-domain mediated activity control. In agreement with this model, we observed strong toxicity upon expression of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ClpC-F436A but not ClpC wild-type in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells harboring the entire ensemble of ClpC interacting adapter proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This indicates that adapters convey an increased substrate specificity to ClpC preventing uncontrolled proteolysis upon ClpC activation – in contrast to ClpC M-domain mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Flexible fitting was stated as being used to generate the atomic model of the ClpC-MecA structure, but very few details are given regarding its generation, aside from the fact that iModFit was used. Why was flexible fitting not used to generate a model of the ClpC double lockwasher, which is at higher resolution? The fitting shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> has much of the atomic model out of density, and should not be used for detailed structural interpretation. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “Head-to-head interactions of M-domains mediate formation of an inactive 194 ClpC resting state”, the authors state that the trans-acting arginine fingers are displaced away from the nucleotide binding pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), but given the limited resolution of the map and poor fitting of the atomic model, this cannot be claimed. The reviewers agreed that it is fine to include side chains in the models depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, as these data are supported by biochemistry. However, when depositing atomic models based on the presented intermediate resolution EM, the models should only include the C-alpha's of amino acids.</p></disp-quote><p>Model generation and fitting are now clarified in the text in the Materials and methods part (subsection “Model building and fitting”).

Surprisingly, lane 9 shows that most of the double-Walker B mutant still forms the decamer (or even larger structure) in the presence of MecA. Was this trend also observed in the MecA-bound EM sample? In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;once formed, the ClpC6/MecA6 complex is stable and does not dissociate spontaneously&quot;. Why then does MecA-bound ClpC-DWB show any crosslinking larger than hexamers?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, the formation of high molecular weight products upon crosslinking of ClpC-DWB/MecA samples is unexpected. We speculate that a ClpC-DWB/MecA hexameric complex might be able to transiently interact with another complex via MecA-MecA interactions. This scenario is based on the finding that MecA can target itself for degradation and supported by the observation that at early time points of crosslinking (2 min) mostly hexameric complexes are formed and larger crosslink products are only detected at the later time point (10 min). We assume that such ClpC/MecA complex interactions are transient and therefore not detectable by size exclusion chromatography while being frozen upon chemical crosslinking.

The trailing of ClpC wild-type observed in absence of ATP does not reflect hexamer formation but assembly into larger, unstable intermediate oligomeric forms. In presence of glutaraldehyde crosslinker these oligomers are crosslinked to a high molecular weight complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>As discussed in the points above, multiple helical arrangements of AAA+ proteins have been recently described and the ClpC resting state conformation relates to some of them. Adjacent AAA domains share large surface interactions both in an helical as well in a planar conformation. Therefore the mechanisms of activation of these proteins must be regulated by detailed reorganization of the ATP pockets and cannot just simply be described in terms of surface of interactions. We are missing a high-resolution structure of the activated ClpC-F436A MD mutant. Therefore, it is currently not possible to say how the MDs are influencing AAA domain interactions and nucleotide binding. This is a central point and we hope that higher-resolution structures of ClpC and ClpC-F436A where details about ATP binding sites can be described will be able to shed light on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) MecA has been shown in B. subtilis to promote assembly from a lower assembly state (monomeric/dimeric) to the active hexamer.

This should be discussed.</p><p>The authors suggest that activation upon MecA association occurs via monomeric ClpC. Can they provide evidence for that?

Peripheral ClpC subunits do not show complete densities in the cryo-EM model, suggesting increased flexibility and dynamics.

Therefore dissociation of ClpC subunits seems prerequisite for subsequent MecA interaction.
