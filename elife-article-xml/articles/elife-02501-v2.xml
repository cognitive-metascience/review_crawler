The physiological necessity of these quality control mechanisms in different environments remains unclear, as the cost vs benefit of accurate protein synthesis is difficult to predict. We show that in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a non-coded amino acid produced through oxidative damage is a significant threat to the accuracy of protein synthesis and must be cleared by phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase in order to prevent cellular toxicity caused by mis-synthesized proteins. These findings demonstrate how stress can lead to the accumulation of non-canonical amino acids that must be excluded from the proteome in order to maintain cellular viability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02501.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02501.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02501.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are built from molecules called amino acids. The amino acids that make up a particular protein, and the order they appear in, are determined by the gene that encodes that protein. First, the gene is transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA, which is then translated by a molecular machine called a ribosome. This involves other RNA molecules, called transfer RNAs (tRNAs), bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome, which then joins the amino acids together to build the protein.</p><p>Amino acids are loaded onto their corresponding tRNA molecules by enzymes called tRNA synthetases. Occasionally, however, the wrong amino acid can be loaded onto a tRNA. If this amino acid ends up in a protein, the protein might not be able to function properly, or it might even be toxic to the cell, so cells need to be able to fix this problem. Some tRNA synthetases can check if a wrong amino acid has been loaded onto a tRNA, and remove it before it can cause harm. However, the importance of these ‘editing’ activities to living cells is unclear.</p><p>Here, Bullwinkle, Reynolds et al. show that, in the bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>, a tRNA synthetase works to stop an incorrect amino acid—which accumulates in cells that are exposed to harmful chemicals—from being built into proteins.

However, <italic>E. coli</italic> can thrive without this editing activity when it is grown under normal conditions in a laboratory. Yeast benefit slightly from this editing activity when exposed to the stress-produced amino acid.

The accuracy of translation depends on the precise pairing of mRNA codons with their cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs, containing the corresponding anticodons, during ribosomal protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaher and Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodnina, 2012</xref>). Cognate amino acids are attached to their respective tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), and the ability of these enzymes to distinguish between cognate and non-cognate substrates is a major determinant of the fidelity of the genetic code. AaRSs discriminate against near- and non-cognate tRNAs at levels compatible with typical translation error rates (∼10<sup>−4</sup>) due to the structural complexity and diversity observed between tRNA isoacceptors. AaRSs can less successfully discriminate against near-cognate amino acids, which may differ from the cognate substrate by as little as a single methyl or hydroxyl group. Errors during amino acid recognition do not usually compromise the accuracy of translation due to highly specific aaRS enzymes, and the widespread existence of editing mechanisms that proofread non-cognate amino acids. For example, phenylalanine tRNA synthetase (PheRS) edits mischarged Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> at a hydrolytic editing site ∼30 Å from the synthetic active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kotik-Kogan et al., 2005</xref>). PheRS editing provides a key checkpoint in quality control, as mischarged Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> is readily delivered to the ribosome by EF-Tu where it can efficiently decode Phe codons as Tyr in the growing polypeptide chain, resulting in mistranslation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ling et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite their role in accurately translating the genetic code, aaRS editing pathways are not conserved, and their activities have varying effects on cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacher and Schimmel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacher et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Mycoplasma mobile</italic>, for example, tolerates relatively high error rates during translation and lacks PheRS editing function, as do other aaRSs in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yadavalli and Ibba, 2013</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cytoplasmic PheRS (<italic>Sc</italic>ctPheRS) has a low Phe/Tyr specificity and is capable of editing, whereas the yeast mitochondrial enzyme (<italic>Sc</italic>mtPheRS) completely lacks an editing domain, and instead relies on high Phe/Tyr specificity. <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> in contrast, has retained both features and displays a high degree of Phe/Tyr specificity and robust editing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>). The range of divergent mechanisms used by different PheRSs to discriminate against non-cognate amino acids illustrates how the requirements for translation quality control vary with cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yadavalli and Ibba, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, given that editing by PheRS and other aaRSs is not essential for viability in yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic>, it is clear that the true roles of these quality control pathways remain to be fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the well-documented ability of aaRSs to edit tRNAs charged with genetically encoded near cognate amino acids, these same proofreading activities have been demonstrated to act on other non-canonical substrates. AaRSs are able to edit tRNAs misacylated with a range of amino acids not found in the genetic code such as homocysteine, norleucine, α-aminobutyrate and <italic>meta</italic>-tyrosine (<italic>m</italic>-Tyr), although the physiological relevance of these activities is unknown (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yadavalli and Ibba, 2012</xref>). Both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> PheRS have been shown to edit <italic>m</italic>-Tyr, a metabolic byproduct formed by oxidation of phenylalanine following metal-catalyzed formation of hydroxyl radical species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huggins et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stadtman and Levine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klipcan et al., 2009</xref>). Certain species of fescue grasses (<italic>Festuca</italic> spp.) produce <italic>m</italic>-Tyr as a natural defense agent that appears in the proteomes of neighboring plants, and <italic>m</italic>-Tyr accumulation in the proteome of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been proposed to have a cytotoxic effect on translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurer-Orhan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertin et al., 2007</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that oxidative stress could potentially result in <italic>m-</italic>Tyr accumulation with the accompanying threat of cytotoxic mistranslation. Under such growth conditions, the ability of the cell to edit <italic>m-</italic>Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> would be essential to maintain cellular viability. Here we show that bacterial PheRS is able to efficiently edit <italic>m-</italic>Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, and that this editing activity is essential for cellular growth and survival under both cytotoxic amino acid and oxidative stress conditions. Additionally, we show that PheRS editing in yeast provides only limited protection from <italic>m</italic>-Tyr, but instead is essential for protecting the cell from <italic>para</italic>-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PheRS editing is dispensable for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> growth</title><p>To investigate the role of <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS (<italic>Ec</italic>PheRS) editing in vivo, a strain was constructed containing a point mutation (G318W) within <italic>pheT</italic>, which encodes the β subunit of PheRS.

Additional experiments to investigate possible roles for editing under a range of other conditions, including heat shock, cold shock, pH stress and aging, failed to reveal differences compared to wild type. Growth of these strains was also compared in media containing varying concentrations of near-cognate <italic>p-</italic>Tyr in order to test the limits of <italic>Ec</italic>PheRS specificity in the absence of post–transfer editing activity.

Cytosolic protein samples were isolated from <italic>m-</italic>Tyr treated <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and samples subjected to acid hydrolysis to generate individual amino acids. The resulting amino acid hydrolysate was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MS/MS-MRM). To validate peak assignments of the Tyr isomers, co-chromatography was performed with synthetic <italic>m</italic>-Tyr or <italic>o</italic>-Tyr added to proteome samples. Only one peak for each of the isomers was observed, validating the assignments. Some level of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr was found to be present in the proteomes of both wild type and <italic>phe(G318W)</italic> strains indicating incorporation could be occurring through more than one route. Comparison of proteome total amino acid levels between wild type and <italic>pheT</italic>(G318W) strains indicated a level of misincorporation of 1% <italic>m-</italic>Tyr at Phe codons due to the absence of PheRS editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In wild type proteins the fraction of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr compared to Phe is 0.015, increasing to 0.025 in samples isolated from the <italic>pheT(G318W)</italic> strain grown in the same conditions. This result indicates post–transfer editing by PheRS provides protection of the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome from misincorporation of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr at Phe codons. Quantification of <italic>p</italic>-Tyr relative to Phe in the protein samples isolated from cultures grown in the presence of 0.5 mM <italic>p</italic>-Tyr does not change between the wild type and <italic>pheT(G318W)</italic> strains indicating this protein amino acid is not significantly misincorporated at Phe codons, even in the absence of PheRS editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In these samples, traces of <italic>o</italic>-Tyr were detected, indicating that free amino acid carry over possibly contributes to some of the <italic>m</italic>-Tyr detected in the samples from the wild type strain grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with <italic>m</italic>-Tyr.

Proper quantification of the levels of each amino acid in these samples was not possible as adequate resolution could not be achieved for the peaks corresponding to the different Tyr isomers in total protein samples prepared from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells. These observations suggest posttranslational damage of Phe residues in protein by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment may also be partially responsible for the accumulation of hydroxylated Phe residues. In efforts to increase the misincorporation of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr into the proteome at Phe codons, higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were used, however this resulted in the death of both strains likely due to the other damaging effects of reactive oxygen species.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02501.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Requirement for PheRS posttransfer editing in ROS conditions in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LC-MS/MS-MRM chromatograms for <italic>p</italic>-, <italic>m</italic>- and <italic>o</italic>-Tyr (m/z 182→136 transition) extracted from cells grown in the absence (left) and presence (right) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and FeSO<sub>4</sub>.

AaRS fidelity is achieved through discrimination at the aminoacylation site as well as through additional editing activities in some aaRSs. Protection against both <italic>p</italic>-Tyr and <italic>m</italic>-Tyr incorporation at Phe codons appears critical in <italic>E. coli</italic> as the PheRS enzyme maintains high active-site selectivity against <italic>p</italic>-Tyr as well as post–transfer editing activity against <italic>m</italic>-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS requires this editing activity to protect the proteome from toxic effects of the non-proteinogenic amino acid <italic>m</italic>-Tyr, which is poorly discriminated against by the active site of the enzyme. Examination of the structure of the catalytic active site provides clues as to why PheRS is unable to discriminate against all the Tyr isomers. Ala294 is primarily responsible for specificity against binding of <italic>para</italic>-substituted Phe analogs, while Gln174 and Glu210 help stabilize the hydroxyl of non-cognate <italic>m</italic>-Tyr at position 3 of the ring (<italic>E. coli</italic> numbering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klipcan et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of the cognate Phe substrate, Glu210 is also needed to hydrogen bond with the Phe amino group, ensuring correct orientation of the substrate for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Safro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mermershtain et al., 2011</xref>). It is unlikely this enzyme selects against recognition of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr while still maintaining efficient activity for the cognate amino acid, therefore the maintenance of post–transfer editing activity is critical for fidelity in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In eukaryotes, cytoplasmic PheRS editing is needed to protect the proteome from <italic>p</italic>-Tyr misincorporation. This finding concurs with the low Phe/<italic>p</italic>-Tyr specificity of the yeast cytoplasmic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>). It is unclear if protection from <italic>m</italic>-Tyr incorporation is achieved through editing as the yeast strain encoding wild type ctPheRS is sensitive to high concentrations of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr, mtPheRS efficiently aminoacylates <italic>m</italic>-Tyr onto tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, and other eukaryotic proteomes are vulnerable to the use of this oxygen-damaged amino acid for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurer-Orhan et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that either <italic>m</italic>-Tyr accumulation is not a substantial threat in eukaryotes, or possibly that the incorporation of low amounts of this non-proteinogenic amino acid in certain proteomes confers some as yet unknown evolutionary benefits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Non-proteinogenic amino acids as threats to translational integrity</title><p>Naturally occurring non-proteinogenic amino acids occur widely in nature and are well-characterized by-products and/or intermediates of biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richmond, 1962</xref>). The actual threats these non-canonical substrates pose to protein synthesis and cell viability is unknown, as is the role of aaRS quality control in protecting the proteome from such amino acids. The non-proteinogenic amino acid <italic>m</italic>-Tyr has been detected in several eukaryotic proteomes and is one of the products of canonical aromatic amino acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wells-Knecht et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pennathur et al., 2001</xref>). The presence of hydroxylated forms of tyrosine in proteomes has previously been attributed to post-translational damage to proteins by hydroxyl radical species, and is often used as a marker for tissue damage due to the oxidative conditions of aging and disease. It has also been shown that <italic>m</italic>-Tyr and other Tyr analogs, for example L-DOPA, are substrates for translation in some organisms and could potentially be incorporated directly during protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodgers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ozawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurer-Orhan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klipcan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moor et al., 2011</xref>). Our results now reveal the role of <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS editing for preventing the use of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr during protein synthesis, demonstrating the threat amino acid oxidation poses to the proper functioning of the bacterial translation machinery.</p><p>Incorporation of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr into the proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> at Phe codons is toxic to the cell, and in the absence of PheRS quality control this non-proteinogenic amino acid serves as an efficient substrate for translation. Other non-proteinogenic amino acids have also been shown to be potential threats to translation, such as α-aminobutyrate, which in the absence of ValRS editing is toxic at high concentrations, although the physiological conditions under which this non-protein amino acid might naturally accumulate to significant levels are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nangle et al., 2002</xref>). The robust editing activity maintained by <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS to protect the proteome from <italic>m</italic>-Tyr demonstrates the significant threat such an amino acid poses when misincorporated at specific near-cognate codons. In contrast, the presence of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr in the proteome of wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> suggests misincorporation can also occur at Tyr codons but without cytotoxic sequelae. These findings suggest that the cellular effects of non-proteinogenic amino acid incorporation are codon-dependent. The cell does not have codons or tRNAs for <italic>m</italic>-Tyr, therefore any advantage or disadvantage this amino acid might provide to the proteome cannot easily be selected for, or against, at the level of the genetic code. The only selection against near-cognate non-proteinogenic amino acid use during translation can be made at the level of the synthetase or ternary complex formation with an elongation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dale and Uhlenbeck, 2005</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, misincorporation of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr at Phe codons in the absence of PheRS quality control occurred at a frequency of 1% and had a significant impact on cellular viability and restricted growth. This contrasts with the effects of misincorporation of canonical amino acids, which have been shown to be tolerated at rates of up to 10% without inhibiting growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruan et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together with earlier studies, our present findings now show that the misincorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids presents a substantial challenge for protein synthesis quality control. This in turn suggests that many ‘dispensable’ editing functions, both in aaRSs and <italic>trans</italic> editing factors, may actually be essential for growth under conditions that lead to the accumulation of potentially toxic levels of non-proteinogenic amino acids.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Oxidative stress and translation quality control</title><p>Oxidation of amino acids by reactive species such as hydroxyl radical and superoxide anions results in limited alteration of amino acid structure, such as the addition of a hydroxyl group, creating potential in vivo substrates for tRNA misacylation. These damaged amino acids challenge the protein synthesis machinery, as for example in the case of L-DOPA, and leucine hydroxide, which have been shown to be incorporated into proteins in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodgers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ozawa et al., 2005</xref>). The formation of intracellular <italic>m</italic>-Tyr in <italic>E. coli</italic> under physiological conditions is possibly a result of cellular exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Aerobic respiration results in elevated endogenous levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but bacterial cells are also exposed to ROS present in their environment. Uncharged H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is able to penetrate the cell membrane and accumulate inside cells whenever H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is present in the extracellular habitat. At physiological pH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> quickly oxidizes ferrous iron via the Fenton reaction, generating a hydroxyl radical that can react with nearby cellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rush et al., 1990</xref>). Accumulation of toxic levels of <italic>m</italic>-Tyr in the intracellular pools of <italic>E. coli</italic> occurs under experimental conditions that promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals, however this is not the major byproduct of Phe oxidation. The <italic>o</italic>-Tyr isomer is the more abundant hydroxylation product under ROS-generating conditions used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, there is no observed <italic>o</italic>-Tyr aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> by wild type PheRS in vitro, or inhibition of cell growth, in the presence of this hydroxylated Phe substrate. These, and the corresponding biochemical data, indicate how <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS has evolved to effectively discriminate against different Tyr isomers using a combination of substrate specificity (<italic>o-</italic>Tyr, <italic>p-</italic>Tyr) and editing activity (<italic>m-</italic>Tyr, <italic>p-</italic>Tyr).

TLC plates were then exposed and quantified by phosphor imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of amino acid pools</title><p>Cultures were grown to late log phase in supplemented M9 media with or without 0.5 mM tyrosine in 5 ml volumes and harvested by vacuum filtration over a nylon filter followed by washing cells three times with 1 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. Cells and filters were then placed upside down in 0.5 ml extraction buffer (40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol) containing internal standards (100 pmol [U<sup>13</sup>C]Phe and 100 pmol [U<sup>13</sup>C]Tyr) at −20°C for 15 min. Metabolites were extracted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crutchfield et al., 2010</xref>) and vacuumed dried. Samples were re-dissolved in water (50 µl), centrifuged (16,000×<italic>g</italic>, 5 min) and the supernatant transferred to LC injector vials. Aliquots of the supernatant (typically 5 µl) were injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Phenomenex Kinetex XB-C18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size) equilibrated in solvent A (water/formic acid, 100/0.1, vol/vol) and eluted (100 μl/min) with an increasing concentration of solvent B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 100/0.1, vol/vol; min/%B, 0/1, 5/1, 26/70, 27/1, and 35/1). The effluent from the column was directly connected to an electrospray ion source (Agilent Jet Stream, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) attached to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (6460; Agilent) scanning in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with standard resolution settings (FWHM 0.7) using previously optimized conditions for the following transitions: Tyr, 182→136; U<sup>13</sup>C-Tyr, 191→144; Phe, 166→120; U<sup>13</sup>C-Phe, 175→128. With each batch of samples a series of standards was prepared with the same amount of internal standards and increasing amounts of Tyr and Phe (0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 pmol in 50 µl of water, in duplicate). Typical retention times for <italic>p-</italic>Tyr, <italic>m-</italic>Tyr, <italic>o-</italic>Tyr and Phe were 4.8, 6.6, 8.6 and 9.7 min, respectively. Peak areas were measured using instrument manufacturer supplied software (Agilent MassHunter). The amount of each analyte in each sample was determined by interpolation from the curves constructed from the standard samples (peak area Tyr or Phe/peak area U<sup>13</sup>C-Tyr or –Phe against amount of Tyr or Phe).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Purification and LC-MS/MS-MRM of total protein hydrolysate</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> cultures (100 ml), prepared in duplicate, were grown in M9 minimal media with or without 0.5 mM <italic>m</italic>-Tyr to exponential phase and harvested by centrifugation (6000×<italic>g</italic>, 10 min). Cell pellets were washed twice, resuspended in water, and lysed by sonication. To precipitate ribosomes and nucleic acids, streptomycin sulfate was added to a final concentration of 8 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen and Lichtenstein, 1960</xref>). Samples were incubated at 4°C for one hour, then centrifuged at 11,000×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and brought to 55% acetone by volume at 4°C for 1 hr. Precipitated material was pelleted at 11,000 g for 5 min. Supernatants were discarded and the pellets were washed twice with 60% acetone (ice cold). The pellets were then subjected to two methanol/chloroform extractions, vacuumed dried, and weighed. One set of samples was used for measurement of protein content (bicinchoninic assay, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). After resuspending in water and addition of internal standards (U<sup>13</sup>C-Tyr and U<sup>13</sup>C-Phe, 100 pmol each), the other set of samples was subjected to acid hydrolysis (6 M HCl for 24 hr at 110°C). LC-MS/MS-MRM was performed on the hydrolysate as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Protein hydrolysis was performed with the help of John Lowenson and Steve Clarke (UCLA).
