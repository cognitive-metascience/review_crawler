Using a scleroderma mouse, we show that transplantation of MHC compatible, minor antigen mismatched bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs) play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Removal of donor BMSCs rescued mice from disease. Freshly isolated PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> BMSCs expressed MHC class II following transplantation and activated host T cells. A decrease in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg population was observed. T cells proliferated and secreted IL-6 when stimulated with mismatched BMSCs in vitro. Donor T cells were not involved in fibrosis because transplanting T cell-deficient RAG2 knock out mice bone marrow still caused disease. Once initially triggered by mismatched BMSCs, the autoimmune phenotype was not donor BMSC dependent as the phenotype was observed after effector T cells were adoptively transferred into naïve syngeneic mice. Our data suggest that minor antigen mismatched BMSCs trigger systemic fibrosis in this autoimmune scleroderma model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09394.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09394.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09394.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Systemic scleroderma is an autoimmune disease caused by the immune system attacking the body’s connective tissues, which provide the body with structural support. Immune cells called T cells accumulate in connective tissue, which leads to the hardening of the skin and may also damage the heart, lungs and other internal organs. However, it is not clear what prompts the T cells to accumulate in the connective tissues of these individuals.</p><p>Autoimmune diseases develop when the immune system mistakenly identifies host cells as being a threat to the body. Normally, the immune system recognizes healthy body cells by the presence of particular proteins on the surface of the cells. A set of surface proteins called the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) play a major role in this process, but there are also many other surface proteins that play more minor roles.</p><p>In 2002, researchers developed a method that can trigger the symptoms of systemic scleroderma in mice. This method involves transplanting bone marrow from one mouse into another mouse. Both mice have identical MHC proteins on the surfaces of their cells, but have some differences in other cell surface proteins, and so the bone marrow from the donor mouse triggers an immune response in the recipient.</p><p>To better understand how this mouse “model” of systemic scleroderma works, Ogawa, Morikawa et al. refined the method so that they could just transplant specific types of bone marrow cells into the recipient mice. The experiments reveal that bone marrow stromal stem cells, but not so-called “hematopoietic stem cells”, from a donor mouse are responsible for triggering the immune response and disease symptoms in the recipients.</p><p>Ogawa, Morikawa et al.’s findings show that mismatched minor cell surface proteins on bone marrow stromal stem cells can trigger symptoms of systemic scleroderma in mice. Further studies are required to find out how these cells encourage T cells to trigger an autoimmune response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09394.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09394.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mesenchymal stem cell</kwd><kwd>autoimmune response/disease</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>dry eye disease</kwd><kwd>adoptive transfer</kwd><kwd>auto-reactive T cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogawa</surname><given-names>Yoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Yumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Global Century COE program of the Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Yumi</given-names></name><name><surname>Shimmura</surname><given-names>Shigeto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Women Medical Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogawa</surname><given-names>Yoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Medical Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogawa</surname><given-names>Yoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PDGFRα+ Sca-1+ bone marrow stromal/stem cells in whole bone marrow grafts can trigger the onset of autoimmune-related fibrosis in a mouse model of scleroderma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic fibrosis is a feature of autoimmune disease such as systemic sclerosis (SSc) or Sjögren’s syndrome involving exocrine glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filipovich et al., 2005</xref>). A mouse model for human SSc reported by Zhang et. al. involves transplantation of B10.D2 bone marrow into MHC matched, minor antigen mismatched BALB/c host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). This model of SSc occurs spontaneously without the use of artificial agents such as bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamamoto and Nishioka, 2004</xref>), and exhibits characteristics of human SSc including fibrosis, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Animal models are effective in screening for therapeutic interventions such as anti IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Huu et al., 2012</xref>) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). However, such a spontaneous model is also a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of SSc, which is still largely unknown.</p><p>In order to shed light onto the mechanisms leading to fibrosis in this SSc mouse model, it is necessary to isolate the different cellular fractions within the B10.D2 donor bone marrow, namely, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs). Multipotent BMSCs in the bone marrow differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages including fibroblasts, adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pittenger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prockop, 1997</xref>). However, due to the lack of specific markers, a crucial step involving in vitro expansion was required to isolate BMSCs, which may modify their phenotype and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banfi et al., 2000</xref>). Most current information on BMSCs comes from such in vitro studies of adherent cells referred to as fibroblast CFUs (CFU-Fs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conget and Minguell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedenstein et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pittenger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prockop, 1997</xref>), which are a heterogeneous population of cells at best. Therefore, the in vivo dynamics of BMSCs after whole bone marrow transplantation (WBMT) are still unknown, and the establishment of a solid experimental system to trace the fate of BMSCs following transplantation was required.</p><p>In order to establish an animal model with traceable donor BMSCs and HSCs, we applied our previously reported method for prospectively isolating murine BMSCs based on their expression of PDGF receptor α and Sca-1 (PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>/ Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (PαS) cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morikawa et al., 2009a</xref>). Selectively isolated PαS-BMSCs without in vitro expansion represents highly clonogenic and multi-potent population of cells including hematopoietic niche cells, osteoblasts, and adipocytes after systemic in vivo transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morikawa et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2009b</xref>). Our model allows for the first time both whole bone marrow transplantation, as well as the selective transplantation of freshly isolated BMSCs and/or HSCs into recipient mice. By applying this modified SSc model using prospectively isolated BMSCs and HSCs, we sought to identify the role of donor HSCs and BMSCs in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune-related fibrosis in SSc. Here, we show how mismatched donor BMSCs not only contribute to fibrosis in various organs, but also trigger the onset of autoimmune disease by activating host T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mismatched PαS-BMSCs is a key inducer of fibrosis after bone marrow transplantation</title><p>A known bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model using 8-week-old donor B10.D2 (H-2d) mice and recipient BALB/c mice (H-2d), is a MHC-compatible, minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA)–incompatible model of systemic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Signs of fibrosis appear by 3 weeks after BMT and progresses to a full-blown disease by 8 weeks characterized by excessive fibrosis of the lacrimal gland, conjunctiva, salivary gland, skin, lung, liver, and intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>In order to elucidate the source and role of donor-derived fibroblasts, we first modified the SSc model by co-transplanting prospectively isolated HSCs with prospectively isolated BMSCs. PαS-BMSCs and side population (SP-HSCs) from B10.D2 or BALB/c were individually isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We confirmed that PαS BMSCs cells expressed CD29, CD90, and CD106, known as established markers of BMSCs. However, CD31 and CD133, markers of endothelial cells, consisted of only a small portion of the PαS BMSCs fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These PαS-BMSCs and side population (SP-HSCs) from B10.D2 or BALB/c were systemically co-transplanted into BALB/c recipients as defined combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi–iv</xref>). Unlike the original model using WBM, the graft does not include donor type mature hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, and the cells were provided from each lineage of stem cell after bone marrow engraftment.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09394.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modified SSc model by co-transplanting isolated HSCs and BMSCs.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold></bold>) Transplantation model with different combinations of syngeneic (white) and mismatched (black) HSCs and BMSCs co-transplanted into BALB/c mice.

Since heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), a molecular chaperon specific to collagen-secreting cells, has been reported as a useful marker for fibroblasts in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuroda and Tajima, 2004</xref>), we determined the state of fibrosis by (1) semi-quantitative analysis to count the number of HSP47+ fibroblasts per field and (2) Mallory staining, a specific marker of connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brack et al., 2007</xref>). Fibrotic lesions in mismatched BMSC recipients had significantly higher HSP47<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Lacrimal gland function was also reduced only in mismatched BMSC recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, all these observations were canceled in recipients of BMSC-depleted WBM transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bv,Cv,Dv</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3Av,Bv</xref>). Minimal Mallory staining areas are physiological changes and necessary to support the structure of ducts and intestinal walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The severity of fibrosis triggered by mismatched BMSCs was dose dependent on the number of transplanted BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). These results suggest that mismatched donor BMSCs or their progeny triggered the onset of disease.</p><p>Cells double positive for HSP47 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were detected in fibrotic tissue when mismatched EGFP<sup>+</sup>B10.D2 PαS-BMSCs were transplanted with wild-type B10.D2 SP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Approximately 42.9 ± 7.3% of the HSP47<sup>+</sup> cells in fibrotic tissue were GFP<sup>+</sup>, indicating that the majority of fibroblasts were derived from donor PαS-BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, a notable number of cells derived from mismatched donor EGF<sup>+</sup>SP-HSCs also migrated to fibrotic lesions, but none of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed HSP47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The lineage exclusivity of this transplantation excludes the possibility that HSP47<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts were derived from SP-HSCs as shown in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koide et al., 2007</xref>). The accumulation of donor-derived fibroblasts was not observed in syngeneic transplantation, where fibrosis does not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). HSP47 expression is clearly seen especially in activated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but very faint expression is detected in quiescent fibroblasts in the syngeneic BMSCs transplanted recipients’ target organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The next question was whether these pathogenic T cells were donor-derived T cells, or residual host T cells that lost self-tolerance. Both host-derived T cells and donor HSC-derived T cells are believed to exist in this mouse model, because mature T cells often escape radiation damage and remain in the peripheral blood of recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>).

Our data show that depletion of BMSCs from donor whole bone marrow significantly reduced fibrosis in all organs examined, and rescued mice from lacrimal gland dysfunction associated with the disease. These findings suggest the possible role of donor BMSCs in the initiation of the autoimmune process, as the number of BMSCs in graft correlated with severity of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Furthermore, the onset of true autoimmune disease in these mice was shown by the repression of Treg induction, followed by an increase in Th17 effector cells of host origin. This shows that migrating donor PαS-BMSCs are the initial trigger of events leading to increased levels of circulating IL-6, followed by a decrease in Tregs, and conversely an increase in host-derived Th17 cells. Activation or maturation of BMSC-derived progeny is probably also involved in the progression of disease because accumulation of donor-derived fibroblasts was not observed in syngeneic BMSC transplantation, where fibrosis does not occur. In the mixed lymphocyte reaction experiments, Thy-1<sup>+</sup> T-cells isolated from host mice after mismatched BMT were activated by PαS-BMSCs in vitro, as shown by enhanced proliferation and IL-6 secretion. In addition, the T-cell proliferation was blocked by anti-MHC antibody. Finally, adoptively transferred T cells from mismatched BMSCs recipients into nude-mice-induced autoimmune-like inflammation and fibrosis in targets organs, indicating that autoreactive recipient T cells were activated by antigens presented by MHC class II molecules in minor antigen mismatched donor BMSCs. Adoptive transferred T cells react recipient BMSCs leading to recipient’ fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) probably because adoptively transferred T cells has already acquired the autoreactive nature to activate the recipient derived BMSCs as shown in vitro analysis from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p><p>Although the auto-antigen responsible for the autoimmune type reaction still needs to be identified, a common antigen specifically expressed in BMSCs of B10.D2 and BALB/c with different isoforms or SNIPs, is one of the most probable candidates. Since naive T cells responded to PαS-BMSCs in vitro at low levels, we speculate that auto-reactive T cells that are only present in basal levels under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>) can recognize minor differences between B10.D2 and BALB/c BMSCs. The lack of fibrosis following mismatched HSC transplantation suggests that hematopoietic lineage cells, including DCs, did not express such a molecule. The identical phenotype was observed when host and recipient were reversed (i.e. BALB/c BMSCs transplanted to B10.D2 recipients, data not shown). This implies that both B10.D2 and BALB/c BMSCs can be a primary inducer against mismatched recipient T cells, showing that the autoimmune-related fibrosis in this model was due to difference in strain, and not a specific reaction of B10.D2 BMSCs and BALB/c T cells.</p><p>The novelty of our study is the use of prospectively isolated BMSCs combined with prospectively isolated HSCs. Previous studies have used culture-isolated BMSCs, which do not reflect the physiological role of these cells in vivo. Functional differences between in vitro and in vivo observations may explain discrepancies in the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects of BMSCs reported in the literature (See review by Bernardo et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardo and Fibbe, 2013</xref>). Our study has also demonstrated that donor BMSCs can contribute to the fibroblast population observed in fibrotic lesions of the host. Our findings suggest that once mismatched BMSCs migrate into the target organs via certain homing signals, mismatched BMSCs encounter T cells and proliferate and activate under the pathological microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This phenomenon may not be present in syngeneic BMSCs transplantation where an allogeneic response does not occur. As for HSP47 expression, it is clearly seen in activated fibroblasts, but only very faint expression is detected in quiescent fibroblasts in the syngeneic BMSC-transplanted recipients’ target organs. Interestingly, a fraction of BMSCs mobilized in the peripheral blood expressed MHC class II molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Preliminary data show that these cells also express CD45 and type I collagen (data not shown), which corresponds with the phenotype of fibrocytes reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chesney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mielcarek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies are required to elucidate the association of PαS-BMSCs and fibrocytes.</p><p>Interestingly, this SSc mouse model has also been used as a model of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). The phenotype of cGVHD characterized by systemic fibrosis and severe dry eye is very similar to this SSc mouse phenotype. Unlike conventional cGVHD that is believed to be caused by donor T cells, our results show that radio-resistant residual recipient T cells, but not donor-HSC derived de novo T cells, were activated following mismatched BMSC transplantation. Although we do not believe that our findings in this mouse model could be directly applied to human cGVHD cases, it is worth noting this phenomenon. In fact, several previous reports have shown that residual recipient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells regulate cGVHD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blazar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaffee and Claman, 1983</xref>). In addition, cGVHD has occurred in a surprisingly high fraction of nonmyeloablative stem cell transplant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mielcarek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schetelig et al., 2002</xref>) since residual host T cells remain in nonmyeloablative transplantation.</p><p>Notably, BMSC depletion from grafts significantly reduced fibrosis in all organs that we examined. The use of CD34<sup>+</sup> selected HSCs as an approach to reducing the risk of cGVHD was suggested in early studies of CD34<sup>+</sup> selected peripheral blood HSCs.

In addition, recent reports showed that the incidence of cGVHD was less following cord blood transplantation (CBT) compared to peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uchino et al., 2012</xref>). We have found that BMSCs are rarely detected in cord blood but are abundant in G-CSF-mobilized PBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mabuchi et al., 2013</xref>), which may indicate that the onset of cGVHD may correlate with the number of BMSCs transplanted. Taken all, the reduced risk of cGVHD may have been due to the removal or absence of donor BMSCs as we showed in our BMSC-depleted model. Further studies are required for monitoring the frequency of donor BMSCs in grafts and residual host T cells in human cGVHD patients to elucidate the possible role of donor BMSCs in the pathogenesis.</p><p>In summary, prospective transplantation of freshly purified BMSCs and HSCs into BALB/c-RAG2KO suggests that transplantation of minor antigen-mismatched MHC-compatible BMSCs interact with residual host T cells to induce the autoimmune phenotype observed in fibrosis associated with the SSc mouse model. While the responsible antigen remains to be elucidated, our data suggest that accidental recognition of self-minor antigens on MHC class II<sup>+ </sup>BMSCs may be involved in systemic fibrosis observed in autoimmune disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>B10.D2, BALB/c, and BALB/c background Nude mice 8-10 week of age were purchased from Sankyo Laboratory, Inc.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the possible importance of donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and host T cells in what is typically considered a murine cGVHD model. The authors report that mismatched MSCs are a key inducer of fibrosis after BMT and that host T cells, but not donor T cells, are required for the progression of this fibrosis, presumably as a result in a break in tolerance and the initiation of an autoimmune state. This study is potentially important for changing existing views of the pathogenesis of cGVHD. However, there are some doubts about the results, which have to be answered before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the authors have reported that freshly isolated PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup> are able to survive after systemic delivery and possibly to form differentiated cell types, the vast majority of studies report that BMSCs are not transplantable. There is related to the question of how &quot;pure&quot; the PαS cells are. It is not at all clear that PαS &quot;MSCs&quot; are as uniform a population of cells as the authors think. While they do have features of the best-characterized &quot;MSC&quot;, bone marrow skeletal stem cells, they have other properties that may be due to the inclusion of other cell types using their minimal cell surface phenotype. As reported in Morikawa et al, 2009a, endothelial cells are Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (and it has been reported that endothelial progenitors express PDGFRα). Collagenase was used to digest the marrow prior to sorting, thereby liberating more cells that the usual mechanically dissociation. This suggests that endothelial and or progenitor cells are likely to be within the PαS fraction and indeed, the statements about MHC class II+ fibrocytes suggest that even hematopoietic cells may contaminate the injected population. Further, it is stated that &quot;PαS-MSCs&quot; were found in peripheral blood, but to date there is rigorous evidence that bona fide BMSCs are able to circulate on a routine basis. This calls into question the efficacy of the markers used (PDGFRα and Sca-1) to identify only BMSCs. The authors need to show a better characterization of the PαS cells (CD45<sup>-</sup>/Ter119<sup>-</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells), specifically, to show that they have other markers of bone marrow stromal cells (e.g., CD29, CD, 90, CD106) and devoid of endothelial cells (CD31), endothelial progenitors (CD133), or hematopoietic cells, especially of myeloid nature.

There is related to the question of how &quot;pure&quot; the PαS cells are. It is not at all clear that PαS &quot;MSCs&quot; are as uniform a population of cells as the authors think. While they do have features of the best-characterized &quot;MSC&quot;, bone marrow skeletal stem cells, they have other properties that may be due to the inclusion of other cell types using their minimal cell surface phenotype. As reported in Morikawa et al, 2009a, endothelial cells are Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (and it has been reported that endothelial progenitors express PDGFRα). Collagenase was used to digest the marrow prior to sorting, thereby liberating more cells that the usual mechanically dissociation. This suggests that endothelial and or progenitor cells are likely to be within the PαS fraction and indeed, the statements about MHC class II+ fibrocytes suggest that even hematopoietic cells may contaminate the injected population. Further, it is stated that &quot;PαS-MSCs&quot; were found in peripheral blood, but to date there is rigorous evidence that bona fide BMSCs are able to circulate on a routine basis. This calls into question the efficacy of the markers used (PDGFRα and Sca-1) to identify only BMSCs. The authors need to show a better characterization of the PαS cells (CD45<sup>-</sup>/Ter119<sup>-</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells), specifically, to show that they have other markers of bone marrow stromal cells (e.g., CD29, CD, 90, CD106) and devoid of endothelial cells (CD31), endothelial progenitors (CD133), or hematopoietic cells, especially of myeloid nature. This is key for the authors to claim that the fibrosis is induced by mismatched bone marrow stromal cells.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the editors’ and reviewers’ constructive comments and suggestions.
