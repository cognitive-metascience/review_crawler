The antiviral drugs that are currently available limit the ability of the virus to multiply in infected individuals, but they rarely eliminate the virus entirely. A better understanding of how HIV behaves in the cell would help researchers to find a cure for persistent HIV infection. When HIV enters an immune cell, its genetic material – in the form of molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA) – is used as a template to make molecules of DNA. This viral DNA can integrate into the host cell’s DNA, where it is used as a template to make more viral RNA molecules, which are then used to make viral proteins. Some of the viral RNAs are also packaged into new virus particles.</p><p>In cells, RNA molecules are often subject to a chemical modification called adenosine methylation, which regulates how that RNA is translated into proteins. Specific enzymes add molecules called methyl tags to particular locations on the RNA, while other enzymes remove them. A family of proteins called YTHDF1–3 recognize and bind to these methyl tags on the RNA and influence how much protein is produced from the target RNA. There is evidence to suggest that the cell can add methyl tags to HIV RNA. However, the extent to which this happens, and what effects this modification has on HIV replication and viral protein production, are not clear.</p><p>Tirumuru et al. addressed these questions by analyzing how changing the levels of YTHDF1–3 proteins and the enzymes that add or remove methyl tags in human cells affected HIV infection. The experiments show that YTHDF1–3 proteins inhibited HIV infection in immune cells called T-lymphocytes by recognizing HIV RNA that had been methylated, mainly by targeting the step where the viral RNA is copied into DNA.</p><p>Altering the levels of the enzymes that add or remove methyl tags in the cells can change the amount of methyl tags attached to RNA molecules, which alters the amount of HIV protein produced. For example, when more RNA molecules had methyl tags, the cells produced more HIV proteins. These findings suggest that adenosine methylation plays an important role in regulating the ability of HIV to thrive and multiply in T-lymphocytes, which are an important target for HIV. Since the RNAs of other human viruses, such as influenza virus, can also be modified by adenosine methylation, drugs that target this pathway could have the potential to be used to fight a variety of viral illnesses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15528.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15528.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>RNA methylation</kwd><kwd>N6-methyladenosine</kwd><kwd>YTHDF proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI074658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI104483</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA181997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI120209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for RNA Biology at The Ohio State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human proteins that add or remove the methyladenosine modification of cellular RNA, or recognize methylated RNA significantly affect HIV-1 infection or viral protein synthesis in cells, suggesting an important role for HIV-1 RNA methylation in regulating viral replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interactions of host proteins with HIV-1 substantially modulate viral replication and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moir et al., 2011</xref>).

The m<sup>6</sup>A modification is widely distributed in mammalian mRNAs, enriched in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) near the stop codon and also present in the 5’ UTR and long exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). It has been known for almost 40 years that RNAs of influenza virus, adenovirus, Rous sarcoma virus, and simian virus 40 are m<sup>6</sup>A-methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beemon and Keith, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Canaani et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hashimoto and Green, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krug et al., 1976</xref>), although the impact of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on viral replication remains unclear. The recent studies revealed that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA significantly affects viral replication and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>). Lichinchi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that HIV-1 mRNA contains multiple m<sup>6</sup>A modifications and viral infection in a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell line increases the m<sup>6</sup>A levels in both host and viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a dynamic regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A methylomes during HIV-1 infection. In contrast, Kennedy <italic>et al.</italic> only found four clusters of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications in the 3’ UTR region of the HIV-1 RNA genome that enhance viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The dynamic addition, removal, and recognition of m<sup>6</sup>A in cellular mRNAs and other types of nuclear RNAs are coordinately regulated by three groups of host proteins, including adenosine methyltransferases (writers), m<sup>6</sup>A demethylases (erasers), and m<sup>6</sup>A-selective-binding proteins (readers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). The methyltransferase complex is composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP (Wilms’ tumor 1-associating protein), which add m<sup>6</sup>A modification to nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ping et al., 2014</xref>).

Three host proteins, including YTHDF1, 2, and 3 (YTHDF1–3), have been identified as selective m<sup>6</sup>A-binding proteins (readers) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2015</xref>).

Human YTHDF1–3 proteins contain a conserved YTH RNA-binding domain that preferentially binds the m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs and a P/Q/N-rich region that is associated with different RNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2014</xref>).

However, neither study examined the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA and its effect on HIV-1 replication in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, nor systemically analyzed the role of the m<sup>6</sup>A writers, erasers, and readers in HIV-1 replication.</p><p>Here we show that HIV-1 RNA contains multiple m<sup>6</sup>A modifications enriched in the 5' and 3' UTRs and within several coding genes. We mapped the specific sites in HIV-1 RNA bound by YTHDF proteins in HIV-1-infected cells. We found that overexpression of YTHDF proteins in target cells significantly inhibited HIV-1 infection, while knockdown of these proteins in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells enhanced HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, knockdown of the m<sup>6</sup>A writers or the erasers decreased or increased HIV-1 Gag synthesis and virion release in virus-producing cells, respectively. Our findings suggest important functions of the m<sup>6</sup>A reader, writer, and eraser proteins in modulating HIV-1 gene expression and viral infection through the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIV-1 RNA genome contains m<sup>6</sup>A modifications</title><p>To investigate the presence of m<sup>6</sup>A in HIV-1 RNA and to map the m<sup>6</sup>A modification within HIV-1 RNA, we isolated RNA samples from CD4<sup>+</sup> Jurkat T-cells or primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells infected with replication-competent HIV-1<sub>NL4-3,</sub> and performed immunoprecipitation (IP) with poly(A)-enriched RNA using m<sup>6</sup>A-specific antibodies, followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (m<sup>6</sup>A-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>).

We noticed a differential level of the effect on HIV-1 infection in different cell types by manipulating the individual YTHDF1–3 proteins. It is possible that the different effects are due to distinct cellular functions and mechanisms of YTHDF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies indicated that YTHDF1 is responsible for translation promotion, and that YTHDF2 is responsible for mRNA decay, while the function YTHDF3 is unclear, but likely to aid in the temporal-spatial transport and delivery of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang and He, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2015</xref>). Indeed, we observed a unique high peak within the <italic>rev</italic> gene of HIV-1 RNA bound by YTHDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 appear to have similar inhibitory effects on HIV-1 infection. It is possible that YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 may interact with different host proteins that directly or indirectly affect HIV-1 replication and lead to similar effects on viral inhibition. Furthermore, these three YTHDF proteins may have functional redundancy, and individual knockdown of one YTHDF protein may result in a modest effect because the other two could compensate the function. A recent study suggests that the dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cellular mRNA is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization and upregulation of YTHDF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). It is conceivable that HIV-1 infection of cells may induce the changes of cellular localization and expression levels of YTHDF proteins, thereby affecting HIV-1 RNA replication and viral infection.</p><p>The mechanisms by which m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection remain to be elucidated. Lichinchi <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a conserved adenosine (A7883) in the stem loop II region of HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA increased binding of HIV-1 Rev protein to the RRE and facilitated nuclear export of RNA, thereby enhancing HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>). However, other m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the HIV-1 genome (such as in the <italic>gag, pol, tat,</italic> and <italic>rev</italic> genes) might also be critical for viral replication. Future studies using targeted mutations of the identified m<sup>6</sup>A sites in HIV-1 genome may lead to a loss of the effects on HIV-1 infection by YTHDF1–3 knockdown or overexpression.</p><p>During the revision of this manuscript, Kennedy <italic>et al</italic>. reported that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 mRNAs enhances viral replication and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>).

They showed that overexpression of YTHDF1–3 proteins in HEK293T cells enhanced HIV-1 mRNA and protein expression in a single-cycle infection, and that overexpression or knockout of YTHDF2 in CEM-SS T-cells increased or decreased HIV-1 replication and protein expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>).

As HIV-1 infection was inhibited by the addition of 4-thiouridine (data not shown), we omitted that step and performed crosslinking directly. Briefly, HeLa/CD4 cells stably expressing individual YTHDF1-3 proteins were seeded in thirty 15-cm diameter plates one day before HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> infection. At day 2, the cells were infected with HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and cells were washed to remove cell-free viruses. At 72 hr post-infection, the cells were washed once with 10 mL ice-cold PBS. Uncovered cell plates were placed on a tray with ice and irradiated with 0.15 J/cm<sup>2</sup> of 254 nm UV light three times in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). Cells were scraped off in PBS and transferred to centrifugation tubes and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were lysed in 3 volumes of 1% NP40 lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with RNase T1 to a final concentration of 0.2 U/μl, at 22°C for 15 min, and immediately put on ice for 5 min to quench. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was taken. Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma M8823, 20 μl slurry/15-cm diameter plate) were washed in IP buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 M KCl, 0.05% NP40) for 5 times and resuspended in cleared cell lysates and incubated at 4°C overhead rotator for 2 hr. After 2 hr, beads were washed with 1 mL IP buffer for 3 times and beads were changed into a new tube for the final wash and resuspended into 100 μl IP buffer. RNAse T1 was added to the beads at a final concentration of 10 U/μl, incubated at 22°C for 6 min, immediately put on ice for 5 min to quench. Beads were washed with 1 mL high salt buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM KCl, 0.05% NP40) five times, then with 1 mL T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM NaCl (without DTT) two times, finally resuspended into 100 μl PNK reaction mix (95 μl commercial PNK buffer and 5 μl T4 PNK (Promega) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Then 10 μl PNK and 1.1 μl 10 mM ATP (to a final concentration of 100 μM) were added to the mixture and kept at 37°C for another 20 min, followed by washing with 1 mL PNK buffer (without DTT) five times and with 1 mL high salt buffer five times. The bound RNA fragments were eluted from the beads by proteinase K digestion twice at 55 °C for 20 and 10 min, respectively. The eluate was further purified using RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). RNA was used for library generation with NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep kit (NEB). Sequencing was carried out on Illumina HiSeq 4000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>For bioinformatics analysis, after removing the adapter sequence, only reads that are longer than 16 bp were kept. The reads were mapped to the reference genomes (both human hg38 and HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> (GenBank: M19921.2) using Bowtie2. Reads uniquely mapped to HIV-1 genome (not to human genome) were used in the subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Measurement of the kinetics of HIV-1 RNA in infected cells</title><p>HeLa cells over-expressing individual YTHDF1–3 proteins or the pPB-CAG vector were infected with HIV-1-Luc/VSV-G (MOI of 0.5).

letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;N6-methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA Regulates Viral Infection and HIV-1 Gag Protein Expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kathleen Collins (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were collectively in agreement that the topic of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification is of much current interest, and that there are interesting observations on its role in HIV-1 replication in the paper. But there were significant weaknesses in the data and the presentation, as should be apparent from the reviews. Some of the findings are confusing or hard to understand. Major revisions are required to answer the criticisms.</p><p>Of the comments, it will be essential to address these points:</p><p>1) From Reviewer #2: Silencing YTHDF1, but not 2 or 3, enhanced RT in T cells. In contrast, silencing YTHDF 3, but not 1 or 2, enhanced gag mRNA expression. Silencing each in HeLa cells strongly enhanced both RT and gag mRNA expression. This needs to be laid out more clearly, and an explanation needs to be presented. The explanation given &quot;One possibility is that different levels of YTHDF proteins in overexpression or knockdown experiments using different cell types.&quot; is confusing.</p><p>2) We need better explanation of the exact sites and population states of the modifications. What exactly do the data allow us to know? This is laid out in Reviewer #3 comment 1.</p><p>3) The cell-type specificity of the results is not adequately spelled out. If the authors feel this is a major conclusion, we need to know what is happening in relevant cells (T cells).</p><p>4) The differential effects of the various YTHDF proteins reported here are not in agreement with effects seen by others. This and other discrepancies need to be addressed or explained.</p><p>5) We need to know if the mechanism of action is thought to be RNA degradation or just inhibition of RT.</p><p>We suppose that it will not be simple to address these issues without considerable new effort, and so we want to make it clear that there is no certain path that will assure satisfaction of the reviewers. The key issues raised by Reviewer #3 will need to be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper reports the effects of KD or overexpression of the three YTHDF proteins on HIV-1 replication. These are &quot;readers&quot; of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of RNAs.</p><p>This is a very active area of investigation right now. The existence of the modification on HIV-1 and many other viral RNAs has been known for some time. Recently a paper has appeared that shows that the &quot;writers&quot; of the modification (METTL3 and METTL14 and WTAP) and the &quot;erasers&quot; (the FTO proteins) have effects on HIV-1 consistent with the idea that the modifications are mostly negative.

The authors find that this modification of viral RNA has both positive and negative effects; it is inhibitory to reverse transcription due to binding by YTHDF1-3 proteins. The authors also confirm prior studies indicating that N6-methyladenosine incorporation is necessary for maximal HIV protein expression. Thus, N6-methyladenosine has both positive and negative effects depending on the stage of the viral life cycle. Overall, the experiments were well-controlled and interpreted accurately. In particular, the inhibitory effects of YTHDF1-3 on reverse transcription and viral gene expression in HeLa cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> are quite striking. The authors also elegantly determine the binding sites of YTHDF1-3 proteins on the HIV genome and demonstrate that these sites partially correspond with sites containing N6-methyladenosine. Interestingly, YTHDF1 had a unique binding site within the <italic>rev</italic> gene, suggesting it plays a unique role. The data are significant and important to our understanding of this poorly understood RNA modification and its role in HIV replication.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall this is an interesting story about m<sup>6</sup>A and HIV. A recent paper in Nature Microbiology by Rana et al. showed m<sup>6</sup>A promotes viral replication and via promoting REV/RRE interactions and mapped m<sup>6</sup>A in HIV and in the host cellular RNA. The present manuscript does not significantly advance the field in light of the prior study, and the relevance of the mechanisms seem somewhat unclear. Lastly, some of the experiments seem poorly executed.</p><p>1) Concerns with mapping m<sup>6</sup>A: Mapping of m<sup>6</sup>A sites on the HIV-1 RNA was performed in HEK293T cells using m<sup>6</sup>A-seq and in Jurkat cells using m<sup>6</sup>A -CLIP-seq. However, m<sup>6</sup>A mapping was never performed in the natural target cell (primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) of HIV-1 virus. Moreover, the resolution of these methods seems limited-it doesn't appear that the m<sup>6</sup>A -CLIP-Seq identifies the specific adenosine that is methylated, but regions that might contain an m<sup>6</sup>A. (Or perhaps the authors could show the residues that are methylated in an inset?) This is especially important for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and C</xref> which look like jagged noise-how do we know these are caused by m<sup>6</sup>A?</p><p>The authors claim that there are 4 m<sup>6</sup>A's based on MS. This assumes that each site is methylated in every viral RNA. This may not be the case. The number of sites should be predicted from the mapping data, not the MS data.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (bottom panel), the m<sup>6</sup>A peak profile in HEK293T and m<sup>6</sup>A-CLIP-seq in Jurkat cells appear strikingly different. This difference clearly suggests cell-to-cell variation in m<sup>6</sup>A distribution on the HIV-1 RNA. Therefore, an m<sup>6</sup>A map from primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which are the natural targets of HIV-1 virus is necessary.</p><p>3) The authors fail to identify any robust m<sup>6</sup>A peak/site over the input RNA in the <italic>gag</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel), but they see an effect of overexpression of YTHDF proteins on the expression of HIV-1 Gag protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At the same time, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, several YTHDF binding sites were identified in the <italic>gag</italic> gene. This discrepancy is not addressed.</p><p>4) YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 have different effects on cellular mRNA. YTHDF2 (Wang et al., Nature, 2014, doi:10.1038/nature12730) mediates m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent mRNA degradation and YTHDF1 (Wang et al., Cell, 2015, DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.014</ext-link>) promotes mRNA translation. However, in the present manuscript, the authors demonstrate that YTHDF 1-3 show a similar effect on Gag protein expression. Overexpression of YTHDF proteins leads to a decreased expression of Gag protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors demonstrate the effects of YTHDF protein overexpression and knockdown on gag mRNA expression. Similar to the decrease in Gag protein expression, gag mRNA expression decreases upon the overexpression of YTHDF proteins. Furthermore, a shRNA-mediated knockdown leads to an increase in gag mRNA levels. From their previous findings, YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 should exhibit opposing effects on gag mRNA and protein levels. This contradictory data is not addressed. It is also possible that the changes in gag expression is due to some secondary effects of YTHDF knockdown and overexpression.</p><p>5) According to the Rana paper, HIV-1 infection modulates host gene expression and m<sup>6</sup>A levels in the encoded mRNAs. Protein encoded by these mRNAs (19 out of 56) were previously identified as regulators of HIV replication. Some of these proteins also directly interact with HIV proteins. These m<sup>6</sup>A-containing host RNAs could also be targets of YTHDF proteins. Therefore, the role of YTHDF interaction with the viral genome and inhibition of viral reverse transcription is not convincing. In cells, HIV-1 RNA can be covered with hundreds of proteins before and during reverse transcription. Why would the presence of YTHDF protein on HIV-1 genomic RNA hinder reverse transcription? It is highly likely that recruitment of YTHDF proteins induce HIV-1 RNA degradation or function in an indirect manner to affect HIV. Little mechanistic insight is provided.</p><p>6) It seems arbitrary that the authors only look at FTO and not the other m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase ALKBH5, yet incorporate ALKBH5 in their model.</p><p>7) The PAR-CLIP data should be aligned with the m<sup>6</sup>A site data so that we can see if these YTH proteins are bound at m<sup>6</sup>A sites. It seems like all m<sup>6</sup>A-Seq and PAR-CLIP experiments were done without replicates. This is a problem.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15528.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers were collectively in agreement that the topic of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification is of much current interest, and that there are interesting observations on its role in HIV-1 replication in the paper.

We have performed additional experiments to further confirm our results of the late RT and gag mRNA expression. The inhibition of RT products by YTHDF1 occurred before gag mRNA expression and is the main mechanism. Thus, to avoid confusion, we moved the gag mRNA results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and provided further explanations in subsection “YTHDF1–3 proteins inhibit HIV-1 infection by blocking viral reverse transcription”.

These are &quot;readers&quot; of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of RNAs. This is a very active area of investigation right now. The existence of the modification on HIV-1 and many other viral RNAs has been known for some time. Recently a paper has appeared that shows that the &quot;writers&quot; of the modification (METTL3 and METTL14 and WTAP) and the &quot;erasers&quot; (the FTO proteins) have effects on HIV-1 consistent with the idea that the modifications are mostly negative.

To avoid potential confusion, we have moved the previous m<sup>6</sup>A mapping results of HIV-1 RNA from HEK293T cells to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To identify the specific adenosine on the HIV-1 RNA that is m<sup>6</sup>A-methylated, we have planned to employ a photo-crosslinking-assisted m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing strategy that more accurately defines sites of modification (Chen, K et al. <italic>Angew Chem Int Ed Engl</italic> 2015), and validate the result with a base-resolution method termed SCARLET (site-specific cleavage and radioactive labeling followed by ligation-assisted extraction and thin-layer chromatography) (Liu N. et al. RNA, 2013). However, we need to optimize the protocols of both methods to define the specific m<sup>6</sup>A residues on the HIV-1 RNA, which would require additional controls and time to complete. We feel that this experiment is beyond the current scope and focus of our study, which we will complete in the future.</p><p>To investigate whether purified HIV-1 virion RNA contains m<sup>6</sup>A, we quantified HIV-1 RNA m<sup>6</sup>A level using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is a novel approach because none of two recent studies (Lichinchi et al., <italic>Nature Microbiology</italic> 2016; Kennedy et al., <italic>Cell Host Microbe</italic> 2016) directly measured m<sup>6</sup>A level of HIV-1 RNA from purified HIV-1 particles. Considering 35.8% of HIV-1 genomic RNA (9,173 nucleotides) sequence are adenosines (van Hemert et al., <italic>Virus Res.</italic> 2014), based on our data, we estimated 3-4 sites of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification in each copy of HIV-1 gRNA, which match the numbers of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks identified by m<sup>6</sup>A-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, a m<sup>6</sup>A map from primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which are the natural targets of HIV-1 virus is necessary.</italic></p><p>We agree.

At the same time, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, several YTHDF binding sites were identified in the gag gene.

We now provided new results of HIV-1 RNA m<sup>6</sup>A mapping in both Jurkat T-cells and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>), which show two m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in the <italic>gag</italic> gene. Together, these results confirm the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA despite some differences in m<sup>6</sup>A distributions in HIV-1 infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells compared to transfected HEK293T cells.</p><p><italic>4) YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 have different effects on cellular mRNA. YTHDF2 (Wang et al., Nature, 2014, doi:10.1038/nature12730) mediates m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent mRNA degradation and YTHDF1 (Wang et al., Cell, 2015, DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.014</ext-link>) promotes mRNA translation. However, in the present manuscript, the authors demonstrate that YTHDF 1-3 show a similar effect on Gag protein expression. Overexpression of YTHDF proteins leads to a decreased expression of Gag protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors demonstrate the effects of YTHDF protein overexpression and knockdown on gag mRNA expression. Similar to the decrease in Gag protein expression, gag mRNA expression decreases upon the overexpression of YTHDF proteins. Furthermore, a shRNA-mediated knockdown leads to an increase in gag mRNA levels. From their previous findings, YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 should exhibit opposing effects on gag mRNA and protein levels. This contradictory data is not addressed. It is also possible that the changes in gag expression is due to some secondary effects of YTHDF knockdown and overexpression.</italic></p><p>We agree and appreciate the comments. We have added discussions on different effects of YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 on cellular mRNA and translation (Discussion section, second paragraph). Indeed, we observed a unique high peak within the <italic>rev</italic> gene of HIV-1 RNA bound by YTHDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 appear to have similar inhibitory effects on HIV-1 infection. It is possible that YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 may interact with different host proteins that directly or indirectly affect HIV-1 replication and lead to similar effects on viral inhibition.</p><p><italic>5) According to the Rana paper, HIV-1 infection modulates host gene expression and m<sup>6</sup>A levels in the encoded mRNAs. Protein encoded by these mRNAs (19 out of 56) were previously identified as regulators of HIV replication. Some of these proteins also directly interact with HIV proteins. These m<sup>6</sup>A-containing host RNAs could also be targets of YTHDF proteins. Therefore, the role of YTHDF interaction with the viral genome and inhibition of viral reverse transcription is not convincing. In cells, HIV-1 RNA can be covered with hundreds of proteins before and during reverse transcription. Why would the presence of YTHDF protein on HIV-1 genomic RNA hinder reverse transcription? It is highly likely that recruitment of YTHDF proteins induce HIV-1 RNA degradation or function in an indirect manner to affect HIV. Little mechanistic insight is provided.</italic></p><p>We agree and appreciate the constructive suggestions. To better understand the mechanism of action of YTHDF proteins, we have performed a new experiment to examine the impact of YTHDF1–3 on HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> RNA kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Our data indicate that YTHDF1–3 proteins can degrade HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> RNA in infected cells, thereby leading to inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) It seems arbitrary that the authors only look at FTO and not the other m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase ALKBH5, yet incorporate ALKBH5 in their model.</italic></p><p>We agree.

We have also repeated the m<sup>6</sup>A-Seq experiments using both Jurkat cells and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. We identified similar profiles of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in HIV-1 RNA from these two cell types, which are mainly enriched in the 5' and 3' UTRs, the <italic>rev</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> genes of the HIV-1 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
