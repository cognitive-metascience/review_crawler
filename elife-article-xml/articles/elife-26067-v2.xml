during synthesis. Proper gp160 folding in the ER requires core glycosylation, disulfide-bond formation and proline isomerization. Signal-peptide cleavage occurs only late after gp160 chain termination and is dependent on folding of the soluble subunit gp120 to a near-native conformation. We here detail the mechanism by which co-translational signal-peptide cleavage is prevented. Conserved residues from the signal peptide and residues downstream of the canonical cleavage site form an extended alpha-helix in the ER membrane, which covers the cleavage site, thus preventing cleavage. A point mutation in the signal peptide breaks the alpha helix allowing co-translational cleavage. We demonstrate that postponed cleavage of gp160 enhances functional folding of the molecule. The change to early cleavage results in decreased viral fitness compared to wild-type HIV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>signal peptide</kwd><kwd>translocation</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>gp160</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCaul</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Quandte</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Land</surname><given-names>Aafke</given-names></name><name><surname>Braakman</surname><given-names>Ineke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands AIDS Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Land</surname><given-names>Aafke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN 'Virus Entry'</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCaul</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Quandte</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Braakman</surname><given-names>Ineke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH AI-51519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snapp</surname><given-names>Erik Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>IngMarie</given-names></name><name><surname>von Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG-2011-280829-SHEV</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>Rogier W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signal-peptide cleavage of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is delayed because of alpha-helical structure covering the cleavage site, effecting early cleavage alters the folding pathway and resulting in localized misfolding and reduced viral fitness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins destined for the secretory pathway are translated and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which provides a specialized environment for their folding, disulfide bond formation, and N-linked glycosylation. Targeting of soluble and type-I transmembrane proteins to the ER is mediated via cleavable signal peptides, near-N-terminal hydrophobic stretches of 14–50 amino acids that are recognized by SRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">von Heijne, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kurzchalia et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lütcke et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Walter and Blobel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hegde and Bernstein, 2006</xref>). Cleavable signal peptides are variable in sequence but share characteristics of an N-terminal region with typically 0–2 basic residues, a membrane-spanning hydrophobic α-helix (H) region, and a C-terminal region that often contains a signal-peptide cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">von Heijne, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">von Heijne, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Signal-peptide cleavage is mediated by the signal-peptidase complex, which, like oligosaccharyl transferase, associates with the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Görlich et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilmore, 1993</xref>). In a second cleavage step signal peptides are cleared from the ER membrane by signal-peptide peptidase, an intramembrane rhomboid-like protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Weihofen et al., 2002</xref>). Signal peptides are widely believed to be cleaved co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jackson and Blobel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Martoglio and Dobberstein, 1998</xref>), but cleavage may well occur anywhere from early co-translational to late post-translational, depending on the protein. The minimal requirement for cleavage is the emergence of the cleavage site in the ER lumen, which translates to ~70 synthesized residues of a nascent polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kowarik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hou et al., 2012</xref>), and its recognition by the signal-peptidase complex. Yet, examples such as preprolactin, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and human cytomegalovirus US11 show that cleavage can follow initial folding and/or glycosylation and sometimes requires longer nascent-chain lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rutkowski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rehm et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 represents an extreme case of late post-translational cleavage and the mechanism for delayed cleavage has been a long-standing problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 1996</xref>). The gp160 signal peptide acts as a membrane tether for at least 15 min after synthesis and requires at least some folding of the ectodomain for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>). When proper folding is prevented by maintaining gp160 in a reduced state with DTT treatment or by blocking N-linked glycosylation using tunicamycin, the signal remains uncleaved and gp160 fails to exit the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>). Gp160 begins as a transmembrane protein whose folding requires formation of conserved disulfide bonds, abundant glycosylation, proline isomerization, and trimerization before the protein leaves the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Willey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Earl et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Earl et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Land and Braakman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van Anken et al., 2008</xref>). In the Golgi complex, gp160 glycans are modified and furin proteases cleave the trimeric glycoprotein into its two subunits, which stay non-covalently attached and are incorporated into new virions at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araújo and Almeida, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>). Gp160 is essential for virus entry as gp120 recognizes CD4, the HIV receptor on the cell surface, and one of the HIV coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, whereas gp41 mediates fusion with the target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blumenthal et al., 2012</xref>). The soluble subunit gp120 dominates gp160 folding and can fold and be secreted on its own, in the absence of gp41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>). Signal-peptide cleavage of gp120 is similarly delayed as for full-length gp160 and obeys the same rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van Anken et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, for certain assays, we use gp120 interchangeably with gp160.</p><p>Late cleavage of a signal peptide requires a two-component mechanism that prevents initial recognition of the cleavage site by the signal-peptidase complex and then enables cleavage at a later time. In this study, we identify the structural basis of delayed signal-peptide cleavage and propose a novel role for gp160 signal-peptide cleavage as a built-in quality control mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Residues up- and downstream of the signal-peptide cleavage site prevent co-translational cleavage</title><p>To examine whether the signal peptide directly impaired co-translational cleavage, we replaced the natural gp160 signal peptide (30 residues) with the unrelated signal peptides of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), cystatin (cys), Igκ, and two synthetic, optimal (opt), or suboptimal (sub) signal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barash et al., 2002</xref>). The timing of signal-peptide cleavage was assayed using a radioactive pulse-labeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, HeLa cells expressing wild-type or mutant gp120 were incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine for 5 min and chased for the indicated times. Cells were transferred to 4˚C and iodoacetamide was added to prevent further formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 and the detergent lysates were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody 40336, which recognizes all forms of gp160.

Addition of four more residues of mature gp160 (SP+5) delayed the processing and resulted in signal-cleaved and uncleaved GFP species.

We examined whether the population of cleaved and uncleaved molecules in steady state represented distinct populations or a low rate of cleavage. Pulse-chase experiments showed that cleavage only occurred during the pulse-labeling period and not anymore after synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), demonstrating that signal-peptide cleavage of the GFP-reporter constructs was not progressive.

Increased compactness is caused by a larger number of disulfide bonds or disulfides between more distant cysteines or both.

Postponing disulfide-bond formation synchronized folding intermediates and diminished differences in co-translational folding that may exist between wild type and M26P. Again, M26P folding intermediates acquired high compactness more rapidly than wild-type gp160, with the majority of protein accumulating close to the native band after 15 min of chase.

With disulfide bonds intact (NR), M26P proteolysis produced a single diffuse band of ~30 kDa (&gt;), whereas the wild-type gp120 digest contained three diffuse bands, at ~35 (•), ~20 kDa (○), and ~15 kDa. Upon reduction, all diffuse bands, of both wild type and M26P, dissociated into many well-defined bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> R) that must have been disulfide linked in the diffuse large fragments. The patterns of wild type and M26P were similar, albeit with a mobility shift explained by the presence of the signal peptide in the wild-type fragments, implying that these fragments were N-terminal. M26P was digested into a slightly larger number of fragments, indicative of subtle conformational differences and more conformational heterogeneity than wild-type gp120. The three disulfide-linked diffuse bands from wild-type gp120 indicated that the protease had cleaved between 3 clusters of relatively local disulfide bonds, most likely between the variable loops. In contrast, the single large band of M26P implies the presence of long-distance disulfide bonds between these 3 clusters. This is consistent with the increased compactness on non-reducing gel after the pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as long-distance disulfide bonds would confer more compactness than short-distance ones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Co-translational signal-peptide cleavage causes localized misfolding in gp120</title><p>Because wild-type and M26P Envelope accumulated in the same ‘native’ position on SDS-PAGE gel, we extended the conformational assay from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> to both proteins after folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Strikingly, at the end of the 2-h chase both M26P and wild-type gp120 were highly protease resistant under non-reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Even when we increased the protease concentration to 100 µg/ml trypsin, we still immunoprecipitated a fragment of almost full-length size from both proteins. As before, these large fragments dissociated into well-defined bands upon reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, R), indicating that in both natively-folded proteins the cleavage must have primarily occurred within the variable loops as this would allow disulfide bonds to hold the structure intact. As we found no significant difference in the fragments after reduction, we concluded that both wild-type and M26P contained a similar set of disulfide bonds and a similar conformation.</p><p>To further probe differences in the antigenic structures of wild-type and M26P gp160, we used conformation-specific antibodies. We pulse labeled samples as before and chased for 0, 30 min or 2 h before detergent lysis, immunoprecipitation, deglycosylation, and analysis by reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Gp160 signals were quantified and normalized to recognition by polyclonal antibody 40336 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We did not detect any significant differences at early chase times (0 and 30 min), likely due to the large heterogeneity in folding intermediates for gp160. Only when we examined the 2-h samples, which contained mostly ‘native’ gp160, did we detect significant differences between wild-type and M26P gp160. Antibody A32, which recognizes a 3D epitope in the inner domain of gp120 around disulfide 54–74, showed a significant decrease in recognition of M26P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Misfolding was not limited to gp120, as antibody D7324, which recognizes an epitope near the disulfide bond in gp41, also showed a significant decrease in M26P recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Given that the inner domain of gp120 interacts with gp41 in the trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garces et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that misfolding of the inner domain led to the misfolding in gp41. Immunoprecipitation with CD4-IgG did not show a difference between wild-type and M26P gp160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We concluded that co-translational signal-peptide cleavage resulted in localized misfolding in gp160. This misfolding however, was not sufficient to cause M26P to be retained in the ER or degraded.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Co-translational signal-peptide cleavage of gp160 affects function</title><p>Because co-translational signal-peptide cleavage significantly altered the complex oxidative folding process of gp160, we anticipated the M26P mutation to affect gp160 function. We therefore assessed the impact of the M26P mutation on virus replication and fitness compared to the wild-type virus. SupT1 cells were transfected with 20 µg wild-type or mutant virus using electroporation, and viral titers were determined by CA-p24 ELISA at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). M26P virus exhibited a slight delay in replication compared to wild-type virus, with virus levels being significantly lower at days 3 and 4, although the M26P mutant caught up with the wild-type virus at day 7. Because we expected that the maintenance of delayed signal-peptide cleavage across HIV-1 subtypes would confer a selective advantage, we tested the fitness of the M26P mutant virus compared to the wild-type virus, in a direct virus-competition assay. SupT1 cells were infected with a mix of wt:M26P LAI virus (50 pg in total) in two ratios, 1:1 and 1:10, both in duplicate cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

After 4 and 35 days of culturing, the virus was harvested, sequenced and the electropherograms were quantified. When mixed at a 1:1 ratio the wild-type virus had outcompeted M26P virus by day 4 and the M26P mutant was only present as a minority variant at day 35. Moreover, when added in a ten-fold excess, the M26P mutant dominated the population at day 4, but again only formed a minority variant by day 35.

This delayed cleavage is evolutionarily conserved across HIV-1 subtypes and is important for viral function. Secondary structure in the form of an alpha helix extends through the cleavage site preventing early access and cleavage by signal peptidase. Uncleaved gp120 hence transiently resides in the ER as a signal-anchored type-II transmembrane protein with the cleavage site shielded by membrane phospholipids. The integral-membrane intermediate is retained in the ER, and we here suggest that the signal peptide acts a quality-control mechanism to ensure that gp160 exits the ER in an optimally folded form. Forced co-translational cleavage by insertion of a helix-breaking proline in the signal peptide led to changes in gp120 folding and reduced Env function.</p><p>Residues flanking the cleavage site influence removal of a signal peptide as the ER signal peptidase does not limit its activity to a strict consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choo and Ranganathan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 1988</xref>). While this enzyme may be a specific protease in terms of its location and topology, the signal peptidase nonetheless does show hallmarks of a typical protease: structural descriptors for cleavage are exposure, flexibility, and local interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hubbard et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kazanov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Novotný and Bruccoleri, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Overall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Timmer et al., 2009</xref>). Proteases prefer loops and disfavor α-helices and β-sheets. The helix-breaking M26P mutation supports our conclusion that lack of co-translational Env signal-peptide cleavage is primarily the result of secondary structure around the cleavage site. NMR studies of <italic>E.coli</italic> signal peptidase in complex with alkaline phosphatase signal peptide revealed that the cleavage region adopted a poorly structured ‘U-turn’ shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Bona et al., 2012</xref>).

Enrichment of proline near signal-peptide cleavage sites is not limited to <italic>E. coli</italic>: a database of all verified signal peptides from Archaea to mammals shows ~20% of all cleavable signal peptides containing at least one proline in the −1 to −5 position relative to the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choo et al., 2005</xref>).

We show here that a signal peptide with mixed probabilities may well function as a transient signal anchor. A sequence with similar signal-peptide/anchor probabilities hence may suggest a similar ‘bipolar’ anchor/peptide behavior, provided that targeting is efficient and does not affect the probability computation. The distinction between a signal peptide that is engaged by the translocon and a signal anchor immersed in the lipid bilayer is subtle because the lateral gate of the translocon allows partial immersion in the bilayer within the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gogala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Voorhees et al., 2014</xref>).

Tethering of the protease domain of the Semliki Forest virus capsid protein to the membrane via a non-cleavable signal anchor resulted in more efficient folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kowarik et al., 2002</xref>), and we propose that tethering gp120 might be similarly beneficial for gp120 folding. In-silico folding simulations of knotted proteins demonstrated that efficiency of knot-domain formation was enhanced by tethering of the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soler and Faísca, 2012</xref>). Indeed, many proteins have their N-termini restrained by ribosome-associated chaperones such as <italic>E.</italic> coli trigger factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaiser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>), which prevent early, non-productive folding interactions. In the context of gp160 this can be illustrated by our finding that the M26P mutant immediately collapses into a more compact, disulfide-bonded state leading to a substantially more heterogeneously folded gp160 population. Post-translational cleavage of gp160 restricts conformational freedom, thereby preventing the initial collapse, and increases folding fidelity while ultimately allowing release from its tether, which is essential for its role in viral infectivity.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that signal-peptide cleavage requires folding and N-glycosylation of gp120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2003</xref>), and that five out of ten conserved disulfide bonds are required for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van Anken et al., 2008</xref>). Crystal structures of gp120 show that it adopts a hairpin conformation, with its N- and C-termini in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garces et al., 2015</xref>). Given that the far N-terminus is a β-strand in the native protein whereas our studies have suggested this region to be α-helical early on (which prevents co-translational cleavage), a late folding event (possibly integration of the N- and C-termini) likely triggers the conformational change in the N-terminus, allowing cleavage to occur. This is underscored by the poor cleavage of the various reporter constructs that lacked the C-terminal residues of gp120 necessary to initiate this conformational change.</p><p>The M26P mutation had a dramatic impact on infectivity of JR-FL pseudovirus. However, considering the conservation of post-translational cleavage, one might have expected a more pronounced effect of the M26P mutation on LAI virus infectivity. Although wild-type LAI readily outcompeted the co-translationally cleaved M26P Env-containing virus, the difference in infectivity of target cells was subtle. The defects caused by co-translational cleavage may be much larger in vivo.</p><p>As the association between subunits gp120 and gp41 involves gp120’s N-terminus, it is appropriate that this conserved interface suffered from early cleavage; we found that co-translational signal-peptide cleavage caused localized misfolding in gp41 and in the inner domain of gp120. Because the stability of the gp120/gp41 association differs substantially between HIV-1 strains this may explain the more dramatic impact of the M26P mutation in the context of the JR-FL isolate versus LAI. Strain-specific differences in stability of subunit association may be the reason why the effect of a heterologous signal peptide on gp160 function has been controversial thus far. The gp160 signal peptide was often replaced without detected negative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lasky et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 1994</xref>) whereas in other cases replacement led to decreased infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pfeiffer et al., 2006</xref>). Heterologous signal peptides may compensate for functional defects by increased expression of gp160 and the resulting increase in incorporation into new virions. Although as few as 9–14 native trimers on the virion surface suffice for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klasse, 2007</xref>), suboptimal Env trimers may require increased density for function.</p><p>Despite great sequence variability, signal peptides of different secretory proteins have been considered interchangeable. While this may be true for their primary role, ER targeting, it becomes increasingly obvious that signal peptides fulfill diverse other functions starting from the moment they emerge from the ribosome. Hydrophobicity of prokaryotic signal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Valent et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee and Bernstein, 2001</xref>) or in yeast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ng et al., 1996</xref>) determines whether protein translocation is SRP-dependent or independent and generally the targeting efficiency of a signal peptide regulates expression levels. Gp160 for instance shows increased expression over the course of infection when the N-terminal charges in the signal peptide decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asmal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gnanakaran et al., 2011</xref>). Low efficiency in targeting may result in dual localization of the mature protein, which in the case of calreticulin gives rise to functional ER-lumenal and cytosolic pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shaffer et al., 2005</xref>). Actively tuning translocation efficiency of distinct sets of proteins allows the cell to react to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2006</xref>). To lower the burden on the ER, newly synthesized proteins that fail to translocate are degraded in the cytosol and inefficient SRP binding triggers Argonaute2-dependent mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karamyshev et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to targeting, signal peptides may influence topology of the mature protein, as was shown for the human prion protein, PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ott and Lingappa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hegde et al., 1998</xref>), or they may regulate folding [e.g. gp160, US11, and EspP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rehm et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szabady et al., 2005</xref>)]. In this sense, they are specialized, membrane-bound versions of soluble pro-peptides that function as intramolecular chaperones before their removal. They function in places that cellular chaperones cannot reach. These soluble pro-peptides may contain a cysteine that supports intramolecular disulfide-bond isomerization as seen with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weissman and Kim, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">1992b</xref>) or a specific sequence interacting with the folding protein (insulin). Signal peptides immersed in the membrane cannot fulfill these roles very robustly as most of the signal peptide is not available for interaction, but in essence the functions of soluble pro-peptides and intramembrane signal peptides may be similar.</p><p>The more we learn about different functions of signal peptides the more understandable their variability. Every function requires a regulatory mechanism, and soluble pro-peptides may set the example.

Although we studied gp160 of the LAI isolate, we followed the canonical HXB2 residue numbering (GenBank: K03455.1), which relates to the LAI numbering as follows: because of an insertion of five residues in the V1 loop of LAI gp160, all cysteine residues beyond this loop have a number that is 5 residues lower in HXB2 than in LAI: until Cys131, numbering is identical, but Cys162 in LAI becomes 157 in HXB2, etc.</p><p>GFP constructs ER-RFP, ER-GFP, ER-GFP-KDEL and gp120 sfGFP have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costantini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Snapp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronson et al., 2011</xref>). This construct was used as the backbone for all of the different SP-GFP constructs. The HIV-1 gp160 SP constructs included the SP and one to thirty post-SP amino acids (+1 to +30).

Virus spread was monitored by visual inspection for the appearance of syncytia and by CA-p24 ELISA as indicators of virus replication. Decreasing amounts of supernatant were passaged when the cells were (almost) wasted due to infection by the replicating virus.

This manuscript from Snapp et al., comprehensively looks at the timing of signal sequence cleavage for the signal sequence of gp160, and how its known delayed cleavage affects folding/oxidation and the fitness of viral progeny. A combination of bioinformatic tools and protein structure prediction methods suggest that the formation of an α-helical segment, that includes the signal sequence and the N-terminus of the mature protein, yields a signal-anchor sequence that tethers gp120 to the membrane during protein folding. The addition of a single helix breaking Pro residue (M26P) supports domain separation as determined using an in silico analysis and permits co-translational cleavage. Importantly, early cleavage results in rapid oxidation and the generation of weakly infectious virions. The authors propose a thoughtful and provocative model whereby the uncleaved signal sequence acts as an intramolecular chaperone to promote proper folding of gp160. Given the poor understanding and the importance of signal sequence cleavage to the fidelity of the maturation process and its widespread implications, this manuscript would be of significant relevance to a broad audience. Overall the manuscript is well written and the experiments are properly designed and interpreted. The reviewers concluded that a revised version of this manuscript would be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors would like to conclude that the altered folding kinetics of the M26P mutant yields a more heterogeneous population of gp160 proteins that would include misfolded variants, hence the less-fit phenotype. Unfortunately, the authors lack direct evidence that misfolded variants are produced. While the M26P mutant appears to acquire a more compact intermediate faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the folding assay does not seem to distinguish between properly folded and misfolded variants. As noted by the authors, formation of the folded form (NT) occurs at a similar rate, as does appearance of shed gp120 in the media. The authors concluded that co-translational cleavage of the M26P mutant results in rapid oxidation of gp160. However, it is not clear that intermediate steps in oxidation of gp160 are more rapid with the M26P signal sequence. Can this be quantified? The authors need to address this question in a revised version of the manuscript, perhaps commenting on whether there are other biochemical assays that might be able to distinguish between properly folded and misfolded variants. For example, are there anti-gp120 antisera that distinguish between unfolded and properly folded variants? If misfolded variants are being produced in the M26P mutant, are these variants subject to ERAD, or are these misfolded variants evading ER glycoprotein quality control? In spite of the tremendous efforts that this group and others have made to develop assays to detect steps in protein folding in a cell, one wonders whether the methods available to study this are still painfully insufficient and that even the cell's ability to monitor proper folding has its limitations.</p><p>2) What mechanism triggers eventual cleavage of the signal sequence of wild type gp160? It appears that the rate of folding (collapse of WT gp120 into the native form) occurs more rapidly than signal sequence cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While we don't feel that the authors need to experimentally address this question in the current manuscript, the topic needs to be discussed in light of the current data. Do the fusion constructs that were assayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> (gp160(1-89)-p2 of Lep, SP+10-GFP) undergo cleavage at rates similar to gp160? These experiments all used &quot;steady-state&quot; detection methods (e.g., Western blot), so it would appear that signal sequence cleavage is more strongly delayed or blocked in the fusion constructs. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, it is not clear why extending the gp160 linker residues appears to completely stop signal sequence cleavage under steady state conditions rather than just delaying it as it does in the context of gp160. Wouldn't you expect to primarily see the cleaved product under steady state conditions even if signal sequence cleavage was as slow as in gp120? The manuscript should be revised to clarify this point.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – the media should be shown to accurately conclude ER retention. It is not clear whether the cleaved protein is secreted or being degraded. And the protein bands should also be quantified to determine the retention levels of the cleaved compared to uncleaved protein.</p><p>4) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the microscopy could be moved to the supplementary materials as it is largely a control. SP+1 image shows two cells with apparently different patterns. Is this simply a difference in expression level of the SP+1 construct, or does it reflect different extents of ER retention?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structure and topology around the cleavage site regulate post-translational cleavage of the HIV-1 gp160 signal peptide&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor), and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. The text states that the mutant virus has caught up with wild type by day 6. The graph shows a data point for day 7, not day 6.

Unfortunately, the authors lack direct evidence that misfolded variants are produced. While the M26P mutant appears to acquire a more compact intermediate faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the folding assay does not seem to distinguish between properly folded and misfolded variants. As noted by the authors, formation of the folded form (NT) occurs at a similar rate, as does appearance of shed gp120 in the media. The authors concluded that co-translational cleavage of the M26P mutant results in rapid oxidation of gp160. However, it is not clear that intermediate steps in oxidation of gp160 are more rapid with the M26P signal sequence. Can this be quantified? The authors need to address this question in a revised version of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We changed text to indicate more clearly that rather than a firm conclusion on an increase of the rate of oxidation or disulfide-bond formation in the M26P mutant, the data show that electrophoretic mobility had increased, which is indicative of increased compactness due to either more disulfide bonds or longer-distance disulfides or both. This mobility change can be quantified but this is inaccurate because of the prominent presence of untranslocated M26P protein on top of the folding-intermediate smear. Instead we ran M26P and wild-type gp120 next to each other and added lane profiles to show the large difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Text was adapted accordingly. The limited-proteolysis assays we added (see below) confirm that long-distance disulfide bonds were formed in the M26P mutant.</p><p><italic>Perhaps commenting on whether there are other biochemical assays that might be able to distinguish between properly folded and misfolded variants. For example, are there anti-gp120 antisera that distinguish between unfolded and properly folded variants?</italic></p><p>Before submission of the manuscript we had analyzed already over a dozen conformation-specific antibodies without finding significant differences. Wild-type and M26P gp160 at later chase-time points shared many epitopes and we found no significant difference in the formation of functionally important epitopes in the CD4-binding site. We continued however with additional antibodies (unfortunately with decreased affinities) and now did find significant differences in recognition by antibodies directed against the inner domain of gp120 (around disulfide 54-74) and an epitope in gp41. Given the importance of the inner domain in triggering signal-peptide cleavage (discussed below) and its proximity to the signal peptide, it is fitting that early cleavage led to conformational defects in the inner domain. As this region interacts with gp41, this likely causes the defects we see in gp41. We now added these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> panels E and F with text.</p><p>An alternative folding assay we used with success involves proteolytic digestion under limiting conditions (low concentration protease, low temperature, short times). We added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> panels C and D and text. Limited proteolysis of wild-type and M26P gp120 at the 2-hour time point, when the majority of protein was “native”, did not yield a difference in proteolytic-fragment pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Early after synthesis however the difference was convincing and striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), demonstrating that in wild-type gp120 more local disulfide bonds formed, whereas in M26P all parts of gp120 were connected by disulfide bonds.</p><p><italic>If misfolded variants are being produced in the M26P mutant, are these variants subject to ERAD, or are these misfolded variants evading ER glycoprotein quality control?</italic></p><p>We have not seen any difference between wild-type and M26P gp120 or gp160 in terms of secretion/shedding, degradation or aggregation. Degradation of Env is not detectable; even after 24 hours of chase gp160 molecules still are folding and acquiring an ER-exit-competent conformation (Land et al., FASEB J 2003). Misfolding leads to aggregation rather than degradation. The M26P mutation may only seem to lower expression of gp120 or gp160 because targeting of this mutant to the ER is less efficient and part of Env remains untranslocated. We added more explicit text on this issue.</p><p><italic>In spite of the tremendous efforts that this group and others have made to develop assays to detect steps in protein folding in a cell, one wonders whether the methods available to study this are still painfully insufficient and that even the cell's ability to monitor proper folding has its limitations.</italic></p><p>Indeed, the many years of work we have done on protein folding in intact cells has provided a clear picture of the cell's frequent failure to recognize functional folding. This is underscored by diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia or cystic fibrosis, where many patients suffer from mutant LDL receptor or CFTR, respectively that does leave the ER, does reach the cell surface, but is not functional.</p><p>Reviewers' statement that the methods may be painfully insufficient we took as a challenge, as we had recently added limited proteolysis to our panel of methods for disulfide-bond-containing proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref> shows the results. Nevertheless, misfolding indeed is usually much more subtle than commonly perceived.</p><p><italic>2) What mechanism triggers eventual cleavage of the signal sequence of wild type gp160? It appears that the rate of folding (collapse of WT gp120 into the native form) occurs more rapidly than signal sequence cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While we don't feel that the authors need to experimentally address this question in the current manuscript, the topic needs to be discussed in light of the current data.</italic></p><p>Signal-peptide cleavage is not slower than the collapse. In Land et al. (FASEB J, 2003) we showed that cleavage can start at an electrophoretic mobility just above the native position.</p><p>We in the meantime have data to show that almost complete gp120 is needed for cleavage to occur. Shorter, C-terminally truncated constructs of gp120 do not lose their signal peptides. We predict that cleavage is triggered by integration of parts of the C1, C2 and C5 domains into a β sandwich in the inner domain. This integration likely triggers a conformational change in the N-terminus, changing the structure around the cleavage site from its predicted α helix to the β strand found in crystal structures of cleaved gp120. We now added text to discuss this.</p><p><italic>Do the fusion constructs that were assayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> (gp160(1-89)-p2 of Lep, SP+10-GFP) undergo cleavage at rates similar to gp160? These experiments all used &quot;steady-state&quot; detection methods (e.g., Western blot), so it would appear that signal sequence cleavage is more strongly delayed or blocked in the fusion constructs.</italic></p><p>The Lep reporter construct was not analyzed in steady state but by radiolabeling in-vitro translations. We have clarified the text in the manuscript. The +10 GFP reporter construct did not undergo cleavage either, but in this case analysis was by Western. To address the question of whether only delayed or completely blocked we added a radioactive pulse-chase analysis on this construct, which shows that there is no post-translational cleavage anymore after the initial co-translational removal of the signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, it is not clear why extending the gp160 linker residues appears to completely stop signal sequence cleavage under steady state conditions rather than just delaying it as it does in the context of gp160. Wouldn't you expect to primarily see the cleaved product under steady state conditions even if signal sequence cleavage was as slow as in gp120? The manuscript should be revised to clarify this point.</italic></p><p>Knowing what we know now, that we need almost complete gp120 to trigger cleavage, it is no surprise that neither the Lep nor the GFP constructs showed any post-translational signal-peptide cleavage.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – the media should be shown to accurately conclude ER retention. It is not clear whether the cleaved protein is secreted or being degraded. And the protein bands should also be quantified to determine the retention levels of the cleaved compared to uncleaved protein.</italic></p><p>We have followed up on these experiments and discovered that our original interpretation was incorrect for an unexpected reason. We predicted that the ER-retrieval sequence, KDEL, was necessary to localize the signal-cleaved GFP reporter in the ER lumen, which we confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of the reporters with the KDEL sequence. The unexpected findings were of the controls, the reporters without KDEL sequences: the +5 GFP reporter lacking the KDEL retrieval motif turned out to be localized predominantly to the Golgi complex. This would be consistent with secretion of the cleaved reporter into the secretory pathway and exit from the ER. However, the immunoblot data indicate that the major pool in cells is the signal-uncleaved version. Thus, the Golgi complex-localized protein most likely still contains the signal peptide. Further consideration of the data suggests a model in which the no-KDEL variants are uncleaved not because of the structural accessibility of the signal cleavage site, but rather the segregation of the no-KDEL variants away from the ER and the signal-peptidase enzyme complex. This artifact renders the no-KDEL reporter variants irrelevant to our studies, because we know from previous studies as well as our own data in this study, that immature signal sequence-uncleaved gp120 and gp160 remain ER localized and only exit the ER upon signal cleavage.</p><p>These results in no way alter interpretation of the rest of our studies. They simply argue that the no-KDEL data should be removed to avoid any confusion. We adapted text accordingly.</p><p><italic>4) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the microscopy could be moved to the supplementary materials as it is largely a control. SP+1 image shows two cells with apparently different patterns. Is this simply a difference in expression level of the SP+1 construct, or does it reflect different extents of ER retention?</italic></p><p>Following the reviewer's request, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> has been moved to the supplementary material as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>. We apologize for any confusion with the colocalization data. There is no difference in ER retention. The reporter and ER-localization reporters both perfectly colocalize. The difference in merge color is due to differences in transfection efficiency/expression levels of the co-transfected cells. The levels of the red ER-localization reporter is higher relative to the GFP reporter in the left cell, leading to a stronger red merge signal. We provided the individual channel images in grayscale to highlight the identical localization patterns, as well as the intensity/expression differences.</p><p>To avoid confusion, we have replaced the image for SP+1 with a single cell with comparable levels of expression of the ER-localization reporter and the GFP reporter.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.
