We demonstrated that the ubiquitous GPCR signaling proteins Gq and β-arrestin-1 are essential for fluid reabsorption because they mediate coupling between an orphan receptor ADGRG2 (GPR64) and the ion channel CFTR. A reduction in protein level or deficiency of ADGRG2, Gq or β-arrestin-1 in a mouse model led to an imbalance in pH homeostasis in the efferent ductules due to decreased constitutive CFTR currents. Efferent ductule dysfunction was rescued by the specific activation of another GPCR, AGTR2. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that β-arrestin-1 acts as a scaffold for ADGRG2/CFTR complex formation in apical membranes, whereas specific residues of ADGRG2 confer coupling specificity for different G protein subtypes, this specificity is critical for male fertility. Therefore, manipulation of the signaling components of the ADGRG2-Gq/β-arrestin-1/CFTR complex by small molecules may be an effective therapeutic strategy for male infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>arrestin</kwd><kwd>G

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Male infertility is transforming from a personal issue to a public health problem because approximately 15% of reproductive-age couples are infertile, and male infertility accounts for approximately 50% of this sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jodar et al., 2015</xref>). The unique structure of the male reproductive system increases the difficulty of determining the working mechanisms. Among male reproductive system, the efferent ductules of the male testis play important roles during sperm transportation and maturation by reabsorbing the fluid of the rete testis and maintaining the homeostasis of water and ion metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hess et al., 1997</xref>). Whereas a dysfunction of the efferent ductule reabsorption capacity caused by a developmental defect that produces improper signaling results in epididymal obstructions and abnormal spermiostasis, which ultimately lead to infertility in both humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendry et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nistal et al., 1999</xref>), manipulating the reabsorption function in the efferent ductules could be developed into a useful contraceptive method for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottwald et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Receptors play key roles in the regulation of fluid reabsorption in tissues such as the proximal tubules and alveoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haithcock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomson et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, only a few receptor functions in the efferent ductules have been characterized. Nuclear estrogen receptor α (ERα) must be activated for male reproductive tract development and reabsorption function maintenance to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hess et al., 1997</xref>). However, the mechanism by which fluid reabsorption is regulated by cell surface receptors in the efferent ductules is only beginning to be appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shum et al., 2008</xref>). Knockout of an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), ADGRG2 (adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor G2), results in male infertility due to dysregulated fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules, suggesting an active role for this cell surface receptor in regulating these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2004</xref>). However, how ADGRG2 regulates water-ion homeostasis and fluid reabsorption remains elusive.</p><p>ADGRG2 belongs to the seven transmembrane receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamann et al., 2015</xref>), which regulates approximately 80% of signal transduction across the plasma membrane and accounts for 30% of current clinical prescription drug targets. Five different types of G proteins and arrestins act as signaling hubs downstream of these GPCRs, mediating most of their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Curto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nuber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In the efferent ductules, it remains unclear how G proteins and their parallel signaling molecules, the arrestins, regulate reabsorption as well as fertility.</p><p>Here, we developed a new labeling method utilizing specific red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression driven by the ADGRG2 promoter, which enabled a detailed mechanistic study of efferent ductule functions. By exploiting <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup>, <italic>Gnaq</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>Arrb1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Arrb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> knockout mouse models, together with the combination of pharmacological interventions and electrophysiological approaches, we have identified the importance of the ubiquitous Gq protein and β-arrestin-1, which confer the ADGRG2 constitutive activity to a basic cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) current, in fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules. Both specific Gq activity- and β-arrestin-1 scaffolding-mediated ADGRG2/CFTR coupling are required for male fertility and Cl<sup>-</sup>/acid-base homeostasis in the efferent ductules. Our results not only reveal how fluid reabsorption in the male efferent ductules is precisely controlled by a specific subcellular signaling compartment encompassing ADGRG2, CFTR, β-arrestin-1 and Gq in non-ciliated cells but also provide a foundation for the development of new therapeutic approaches to control male fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gq activity is required for fluid reabsorption and male fertility</title><p>Previous studies have found that knockout of the orphan receptor ADGRG2 causes infertility and fluid reabsorption dysfunction in the efferent ductules, indicating important roles for GPCR signaling in male reproductive functions. Downstream of GPCRs, there are 16 Gα proteins that mediate diverse GPCR functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeVree et al., 2016</xref>). However, the expression of these G protein subtypes and their functions in the efferent ductules have not been investigated. Here, we show that Gs is more enriched, while G11 and Gi3 have expression levels in the efferent ductules similar to those in brain tissue, whereas all other 11 tested G protein subtypes have detectable expression levels in the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ADGRG2 localizes in cells devoid of acetylated-tubulin staining, suggesting that it is specifically expressed in non-ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

After fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) results indicated that ADGRG2-expressing non-ciliated cells have expression levels of Golf, Gi2, Gq, G11, and G13 that are higher than those in brain tissue and expression levels of Gs, G12 and Gz that are similar to those in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33432.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The expression of G protein subtypes in the efferent ductules and ADGRG2 promoter-labeled non-ciliated cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA transcription profiles of G proteins in brain tissues and the efferent ductules of WT (n = 3) male mice.

An ADGRG2 knockout mouse was produced by introducing an 11-nucleotide sequence into the first exon of the ADGRG2 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby creating a positive control for fluid reabsorption dysfunction in the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2004</xref>). The wild-type (WT) mice did not show size alterations due to the normal reabsorption of luminal fluid, but the ligated efferent ductules derived from the ADGRG2 knockout mice displayed a 40% increase in luminal area after 72 hr of in vitro culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Application of the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) or the MEK-ERK signaling inhibitor U0126 did not have a significant effect on the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In contrast, a 50% reduction in Gq protein levels in <italic>Gnaq</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice or the application of the protein kinase C(PKC) inhibitor Ro 31–8220 significantly impaired fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules, which mimicked the phenotype of the ductules derived from <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). The contribution of Gs-PKA (protein kinase A) signaling to fluid reabsorption of the efferent ductules is confounded. While the application of the Gs inhibitor NF449 or the PKA inhibitors PKI14-22 or H89 to the efferent ductules derived from WT mice slightly increased the volume of the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>), cAMP regulators, such as the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (FSK) and the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine(IBMX), increased the volume of the efferent ductules in an acute manner in both <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice and WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). These results suggested that Gs-PKA signaling is finely tuned in the efferent ductules to maintain its fluid reabsorption function because both increasing and decreasing its activity caused detrimental effects. In conclusion, Gi and MEK-ERK signaling exerted no significant effects, whereas Gq-PKC signaling was required for efficient fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33432.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gq activity is required for fluid reabsorption.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of cultured ligated efferent ductules derived from WT male mice, <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice and <italic>Gnaq</italic><sup>+/-</sup> male mice.

The exogenous introduction of WT ADGRG2 to non-ciliated cells nearly restored the appearance of sperm in the initial segment and significantly increased sperm numbers in the caput (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, introducing any of the Gs or Gq signaling-deficient mutants into <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice did not induce a significant effect on sperm number restoration in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Sperm prepared from the caudal epididymis were then examined. <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice exhibited significantly reduced sperm numbers and presented morphologically abnormal sperm compared with those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Conditional expression of WT ADGRG2 in the efferent ductules restored sperm numbers in the caudal epididymis by more than half, whereas exogenous introduction of the two Gs-deficient mutants Y698A and F705A into <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice increased sperm numbers by 5–10% compared with those in <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice. Expression of the other 4 Gs-, Gq- or double-deficient mutants did not rescue the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the sperm production phenotype was related to fluid reabsorption, we isolated the efferent ductules after virus infection with the WT ADGRG2 or one of the mutants and measured the luminal area after ligation. Interestingly, conditional expression of the Gs-deficient mutations Y698A and F705A marginally reduced the inflation of the efferent ductules of <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice, whereas the Gq signaling mutants did not exert significant effects on the luminal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A–F</xref>). This result is consistent with the effects of these mutants on sperm numbers in the caudal epididymis, thereby suggesting a direct correlation between efferent ductule reabsorption ability and mature sperm numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figures 12C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13A–F</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Gq activity is required downstream of ADGRG2, and Gs function contributes to fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules and sperm transportation.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33432.042</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Effects of conditional expression of ADGRG2 wild-type or its selective G-subtype signaling mutants in <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice on the fluid reabsorption of efferent ductules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effects of the expression of the ADGRG2-WT adenovirus on the diameter of the ligated efferent ductules derived from the WT or <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice.

The cell surface orphan receptor ADGRG2 is an X-linked gene specifically expressed in the reproductive system, and recent studies have found that its deficiency results in the dysfunction of fluid reabsorption and male fertility. However, the mechanism by which fluid reabsorption is regulated by ADGRG2 in the efferent ductules remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2004</xref>). ADGRG2 belongs to the adhesion GPCR (aGPCRs) subfamily, whose members are either structurally essential in specific tissues (VLGR1 participates in forming the ankle link) or critical signaling molecules in the nervous and immune systems (GPR56, CD97 and EMRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Purcell and Hall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Although the efferent ductules of <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice exhibit normal morphology, our results here have identified essential signaling roles for ADGRG2 in non-ciliated cells of the efferent ductules to maintain pH homeostasis as well as the basic CFTR outward-rectifying current, which is required for fluid reabsorption and sperm maturation. Currently, there have been no reported endogenous ADGRG2 ligands. While an unknown ADGRG2 agonist may be responsible for ADGRG2 function in the efferent ductules, it is also likely that the constitutive activity of ADGRG2 in non-ciliated cells is sufficient to maintain the basic CFTR current and pH homeostasis, which is supported by our data using both primary ADGRG2 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells and a recombinant heterologous HEK293 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Therefore, our results provide an example of the functional relevance of the constitutive activity of aGPCRs. Moreover, there are several examples indicating the constitutive activity of aGPCRs is tunable by mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Purcell and Hall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scholz et al., 2015</xref>). As ADGRG2 was expressed in efferent ductules that were controlled by extensive tension, it will be interesting to investigate the effects of tension on ADGRG2 functions in future studies.</p><p>Downstream of GPCRs, 16 different G protein subtypes and arrestins play important roles in almost every aspect of human physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2017</xref>). However, the expression and function of five different G protein subtypes as well as arrestins in the efferent ductules have never been systematically investigated. Here, we have determined that the majority of G protein subtypes are expressed in the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). Gq activity is essential for male fertility by maintaining basic CFTR activity and pH homeostasis in the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). In particular, specific residues in intracellular loops 2 and 3 are structural determinants of the ADGRG2/Gq interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>), which mediates the constitutive activity of Gq-PLC-IP3 signaling in non-ciliated cells of the efferent ductules.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33432.043</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram depicting the GPCR signaling pathway in the regulation fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules.</title><p>The ADGRG2 and CFTR localized at cell plasma membrane, whereas Gs and Gq localize at the inner surface of non-ciliated cells. Deficiency of ADGRG2 in <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice, reducing the Gq protein level by half in <italic>Gnaq</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice or PKC inhibitor Ro 31–8220 significantly destroyed the coupling of ADGRG2 to CFTR, thus impaired Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and fluid reabsorption of efferent ductules. Structurally, residues in intracellular loops 2 and 3 of ADGRG2 are required for the specific interactions between ADGRG2 and Gq, which are required for CFTR and ADGRG2 coupling and fluid reabsorption. In addition to G protein signaling, β-arrestin-1 is also required for fluid reabsorption in efferent ductules by scaffolding the ADGRG2 and CFTR coupling and complex formation. Therefore, a signaling complex including ADGRG2, Gq, β-arrestin-1 and CFTR that specifically localizes in non-ciliated cells is responsible for the regulation of Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules; thus, these functions are important for male fertility. Moreover, activation of the AGTR2 could rescue the H<sup>+</sup> metabolic disorder caused by ADGRG2 deficiency, which restored the ability of fluid reabsorption in efferent ductules, providing a potential therapeutic strategy in treatment of male infertility caused by dysfunction of GPCR-CFTR signaling in non-ciliated cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33432-fig14-v2"/></fig><p>Notably, we found that ADGRG2 and Gq regulate fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules via the activation of CFTR, an important ion channel whose mutation leads to cystic fibrosis (CF). One of the hallmarks of CF is infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cutting, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Massie et al., 2014</xref>), which has a 97–98% incidence rate in male CF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). CFTR knockout and the application of specific CFTR inhibitors in animal models indicate that CFTR plays important roles in spermatogenesis and sperm capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we demonstrated the specific co-localization of ADGRG2 and CFTR in the apical membrane in the non-ciliated cells of the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). CFTR was basically active in ADGRG2 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells, and this activity was significantly decreased by ADGRG2 or Gq deficiency. The application of a specific CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh-172, consistently pheno-copied the ligated efferent ductules of <italic>Adgrg2</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Further pharmacological intervention in the efferent ductules and recombinant experiments in vitro confirmed the coupling of ADGRG2 and CFTR activity through Gq. Moreover, previous studies have shown that PKC phosphorylation is required for subsequent PKA phosphorylation to fully activate CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chappe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 1997</xref>). Our study not only agreed with the observation that PKC and PKA lie downstream of Gq and Gs, respectively, but also suggested that ADGRG2-activated Gq primes the full activation of CFTR in the efferent ductules. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the physiological and functional coupling of ADGRG2 and CFTR mediated by Gq in the non-ciliated cells of the efferent ductules primes the basic activity of CFTR, which is essential for fluid reabsorption. The ADGRG2-Gq-CFTR signaling axis is important to maintain male reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).</p><p>Parallel to G protein signaling, β-arrestins are known to play important roles in almost all GPCR functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Knockout of β-arrestin-1 but not β-arrestin-2 abolished the co-localization of ADGRG2 and CFTR, demonstrating the essential role of β-arrestin-1 in assembling ADGRG2/CFTR/Gq signaling compartmentalization to regulate Cl<sup>-</sup> and pH homeostasis during fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules. For decades, GPCR/β-arrestin complexes were thought to play fundamental roles in the internalization and desensitization of G protein signaling. Recently, a mega complex encompassing the GPCR, G trimer proteins and β-arrestins was identified by using an in vitro reconstruction system in HEK293 cells to provide a new paradigm of GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, we identified the ability of β-arrestin-1 to facilitate ADGRG2/Gq/CFTR signaling compartmentalization, which indicated that such a receptor/G protein/β-arrestin mega complex plays important roles in the regulation of important physiological processes, such as fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules.</p><p>Finally, our results suggest that the inhibition of either CFTR or ADGRG2 impairs the resorptive function of the efferent ductules, which may confer a contraceptive function. Indeed, anti-spermatogenic agents, such as indazole compounds, block CFTR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gong et al., 2002</xref>). Compared with CFTR, which is broadly expressed and has important functions in many tissues, ADGRG2 is specifically expressed in the efferent ductules and epididymis. Contraceptive compounds targeting ADGRG2 may have fewer side effects. Moreover, the dysfunction of ADGRG2 or CFTR is rescued by the activation of AGTR2 in the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shum et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a specific agonist of AGTR2 should be considered for the development of therapeutic methods to treat male infertility caused by impaired ADGRG2-Gq-CFTR signaling, such as that observed in CF patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Gq activity and β-arrestin-1 scaffolding are required for male fertility through mediating GPR64/CFTR coupling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Haggie (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers thought the connection between GPR64 and CFTR was highly interesting and that mouse phenotype was also relevant in the context of efferent ductule physiology and cystic fibrosis. However, all reviewers also pointed out significant technical concerns that affect key results. In particular, the use of a relatively unspecific CFTR inhibitor that also targets Slc26a9, and concerns with the electrophysiology experiments raised questions about the primary data and the interpretation of key results. Moreover, the probes and methods used for measuring pH and Cl<sup>-</sup> levels also present technical problems. These significant technical issues and the need for extensive experimental work to provide proper controls throughout make a revision of this manuscript unfeasible within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, Zhang et al. link GPR64-dependent activation of CFTR with male reproductive tract physiology and link in Gq/b-arrestin. Finding that GPR64 can regulate CFTR is novel and interesting. The major problem with this paper, however, is that there is too much data, yet not enough controls. My recommendation would be to focus the paper on GPR64 and CFTR story and try to keep in the data that is really needed to justify these conclusions. Then, with the space that you've saved, perform the controls that are needed and save the additional data for other papers. The mouse experiments are nicely done and believable, but you fall down on the immunohistochemistry, western blots and patch clamping due to lack of controls. This paper is highly focused on CFTR, GPR64, Gq – it'd be nice to see for example, that GPR64 does not interact/colocalize with other ion channels (e.g. Ano1 ro whatever) etc. My comments are below.</p><p>General</p><p>What is the natural ligand for GPR64 in the testes? This is not discussed. For GPR64, this might not be known, but that's ok and it should be pointed out not avoided. GPR64 belongs to a superfamily of &quot;adhesion GPCRs&quot;. From Wikipedia, &quot;The defining feature of adhesion GPCRs that distinguishes them from other GPCRs is their hybrid molecular structure. The extracellular region of adhesion GPCRs can be exceptionally long and contain a variety of structural domains that are known for the ability to facilitate cell and matrix interactions.&quot; This has been reviewed and might give you a clue or at least give you something to discuss.</p><p>Patch clamp. As discussed below, more needs to be done by patch clamp to ensure that this is CFTR that you are recording (more inhibitors, demonstrate that the reversal potential changes appropriately). Also, is this CFTR that's basally active? More needs to be done to define this. What happens with forskolin or inhibitors of PKA/PKC to CFTR in WT and KO cells? Why is CFTR basally active in this cell type? How is GPR64/Gq regulating CFTR? Is it affecting N or Po? Single channel records would be nice to see, as would surface biotinylation/western blots to see if this process affects CFTR trafficking.</p><p>WBs are too cropped and often lack controls to demonstrate specificity (except those with knockout mice). Also, integrated densitometry should be included for all WBs. There are also specific issues with the CFTR westerns (i.e. I think that they're inverted). Here, the reviewers should indicate which is the mature band.</p><p>Immnuo – Not enough info is presented to convince me that what you are seeing takes place in non-ciliated cells. Please provide light images and more extensive co-localization markers to verify this.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> - Going from A to R is excessive and many images are too small. Please consider splitting up this figure into 3.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A–C</xref> - Why did you only do brain and testes? Why not do other organs that expresses CFTR? This would fit better into the theme of the paper (that is expanded upon in the discussion) that CFTR is highly expressed but GPR64 gives specificity by being more highly expressed in testes.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> - The images are too small and there is not enough information. Also, there are no controls. Also, the authors claim to that GPR64 is localized to non-ciliated cells, but I cannot tell this from the information provided.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> - The images are too small. Scale bars are hard to read.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>- I can barely see the cells on these images.</p><p>Figure 1I - H89 is only PKA-specific at nM levels. At 10 μm it will hit many other kinases – this needs to be addressed.</p><p>IBMX is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor – This should be stated in both the Results section and discussion section rather than calling it a &quot;cAMP motivator&quot;.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2–E</xref> - The authors measure duct width as an indicator of fluid secretion. The first add a series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibitors and then a CFTR-specific inhibitor. This is a strange juxtaposition. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not present in biological fluids at a sufficiently high concentration to be an osmotic driver of fluid secretion and secretion is mediated by Cl, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. As such, a more conventional approach where inhibits of Cl, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transport should be employed. For example, as well as GLYH101, DIDS, bumetanide, niflumic acid could be added as inhibitors of Cl<sup>-</sup> transport. Similarly, amiloride (Na+) etc. should also be added. Inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is a different question, and if they are going to go this route, they should also inhibit Orai1/STIM1, chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup> etc.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> - I suspect that something is wrong with your measurements. Inhibition of CFTR does not usually lead to changes in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> measurements since there are many other anion channels/exchangers that can modulate intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis. Indeed, cells from CF patients have normal intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> levels. MQAE is a non-rationmetric dye that has all the problems associated with this type of dye – for example, changes in cell size can concentrate or dilute the dye which will change fluorescence. Or, is dye loading normal in these cells? What if GPR64 affects xenobiotic pumps like MRP1 that can extrude fluorescent dyes?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> - Are you really seeing a chronic pH change of &gt;1? This is huge and likely incompatible with normal cellular function. See above comments about dye extrusion. Also, give the potential importance of this, where are the controls? What happens in bicarb free media? With acetazolamide or inhibition of Na/H or H/K exchange?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref> - You really should be using Pearson's correlation to measure and quantify colocalization. Controls are needed – it'd be nice to show an ion channel that does not co- colocalize. Also, showing some antibody specificity by showing secondary only.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L</xref> - The current traces look like CFTR but a sizeable amount of current remains after addition of GLYH101. Is there leak or another background current. To prove that this is CFTR other anion channel inhibitors should be used (e.g. DIDs etc.). Also, these experiments are performed in near-symmetrical solutions. The authors should reduce the extracellular solution by 100 mM or more and show that they can get a Nernstian shift in reversal potential.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref> - I have the same issues with the ic Cl/pH measurements. Here, the pH difference is smaller, but WT is closer to 7.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref> - The above statement that not enough is done to.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> - No controls (i.e. other proteins) – also they should include ciliated cell-specific markers such as anti-acetylated a tubulin which is only found in cilia. I'm not convinced by their claim that this effect doesn't occur in cilia. Also, there is no quantification.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> – Why did they do spleen as a control here (brain was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). I think that a more rational approach should be used – i.e. some other CFTR-expressing and some non-CFTR expressing tissues.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> - Please include a positive control that can alter IP levels such as ATP which will activate Gq via purinergic receptors. Since IP metabolism can vary depending on the cells needs, a common approach to meaure IP levels is to add lithium to prevent IP degradation and look for total IP levels of all species.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> - See above but WBs are too cropped and don't have controls like cells that do not express GPR64.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref> - Same comments as above.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–J</xref> - Same comments as above. (needs controls and better quantification).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref> - CFTR is usually seen as Band C (mature, glycosylated) and Band B (immature, minimally glycosylated). Normally Band C is the predominant form in non-CF cells. Thus, unless your cells are CF or very different, I strongly suspect that your CFTR blots are upside down.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> - Same comments as above.</p><p>5B-C - Same comments as above. (needs controls and better quantification).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref> - For the CFTR electrophys in this paper, the reversal potential is negative (unlike <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> where it is 0). This is surprising given the predicted reversal potential for Cl<sup>-</sup> is ~0. Why is this? Did you change your conditions relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–L</xref> - Given the length of the paper, this in my opinion is too much. This data should be removed and saved for another paper.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> - Please spell out what ED, IS stand for on the figures. There's room. Also, please add arrows pointing to sperm accumulation etc.</p><p>Supplement – many of the same concerns arise. The figures are very small, immunofluorescence doesn't have adequate controls and Western blots are too cropped.</p><p>Discussion section – given all of the data presented. The discussion is very short. I would like to see more consideration of GPR64s physiological role as well as more discussion of CFTR regulation.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Gq activity and B-arrestin1-scaffolding are required for male fertility through mediating CPR64/CFTR coupling.</p><p>Overview: This is a comprehensive study evaluating the role for a CFTR/GPR64 complex in fluid reabsorption across efferent ducts of the testis – a function that is vital for male fertility. Further the authors interrogated the regulation of this complex by Gq and B-arrestin. For this most part- these studies are robust and convincing with respect to the role of GPR64 in this function. However- the role of CFTR in this function could use additional supportive data.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> focuses on the tubule fluid transport properties of efferent ductules- studied ex-vivo. These studies clearly show that disruption of GPR64 and Gq impairs fluid reabsorption, morphology and sperm count.</p><p>On the other hand- the role for CFTR is not clear as increases and decreases in activation (via kinase activators and inhibitors respectively) leads to the same effect of luminal swelling.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that disruption of GPR64 alters the sensitivity of the ductular fluid transport to ion channel blockers (calcium transport proteins in addition of a CFTR channel blocker). They also show that chloride channel activity contributes to fluid transport. Their data falls somewhat short of proving that this activity is CFTR mediated. The regulatory properties of the conductance (i.e. regulation by PKA) was not shown and this is important. Also, while GlyH-101 is a well-known CFTR channel blocker- it is not specific and inhibits other chloride channels, including the SLC26A9 channel. The authors should include another inhibitor (i.e. CFTRinh-172) to test specificity.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> aims to show that Β-arrestin1 contributes to fluid reabsorption in these tubes and its expression promotes co-localization of GPR64 and CFTR. However, labeling of the diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> seems somewhat confusing- does 4J show a line scan of GPR64 and CFTR localization or BArr1 and GPR64? The pattern of staining for GPR64 and CFTR looks similar but not overlapping- what compartments are the two proteins localized after BArr1 KO?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows the consequence of co-expressing CFTR with GPR64 Wt or mutants bearing substitution in intracellular loops 2 and 3. This is a comprehensive set of studies supporting the role for these loops in mediating functional interaction between GRP64 and CFTR. However- an important control would include single transfections with GPR64 (no CFTR) to ensure that it is not modulating a distinct chloride channel. Western blotting to ensure expression of the each of the mutant GPR64 proteins would also be helpful to support the conclusion that there are site specific effects in the interaction- rather than reporting differences in protein abundance.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript under review considers interaction between GPR64, CFTR and arrestins in non-cilliated cells of the male reproductive system. In general, the content of this study is interesting and relevant. However, a number of significant technical concerns with the presented study raise doubts about key results.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Several studies have shown that GlyH-101 is not entirely specific for CFTR, for instance at 50 microM GlyH-101 inhibits SLC26A9. A panel of CFTR inhibitors, including CFTRinh172 should have been considered for studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In addition, qPCR or similar should be employed to unambiguously determine that SLC26A9 is not a relevant player in cellular system under consideration.</p><p>In terms of the intracellular measurements of [Cl<sup>-</sup>], MQAE is essentially completely insensitive to [Cl<sup>-</sup>] above 100 mM, so it is hard to see how intracellular [Cl<sup>-</sup>] could be determined to be ~140 mM. In this regard, it is notable that the calibration curve for MQAE versus [Cl<sup>-</sup>] presented in the supplementary data is only extended to ~80 mM [Cl<sup>-</sup>] (i.e., well below the reported value). As such, it is difficult to have any confidence in the presented values of [Cl<sup>-</sup>].</p><p>In terms of the GlyH-101 studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, do driving forces predict that CFTR inhibition would mediate accumulation of cytoplasmic [Cl<sup>-</sup>]? What are the consequences of such inappropriately high intracellular [Cl<sup>-</sup>]? What happens to the concentration of cations, and the membrane potential of cells with such non-physiological levels of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]?</p><p>In terms of the pH measurements presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, sensitivity of BCECF to determine pH above ~pH 7.8 is limited. In addition, no calibration curve is presented – it is critical to demonstrate that the employed method would accurately determine the reported pKa for the fluorescent probe employed, i.e., BCECF, to have confidence that a pH of 8.4 could be accurately determined. The presented methods are unclear, for instance a 25 mM bicarbonate solution would require gassing with 5% CO2, but this is not mentioned. The description of what was measured in the Results was vague, inner solution of efferent ductules does not imply that cytoplasmic pH was determined.</p><p>In terms of the patch clamp analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, prior studies by Muanprasat and colleagues have demonstrated that GlyH-101 inhibition of CFTR is strongly dependent on membrane potential – as would be expected for a charged molecule with a pore occluding mechanism of action. As such, GlyH-101 inhibition alters CFTR current-voltage curves from being linear to showing inward rectification. This is apparently not observed in the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> (where I-V curve remains linear). There is a concentration dependence of this phenomenon, however, I was unable to find information about how much GlyH-101 was used in the Legend or Material and Methods section for the presented data. In general, most studies used 25 microM GlyH-101. If this concentration was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, then inward rectification of CFTR I-V relationship would definitely be anticipated. Consideration of submaximal concentrations of GlyH-101, per Muanprasat and colleagues, should be considered to provide confidence that CFTR currents are really being observed in the reported data. In addition, delivery of PKA (in the pipette) is typically used for excised patch data, as such, experimental data should be presented for whole cell recordings with consideration of an alternative CFTR stimulant such as forskolin. In addition, for patch clamp data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, pharmacological validation that currents are CFTR -dependent should be presented.</p><p>For the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, does stimulation of CFTR with an alternative agonist, such as forskolin, mediate similar cytoplasmic chloride concentration reduction? Molecular details of how GPR64 is activated have been elucidated and are considered by the authors in the supplemental data, for instance in regard to GPR64beta elevating of cAMP. Does the carboxy-terminal fragment of GPR64 also reduce cytoplasmic [Cl<sup>-</sup>]?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>, the mere co-localization of two proteins to a membrane determined imaged by confocal microscopy does not indicate or suggest that a complex with functional coupling exists.

My recommendation would be to focus the paper on GPR64 and CFTR story and try to keep in the data that is really needed to justify these conclusions. Then, with the space that you've saved, perform the controls that are needed and save the additional data for other papers. The mouse experiments are nicely done and believable, but you fall down on the immunohistochemistry, western blots and patch clamping due to lack of controls. This paper is highly focused on CFTR, GPR64, Gq – it'd be nice to see for example, that GPR64 does not interact/colocalize with other ion channels (e.g. Ano1 ro whatever) etc. My comments are below.</p><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestions, which have improved the flow of our story and made the manuscript more compelling by including appropriate controls. We have added additional controls, including immunohistochemistry, Western blots and patch clamp experiments. For example, we have used another ion channel, Ano1, as a negative control for the co-localization of GPR64 with CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). We have also reorganized the data to clarify the results. Please see the following point-by-point responses.</p><p>General</p><p>What is the natural ligand for GPR64 in the testes? This is not discussed. For GPR64, this might not be known, but that's ok and it should be pointed out not avoided. GPR64 belongs to a superfamily of &quot;adhesion GPCRs&quot;. From Wikipedia, &quot;The defining feature of adhesion GPCRs that distinguishes them from other GPCRs is their hybrid molecular structure. The extracellular region of adhesion GPCRs can be exceptionally long and contain a variety of structural domains that are known for the ability to facilitate cell and matrix interactions.&quot; This has been reviewed and might give you a clue or at least give you something to discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestion. We have now included an introduction of GPR64 as an adhesion GPCR member in subsection “Molecular determinants of GPR64 coupling with G protein subtypes and their contribution to the regulation of CFTR activity in vitro”, and a discussion of the potential GPR64 activation mechanism in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Patch clamp. As discussed below, more needs to be done by patch clamp to ensure that this is CFTR that you are recording (more inhibitors, demonstrate that the reversal potential changes appropriately). Also, is this CFTR that's basally active? More needs to be done to define this. What happens with forskolin or inhibitors of PKA/PKC to CFTR in WT and KO cells? Why is CFTR basally active in this cell type? How is GPR64/Gq regulating CFTR? Is it affecting N or Po? Single channel records would be nice to see, as would surface biotinylation/western blots to see if this process affects CFTR trafficking.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comments regarding the working mechanism of CFTR in the efferent ductules. We have performed substantial new experiments, and a detailed response follows:</p><p>1) We have performed new electrophysiology whole-cell Cl<sup>-</sup> recordings of primary GPR64 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells derived from wild-type and GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> mice at normal Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations or with the substitution of Cl<sup>-</sup> by gluconate (Gluc<sup>-</sup>) in the bath solution, with or without different agonists or pharmacological inhibitors, including forskolin, the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220, the PKA inhibitor PKI 14-22, the ANO1 inhibitor Ani9 (Namkung, 2016), the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger inhibitor DIDS and the specific CFTR inhibitor CFTR-Inh-172 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–7E</xref>, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to Figure 6—figure supplement 3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In GPR64 promoter-labeled wild-type efferent ductule cells, we observed an outwardly-rectifying whole-cell Cl<sup>-</sup> current (I<sub>GPR64-ED</sub>), which was significantly diminished in response to substitution of the bath Cl<sup>-</sup> solution with Gluc<sup>-</sup> (148.5 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> was replaced with 48.5 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> and 100 mM Gluc<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The change in the reversal potential (E<sub>rev</sub>) followed the Nernst equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). However, the whole-cell Cl<sup>-</sup> current of the GPR64 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells derived from GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> mice was significantly lower than that in cells derived from their wild-type littermates, which showed only a modest difference in response to substitution of the bath Cl<sup>-</sup> solution with Gluc<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–6B</xref>). These results suggested that GPR64 deficiency in the efferent ductules significantly reduced the whole-cell Cl<sup>-</sup> current of GPR64 promoter-labeled non-ciliated cells.</p><p>2) Our Western blot data showed that the ablation of GPR64 had no effect on CFTR protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and I</xref> and Figure 5—figure supplement 5). To examine whether CFTR is basically activated in GPR64 promoter-labeled cells, we utilized the CFTR-specific inhibitor CFTR-Inh-172, the CFTR agonist FSK<sup>+</sup>IBMX (Lu et al., 2010) and inhibitors for other Cl<sup>-</sup> transporters, including ANI9 and DIDS. The whole-cell Cl<sup>-</sup> current of GPR64 promoter-labeled wild-type efferent ductule cells was significantly reduced by the application of the CFTR inhibitor CFTR-Inh-172 but not by the ANO1 inhibitor ANI9 or the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger inhibitor DIDS, suggesting that CFTR is likely the main mediator of the Cl<sup>-</sup> current of GPR64 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Moreover, the CFTR agonist FSK<sup>+</sup>IBMX induced similar Cl<sup>-</sup> currents in cells derived from both wild-type and GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Moreover, the application of CFTR-Inh-172 to GPR64 promoter-labeled cells derived from wild-type mice decreased the I<sub>GPR64-ED</sub> to a level closer to the I<sub>GPR64-ED</sub> of cells derived from GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggested that CFTR in GPR64 promoter-labeled wild-type efferent ductule cells was generally active, and this activity was dependent on the expression of GPR64 in these cells.</p><p>3) To define the mechanism underlying CFTR activity in the efferent ductules, we performed a series of cell biology experiments. The GPR64 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells derived from GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> cells had much lower IP1 and cAMP levels compared with cells derived from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–I</xref> in the revised manuscript). These increases potentially cause the basal activity of CFTR, which is activated by PKA and PKC downstream of IP1 and cAMP (Chappe et al., 2003; Guggino and Stanton, 2006), and our data showed the constitutive Gq and Gs activity of GPR64 following its expression in HEK293 cells, which promoted CFTR activity in a heterologous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and Figure 9—figure supplement 1 to Figure 9—figure supplement 6). The inhibitory effects of the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 and the PKA inhibitor PKI 14–22 in the efferent ductules further supported this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). The increased IP1 and cAMP levels were attributed to the constitutive activity of GPR64, a property shared by many adhesion GPCR members (Gupte et al., 2012; Paavola and Hall, 2012). Currently, single channel recording of GPR64-labeled efferent ductules is technologically challenging as we are unable to decrease the noise, which is essential for a good signal-to-noise ratio. We are still optimizing conditions for these experiments and may include these results in a future manuscript.</p><p>4) To monitor CFTR trafficking in the efferent ductule cells, we performed co-immunostaining experiments. In both GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> and wild-type mice, CFTR colocalized with ezrin, an apical membrane marker for the efferent ductules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that GPR64 deficiency does not affect CFTR trafficking. However, in β-arrestin-1-deficient mice, CFTR was localized away from both GPR64 and ezrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>), suggesting that its proper localization in the apical membrane is dependent on β-arrestin-1 but not on β-arrestin-2 or GPR64.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>WBs are too cropped and often lack controls to demonstrate specificity (except those with knockout mice).

The first add a series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibitors and then a CFTR-specific inhibitor. This is a strange juxtaposition. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not present in biological fluids at a sufficiently high concentration to be an osmotic driver of fluid secretion and secretion is mediated by Cl, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. As such, a more conventional approach where inhibits of Cl, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transport should be employed. For example, as well as GLYH101, DIDS, bumetanide, niflumic acid could be added as inhibitors of Cl<sup>-</sup> transport. Similarly, amiloride (Na+) etc should also be added. Inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is a different question, and if they are going to go this route, they should also inhibit Orai1/STIM1, chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup> etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your very helpful suggestions to improve our paper. We have incorporated all of the drugs you have suggested in new experiments to confirm our results.</p><p>We performed the following new experiments: first, we examined the expression of different chloride channels as well as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transporters in GPR64-expressing efferent ductule cells and compared them with non-GPR64 promoter-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in the revised manuscript). We found that CFTR, NHE1, NHE3, NKCC, DRA, SLC26a9, CAII, CLCA1, TRPC3, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 are expressed in GPR64 promoter-labeled cells, whereas ANO1, V-ATPase and Cav2.2 demonstrated relatively lower expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>We next used bumetanide to block the Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC, nifumic acid (NFA) to block the calcium-dependent chloride channel CaCC, and ANI9 to block anoctamin-1 (ANO1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>). None of these inhibitors had significant effects on fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules in ligation experiments. Similarly, chelating calcium with EGTA or the administration of TRP channel blockers had no significant effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-H</xref>). The application of 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) to block chloride-bicarbonate exchange induced small effects only after 60 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The application of amiloride to block sodium/hydrogen antiporter NHE1 activity resulted in different phenotypes compared to those of GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, blocking CFTR activity with either GlyH-101 or CFTR-Inh-172 exerted significant effects on fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules and pheno-copied GPR64 <sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–4K</xref>).

Inhibition of CFTR does not usually lead to changes in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> measurements since there are many other anion channels/exchangers that can modulate intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis. Indeed, cells from CF patients have normal intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> levels. MQAE is a non-rationmetric dye that has all the problems associated with this type of dye – for example, changes in cell size can concentrate or dilute the dye which will change fluorescence. Or, is dye loading normal in these cells? What if GPR64 affects xenobiotic pumps like MRP1 that can extrude fluorescent dyes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestions.

This is apparently not observed in the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> (where I-V curve remains linear). There is a concentration dependence of this phenomenon, however, I was unable to find information about how much GlyH-101 was used in the Legend or Material and Methods section for the presented data.

The i/v shift with gluconate is too small and not typical for CFTR. Original whole cell overlay currents or continuous recordings should be shown. What is the proof in addition to CFTRinh172 that the authors truly measured CFTR currents?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions. A continuous recording of the whole-cell Cl<sup>-</sup> current in response to Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration changes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–6B</xref>. In addition to the pharmacological intervention by the application of CFTRinh172, we knocked down the CFTR expression in efferent ductules using si-RNA; this knockdown was verified by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The genetically reduced CFTR expression significantly reduced the Cl<sup>-</sup> current measured in GPR64 promoter-labeled cells compared to that in control si-RNA-treated efferent ductule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-7E</xref>). Both the pharmacological intervention and genetic approach supported that CFTR mediated the observed Cl<sup>-</sup> currents. Additionally, by checking more detail in the published literature, we found that the magnitude of CFTR current is sperm is similar to our observation in efferent ductules (Figueiras-Fierro et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> suggests a GPR64-dependent expression of CFTR-mRNA. How does this fit to the expression data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>/I and to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The qRT-PCR result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> indicates that both CFTR and GPR64 mRNA are highly enriched in GPR64 promoter-labeled efferent ductules. Two potential mechanisms may explain this observation. (1) The first mechanism is that CFTR expression is dependent on GPR64 expression. However, in GPR64 knockout mice, the CFTR expression level did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> in the revised manuscript). Furthermore, when we compared the GPR64 promoter-labeled efferent ductule cells derived from the GPR64<sup>-/Y</sup> mice with their wild-type littermates, the CFTR mRNA level did not change significantly despite the significant difference in the GPR64 mRNA expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> in the revised manuscript, new data). Therefore, CFTR expression is not dependent on GPR64 expression. (2) The second mechanism is that both GPR64 and CFTR were specifically expressed in non-ciliated cells in efferent ductules. GPR64 and CFTR may share a similar transcriptional or epigenetic regulatory mechanism. We added these considerations to the revised manuscript (subsection “ADGRG2 and CFTR coupling in the efferent ductules and its function in fluid reabsorption”).</p><p>In addition, we used GPR64-promoter-RFP to label the non-ciliated cells in efferent ductules, which, compared to ciliated cells (non-GRP64-RFP-labeled cells), bear distinct morphological properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); we also changed the label in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> to clarify the description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>: In what cells were these data obtained?
