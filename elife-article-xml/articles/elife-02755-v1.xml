abundant miRNAs in the brain. Although the function of miR-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to target miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02755.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02755.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02755.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Messages are sent back and forth in our brains by cells called neurons that connect to each other in complex networks. Neurons develop from stem cells in a complicated process that involves a number of different stages. In one of the final stages, tree-like structures called dendrites emerge from the neurons and connect with neighboring neurons via special junctions called synapses.</p><p>A group of small RNA molecules called microRNAs have roles in controlling the development of neurons. One microRNA, called miR-9, is abundant in the brain and is known to be involved in the early stages of neuron development. However, its role in the formation of dendrites and synapses remains unclear.</p><p>Giusti et al. studied this microRNA in mice. A length of DNA, coding for an RNA molecule that binds to miR-9 molecules and stops them performing their normal function, was inserted into the mice. These experiments showed that miR-9 is involved in controlling dendrite growth and synaptic function.</p><p>To enable a neuron to produce dendrites, miR-9 binds to and interferes with the RNA molecules that are needed to make a protein called REST. This protein is a transcription factor that switches off the expression of other genes so, in effect, miR-9 allows a set of genes that are needed for dendrite growth to be switched on.</p><p>The methodology developed by Giusti et al. could be used to study the functions of other microRNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02755.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02755.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>miR-9</kwd><kwd>miR-9 sponge</kwd><kwd>miR-9 reporter</kwd><kwd>dendrite development</kwd><kwd>REST</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SyBoSS FP7-Health-F4-2010-242129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurst</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and Arts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bavarian Research Network - ForIPs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurst</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FKZ 01GN1009C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurst</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FKZ 01GS08151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deussing</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FKZ 01GS08155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deussing</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institute of Psychiatry</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Refojo</surname><given-names>Damian</given-names></name><name><surname>Deussing</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditional transgenic miR-9 sponge mice exhibit developmental defects in dendrite growth due to up-regulation of the transcriptional repressor REST.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early neuronal development consists of a stereotypic progression of events involving neurite extension, axonal polarization and growth, dendritic arborization, and synaptic formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Urbanska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caceres et al., 2012</xref>). Dendrites are the main site of information input into neurons. The architecture of the dendritic tree and the targeting of dendrites into appropriate territories critically shape the input properties of neurons and are therefore of profound importance for the establishment of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">London and Hausser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mumm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parrish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spruston, 2008</xref>). The most relevant synaptic specialization of dendrites is dendritic spines. These actin-rich, structurally plastic protrusions represent the major sites of excitatory synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonhoeffer and Yuste, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hering and Sheng, 2001</xref>). The development of both, dendrites and spines, represents a multistep process influenced by external signals and intrinsic genetic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Jan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wong and Ghosh, 2002</xref>). Emerging data suggest that specific miRNAs exert critical regulatory functions during neuronal differentiation by controlling developmental gene expression programs driving dendritic and spine maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schratt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fiore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parrish et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Magill et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have arisen as a powerful class of conserved noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression. They are particularly enriched in the nervous system where they have been shown to influence neuronal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giraldez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schratt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, miR-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the developing and adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krichevsky et al., 2003</xref>). In mammals, miR-9 precursors are encoded by three genes, <italic>miR-9-1</italic>, <italic>miR-9-2,</italic> and <italic>miR-9-3</italic>, located in different chromosomes. After processing, these paralogous transcripts give rise to a unique mature miR-9. Although the function of miR-9 is well established in neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leucht et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delaloy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coolen et al., 2012</xref>), its role in differentiated neurons is largely unknown. This is surprising since miR-9 levels are higher in mature neurons than in neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that important biological processes beyond proliferation or specification are regulated by miR-9. Recently, a role for miR-9 in axonal extension and branching has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012</xref>), indicating the importance of miR-9 in the establishment of neuronal networks. However, the involvement of this microRNA in the later stages of neuronal development remains unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to characterize a potential role for miR-9 in dendritic and spine development in vivo. In order to efficiently knock-down miR-9 in a living animal, we employed miRNA sponges as a long-lasting miRNA inhibition strategy. miRNA sponges are transcripts that carry several in tandem copies of a sequence complementary to the miRNA of interest in their 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ebert et al., 2007</xref>). When expressed at high levels, miRNA sponges act as specific competitive inhibitors by binding and sequestering the miRNA of interest. In addition, miRNA sponges can be used to monitor miRNA activity when expressed together in the same transcript with a fluorescent protein gene, which is downregulated upon the binding of the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ebert et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the genomic organization or miRNA genes, revealed that approximately 50% of all mammalian miRNAs reside within either protein coding genes or long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, a large proportion of microRNA genes from different families are clustered and expressed as polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olena and Patton, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is a major challenge to develop KO models for miRNA genes, since the targeted deletion of a miRNA might affect overlapping protein-coding or lncRNA genes, or alter the expression of neighbor miRNAs, clustered in the same genomic region. Furthermore, many miRNAs have seed family members encoded at multiple distant loci, which requires that multiple genes have to be simultaneously knocked-out to obtain full ablation and avoid gene compensations based on functional redundancy. These obstacles severely limit the use of conditional targeting strategies, usually based on the Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> system, for the study of miRNA function.</p><p>Strategies based on the use of miRNA sponges as dominant negative genetic tools, can overcome the limitations presented by miRNA-gene-KO approaches. Sponges act in <italic>trans</italic> without interfering with the expression of other genes that could localize with the gene that expresses the miRNA of interest. Moreover, a single sponge transgene allows the simultaneous silencing of ‘seed’ sequence redundant microRNAs encoded at distant loci.</p><p>Here, we describe for the first time a conditional transgenic sponge mouse model. We derived two different strains for in vivo analysis: (i) a reporter mouse line to monitor miR-9 activity with single-cell resolution and (ii) a line for miR-9 loss-of-function studies. Using the latter, we revealed a novel developmental role of miR-9 in the postmitotic differentiation of neurons, as a key regulator of dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we show that regulation of the transcriptional repressor REST by miR-9 is essential for normal dendritic maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fully complementary and bulged miR-9 sponges are equally effective</title><p>Depending on the configuration of the binding sites, two sponge designs have been described: fully complementary (FC) sponges, which function by both sequestering miRNA and promoting miRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameres et al., 2010</xref>); and bulged (Bg) sponge variants, which carry mismatches that prevent base-pairing with the miRNA at positions 9–12, thereby avoiding AGO2-mediated decay of the sponge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ebert et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Before studying the role of miR-9 on dendritic and spine development in vivo, we tested the efficiency of GFP-FC and GFP-Bg miR-9 sponge variants as decoy targets and miR-9 reporters in cell culture systems. Both the sponge variants displayed similar efficacies to inhibit miR-9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We selected FC sponges for further studies since they displayed a higher predicted binding affinity for miR-9 (FC sponge: −42.9 kcal/mol vs Bg sponge: −32 kcal/mol) and a higher sensitivity as reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This last feature might be crucial for precise analysis of miR-9 expression and activity in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MiR-9 regulates dendritic development in primary neuronal cultures</title><p>To define a potential role of miR-9 in the maturation of dendritic arbors and spines, we used transiently transfected sponge constructs in developing mouse primary hippocampal neurons. Neurons transfected with GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge showed significantly reduced total dendritic length and complexity after 10 days in vitro (DIV) compared to neurons transfected with GFP (spongeless) or a GFP-scrambled control sponge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The specificity of the miR-9 sponge was further confirmed, as miR-9 overexpression rescued the phenotype induced by the GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). miR-9*, encoded by the same miRNA precursor as miR-9, has been postulated to contribute to activity-dependent dendritic growth, although no direct evidence was shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, expression of FC sponges directed to miR-9* showed no effects on dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In addition, we found that miR-9 overexpression in hippocampal neurons did not affect total dendritic length and had only a mild impact on dendritic complexity (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that miR-9, but not miR-9*, participates in the developmental programs controlling dendritic growth and that endogenous mir-9 levels have a saturating effect of on dendritic maturation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02755.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>miR-9 regulates dendritic development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of primary hippocampal neurons transiently transfected at DIV4 with the indicated constructs and fixed at DIV10. mRFP was cotransfected for visualization.

To address this question, we expressed the GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge in a subset of sparse CA1 neurons by in utero electroporation. Hippocampal neural precursors of E14.5 wild-type embryos were transfected with a plasmid expressing mRFP (volume marker) together with either a GFP-FC-miR-9 expressing construct or a GFP spongless control plasmid. Total dendritic length and dendrite complexity were analyzed 1 month after birth. In utero gene transfer of GFP-FC-miR-9-sponge plasmids resulted in changes comparable to those observed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. These results demonstrate that the dendritic changes observed with stable ablation of miR-9 are essentially cell autonomous and not caused by changes of cell extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>).</p><p>Alterations in dendrite complexity occurring during development might induce structural or functional compensatory mechanisms at the synaptic level in order to preserve the functionality and computational power of the postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kolb et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dieni and Rees, 2003</xref>). We first investigated dendritic spine density of CA1 hippocampal neurons in miR-9 Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> Thy1<sup><italic>EGFP</italic></sup> mice. No effects were observed in spine density or morphology compared to littermate controls (miR-9-Sp<sup>fl-Stop</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To assess the strength of synaptic transmission in pyramidal hippocampal neurons, we performed field recordings in acute hippocampal slices and analyzed the neural transmission at Schaffer collaterals-CA1 synapses. The size of the presynaptic fiber volley (FV) was compared with the slope of the EPSP in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic>. We found that synaptic transmission was significantly reduced in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice compared to miR-9-Sp<sup>fl-Stop</sup> littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Interestingly, during the course of our experiments, we noted that higher stimulus intensities were required in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice to elicit the same FV amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). This prompted us to directly test the excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells. In current-clamp recordings we observed a shift of the action potential (AP) threshold to more positive membrane potentials in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>). In turn, the same current injected elicited fewer APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). The input resistance was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). If pyramidal neurons are less excitable and therefore generate fewer APs, we should observe a reduced frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSC). Indeed, the mean sEPSC frequency was largely reduced in CA1 neurons of sponge-expressing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>). The reduced sEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>) could be caused by the reduced number of AP driven events; however, to test whether the quantal size is reduced in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSC). Here, mEPSC amplitude and frequency were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–F</xref>). The reduced frequency reflects the reduced number of synapses, while the reduced mEPSC amplitude indicates a change in quantal size. To exclude presynaptic effects, we tested paired-pulse facilitation, a sensitive measure of changes in the probability of transmitter release, which was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the impaired synaptic transmission is caused by a reduction in the absolute number of synapses per neuron (with preserved synapse density), resulting from the shortened dendrites in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. Additionally, inhibiting miR-9 affects neuronal excitability by changing the AP threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dendritic growth defects after miR-9 loss are mediated by REST</title><p>The cell-intrinsic nature of the effects of the GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge indicates that miR-9 regulates neuronal targets primarily involved in the process of dendritogenesis.

However, this is not evident from REST loss-of-function models. Conditional deletion of <italic>Rest</italic> in early neural progenitors in <italic>Rest</italic><sup>Sox1−Cre</sup> mice, did not affect brain histology and had no impact on the expression of REST-target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aoki et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement, we found no difference in dendritic development between shREST- and shControl-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The efficiency of shREST constructs to downregulate REST was assessed in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Together with the lack of phenotype observed in <italic>Rest</italic><sup>Sox1−Cre</sup> mice, these results suggest that the transcriptional repressive activity of endogenous REST is minimal in neurons. Since REST is strongly downregulated during neuronal development, we next hypothesized that maintenance of high levels of this transcriptional repressor might be detrimental for neuronal development and that, consequently, a key function of miR-9 would be to keep low REST levels across neuronal maturation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that overexpression of REST in primary hippocampal neurons significantly reduces dendritic length and arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of other miR-9 targets that were found to be upregulated in sponge expressing neurons, such as Foxp4, Creb1, and Map1b, had no effect on dendritic length and complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that they are not contributing to the dendritic phenotype of miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons.</p><p>To test whether REST upregulation mediates the impaired dendritic growth in sponge mice, we transfected neural precursors with shRNAs against REST by ex vivo electroporation. In this approach, miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> and littermate control embryos were decapitated at E17.5, DNA was injected into lateral ventricles followed by electroporation targeting hippocampal neural precursors directly before dissociated primary hippocampal neurons were prepared. We observed that shREST transfection strongly rescued the dendritic growth defects in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that increased REST level is indeed the major mediator of miR-9 effects on dendritic growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study define a key role for miR-9 during postmitotic differentiation of neurons.</p><p>We present a new double reporter mouse line that helped to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain. The analysis of the miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mouse line showed that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. Experiments using primary neurons and in utero gene transfer approaches indicate that the observed dendritic changes are cell-autonomous. Importantly, we described an essential function of miR-9 in dendritic growth as a regulator of the expression of the transcriptional repressor REST.</p><p>The widespread involvement of miRNAs in both the regulation of developmental and physiological processes and disease is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bushati and Cohen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2013</xref>). However, uncovering the function of specific microRNA families has been limited by the lack of technologies for in vivo analysis. Much of our current knowledge regarding the role of microRNAs in neuronal biology stems from overexpression-based studies. However, overexpression approaches may lead to silencing of genes that normally escape regulation resulting in artificial, neomorphic phenotypes. Therefore, loss-of-function strategies are required to validate physiological miRNA functions. The generation of KO mice has several limitations in this context: (i) requires the ablation of the multiple gene copies of miRNAs belonging to the same family, often placed at distant genomic loci and (ii) miRNAs genes are frequently encoded in clusters together with other miRNAs from different families or directly overlapping other protein-coding or lncRNA genes. Therefore, the ablation of the miRNA sequence by gene targeting KO strategies also affects the expression of the ‘host’ genes coding for proteins or lncRNAs, or miRNA genes from other families encoded in tandem; and (iii) the complementary miRNA* strand is entirely removed by the gene deletion.</p><p>In the case of miR-9, recently generated <italic>miR-9-2</italic>/<italic>miR-9-3</italic> double KO mice showed profound phenotypic brain defects, growth retardation, and reduced life-span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shibata et al., 2011</xref>). In this model, both miR-9 and miR-9* levels are reduced. Unlike other mRNA* species, miR-9* accumulates to substantial levels in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yao et al., 2012</xref>), and since miR-9* has a different seed sequence compared to miR-9, it is predicted to regulate a different set of targets. Importantly, miR-9* regulation of BAF53a has been shown to contribute to activity-dependent dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, two transcripts (C130071C03Rik-001 and C130071C03Rik-201) that overlap with the murine <italic>miR-9-2</italic> gene and encode for lncRNAs, are deleted in this mouse model. Although the function of these transcripts is still unknown, recent evidence demonstrates that ablation of lncRNA genes can produce severe phenotypes at brain level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sauvageau et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that they would play more critical roles in vivo than previously considered. In view of these facts, other functional products in addition to miR-9 might contribute to the phenotype of <italic>miR-9-2</italic>/<italic>miR-9-3</italic> KO mice and further investigations will be required to clarify this issue. In contrast, the use of miR-9 sponges as dominant negative genetic tools, allowed us to dissect the specific role of miR-9 on dendritic and spine development. Previously, miRNA sponges have been proven as useful genetic loss-of-function tools in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loya et al., 2009</xref>), and non-conditional expression of sponges has been reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we provide a new layer of complexity to the existing battery of in vivo tools for genetic manipulation of microRNAs by describing the first conditional transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line.</p><p>We initially tested the efficiency of FC vs bulged miR-9 sponges and found that both designs were equally effective to inhibit miR-9 activity. Although several studies describe efficient inhibitory activity of FC sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Care et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ebert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gentner et al., 2009</xref>), a recent study by Kluiver et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kluiver et al., 2012</xref>), reported that bulged sponges are more effective. The discrepancy with our results could arise from differences in promoter strengths. We employed a CAG promoter for the sponge constructs instead of the PGK promoter used in the referred study. The CAG promoter is stronger than the PGK in most mammalian cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) and in the Neuro-2a cells used in this study (data not shown). Thus, high levels of expression of the sponge achieved in our experiments could compensate the degradation of FC sponge transcript due to endonucleolytic cleavage activity of AGO2, resulting in high steady-state levels of the decoy target.</p><p>Histological approaches to study miRNA expression have often relied on in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerblom et al., 2012</xref>). However, with these techniques, it is not possible to discriminate between precursor and mature miRNAs. Moreover, the design of the probes is very limited due to the very short sequence of miRNAs, preventing the optimization steps usually necessary to obtain adequately specific and sensitive riboprobes for ISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Refojo et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we used the reporter function of miRNA sponges that have the advantage of reporting miRNA activity instead of expression. The miR-9-Sp/tdTomato mouse line was used to analyze the activity pattern of miR-9 in the adult mouse brain. We observed high miR-9 activity in neurons and astrocytes and a lower activity in microglial cells. While miR-9 has been detected in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>) and other cells of myeloid origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Senyuk et al., 2013</xref>), findings obtained with a recently developed miR-9 reporter mouse line, miR-9.T, suggest that miR-9 activity is absent in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerblom et al., 2013</xref>). Lower levels of the PGK-driven GFP-miR-9 sensor transgene may account for the lower sensitivity shown by that mouse model. Although the expression of the sensor is not shown outside the brain, an indication of the low expression of the sensor of miR-9.T mice is that GFP expression could only be analyzed after the enhancement of the signal via immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerblom et al., 2013</xref>), in contrast to our characterization that fully relies on the detection of the native fluorescence of GFP.</p><p>The function of miR-9 has been mainly studied in the context of neurogenesis, where it plays a role as a regulator of the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leucht et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delaloy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coolen et al., 2012</xref>). These studies showed that miR-9 does not act as a differentiation switch, but rather facilitates the transition from the proliferative to the neurogenic mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coolen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013</xref>). In contrast, only few studies have unraveled additional functions of miR-9 at later steps of neural development. A role of miR-9 on the specification of spinal cord motoneurons has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otaegi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luxenhofer et al., 2014</xref>). MiR-9 dysregulation has also been linked to spinal motor neuron disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haramati et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dajas-Bailador et al. (2012)</xref> showed that inhibition of miR-9 in mouse cultured cortical neurons increase axonal length and reduce axonal branching. In this study, we focused in the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation and demonstrated a critical role for miR-9 in the control of dendritic development in vivo. Other miRNAs have also been shown to influence dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wayman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fiore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parrish et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Magill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pathania et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2013b</xref>) suggesting that the expression of genes orchestrating this process is under a complex post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Our studies in cultured primary neurons associated to the morphological analysis performed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice suggests that neuronal miR-9 mainly acts in a cell-intrinsic manner controlling dendritic differentiation genetic programs. However, dendritic growth and branching in vivo are influenced by synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rajan and Cline, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wong and Ghosh, 2002</xref>) or by a multiplicity of extrinsic factors either present in or secreted by neighbor neurons or glial cells, such as neurotrophins, semaphorins, or Slits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polleux et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horch and Katz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whitford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The results obtained in our in utero gene transfer studies targeting CA1 hippocampal neurons, which develop later among a vast majority of non-transfected wild-type neurons and glial cells, are comparable to the dendritic phenotype observed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. This indicates that effects found in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice are essentially cell-intrinsic and that miR-9 exerts its proactive function in modeling dendritic arbors as a key player of neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development. Furthermore, we found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in miR-9 sponge expressing mice. Since the morphology and density of dendritic spines were not affected, the reduced postsynaptic responses are most likely due to a reduction in the total number of synapses as expected from less-arborized dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawabe et al., 2010</xref>), as those found in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. Additionally, we showed that inhibiting miR-9 affects neuronal excitability by shifting the AP threshold to more positive potentials. Since Map1b has already been described to be a miR-9 target critical for terminal axonal arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012</xref>), a potential contribution of the tandem miR-9/Map1b to the electrophysiological phenotype cannot be discarded.</p><p>Intrinsic proteins controlling the establishment of neuronal dendritic fields include several transcription factors, Rho and Ras family GTPases, kinases, and adaptors involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signal transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takemoto-Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simo and Cooper, 2012</xref>). MiR-9 downregulation would lead to the increase in transcriptional rates of direct miR-9 targets. This suggests that the factor/s mediating the effects of miR-9 inhibition in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice would fit best with targets negatively influencing cellular processes potentially involved in dendritic maturation. We found that the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor REST (also known as NRSF), an experimentally validated target of miR-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Packer et al., 2008</xref>), is upregulated in miR-9 sponge expressing neurons. Along this line, the fact that REST is a transcriptional repressor made this factor a specially attractive candidate to explain the effects observed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice.</p><p>REST is essential for repressing neuronal genes in neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ooi and Wood, 2007</xref>). A prevailing view is that downregulation of REST during neuronal differentiation favors the acquisition and maintenance of the neuronal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballas et al., 2005</xref>). REST binds the RE1 consensus element of target genes and recruits corepressors including mSin3, CoREST, and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), inducing silencing by epigenetic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andres et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The influence of REST on the dendritic development of pyramidal neurons remains unexplored. Although a mild effect on neurite outgrowth was reported in cultured retinal ganglion cells upon titration of REST with sequestering plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koch et al., 2011</xref>), we were unable to observe any effect of REST downregulation on the dendritic length or complexity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons during development. In agreement with our results, the conditional deletion of <italic>Rest</italic> in early neural progenitors had no impact on the expression of REST-target genes in postnatal day 0 brains, when dendrite differentiation is taking place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aoki et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the repressive activity of endogenous REST is minimal during postmitotic differentiation of neurons.</p><p>Considering that REST is strongly downregulated during neuronal development, we hypothesized that maintenance of high levels of this transcriptional repressor might be detrimental for neuronal development. Therefore, a key function of miR-9 would be to keep low REST levels across neuronal maturation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that REST overexpression in primary neurons has a negative impact on dendritic length and complexity. Importantly, by performing ex vivo gene transfer of REST shRNAs into neural precursors, we determined that the increased REST activity in miR-9 sponge neurons is underlying the impairment in dendritic growth. However, the fact that the rescue of the dendritic defects was extensive but not complete, suggests that other miR-9-regulated proteins may also contribute to the dendritic phenotype of miR-9 sponge expressing neurons. Together, these experiments delineate a central mechanism in which miR-9 restricts REST expression and thereby promotes neuronal postmitotic differentiation. Interestingly, it has been observed that REST levels are restored in some neuronal populations following a biphasic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, REST expression have been shown to be increased in some adult hippocampal and cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuwabara et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that miR-9/REST regulation might play other non-developmental roles in some mature neuronal populations.</p><p>In summary, we describe the first transgenic sponge mouse line that allows for conditional inactivation of an miRNA family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Analysis of this miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mouse line reveals a prominent role for miR-9 on postmitotic neuronal differentiation as a regulator of dendritic development through repression of REST expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>In all experiments, mice were housed under standard laboratory conditions (22 ± 1°C, 55 ± 5% humidity) with food and water ad libitum.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “MicroRNA-9 controls dendritic development by targeting REST” for consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Jenny Hsieh, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers felt that this was a detailed and carefully carried out study that revealed a novel function for a broadly expressed microRNA in the regulation of dendritic arborization via regulation of the repressor REST. Although the reviewers felt that the available evidence mostly supported the conclusions reached there were several issues raised that require revision, and at least two of these will require additional experimental work.</p><p>All three reviewers wondered about how general the effects were throughout the nervous system. One reviewer noted that prior published reports indicate that REST expression persists in some neuronal populations in hippocampus and neocortex and perhaps elsewhere and so suggest that the authors should consider the possibility that the role of miR-9/REST in dendritic growth regulation may differ as a function of development and/or which neuronal populations are assayed. Given the broad expression of miR-9, the other reviewers wondered about phenotypes at the level of the whole animal resulting from widespread changes in dendritic and axonal arborization. Although a more detailed functional analysis would improve the paper, one relatively simple suggestion is to determine more carefully whether or not there is any gross anatomical change in brain size or cortical thickness, or a consistent change in the soma size of affected hippocampal neurons. These differences can be readily seen in some developmental disorders that produce more modest changes in dendritic arborization than those seen here.</p><p>A second issue concerns a missing negative control. The conclusion that REST is the only relevant target for the phenotype would be more convincing if the authors demonstrated that other targets (e.g. CREB or Map1b) are not implicated in miR-9 dependent dendritic branching through a similar series of experiment as was performed for REST. The Map1b target is particularly interesting given its involvement in neurite outgrowth in general, and a recent report demonstrating miR-9 regulation of axonal length via Map1b regulation (Dajas-Bailador). Manipulation of Map1b expression could serve as an important control ideally by recapitulating the previously reported Map1b-dependent axonal phenotype in the sponge mice in the absence of a Map1b-dependent dendritic phenotype. Less ideal, but requiring less additional work, would be to show the lack of a Map1b-dependent dendritic phenotype and acknowledge in the discussion the prior publication and the possibility that other miR-9 targets contribute to axonal phenotypes which were not directly measured.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The morphological analyses of dendrites are relatively complete, but the physiological analysis is somewhat superficial.

Although the reviewers felt that the available evidence mostly supported the conclusions reached there were several issues raised that require revision, and at least two of these will require additional experimental work</italic>.</p><p><italic>All three reviewers wondered about how general the effects were throughout the nervous system. One reviewer noted that prior published reports indicate that REST expression persists in some neuronal populations in hippocampus and neocortex and perhaps elsewhere and so suggest that the authors should consider the possibility that the role of miR-9/REST in dendritic growth regulation may differ as a function of development and/or which neuronal populations are assayed. Given the broad expression of miR-9, the other reviewers wondered about phenotypes at the level of the whole animal resulting from widespread changes in dendritic and axonal arborization. Although a more detailed functional analysis would improve the paper, one relatively simple suggestion is to determine more carefully whether or not there is any gross anatomical change in brain size or cortical thickness, or a consistent change in the soma size of affected hippocampal neurons. These differences can be readily seen in some developmental disorders that produce more modest changes in dendritic arborization than those seen here</italic>.</p><p>We thank the first reviewer for pointing out this very thoughtful comment. We have acknowledged the fact that REST levels are restored in some neuronal populations following a biphasic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuwabara et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that miR-9/REST regulation might play other non-developmental roles in some mature neuronal populations This is included in the Discussion section.</p><p>Regarding the phenotypes at the level of the whole animal resulting from widespread changes in dendritic and axonal arborization, we have observed, among other behavioral tasks designed to assess sensorimotor performance, that the acoustic startle response is strongly impaired in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. This highlights the functional impact from the morphological and electrophysiological impairments. However these studies are still preliminary and other batteries of behavioral tests to assess cognition, emotional-like states and locomotion are still ongoing. The completion of this comprehensive behavioral characterization will take few additional months and consequently we believe that those results will be more suitable for a further study.</p><p>We have now extended our morphological analysis finding that the dendritic defects in miR-9 sponge expressing neurons are not restricted to hippocampal neurons but are also observed in cortical neurons (layer V), suggesting that this is a generalized effect of miR-9 loss of function. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>. Accordingly we describe this new set of experiments in the Results section. Despite this fact, miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice did not present any gross anatomical change in brain size and also no significant differences were found in cortical thickness measured both directly on tissue sections or using NMR (e.g. data of brain sections: miR-9-Sp<sup>fl-Stop</sup>: 1061 ± 18.60 μm vs. miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup>: 1034 ± 22.20 μm, n.s, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test).</p><p>It is important to note at this point that alterations in dendritic complexity do not always correlate with brain or cortical size changes. Several mouse models showing diminished dendritic arborization do not have reduced brain size (Krey et al., 2013; Hoogenraad et al., 2005; Henkemeyer et al., 2003). Similarly, dendritic overgrowth can occur without changes in brain size (Jiang et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2004). This suggests that other factors, not directly assessed in this study, might compensate variations in dendritic arborization preserving brain size.</p><p><italic>A second issue concerns a missing negative control. The conclusion that REST is the only relevant target for the phenotype would be more convincing if the authors demonstrated that other targets (e.g. CREB or Map1b) are not implicated in miR-9 dependent dendritic branching through a similar series of experiment as was performed for REST. The Map1b target is particularly interesting given its involvement in neurite outgrowth in general, and a recent report demonstrating miR-9 regulation of axonal length via Map1b regulation (Dajas-Bailador). Manipulation of Map1b expression could serve as an important control ideally by recapitulating the previously reported Map1b-dependent axonal phenotype in the sponge mice in the absence of a Map1b-dependent dendritic phenotype. Less ideal, but requiring less additional work, would be to show the lack of a Map1b-dependent dendritic phenotype and acknowledge in the discussion the prior publication and the possibility that other miR-9 targets contribute to axonal phenotypes which were not directly measured</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers address here an important point and we have followed this suggestion.</p><p>First we would like to underline that we have not claimed that REST is the only relevant target of miR-9, but on the contrary we consider that it is unrealistic to envision that all the effects observed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice might be explained by the regulation of only one single target. Concretely, in the reversion experiments depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we show that the expression of shRNAs against REST rescue the effects triggered by the sponge. However the reversion did not reach the 100%, suggesting that other targets beyond REST might also contribute, though in a minor proportion, to the phenotypes observed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. This idea is now expressed in the Discussion.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that other miR-9 targets (e.g. Map1b) contribute to axonal phenotypes, we would like to point out that the excellent description of Dajas-Bailador and colleagues of the role of miR-9/Map1b on axonal growth, prompted us to focus in the less explored dendritic role of this microRNA, leaving the well-described axonal phenotypes out of the scope of this study. Following the suggestion of the reviewers, we added an additional layer of complexity to the interpretation of the electrophysiology results. In the Discussion section, we mention that even though impairments in neurotransmission are in agreement with neurons bearing less-arborized dendritic trees, a potential contribution of the tandem miR-9/Map1b, which has already been described to be critical for terminal axonal arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012</xref>) might also contribute to the functional phenotypes observed.</p><p>Beside these considerations, we followed the suggestions of the reviewers and analyzed the effect of shRNAs against Map1b on the dendritic arborization in a similar series of experiments as performed for REST. During the course of the experiments we observed that the shMap1b had a strong effect <italic>per se</italic> on the dendritic development of control neurons. As can be observed in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response Figure 1</xref>, downregulation of Map1b results in the absence of normal dendrites that are replaced by long filopodia-like structures. Unfortunately, due to this strong <italic>per se</italic> effect, we could not use this tool to evaluate a potential rescue of the dendritic impairment in sponge expressing neurons. Similar effects were observed with a different shRNAi indicating that the results observed are not due to off-target effects of the silencing sequence.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Representative images of primary hippocampal neurons transiently transfected with the indicated constructs and fixed at DIV10. mRFP was cotransfected for visualization.

Together with REST, those were the highest upregulated targets found in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We reasoned that if any of those miR-9 targets would contribute to the dendritic phenotype observed in sponge expressing neurons, their overexpression should negatively regulate dendritic growth. In contrast to REST overexpression, we found that increased levels of Foxp4, Creb1 or Map1b had no impact on dendritic length and complexity. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. It is worth noting that even though the down-regulation of Creb1 sensibly impairs activity-dependent dendritic arborization (Wayman et al., 2006), the forced expression of Creb1 does not trigger the opposite effects. Similar to our results obtained in hippocampal neurons Redmond and colleagues (2002) have sown that Creb1 overexpression in culture cortical neurons during development does not exert any effects on dendritic differentiation.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The morphological analyses of dendrites are relatively complete, but the physiological analysis is somewhat superficial. The authors should probably hedge their bets by noting that the reduced field potential amplitude could be influenced by other factors not measured including neuronal excitability and levels of inhibition</italic>.</p><p>We extended the electrophysiological characterization of miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice by testing the excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells. Our data show that the action potential (AP) threshold is shifted to more positive membrane potentials in sponge-expressing neurons. The lower excitability leads to fewer AP in neurons projecting onto CA1 pyramidal neurons, thereby strongly reducing the spontaneous EPSC (sEPSC) frequency. In addition, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSC). Here, mEPSC amplitude and frequency were significantly reduced. The reduced frequency reflects the reduced number of synapses, while the reduced mEPSC amplitude indicates a change in quantal size. To exclude presynaptic effects we tested paired-pulse facilitation, a sensitive measure of changes in the probability of transmitter release, which was unchanged. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref> and in the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4F, E</italic></xref> <italic>compared to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4 B</italic></xref> <italic>and C-both the dendritic length and Sholl analysis are on vastly different scales</italic>. <italic>Why?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are absolutely right. Two factors might contribute to the differences in dendritic length and complexity between the measurements performed in Thy1-eGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 B, C</xref>) and the in utero electroporation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 E,F</xref>). First, differences in the genetic backgrounds; Thy1-eGFP mice are in a C57BL/6J background while CD1 mice were used for in utero electroporation. Second, and in our view more relevant, the relative high density of transfected neurons in in utero electroporated brains makes sometimes difficult to discriminate between terminal branches belonging to the neuron being traced or to other neighboring neuron. Since these terminal branches from non-clear sources are excluded from the analyses, tracings from these experiments tend to underestimate the real complexity of the neurons, yielding lower values for total dendritic length and neuronal complexity. Since the same criteria apply to both control- and sponge-transfected groups, this does not represent an intrinsic confounding factor in the comparison between these experimental groups.</p><p><italic>References</italic></p><p>Collins AL, Levenson JM, Vilaythong AP, Richman R, Armstrong DL, Noebels JL, David SJ, Zoghbi HY (2004) Mild overexpression of MeCP2 causes a progressive neurological disorder in mice.
