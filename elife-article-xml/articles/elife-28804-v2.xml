One of the primary models of sequential behavior is reminiscent of how animals select among competing behavioral choices. Behavioral competition arises in situations where different mutually exclusive behaviors are appropriate, but they must be performed one at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Redgrave et al., 1999</xref>). These conflicts can be resolved through the suppression of all but the highest priority behavior, as mollusks do to suppress their mating behavior while feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kupfermann and Weiss, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kristan, 2008</xref>). In the case of a behavioral sequence, it is proposed that the different movements to be performed are similarly readied in parallel and in competition for output, and a suppression hierarchy determines their priority order of execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lashley, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bullock, 2004</xref>). Completion of the highest priority movement lifts suppression on movements of lower priority that are subsequently performed according to a new round of competition and suppression. This <italic>parallel model</italic> could drive behaviors across a range of complexity, from the sequential typing of letters on a keyboard in humans to the selection of which behavior to perform first in mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</xref>). Thus, the identification of examples of simple parallel neural architectures that drive a prioritized selection of movements may inform a broad spectrum of sequential behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kristan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jovanic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> grooming sequence provides one example of how conflicting stimuli can induce movement competition that is resolved through a suppression hierarchy. Coating the body of a fly with dust is thought to stimulate competition among different grooming movements that are each responsible for cleaning a particular body part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). We previously presented evidence that the body grooming order is determined through a mechanism where earlier movements suppress later ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). For example, removal of dust from the eyes occurs first because eye grooming suppresses cleaning of the other body parts. From a suppression hierarchy among the different grooming movements emerges a sequence that proceeds in the order: eyes &gt; antennae &gt; abdomen &gt; wings &gt; notum. We further proposed a computational model to describe this sequence that features parallel activation of the different grooming movements by dust to induce competition, and hierarchical suppression among the movements to determine their selection order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). The parallel activation of the movements was proposed based on evidence that stimulation to each body part induces site-directed grooming responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the simultaneous, or parallel stimulation of sensory neurons by dust would cause different grooming movements to compete for output because only one can be performed at a time. However, it was not confirmed that simultaneous activation of sensory neurons across the body indeed elicits the same prioritized grooming response that we observed using a dust stimulus.</p><p>Here, we reveal a neural basis for parallel activation of sensory inputs for a sequential behavior by identifying sensory neurons that stimulate different grooming movements, and by testing the hypothesis that activation of these neurons in parallel elicits a prioritized grooming response. We identify transgenic expression tools for visualizing and optogenetically activating sensory neurons on the body parts that elicit specific grooming movements. This enables the simultaneous activation of sensory neurons across the body to induce competition among their respective grooming movements. As we observed by coating the bodies of flies in dust, whole-body sensory activation elicits grooming that prioritizes the head and then proceeds to the other body parts. This provides direct evidence that the grooming sequence can be induced through simultaneous activation of sensory neurons across the body. These experiments also reveal that flies have a persistent trace of the body parts that were stimulated, which results in delayed and sequential grooming of the stimulated parts. Work presented here lends neural-based evidence in favor of the parallel model of hierarchical suppression among grooming movements and provides new insights into its underlying organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GAL4 lines targeting sensory neurons across the body that elicit grooming</title><p>Our initial goal was to identify GAL4 transgenic lines expressing in sensory neurons across the body, to directly test whether simultaneous activation of these neurons leads to a prioritized grooming response.

Freely moving flies of each line expressing the red light-gated neural activator CsChrimson were exposed to whole body illumination to optogenetically activate their targeted sensory neurons, and grooming responses were subsequently measured. Each of the three GAL4 lines expresses in sensory neurons whose activation can elicit wing or notum grooming, as revealed by localized optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Additionally, each line expresses in eye bristle mechanosensory neurons whose activation we hypothesized could elicit eye grooming, while two of the lines (R52A06- and R30B01-GAL4) also express in antennal Johnston’s Organ neurons that were previously shown to elicit antennal grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Although these GAL4 lines can elicit several movements from different body sensory neurons, we predicted that activating them simultaneously should elicit only the highest-priority movement, according to the hierarchical suppression model. Indeed, the simultaneous optogenetic activation of body sensory neurons targeted by each GAL4 line resulted in head rather than posterior (abdomen, wing, notum) grooming, consistent with the model of hierarchical suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, during red light-on period, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28804.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous optogenetic activation of body sensory neurons elicits sequential grooming.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Head (magenta) or posterior body grooming movements (green) elicited with red light-illumination of R52A06-, R30B01-, and R81E10-GAL4 flies expressing CsChrimson.

Flies groomed their heads at the onset of a five-second red light stimulus, and then transitioned to grooming their posterior bodies during the period after the light was turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). One trivial explanation for this sequence could be that optogenetic activation of sensory neurons on the posterior body elicited grooming with a delay, whereas there was no delay to groom with activation of the head sensory neurons. We tested for this delay to groom the posterior body using decapitated flies that no longer received a sensory drive to groom their heads. In contrast to intact flies, activation of the posterior body sensory neurons of decapitated flies elicited posterior grooming during the red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, a delay does not explain the sequence because head and posterior grooming can be elicited on similar time scales. Instead, evidence that intact flies do not display posterior grooming with the light stimulation supports the hypothesis that it is suppressed by head grooming (discussed below). Notably, optogenetic activation of sensory neurons across the body causes flies to groom their bodies in the same order as when they were coated in dust (head &gt; abdomen &gt; wings &gt; notum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Further, the posterior body grooming sequence continued through the minute after the cessation of the red light, while the sensory neurons were no longer activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green histogram). This suggests a persistent trace of posterior sensory neurons that had been activated, which allowed each movement to be elicited once the previous grooming movement terminated.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-28804-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28804.012</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Grooming in response to the simultaneous optogenetic activation of sensory neurons across the body (R52A06-GAL4).</title><p>CsChrimson was expressed in sensory neurons using R52A06-GAL4.

Evidence of suppression was found when sensory neurons were reactivated during the period when flies had transitioned to posterior grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The hierarchical suppression model predicts that switching the red light back on during this period to reactivate sensory neurons across the body would result in head grooming, coupled with the termination of ongoing posterior grooming. Indeed, in cases where flies were engaged in posterior grooming, delivery of the next red light stimulus caused flies to terminate posterior grooming and switch to grooming their heads. This is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (histogram plots on right, green traces) where the fraction of flies grooming their posterior bodies drops to zero at the onset of the red light (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This termination of posterior grooming was still observed when we shortened the time between light stimuli and only examined trials where flies were grooming at the moment the next stimulus was delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, we find optogentic evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the grooming sequence is driven by a hierarchical suppression mechanism, as was revealed from experiments using dust as a natural stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of mechanosensory neurons that elicit specific grooming movements</title><p>We next sought to test whether the hierarchy of grooming movements could be observed with competing activation of defined sets of sensory neurons that elicit distinct movements.

Campaniform sensilla on the proximal part of the wing are largely clustered in fields, whereas individual sensilla are found along the distal wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palka et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole and Palka, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palka et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickinson and Palka, 1987</xref>).

For this experiment, we identified a spGAL4 combination (R31H10-AD ∩ R34E03-DBD) that expressed both in the eye bristle mechanosensory neurons and the same three categories of sensory neurons on the wings and halteres that were expressed in the R30B01-AD ∩ R31H10-DBD combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Simultaneous optogenetic activation of these defined sensory neurons elicited prioritized grooming that started with the eyes and then proceeded to the wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>), like what we observed with activation of sensory neurons across the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, the transition of eye to wing grooming occurred within the stimulus period, suggesting that eye grooming became inhibited by wing grooming during the stimulus. This may reveal a prediction of the model of hierarchical suppression that later movements in the sequence can suppress earlier ones (see Discussion). However, the prioritized suppression came from eye grooming, as any ongoing grooming of the wings terminated and all flies groomed their eyes with each red light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Two lines of evidence led us to this prediction. The first was based on our previous finding that coating the body of the fly in dust elicits grooming that prioritizes head over posterior body grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). The second was based on data showing that local stimulation to the body surface elicits site-specific grooming responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we proposed that sensory neurons across the body are stimulated in parallel by dust to elicit competition among their respective grooming movements. Here, we test this by identifying transgenic driver lines for targeting and directly activating sensory neurons that elicit grooming, allowing us to bypass the dust stimulus and reveal the underlying sensory neurons. Using simultaneous optogenetic activation of sensory neurons across the body we observe the same anterior-to-posterior prioritization among the grooming movements that occurs when flies are coated in dust. This lends strong support to the hypothesis that the grooming movements are activated in parallel, and are thus selected in a hierarchically determined competition through suppression.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sensory neurons involved in grooming behavior</title><p>One aim of this work was to identify sensory neurons that can induce grooming behavior. The bristles are canonically thought to be involved in insect grooming based on evidence that their tactile stimulation on different body parts induces site directed grooming responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Page et al., 2004</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that direct activation of the bristle mechanosensory neurons can elicit grooming. We identify the fruit fly interommatidial bristle mechanosensory neurons based on their anatomical similarity to those of the praying mantis and cricket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honegger et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zack and Bacon, 1981</xref>). Next, we use a transgenic driver line that expresses in these neurons to show that their optogenetic activation elicits eye grooming. We also identify different spGAL4 lines that express in neurons whose activation elicits wing grooming. However, these lines express both in bristle mechanosensory neurons and campaniform sensilla, raising the question of whether one or both sensory types are involved. Given the wealth of data implicating the bristles in grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>), the parsimonious explanation is that the wing bristle mechanosensory neurons are involved. However, there is also a precedent for the involvement of non-bristle mechanosensory neurons such as the campaniform sensilla. For example, we previously showed that Johnston’s Organ chordotonal neurons can detect displacements of the antennae to induce antennal grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>), and others have shown that gustatory neurons on the wing can detect different chemicals to trigger grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yanagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, further work is required to resolve which sensory neurons are involved in wing grooming.</p><p>One outstanding question is whether the sensory neurons have a direct role in establishing hierarchical suppression. We previously proposed two mechanisms of hierarchical suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). One is that unidirectional inhibitory connections between the movements drive suppression, a mechanism not likely to involve the sensory neurons. The other is that differences in sensitivity to dust across the body establish a gradient of sensory drives among the grooming movements, leading to suppression through winner-take-all competition. One way that sensitivity differences could be established is through differing numbers of receptors on each body part. For example, if we assume that the bristle mechanosensory neurons on the different body parts detect dust to elicit grooming (which remains to be shown), a comparison of bristle numbers on different body parts gives mixed support for this hypothesis. There are 600, 221, and 235 bristles reported to be on the eyes, wings, and notum respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartenstein and Posakony, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cadigan et al., 2002</xref>). The eyes are the highest priority part to be groomed, and have 2.7 times more bristles than the wings, which is consistent with the suppression hierarchy. In contrast, the lowest priority body part is the notum, which has more bristles than the wings, arguing against the hypothesis. Furthermore, given that other sensory neuron types elicit grooming (e.g. chordotonal and gustatory neurons), there may be multiple ways of detecting dust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yanagawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, hierarchical suppression could be established at the level of sensory neurons by regulating their output through presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blagburn and Sattelle, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burrows and Matheson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarac and Cattaert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>). For example, the feeding behavior of the medicinal leech causes presynaptic inhibition of mechanosensory neurons, which suppresses touch-induced behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaudry and Kristan, 2009</xref>). Future experiments will test such hypotheses about whether hierarchical suppression is established at the level of sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Using optogenetic control of sensory neurons to further probe the neural mechanisms of hierarchical suppression</title><p>The use of optogenetics to activate sensory neurons reveals new insights into the neural mechanisms that drive grooming behavior. One striking example is evidence of a persistent trace of those sensory neurons that were optogenetically activated (next Discussion section). Other data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> may show evidence of a prediction of the model of hierarchical suppression that later movements in the sequence can suppress earlier ones. A comparison of the eye grooming elicited by activating eye bristle mechanosensory neurons alone, versus co-activating eye and wing/haltere sensory neurons, reveals an earlier termination of eye grooming and the occurrence of wing grooming (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, top and bottom panels). One explanation for this could be that wing grooming suppresses eye grooming. Our model indicates that grooming movements compete for output through a winner-take-all mechanism that selects the movement with the highest ‘activation level’ and suppresses others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Activation levels are set by the relative amounts of dust on the body parts, and by a hierarchical weighting mechanism across the different movements. When more than one body part is covered in dust, the first movement is selected because it has the highest activity level. The removal of dust from that part causes the activity level to drop below that of the next movement that is consequently selected by suppressing the previous movement. Thus, the suppression of an earlier movement (e.g. eye grooming) by a later movement (e.g. wing grooming) is predicted by the model, providing a plausible explanation for the result.</p><p>Although suppression of eye by wing grooming is predicted by the model, it is unclear why the flies transition to wing grooming during the optogenetic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom panels). The continual optogenetic stimulation period might be likened to a hypothetical scenario where the fly could not remove dust from its eyes. Therefore, eye grooming might be expected to continue throughout the stimulation period, which would suppress wing grooming. The unexpected transition from eye to wing grooming during the stimulation period could occur if the activation level of eye grooming drops below wing grooming. One possible explanation is based on observations that continual tactile stimulation of bristle mechanosensory neurons causes habituation and loss of grooming responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>). Similarly, optogenetic stimulus-dependent habituation might decrease the sensory drive to the point that wing grooming suppresses eye grooming, but not enough to abolish eye grooming when it is activated alone (as seen in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Another possibility is that the activation level of posterior grooming increases to the point that it surpasses eye grooming. There is evidence that grooming responses can temporally sum consecutive sensory stimuli, indicating a mechanism that can store and increase excitability to elicit a grooming response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherrington, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guzulaitis et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments that address these and other possible mechanisms will provide new insights into the neural mechanisms that drive the grooming sequence.</p><p>Future studies will address how changing the relative activation levels between grooming movements results in a shift of suppression such that later movements suppress earlier ones. This could be tested by extending the fiber optic-directed optogenetic approach used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), such that two different body part sensory populations are differentially stimulated with adjustable relative levels of optogenetic illumination. This would allow for an assessment of whether reduced optogenetic light power on the eyes, and increased light power to the wings results in prioritized grooming of the posterior body. In effect, changing the illumination levels on the different body parts could mimic the loss of dust as flies clean the different parts of their bodies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Persistent neural activity within grooming neural circuits</title><p>Emerging behavioral evidence indicates that neural circuits controlling <italic>Drosophila</italic> grooming movements have mechanism(s) for maintaining excitability. This was originally proposed from a study identifying a mechanosensory circuit that elicits persistent grooming of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). That is, neurons within this circuit elicit grooming that continues for tens of seconds beyond their optogenetic activation. Work presented here reveals that activation of wing sensory neurons similarly elicits persistent grooming. Interestingly, grooming responses that outlast their stimulus have also been described in vertebrates, suggesting that persistence is a common feature of grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherrington, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stein, 2005</xref>). Despite the prevalence of persistent grooming, its biological function remains unclear. One possibility is that persistence prevents unnecessary switches between behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Redgrave et al., 1999</xref>); for example swimming responses can last beyond the initial stimulus so that an animal can safely avoid a predator. In the case of grooming, persistence may ensure that a dirty body part is thoroughly cleaned before switching to another behavior.</p><p>We also infer the maintenance of excitability within grooming neural circuits from the observation that brief activation of sensory neurons across the body elicits a grooming sequence. That is, flies groom their heads and then transition to their posterior bodies, even during the period after the red light has turned off. This indicates that flies maintain a persistent trace of which body parts are stimulated to elicit a delayed and sequential grooming response. We postulate that this occurs when the simultaneous stimulation of sensory neurons across the body activates each grooming movement in parallel. Eye grooming occurs first by suppressing grooming movements occurring later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>), however the circuitry for each later movement remains active without requiring further sensory input. The next movement is then elicited via this persistent neural activity once suppression from eye grooming ceases. If this is the case, it raises the question of how the previous movement terminates to allow the next movement to proceed. Further, it is unclear how circuits that drive later grooming movements retain neural excitability. Such acquisition and maintenance of excitability is reminiscent of a previously described feature of grooming called <italic>temporal summation</italic>, whereby successive subthreshold stimuli are summed to elicit grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherrington, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guzulaitis et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, both temporal summation and the grooming sequence observed here point to a mechanism within the grooming neural circuitry that maintains a persistent trace of the sensory stimulus.</p><p>How does a mechanism that maintains excitability within the grooming neural circuitry affect our previously proposed model of grooming behavior? Our previous model indicated that constant stimulation is necessary for each grooming movement to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). That is, dust on a body part provides a constant drive to groom that is lessened through its removal. Indeed, a computational model where the movements are driven entirely by the presence of dust produces grooming that resembles dust-induced grooming. This indicates that the model well describes grooming that occurs over relatively long time scales (~30 min). However, based on observations that grooming persists after a brief stimulus, we now propose that the circuitry contains a neural mechanism that allows grooming movements to remain active on shorter time scales (tens of seconds). The ability to identify and manipulate the sensory neurons that elicit grooming movements and their downstream circuits now enable experiments to determine how persistent neural excitability is acquired and maintained.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and rearing conditions</title><p>The GAL4 lines used in this study were produced by Gerald Rubin’s lab at Janelia Research Campus and are available from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> stock center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>).

ChR2 was used for these experiments because the intensity of the blue light used for its activation is attenuated by the cuticle of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, blue light-elicited grooming would likely be caused by activation of the sensory neurons on the illuminated region of the body surface rather than activation of afferents inside the fly that project to the CNS from other body parts. For decapitations, flies were cold-anesthetized, decapitated using a standard razor blade, and allowed to recover for 10–20 min. The flies were positioned on a slide for the experiment using a fine paint brush. A 473 nm blue light LED (Nichia Corp, Tokushima, Japan) was attached to an optical fiber (1 mm in diameter) to direct light to a specific region on the fly. The optical fiber was held approximately 1 mm from the target body region to deliver a blue light stimulus with a luminance of 0.075 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. The light was directed towards the dorsal posterior region, away from the anterior body, to activate sensory neurons primarily on the wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Alternatively, the light was directed towards the dorsal anterior region, away from the posterior body, to activate sensory neurons primarily on the notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The LED stimulus was controlled using a Grass SD9 stimulator (Astro-Med Inc., Warwick, RI) that delivered 10 Hz pulses that were 20 milliseconds in duration, with 8-millisecond delays between pulses. Each fly was subjected to stimulation on each body region in random order; however, in some cases the flies would jump during the experiment and could not be used further. A grooming response to the illuminated body region within a ten-second time frame was scored as a positive response. The fraction of flies that responded was plotted. The number of trials for each dorsal body region for each line were: R52A06-GAL4, anterior (n = 100), posterior (n = 100); R30B01-GAL4, anterior (n = 40), posterior (n = 61); R81E10-GAL4, anterior (n = 86), posterior (n = 89).

Flies were cold anesthetized, loaded into behavioral chambers, and allowed to recover for at least ten minutes. R52A06-, R30B01-, and R81E10-GAL4 were used to express the light-gated channel CsChrimson. For this experiment, we used CsChrimson for optogenetic activation rather than ChR. In contrast to the blue light used for ChR, the red light used for gating CsChrimson readily penetrates the fly cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>), allowing for uniform activation of sensory neurons across the body, regardless of the flies’ orientation. Our initial experiments using optogenetic activation of the neurons targeted by these GAL4 lines revealed that high levels of red light activation caused defects in motor coordination. This was likely caused by the strong activation of sensory neurons across the body, some of which are known to be involved in proprioception (e.g. femoral chordotonal organs). Therefore, it was necessary to reduce the red-light power to the point where it elicited grooming without causing coordination defects. The light power that met these requirements for each GAL4 line are: R52A06-GAL4 (0.066 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), R30B01-GAL4 (0.066 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), and R81E10-GAL4 (0.077 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). The light power used for each LexA and spGAL4 line was: VT17251-LexA (0.382 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), R30B01-AD ∩ R31H10-DBD and R31H10-AD ∩ R34E03-DBD (0.135 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). The red light frequency was 5 Hz (0.1 s on/off) for 5 s, followed by 30 or 60 s intervals where the red light was off. The experiment consisted of a total of three photostimulation periods with 30 or 60 s intervals between each stimulation. The experiment was recorded for manual annotation of the grooming movements performed.</p><p>The recorded grooming movements of flies were manually annotated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). For the ethogram and histogram plots, the different head grooming movements (e.g. eye, antennal, and proboscis grooming) were binned (1 s time bins) and plotted as head grooming. Similarly, all movements that were directed towards the body (e.g. abdomen, wings, notum) were binned and plotted as posterior body grooming.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting advance on a seminal paper in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2014, which established the grooming behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a very productive one for the study of sequential behaviors at the cellular level, using all the genetic tricks available. In that paper the authors proposed a model of hierarchical suppression where simultaneous activation of sensory neurons on different body parts (dusting the whole fly) elicits a prioritized grooming response, roughly anterior to posterior, with eye grooming dominant over wing grooming, for example. In this advance, the authors use Gal4 and spGal4 drivers to begin the identification of the sensory neurons involved in grooming. Whole body short duration optogenetic stimulation of using general Gal4 drivers for sensory neurons gives rise to sequencing with eye grooming not giving way to posterior body grooming until the activating light is turned off, but light stimulation limited to head or body give rise to eye grooming or body grooming respectively. Thus a persistent state of activation of posterior body grooming is revealed and the model is supported. They identify with spGal4 drivers and optogenetically activate specific sensory neurons that elicit different specific grooming movements, eye grooming and wing grooming. The goal is to activate them optogenetically together and test their effects on grooming behavior and in particular on its sequencing. The ultimate experiments, once limited identified populations of eye and the wing sensory neurons are under optogenetic control, was to simultaneously activate them and show that eye input remains dominant but sequencing persists. This is a significant advance in technique and it provides strong evidence for the hierarchical suppression model, which is of wide interest. The tools and reagents are now in place to explore directly how suppression is accomplished by sensory neurons. The work is carefully done with appropriate controls and characterization of Gal4 and spGal4 lines. The data is analyzed in an appropriate manner. The lines characterized will be very useful for fly workers who wish to pursue experiments in which limited classes of sensory neurons are to be optogenetically activated. The work is of interest to those who study the neuronal bases of natural behaviors and behavior sequences.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> seem to show that stimulation of wing/halters sensory neurons has an inhibitory effect on head grooming; eye grooming is very limited in time when the wings/halters are stimulated together with the eyes compared to the eyes alone. All three reviewers commented on this seeming interaction in different ways. The authors should explain what they think is going on here and any experiments that balance the optogenetic stimulation of eye vs wing/halters sensory neurons differently.</p><p>2) Experiments could, in principle, be done using the activation of mechanosensors in the abdomen, playing them against activation of the head and/or thoracic mechanosensors.

This study nicely tests the basic assumption of the model proposed in the previous study-that activation of mechanosensory neurons all over the fly's body activates pattern generators that arouses grooming behavior to all parts of the body, with the location of the grooming sequenced in an anterior-to-posterior pattern. The experiments are well presented, appropriate, and the results are convincing. The conclusions are fully justified and nicely qualified where appropriate.</p><p>Their basic technique (using combinations of GAL-4 lines to target mechanosensory neurons in different areas of the body, then activating them optogentically) provides a strong test of the hypothesized mechanism. The results are convincingly in line with the hypothesis and, additionally, provide the added information that even short-lasting activation of a set of mechanosensors produces a long-lasting bout of grooming the appropriate area, a finding that should lead to interesting extensions of this work in the future.</p><p>Two possible extensions of the research that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The same kinds of experiments could, in principle, be done using the activation of mechanosensors in the abdomen, playing them against activation of the head and/or thoracic mechanosensors. The authors should discuss whether there is a reason that such experiments were not done.</p><p>2) Have the authors tried weakly stimulating head mechanosensors and strongly stimulating the thoracic ones? Such an experiment would test whether there is a weak back-to-front inhibition of grooming behavior in addition to the clearly strong front-to-back inhibition. If they have such data, it would be good to show it. If not, they might mention this as a possible future experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper represents an important addition to the previous studies by this group looking at the emergence of grooming sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Overall, I find the experimental data compelling, the writing is clear, and I have no major experimental concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28804.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> seem to show that stimulation of wing/halters sensory neurons has an inhibitory effect on head grooming; eye grooming is very limited in time when the wings/halters are stimulated together with the eyes compared to the eyes alone.

Based on the unanimous response by the reviewers on this point we now address it in the Results and a new Discussion section. We explain how these results are consistent with our model.

This may reveal a prediction of the model of hierarchical suppression that later movements in the sequence can suppress earlier ones (see Discussion). However, the prioritized suppression came from eye grooming, as any ongoing grooming of the wings terminated and all flies groomed their eyes with each red light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).”</p><p>The following text has been added as a new Discussion section.

However, we first need to identify transgenic driver lines (e.g. Split GAL4 lines) that specifically target two populations of neurons on the abdomen and head or thorax. This is a laborious, and often unsuccessful process that involves screening though many different combinations of Split GAL4 halves (i.e. AD and DBDs), searching for those that express exclusively in both populations of sensory neurons. It has been particularly difficult to identify lines that express in bristle mechanosensory neurons on specific body parts, which are likely the primary sensory neurons whose activation elicits abdominal and thoracic grooming. The main problem seems to be that the lines often express in mechanosensory bristles on several different body parts. The eye bristle driver that we identified and described in this manuscript seems to be an exception to that rule. Although we had success in identifying a Split GAL4 driver line that expresses in eye and wing/haltere mechanosensory neurons, we have yet to identify a driver that expresses exclusively in the abdomen and head or thorax. This is the reason why we have not tried this experiment yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) Paragraph two subsection “Competition between eye and wing sensory neurons elicits prioritized grooming” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5: I</xref> am not totally convinced by the authors interpretation 'We also found evidence of suppression by eye grooming, as ongoing grooming of the wings terminated and all flies groomed their eyes with each red light stimulus…&quot;.

The model of hierarchical suppression predicts that optogenetic activation of the sensory neurons at shorter interstimulus intervals than the 60 seconds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> would similarly cause the flies to cease grooming their posterior bodies and transition to grooming their heads. As the reviewer asked, we repeated the experiment using a shorter interstimulus interval (30 seconds). To ensure that the optogenetic stimulus was delivered, to quote the reviewer, “when it [posterior grooming] is most robust”, we performed several trials of this experiment, but only plotted the trials where the flies were engaged in posterior grooming at the time of the next stimulus. In all cases, the animals ceased grooming their posterior bodies and groomed their heads. We added an additional figure supplement that shows the results of this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We also added text in the Results section of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: “This termination of posterior grooming was still observed when we shortened the time between light stimuli and only examined trials where flies were grooming at the moment the next stimulus was delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).” This new experiment strengthens our original argument that activating head sensory neurons can initiate anterior grooming and suppress ongoing posterior grooming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Two possible extensions of the research that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The same kinds of experiments could, in principle, be done using the activation of mechanosensors in the abdomen, playing them against activation of the head and/or thoracic mechanosensors.

However, we do not yet have the necessary hardware to rigorously do this experiment. We are constructing an apparatus that uses two lasers to illuminate two body parts as the same time with different light powers. This will allow us to adjust the relative optogenetic light power on the two parts and test whether weak stimulation of the anterior body with strong stimulation of a posterior part results in the prioritization of posterior grooming and the suppression of anterior grooming.</p><p>We realized with this reviewer’s comment that this would be a good point to mention in the manuscript, and added a paragraph to the new Discussion section called: “Optogenetic control of sensory neurons to further probe the neural mechanisms of hierarchical suppression.” The entire Discussion section is also shown above. The paragraph that is directly relevant to this reviewer’s comment follows:</p><p>“Future studies will address how changing the relative activation levels between grooming movements results in a shift of suppression such that later movements suppress earlier ones.
