The bacteria spread in droplets of water from contaminated water systems such as sink faucets, cooling towers, water tanks, and other plumbing systems. In these water systems, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> cells live within communities known as biofilms, which contain many different species of bacteria. These communities often include other species of <italic>Legionella</italic> that compete with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> for similar nutrients.

The work of Levin et al. suggests that HGA may help <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> bacteria to persist in biofilms, but more work needs to be done to test this idea. A possible next step is to test whether drugs that inhibit the production of HGA can eliminate <italic>Legionella</italic> bacteria from water systems.

In these settings, bacteria must battle for space and nutrients while evading antagonism by neighboring cells. One strategy for managing these environments is for bacteria to cooperate with their kin cells, sharing secreted molecules as public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abisado et al., 2018</xref>). However, these public goods are vulnerable to exploitation by other species or by ‘cheater’ bacterial strains that benefit from public goods but do not contribute to their production. For this reason, many bacteria participate in both cooperative and antagonistic behaviors to survive in multispecies biofilms. Bacterial antagonistic factors can range from small molecules to large proteins, delivered directly or by diffusion, and can either act on a broad spectrum of bacterial taxa or narrowly target only a few species. Although narrowly targeted mechanisms may seem to be of less utility than those that enable antagonism against diverse bacterial competitors, targeted strategies can be critical for bacterial success because they tend to mediate competition between closely-related organisms that are most likely to overlap in their requirements for restricted nutrients and niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hibbing et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The bacterium <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) naturally inhabits nutrient-poor aquatic environments where it undergoes a bi-phasic lifestyle, alternating between replication in host eukaryotes and residence in multi-species biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lau and Ashbolt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Declerck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Declerck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). If <italic>Lp</italic> undergoes this lifecycle within man-made structures such as cooling towers, the bacteria can become aerosolized and cause outbreaks of a severe, pneumonia-like disease in humans, called Legionnaires’ disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fraser et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McDade et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fields et al., 2002</xref>). Because of the serious consequences of <italic>Lp</italic> colonization, the persistence and growth of <italic>Legionella</italic> in aquatic environments has been the subject of numerous studies. These studies have examined replication within protozoan hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rowbotham, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lau and Ashbolt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>), survival in water under nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendis et al., 2015</xref>), and sensitivity to biocides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we focus on interbacterial competition as an underappreciated survival challenge for <italic>Lp</italic>.</p><p><italic>Legionella spp.</italic> are not known to produce any antibiotics, bacteriocins, or other antibacterial toxins. Bioinformatic surveys of <italic>Legionella</italic> genomes have revealed a number of polyketide synthases and other loci that likely produce bioactive metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tobias et al., 2016</xref>), but these have not been shown to exhibit any antimicrobial functions. Nevertheless, there are some hints that interbacterial competition is relevant for <italic>Lp</italic> success within biofilms. For example, one study of artificial two-species biofilms found that viable <italic>Lp</italic> were able to persist for over two weeks in the presence of some bacterial species (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>) but not others (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Lp</italic> bacteria are often co-resident with other <italic>Legionella spp.</italic> in man-made structures, with some studies showing that <italic>Lp</italic> proliferation is correlated with a decrease in other <italic>Legionella spp.</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wéry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Declerck et al., 2007</xref>). These studies suggest that <italic>Lp</italic> bacteria may compete with other <italic>Legionella spp.</italic> for similar biological niches.</p><p>The most direct evidence for interbacterial competition comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stewart et al. (2011)</xref>, who found that <italic>Lp</italic> could antagonize the growth of neighboring <italic>Legionella spp.</italic> on the same plate. The molecules mediating this competition have not been identified, although previous work suggested a role for <italic>Lp</italic>’s secreted surfactant, a thin liquid film that facilitates the spread of <italic>Lp</italic> across agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>). Still, it remained unknown if surfactant played a direct or indirect role in inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> inhibition.</p><p>Here, we use unbiased genetic approaches to find that homogentisic acid (HGA) produced by <italic>Lp</italic> generates oxidative intermediates that inhibit the growth of neighboring <italic>Legionella spp</italic>. We find that HGA production co-occurs with surfactant production, but that these are independent, separable phenomena. The redox state of HGA appears to be critical for its activity, as HGA is only toxic in aerobic conditions and fully oxidized HGA-melanin pigment is inactive. Unexpectedly, we find that although <italic>Lp</italic> secretes abundant HGA, it is also susceptible to HGA-mediated inhibition. We identify one gene– <italic>lpg1681</italic>– that enhances <italic>Lp</italic> susceptibility to HGA. Moreover, we find that <italic>Lp</italic> cells are resistant to HGA at high-density, which is also when they secrete large amounts of HGA. This high-density resistance is cell intrinsic and is independent of growth phase, the stringent response, or the previously described quorum-sensing pathway in <italic>Legionella</italic>. Based on these findings, we propose that HGA has the potential to play an important role in structuring <italic>Legionella</italic> communities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> inhibits <italic>L. micdadei</italic> via an unknown, secreted inhibitor</title><p>Inspired by previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>), we investigated how <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) engages in inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> competition.

The first operon had two insertions in the <italic>hisC2</italic> gene (<italic>lpg1998)</italic>, which breaks down tyrosine as part of the HGA-melanin metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Its downstream gene, <italic>pphA</italic>, converts phenylalanine to tyrosine in the same pathway. To validate the role of <italic>hisC2</italic> in inhibition, we overexpressed this gene in the <italic>hisC2</italic> transposon mutant background and found that <italic>hisC2</italic> alone was sufficient to complement the mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Having confirmed the role of <italic>hisC2</italic>, we turned to the second operon, where we had recovered transposon insertions in two uncharacterized genes, <italic>lpg2276</italic> and <italic>lpg2277</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Because transposon insertions at the beginning of an operon can disrupt the expression of downstream genes via polar effects, we hypothesized that the insertions we recovered in <italic>lpg2276</italic> and <italic>lpg2277</italic> altered inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> inhibition via disruption of <italic>hpd</italic> expression. Indeed, we were able to complement insertions in both genes, which had yielded ‘no zone’ mutants, by overexpressing <italic>hpd,</italic> despite the fact that <italic>hpd</italic> overexpression caused a growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In conclusion, all five ‘no zone’ isolates had mutations that disrupted the same metabolic pathway involved in the production of HGA-melanin. Consistent with these findings, we observed defects in HGA-melanin pigmentation in all of the ‘no zone’ mutants as well as some of the ‘small zone’ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>The HGA-melanin pathway is found in diverse eukaryotes and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nosanchuk and Casadevall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu and Nizet, 2009</xref>) including <italic>Legionella spp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fang et al., 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This pathway produces homogentisic acid (HGA) from the catabolism of phenylalanine or tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinert et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). HGA can either be further metabolized and recycled within the cell via HmgA-C, or it can be secreted outside of the cell, where it auto-oxidizes and polymerizes to form a black-brown pigment called HGA-melanin, or pyomelanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kotob et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We tested whether HGA could behave as an inhibitor even though HGA-melanin could not. Indeed, we found that synthetic HGA robustly inhibited <italic>Lm</italic> growth, both when spotted onto a lawn of <italic>Lm</italic> and when titrated into AYE rich media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), We found that inhibition of <italic>Lm</italic> by HGA is relatively specific at the molecular level; neither 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid nor 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, two HGA-related molecules that differ from HGA by only a single -OH group, were able to inhibit <italic>Lm</italic> growth at any concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Because HGA, but not HGA-melanin, can inhibit <italic>Lm</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>), we inferred that the oxidative state of HGA might be important to its inhibitory activity. HGA is a reactive molecule, which auto-oxidizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eslami et al., 2013</xref>) and polymerizes to form HGA-melanin through a series of non-enzymatic steps that are not genetically encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinert et al., 2001</xref>) and are therefore undetectable by our genetic screen. Given its auto-oxidative potential, we next tested whether HGA might cause growth inhibition by oxidizing other nearby molecules, either in the media or on bacterial cells. We allowed synthetic HGA to oxidize completely for 24 hr in AYE media before adding <italic>Lm</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We found that pre-oxidation completely abolished synthetic HGA activity, even at very high HGA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, compare to 3C). This experiment also ruled out the possibility that HGA acts by causing nutrient depletion or other modifications of the media, since media pre-incubated with HGA for 24 hr is still able to support normal <italic>Lm</italic> growth. Instead, we infer that <italic>Lm</italic> inhibition results from direct interactions between bacterial cells and either HGA itself or unstable, reactive intermediates produced during HGA oxidation.</p><p>Small, reactive, quinone-like molecules similar to HGA are known to react with oxygen to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is broadly toxic to bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hassan and Fridovich, 1980</xref>). In such cases, extracellular catalase has been shown to protect bacteria against the toxic effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hassan and Fridovich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imlay, 2013</xref>). To test if HGA toxicity occurs via a similar mechanism as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we asked if extracellular catalase was sufficient to protect <italic>Lm</italic> from HGA-mediated toxicity. Even at very high catalase concentrations, we found that catalase provided no protection from HGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), ruling out the production of extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a potential mechanism of action for HGA-mediated inhibition. We also considered the possibility that HGA as a weak acid could inhibit <italic>Lm</italic> indirectly by altering the local pH, but we observed that adding HGA at 1 mM into AYE media or PBS caused little to no change in pH.</p><p>Given that the redox state of HGA is critical for inhibition, we reasoned that it should be possible to modulate HGA activity by altering the redox state of the media using reducing agents. We accomplished this by titrating L-cysteine from 25% to 200% of the levels in standard AYE media. In the absence of HGA, these altered cysteine concentrations had little impact on <italic>Lm</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, gray symbols). However, lower cysteine concentrations greatly sensitized <italic>Lm</italic> to HGA, while excess cysteine was completely protective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These findings may help partially explain why HGA’s inhibitory activity on <italic>Legionella</italic> has not been previously detected, as <italic>Legionella</italic> species are typically studied in cysteine-rich media. We found that synthetic HGA is readily able to react with cysteine in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), presumably impacting the oxidation state of HGA. Moreover, incubation of HGA with two other reducing agents, DTT (dithiothreitol) or reduced glutathione, similarly quenched HGA’s inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that HGA is less potent in rich media because it reacts with excess cysteine (or other bystander molecules) before it can interact with <italic>Lm</italic>. In sum, these results implicate the reactive activity of HGA and/or its transient, oxidative intermediates in inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> inhibition.</p><p>In these experiments, synthetic HGA was a robust inhibitor of <italic>Lm.</italic> However, this inhibition required relatively high concentrations of HGA (&gt;50 µM). We next quantified the amount of HGA secreted by <italic>Lp</italic> to determine if these levels were biologically relevant. Compared to other <italic>Legionella spp.</italic>, <italic>Lp</italic> produces much more pigment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that it secretes considerably more HGA. To estimate the quantity of secreted HGA, we created a standard curve of synthetic HGA in AYE rich media. We allowed the HGA added to completely oxidize to HGA-melanin, which can be measured by OD 400 readings. In this way, we can use the pigment levels after oxidation as a reliable measure of total HGA that was produced by a given time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using this calibration, we estimated that wild type <italic>Lp</italic> had secreted the equivalent of 1.7 mM HGA after 48 hr of culture, whereas the hyperpigmented <italic>∆hmgA</italic> strain secreted about 2.6 mM HGA. Thus, the levels of HGA produced by <italic>Lp</italic> are considerably higher than the inhibitory concentrations of synthetic HGA used in our assays (50–500 µM), at least under lab conditions. In contrast, we did not detect any pigment from the non-inhibitory <italic>hisC2</italic>::Tn strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that HGA is an abundant, secreted, redox-active metabolite of <italic>Lp</italic>, which can accumulate in concentrations that are relevant for inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> can be susceptible to its own inhibitor</title><p>Our results so far indicated that HGA can be a potent, redox-active inhibitor of <italic>Lm</italic>, which is volatile and capable of reacting with many types of thiol-containing molecules.

We observed that HGA was not inhibitory to <italic>Lp</italic> in anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that HGA-mediated toxicity comes from the action of a reactive intermediate molecule generated during HGA oxidation.</p><p>We then considered the density-dependent difference in HGA susceptibility, reasoning that quorum sensing would be most likely to control this phenomenon. When we asked if HGA resistance depended on the previously described <italic>Lp</italic> quorum sensing response regulator, <italic>lqsR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tiaden et al., 2007</xref>), we found that deleting <italic>lqsR</italic> had no detectable impact on HGA susceptibility or resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, the density-dependent susceptibility of <italic>Lp</italic> to HGA must be independent of the <italic>lqsR</italic> pathway. We next investigated the basis of high-density resistance to HGA by <italic>Lp</italic> bacteria, hypothesizing that high-density cells could alter the activity of extracellular HGA, either through the secretion of inactivating compounds or through bulk, non-specific binding of HGA to bacterial biomass, leading to a reduction in its effective concentration. To test both hypotheses, we recovered the supernatants from high-density and low-density bacteria that had been incubated with or without HGA, and applied these supernatants to fresh, low-density <italic>Lp</italic> to assess HGA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

In this study, we identify HGA’s oxidative intermediates as a mediator of inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> inhibition, both between <italic>Legionella</italic> species and even between genetically identical populations of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first time that HGA has been described to have antimicrobial activity. One reason HGA-mediated inhibition may not have been previously documented is that the active compound(s) are redox-active, unstable molecules with transient activity. Our study finds that synthetic HGA can auto-oxidize over the course of an experiment to form inactive HGA-melanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), allowing exposed <italic>Lp</italic> populations to rebound following initial inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Intriguingly, although <italic>Lp</italic> populations recover upon HGA oxidation, <italic>Lm</italic> populations do not, suggesting that HGA may cause more harm to <italic>Lm</italic> cells. The quenching of HGA’s inhibitory activity occurs especially rapidly in the cysteine-rich microbial media typically used to grow <italic>Legionella</italic> in the lab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Conversely, we find that HGA becomes more potent in low-cysteine media or in PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and 7</xref>), where oxidation of HGA into HGA-melanin occurs more slowly; such nutrient-poor conditions may better replicate the nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) aquatic environments of <italic>Legionella’s</italic> natural habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atlas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boamah et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although dense, stationary-phase cultures of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> secrete abundant HGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we also find that these bacteria do not possess heritable resistance to HGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>) and are highly susceptible to HGA-mediated inhibition at low cell density. However, they exhibit conditional, cell intrinsic resistance to HGA at high cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 and 7</xref>). This lack of heritable resistance makes HGA-mediated inhibition different from classical antibiotics or toxins, which typically are produced by bacteria that also express resistance genes or antitoxins. HGA inhibition is also distinct from that caused by toxic metabolic by-products in two important ways. First, HGA production is not required for efficient growth or metabolism in <italic>Legionella</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and see growth of <italic>hisC2</italic>::Tn mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, high-density populations of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> that produce HGA are themselves protected from HGA inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 and 7</xref>). Only neighboring, low-density <italic>Legionella</italic> are strongly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 6D</xref>). The strong density-dependence of <italic>Legionella</italic>’s susceptibility to HGA may be another reason that it has been previously undiscovered despite intense study of these bacteria.</p><p>HGA-mediated inhibition of <italic>Legionella</italic> is reminiscent of the antimicrobial activities of phenazines, another class of small aromatic molecules including pyocyanin from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Both types of molecules are redox-active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hassan and Fridovich, 1980</xref>), are produced at high cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hassan and Fridovich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron et al., 1989</xref>), are able to chemically react with thiol groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheluvappa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heine et al., 2016</xref>), and result in the production of a colored pigment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Price-Whelan et al., 2006</xref>). Phenazine inhibitory activity is typically thought to come from redox cycling and the production of reactive oxygen species, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hassan and Fridovich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheluvappa et al., 2008</xref>). Oddly, HGA-melanin production has previously been implicated both in the production of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noorian et al., 2017</xref>) and protection from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Orlandi et al., 2015</xref>) reactive oxygen species. The catalase experiments presented here have ruled out the production of extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a possible mechanism behind HGA inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Instead, based on association of <italic>lpg1681</italic> and <italic>DsbD2</italic> with reduced HGA sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the ability of diverse thiols to quench HGA’s activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and precedents from phenazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heine et al., 2016</xref>), we speculate that HGA’s transient, oxidative intermediates may be toxic by forming adducts on cysteine residues or otherwise disrupting disulfide bonding. Alternatively, HGA-mediated inhibition could occur via the production of other reactive oxygen species, including potentially the generation of intracellular superoxide and/or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hassan and Fridovich, 1979</xref>), which would not be affected by catalase treatment. As both of these mechanisms should be broadly inhibitory to a number of bacterial taxa, it will be interesting to survey HGA susceptibility outside of <italic>Legionella</italic>.</p><p>The density-dependence of <italic>Lp</italic>’s resistance to HGA is unusual and worthy of future study. Because high-density cells do not inactivate or bind up extracellular HGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and because heat-killed cells cannot protect live, low-density <italic>Lp</italic> from inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we infer that resistance is cell-intrinsic, resulting from differing physiology and/or gene expression between high- and low-density cells. Two pathways that commonly regulate such defenses include the stringent response pathway, which becomes active under nutrient limitation and stress, and quorum sensing pathways, which become active at high cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachman and Swanson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hammer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tiaden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalebroux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hochstrasser and Hilbi, 2017</xref>). Although our experiments disrupting these pathways suggest that neither pathway contributes to density-dependent susceptibility or resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), we note that quorum sensing in <italic>Legionella</italic> remains understudied, and such pathways vary considerably across bacterial taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hochstrasser and Hilbi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller and Bassler, 2001</xref>). Future work using unbiased approaches to investigate the regulation of HGA susceptibility may be able to uncover additional density-sensing pathways, possibly including an undescribed mode of quorum sensing in <italic>Legionella</italic>. Finally, we note that the density-dependent resistance was observed in well-mixed, liquid cultures in both rich media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and in PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In natural conditions, high-density bacteria may be further protected within anaerobic regions of a biofilm, as HGA was not toxic to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is often co-isolated with other <italic>Legionella</italic> species, which likely compete for similar ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wéry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>). HGA-mediated inter-<italic>Legionella</italic> inhibition therefore has a strong potential to impact the success of <italic>Lp</italic> in both natural and man-made environments. Because high-density, established <italic>Lp</italic> bacterial communities are largely resistant to HGA inhibition, these communities might use HGA to protect against low-density, invading <italic>Legionella</italic> competitors with little harm to themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In this model, motile <italic>Lp</italic> can disperse, colonize a new surface, and grow into a microcolony using the locally available nutrients. In these early stages, no HGA is produced. After the <italic>Lp</italic> population grows up and crosses a certain cell density threshold, the cells become HGA-resistant through a cell-intrinsic mechanism. When this dense population enters stationary phase, it also begins to secrete abundant HGA into the local environment. This secreted HGA has minimal impact on the resistant, producer cells. However, it can inhibit the growth of nearby, low-density <italic>Legionella</italic>, whether the neighboring cells are other <italic>Legionella</italic> species or even genetically-identical <italic>Lp</italic>. Given these dynamics observed in the lab, we speculate that HGA and other such inhibitors may be deployed as a bacterial niche-protective strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used for this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Into this plasmid, we cloned ~ 1 kb regions upstream and downstream of the gene of interest to enable homologous recombination. Following electroporation and selection on chloramphenicol, we used colony PCR to verify insertion of the plasmid into the chromosome, before counter-selection on sucrose media. From the resulting colonies, we performed PCR and Sanger sequencing to verify clean gene deletion.

Once spots were dry, plates were then incubated for an additional 3 days before scoring for inhibition. This assay was also used to quantify the bactericidal inhibition of <italic>Lm</italic>, with slight modifications. Here, all <italic>Lm</italic> was plated in 20 µL spots at 10^6 CFU/mL. The time of plating susceptible <italic>Lm</italic> was treated as t = 0. Once spots were dry, plugs were extracted from within the <italic>Lm</italic> spots using the narrow end of a Pasteur pipette.

Synthetic HGA (Sigma: #H0751) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 100 mM and filter sterilized before use. To limit the potential for HGA oxidation prior to use, 100 mM aliquots prepared in water were stored frozen at −20C and discarded after 1–2 weeks. HGA-related compounds, 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (Sigma: #H49804) and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (Sigma: #H49901), were prepared in the same way. To test the impact of DTT (Sigma: #43819) and glutathione (oxidized: Sigma #G4376, reduced: Sigma #G6529) on HGA-mediated inhibition, filter-sterilized solutions dissolved in water were mixed in equimolar ratios with HGA, and incubated shaking at room temperature for 1 hr before spotting onto bacterial lawns.

All putative mutants underwent clonal re-isolation, were diluted to OD 600 of 0.1, and spotted on fresh <italic>Lm</italic> lawns to retest their phenotypes.

The cytation three imaging reader (BioTek CYT3MV) was used to monitor growth by OD 600 measurements. Because oxidized pigment from synthetic HGA is detected at OD 600 as well, each experiment included bacteria-free control wells containing media and each concentration of HGA. To correct OD 600 readings for pigment development, at each time point we subtracted the control well reading from bacterial wells that received the same concentration of synthetic HGA.</p><p>For experiments with HGA ‘pre-oxidation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we diluted HGA in AYE media and incubated this solution shaking at 37 ˚C for 24 hr in the plate reader before adding <italic>Lm</italic> bacteria.

This design ensured that the bacteria maintained a constant cell density throughout the course of the experiment. Stationary phase cultures were washed 1–2 times and re-suspended in PBS. We diluted these bacteria to estimated starting concentrations of 10^9, 10^8, and 10^7 CFU/mL and plated for CFU at t = 0. We distributed the remaining bacteria into 96 well plates with or without 125 µM HGA.

As this measurement can be altered by pH and temperature, we assessed the ability for HGA to oxidize cysteine in our experimental conditions using Ellman’s reagent (also known as 5,5’-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTNB, Invitrogen #D8451). Ellman’s reagent reacts in the presence of reduced thiol groups on L-cysteine to form a yellow color, which can be read as 412 nm absorbance. When thiol groups are oxidized, the Ellman’s reagent is colorless. We used the ability for HGA to decrease the amount of reduced cysteine as a proxy for its oxidizing ability. Stock solutions of both 100 mM HGA and 1.5 mM L-cysteine (Sigma #C6852) were prepared fresh in PBS at the start of the experiment. Different concentrations of HGA (from 125 µM to 8 mM) were incubated in triplicate, shaking at 25°C with 1.5 mM cysteine in PBS for 16 hr. These conditions were compared to a standard curve of cysteine from 0 to 2 mM, which were incubated in parallel with the experimental samples to account for cysteine oxidation over time. To quantify the remaining free thiol groups, 180 uL of 0.08 mg/mL Ellman’s reagent was mixed with 17.65 uL of each experimental or standard sample in a 96 well plate, incubated for 3 hr at 25°C, and read for 412 nm absorbance.

After 15, 20, 24, 39, 44, and 48 hr, we measured the OD 600 of the culture and collected conditioned media. To create a standard curve, we diluted synthetic HGA into AYE at the following concentrations: 62.5 µM, 125 µM, 250 µM, 500 µM, and 1 mM. The conditioned media and standard curve samples were incubated in a 96 well plate in a plate reader shaking at 37 ˚C for 24 hr to allow the HGA to oxidize. We used OD 400 data from the 24 hr time point to generate a standard curve for each HGA concentration and calculated a line of best fit using linear regression. This equation was used to estimate the amount of secreted HGA that corresponded to the OD 400 of each conditioned media sample.

We identified most of these homologs of <italic>lpg1681</italic> using a jackhmmr search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Finn et al., 2015</xref>), followed by cross-referencing the homologs with the <italic>Legionella</italic> orthology groups defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al. (2016)</xref>. From this starting set, additional <italic>lpg1681</italic> orthologs were identified in unannotated, intergenic regions by searching for &gt; 200 bp open reading frames upstream of <italic>dsbD</italic> orthologs, and confirming the homology of these regions using MAFFT alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>). Through this method, we located <italic>lpg1681</italic> in all currently sequenced <italic>Legionella</italic> genomes that contain an annotated <italic>dsbD2</italic> gene, with the exception of <italic>L. shakespearei.</italic> We categorized the <italic>lpg1681</italic>-containing loci into those with similar synteny, based on the orthology group annotations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al. (2016)</xref>. We colored and provided names for the neighboring genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> if they had a homolog in the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Philadelphia-1 genome that was not annotated as a hypothetical gene. To assess the conservation of the <italic>lpg1680-lpg1682</italic> among <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains, we used blastn in the NCBI nr and wgs databases with the full <italic>lpg1680-lpg1682</italic> genomic DNA sequence as a query. We found that the full region was conserved with few mutations across 501 currently sequenced <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Howard Shuman for providing <italic>Legionella</italic> strains as well as the pLAW344 and pMMB207c plasmids, and Tamara O’Connor for the pTO100 plasmid carrying the transposon.

The more interesting question is why is HGA toxic to the producers? That, unfortunately, isn't clarified here, and without deeper insight into this aspect, this paper falls short of the <italic>eLife</italic> bar.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- An oxidative stress mechanism is asserted but not rigorously tested.

By applying a logical series of genetic and biological assays, they also identified a previously uncharacterized locus that modulates bacterial sensitivity to the HGA pigment. The authors discuss their results within a provocative ecological framework, proposing that, by secreting the pigment in stationary phase, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> restricts encroachment by competitor <italic>Legionella</italic>.</p><p>In general, the experiments are logical, quantitative, and well controlled, and the primary conclusions are supported by data provided. The value of the manuscript is to advance the scant literature on mechanisms of ecological fitness of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in aquatic environments, the source of transmission to humans. Ambiguity concerning growth phase vs cell density complicates independent interpretation and replication of the results, a weakness that can be corrected by editing and/or comparing directly log and stationary phase WT cells in their HGA-sensitivity assay.</p><p>1) Cell density vs growth phase: Abstract, Results section, Discussion section; Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and elsewhere. <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> induce expression of multiple virulence and resilience traits upon entry into stationary phase, whereas exponential phase cells are more susceptible to killing by macrophages and a variety of environmental stresses (e.g. Molofsky and Swanson, 2004; Olivia et al., 2018). Accordingly, in experiments testing sensitivity of <italic>Legionella</italic> to HGA, clarify in Materials and methods section and relevant figure legends the growth phase of the cells that were challenged with HGA. Currently, the references to &quot;regulatory state&quot; (Discussion section) are vague and not tested directly here.</p><p>2) HGA induces transient &quot;growth delay&quot;, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and Results section &quot;improvement in growth&quot;: Without knowing the growth phase of inocula used throughout this study, it is difficult to interpret the apparent prolonged lag phase of HGA-treated cells: Does HGA kill a large subset of the treated population, or instead delay entrance into the cell cycle for the entire population? If the latter, do you speculate that HGA loses activity or instead that the bacteria adapt to overcome the HGA block to replication?</p><p>3) Cell density protection, Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and Results section: Do cells need to be metabolically active to confer protection from HGA, or is this a biochemical effect of distributing the oxidative damage across more substrate – more surface area of stationary phase L. pneumophila cells? For example, do UV-inactivated bacteria protect a minority population of viable stationary phase cells? Related to #1, at high densities, are log phase cells also protected from HGA treatment?</p><p>4) Title and Discussion section, &quot;observed specificity&quot;: Whether HGA also inhibits non-<italic>Legionella</italic> bacteria is predicted from the Stewart et al., 2011 study of surfactant and implied here but is not tested directly. Also, this paragraph focuses on pigments, but cites Stewart et al., 2011 that only analyzes surfactant.</p><p>5) Translation mutants alter HGA susceptibility, Results section: Nam et al., 2016 reported that disruption of elongation factor P function induces the stringent response of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Since the stringent response triggers entry of replicating <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> into stationary phase and the more resilient &quot;transmissive&quot; cell type (e.g. Molofsky and Swanson, 2004; Olivia et al., 2018), the authors may wish to comment on whether activation of the stringent response might account for the isolation of a large number of translation mutants in the screen for enhanced resistance to HGA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Levin et al. identify an important mechanism that <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> may employ to successfully compete in complex multispecies communities. Specifically, demonstrate that interbacterial competition between closely related <italic>Legionella</italic> species is mediated in part by the secretion of the inhibitory molecule homogentisic acid by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. This work is important as it reveals a novel mechanism this pathogen may use to thrive in the environment. They identify HGA as the inhibitory molecule using a random transposon mutagenesis approach and further characterize mutations that increase resistance to HGA in the producing strain. Cysteine is shown to protect cells from the toxic effects of HGA and the oxidized form of the molecule (HGA-melanin) is non-toxic, suggesting that redox activity of HGA is important for the mechanism of inhibition. The work is well done, and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Density-dependent resistance protects <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> from its own antimicrobial metabolite, HGA&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Overall, you have done an outstanding job in responding to the first set of reviews, and this manuscript is on-track for acceptance in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers made a few suggestions that are constructive, which you will likely want to incorporate into your final manuscript prior to publication. The goal here is to help you polish your work one last time, but not to add onerous new experiments. No additional new experimentation is required, but should you want to try one quick experiment independently suggested by reviewer 1 and reviewer 3, please go for it.</p><p>We look forward to receiving your final revised manuscript and processing it for publication shortly!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript has improved significantly and the authors are to be commended for doing a great job in response to the previous set of reviews. The new experiments aimed at bolstering the interpretation of the HGA toxicity mechanism have elevated the work, and the comparison with phenazines in the discussion is clarifying. The manuscript is much better focused and thoughtfully discussed, and makes an interesting new contribution to the literature on secondary metabolism, an important and understudied aspect of bacterial physiology. Why much remains to be learned about the mechanism(s) underpinning the phenotypes reported here, the authors have ruled out the usual suspects and have revealed an intriguing phenomenon that will inspire future work to fill in the molecular details and test the potential ecological importance of the finding, both worthy goals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have thoughtfully and rigorously addressed each of the gaps noted in their first submission. This significantly expanded and revised manuscript is impressive in its scope, incorporating a logical series of microbiological, genetic, bioinformatic, and biochemical approaches to identify a new activity for a pigment that has long been known to be produced by the environmental opportunistic pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>. Using a clever series of quantitative assays, they convincingly demonstrate that in the stationary phase, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> secretes HGA which inhibits replication of other legionellae that are present at low density, whether in log or stationary phase (Figure 6F). Based on several systematic tests of multiple potential mechanisms, they demonstrate that both regulation and activity of the HGA inhibitor have novel features that warrant continued investigation. The authors discuss their data within a provocative ecological framework that will guide future research in the field.</p><p>Altogether, the study marks a significant advance for the <italic>Legionella</italic> field, where mechanistic knowledge of this pathogen's strategies for persistence in the environment remains scant, despite <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> now being the leading cause of water-associated infectious disease in the USA. The clearly written manuscript is also highly accessible for the broad audience that will be interested in this new environmental microbiology, thanks to multiple schematic diagrams that beautifully illustrate the experimental design (eg Figure 2A, Figure 3A, Figure 5A, Figure 6B, D, E).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Levin et al., have modified their previous manuscript in response to earlier reviews. The focus is narrowed to highlight the role of HGA in inhibiting <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. and that resistance to this inhibition is density dependent the producing species, <italic>Lp</italic>. This inhibition is shown to be independent of secreted surfactants, disproving a hypothesis previously set forth in the field. The secreted inhibitory factor is identified as HGA using a clever genetic screen for transposon mutants, and HGA is later shown to be inhibitory at biologically relevant concentrations. They show that this inhibitory activity is due to HGA and that catalase was not protective suggesting that inhibition is not due to the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through side reactions. They further show evidence that HGA inhibition is bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal in <italic>Lp</italic> and perform a forward genetic selection to identify genes that allow for growth in the presence of HGA. Unsurprisingly, they identify many genes that likely have global effects, and focus on one gene that was mutated in a subset of the population. The authors speculate that periplasmic disulfide bond formation may be important to mediate the cellular response to HGA, but no direct evidence is given. This resistance response may be density, but not growth phase, dependent and cell-intrinsic.</p><p>Several new experiments strengthen this version of the manuscript and address many questions raised previously. While the authors are unable to identify a mechanism by which HGA inhibits cells or LP gains resistance, many &quot;obvious&quot; candidates are tested and determined to not play a role and it is likely that resistance mechanisms will have global cellular effects that are difficult to tease apart. This is an interesting first observation of the phenomenon and should be of interest to a broad group of scientists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46086.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

Micro.).</p></disp-quote><p>There were four chief criticisms and suggestions by the reviewers. They felt that our study was not as complete as desired. They provided guidance for refocusing our revision with several additional experiments, which we have now performed over the past five months. These additional experiments and their follow-ups have now resulted in an additional two and a half main figures (and some associated supplementary figures) in our revision. We have also extensively revised our manuscript to focus on our findings. We believe that our revisions and new experiments have now addressed the majority, if not all, of the reviewers’ comments. In light of the editor’s encouragement, we are therefore resubmitting our manuscript for reconsideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. To aid your appraisal, we highlight the main changes in our revision below. A point-by-point response to the reviewer comments follows after.</p><p>1) We have performed additional experiments to show that HGA inhibition of <italic>L. pneumophila (Lp)</italic> is bacteriostatic in rich media. The <italic>Lp</italic> population rebounds in our experiments in rich media reflect delayed growth, which occurs after HGA has oxidized and is no longer inhibitory. Specifically, we are able to rule out an alternative hypothesis of genetic adaptation i.e., that the inhibition curves reflected killing followed by outgrowth of resistant mutants. This behavior differs from nutrient-poor media like PBS, where HGA appears to be bacteriocidal.</p><p>2) We perform additional experiments in both rich media and PBS to demonstrate that <italic>Lp</italic> resistance to HGA is associated with cell density and not growth phase. We note that we had already ruled out the role of the known quorum sensing pathway in this resistance, concluding that this resistance must therefore constitute a distinct density dependent phenomenon.</p><p>3) We perform additional experiments to show that HGA resistance at high density appears to be cell-intrinsic, and not a result of HGA inactivation or cell mass mediated mitigation of HGA inhibition. We show that supernatants from high-density, HGA exposed cells retain activity against low-density cells, demonstrating that extracellular HGA has not been inactivated or otherwise lost activity in the high-density condition. Moreover, we show that low-density live cells, spiked into high-density heat-killed cells, are not protected from HGA. Therefore, protection at high-density is not due to generic HGA binding to excess cellular material.</p><p>4) Following up on our findings of elongation factor P mutations that increase resistance to HGA, and reviewer suggestions, we now evaluate and rule out the role of <italic>Legionella’s</italic> stringent response in mediating HGA resistance. We find that mutations to the stringent response pathway have no impact on either <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> susceptibility to HGA or on bacterial resistance at high density.</p><p>5) We have added significant experimentation beyond what was suggested by the reviewers to test the redox hypothesis for HGA inhibition. We measure the redox properties of HGA. We also test and rule out the hypothesis that HGA inhibits by generating extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by testing if catalase can rescue HGA inhibition; it cannot.</p><p>6) We have minimized our previous speculation about the ecological context of this HGA inhibition and resistance, while clarifying our comparisons in the text between HGA and phenazines. This is also reflected in our rephrasing of the title as suggested by the editor to focus more on our findings and speculate less about their implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>While this manuscript takes an impressive genetics approach to an interesting observation, at the end of the day, the key biological insights here aren't clear. Similar things have been reported for phenazines: they can be both beneficial under some circumstances, and harmful under others, including harmful to the producing cells (they are &quot;self-active&quot;, see work on eDNA release, for example). The more interesting question is why is HGA toxic to the producers? That, unfortunately, isn't clarified here, and without deeper insight into this aspect, this paper falls short of the eLife bar.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the relevant points were not clearly explained in our original manuscript, and attempt to do better in our revision.</p><p>The interesting and unexpected feature is that HGA has vastly different impacts on adjacent, genetically-identical bacteria depending on their cell density. Specifically, high-density cells produce abundant HGA, which is not harmful to the producing cells but is harmful to their low-density neighbors in the same environment. This makes the phenomenon of HGA inhibition different from the production of antimicrobials such as antibiotics or toxins, because there is not constitutive resistance via a resistance gene or antitoxin. At the same time, HGA’s mode of action is also distinct from the release of generically toxic metabolites that would harm both producing and neighboring cells (as is true for phenazines that trigger eDNA release), because <italic>Legionella</italic> exhibit conditional, cell intrinsic, high-density resistance (see new Figure 6C-E). This phenomenon is different from a shift in the cost-benefit balance of phenazines across environments, which we believe the reviewer is referring to here. Nevertheless, there remain parallels between the action of HGA and phenazines, which we highlight in our new Discussion section.</p><p>As mentioned in points 2, 3, and 4 above, we now present additional data in our revision investigating the mode of HGA inhibition and resistance. We show that HGA’s activity vs. <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is bacteriostatic in rich media, with population rebounds occurring after HGA becomes sufficiently oxidized and inactive (Figure 3). We also demonstrate that the density-dependence of resistance is separate from growth phase and is cell-intrinsic (Figure 6).</p><p>In our new experiments investigating the basis of resistance, we have ruled out several potential mechanisms including extracellular inactivation of HGA (Figure 6E), quorum sensing via <italic>lqsR</italic> (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B), stringent response pathway signaling via ppGpp (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C-D), and mass action effects through excess cellular material (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). We have also ruled out the possibility that HGA acts by generating extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), a mechanism that is typical for phenazines. Through these experiments, we have tested the most probable mechanisms of action and resistance for HGA. We believe that the fact that HGA does not behave according to many of these expectations (notably, expectations that were based primarily on precedents from phenazines) makes this activity even more interesting than we initially appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- An oxidative stress mechanism is asserted but not rigorously tested. What is the redox potential of HGA? What factors in the cell respond to it? The screen for resistance found a number of general-growth defects, but unfortunately, they don't shed much light on the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a fair point. The redox potential of HGA has been previously measured to be +0.636V (Eslami et al., 2013); we have now added this citation to our revision. Because these values can be altered by experimental conditions such as pH, we have also now quantified the ability of HGA to reduce cysteine in our experimental conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>Our data certainly demonstrate that only certain redox states of HGA are active (Figure 3), but they did not necessarily show that inhibition proceeds via oxidative stress. Indeed, our new finding that catalase does not protect from HGA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-C) shows that production of extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not involved. We have now been more precise with our wording to indicate this distinction.</p><p>In terms of our genetic screen for resistance to HGA, we do discuss two classes in detail in our revision. The first, most abundant class is that of genes involved in elongation factor P biology in translation. On the recommendation of reviewer 2, we investigate the stringent response pathway (because of its link to elongation factor P) but find it does not play a detectable role in HGA resistance. We also investigate <italic>lpg1681</italic>, a previously uncharacterized gene,and suggest that partial HGA resistance can result from altered regulation of periplasmic disulfide bonding. We note that all mutations we recovered in this second screen provided only partial resistance to HGA inactivation. Yet, we unexpectedly observe nearly complete phenotypic resistance to HGA when <italic>Lp</italic> cells are at high density. This phenotypic resistance is density dependent and cell intrinsic, but not dependent on inoculum growth phase or on activation of the stringent response or known quorum-sensing pathway. We believe it is these observations, along with our elucidation of the <italic>Lp</italic> population rebound in rich media, which elevate the impact of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Insufficient physiological description of state of cultures used in experiments (cell density/growth stage of inoculum?).

We have now added the information to the relevant sections including in the Materials and methods section. We have also provided data in Figure 6 demonstrating that the HGA susceptibility and resistance phenotypes in the rich media and PBS assays are robust across different inoculum growth stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Ecological relevance seems more asserted than supported by data.

We have now completely re-written the Discussion section to make it more focused in light of suggestions made by the reviewers.

By applying a logical series of genetic and biological assays, they also identified a previously uncharacterized locus that modulates bacterial sensitivity to the HGA pigment. The authors discuss their results within a provocative ecological framework, proposing that, by secreting the pigment in stationary phase, L. pneumophila restricts encroachment by competitor Legionella.</p><p>In general, the experiments are logical, quantitative, and well controlled, and the primary conclusions are supported by data provided. The value of the manuscript is to advance the scant literature on mechanisms of ecological fitness of L. pneumophila in aquatic environments, the source of transmission to humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for her positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ambiguity concerning growth phase vs cell density complicates independent interpretation and replication of the results, a weakness that can be corrected by editing and/or comparing directly log and stationary phase WT cells in their HGA-sensitivity assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her feedback and for the detailed suggestions. In keeping with these comments, we have now performed several additional experiments which we now summarize in Figure 6 in the revised version. These experiments decouple the growth phase from cell density, showing that resistance to HGA inhibition is both cell-intrinsic (see below), density-dependent, and independent of growth phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Cell density vs growth phase: Abstract, Results section, Discussion section; Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and elsewhere. L. pneumophila induce expression of multiple virulence and resilience traits upon entry into stationary phase, whereas exponential phase cells are more susceptible to killing by macrophages and a variety of environmental stresses (e.g. Molofsky and Swanson, 2004; Olivia et al., 2018). Accordingly, in experiments testing sensitivity of Legionella to HGA, clarify in Materials and methods section and relevant figure legends the growth phase of the cells that were challenged with HGA. Currently, the references to &quot;regulatory state&quot; (Discussion section) are vague and not tested directly here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions and citations. We have now added details about the cultures used to set up our experiments in the Materials and methods section. More importantly, we have added several new experiments in Figure 6 to show that across our assays, cell sensitivity to HGA correlates with cell density and does not depend on the growth phase of the inoculum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) HGA induces transient &quot;growth delay&quot;, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and Results section &quot;improvement in growth&quot;: Without knowing the growth phase of inocula used throughout this study, it is difficult to interpret the apparent prolonged lag phase of HGA-treated cells: Does HGA kill a large subset of the treated population, or instead delay entrance into the cell cycle for the entire population? If the latter, do you speculate that HGA loses activity or instead that the bacteria adapt to overcome the HGA block to replication?</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent points raised by the reviewer, which we now address in detail in the revision with several new experiments. In new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1, we now show multiple lines of evidence that HGA in rich media is bacteriostatic instead of bacteriocidal against <italic>Lp</italic>, and that the basis of recovery from the growth delay is not via genetic adaptation. Instead, multiple lines of evidence lead us to conclude that HGA auto-oxidation in rich media over time negates its inhibitory effects, and that <italic>Lp</italic> bacterial cells are able to recover and resume growth after HGA concentrations drop below inhibitory levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 Cell density protection, Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and Results section: Do cells need to be metabolically active to confer protection from HGA, or is this a biochemical effect of distributing the oxidative damage across more substrate – more surface area of stationary phase L. pneumophila cells? For example, do UV-inactivated bacteria protect a minority population of viable stationary phase cells? Related to #1, at high densities, are log phase cells also protected from HGA treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful suggestions, which we have gratefully used to motivate and perform new experiments. First, we show that in the PBS assay, both log and stationary phase cells are protected from HGA at high densities, but susceptible at low densities (new Figure 6C). We also find that high-density, heat-killed bacteria do not protect low-density live bacteria from HGA, suggesting that protection is not merely from abundant surface area or substrate (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). Finally, we find that the conditioned media from high-density cells exposed to HGA retains the activity to kill low-density cells, showing that the HGA is not inactivated or adsorbed out of solution in high-density conditions (Figure 6E). Based on these experiments, we conclude that high-density protection is a cell-intrinsic effect, rather than a biochemical one of HGA dilution or distribution across more cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Title and Discussion section, &quot;observed specificity&quot;: Whether HGA also inhibits non-Legionella bacteria is predicted from the Stewart et al., 2011 study of surfactant and implied here but is not tested directly. Also, this paragraph focuses on pigments, but cites Stewart et al., 2011 that only analyzes surfactant.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with this point. We have rephrased these sections to be more precise, and removed this section from the revised, refocused Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Translation mutants alter HGA susceptibility, Results section: Nam et al., 2016 reported that disruption of elongation factor P function induces the stringent response of Salmonella. Since the stringent response triggers entry of replicating L. pneumophila into stationary phase and the more resilient &quot;transmissive&quot; cell type (eg Molofsky and Swanson, 2004; Olivia et al., 2018), the authors may wish to comment on whether activation of the stringent response might account for the isolation of a large number of translation mutants in the screen for enhanced resistance to HGA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. We had not fully explored the potential link between elongation factor P and <italic>Legionella’s</italic> stringent response in our previous manuscript. We now discuss the stringent response in light of our resistant mutant screen. We also perform experiments with <italic>Lp</italic> bacteria strains with mutations in the stringent response pathway. However, we find that these mutations do not appear to alter HGA susceptibility or high-density resistance (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C-D). In the discussion, we note that the resistant mutants we have recovered in our screen show only partial resistance to HGA (Figure 5). Therefore, it is possible that high-density cells are able to fully resist HGA via another mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Levin et al. identify an important mechanism that Legionella pneumophila may employ to successfully compete in complex multispecies communities. Specifically, demonstrate that interbacterial competition between closely related Legionella species is mediated in part by the secretion of the inhibitory molecule homogentisic acid by L. pneumophila. This work is important as it reveals a novel mechanism this pathogen may use to thrive in the environment. They identify HGA as the inhibitory molecule using a random transposon mutagenesis approach and further characterize mutations that increase resistance to HGA in the producing strain. Cysteine is shown to protect cells from the toxic effects of HGA and the oxidized form of the molecule (HGA-melanin) is non-toxic, suggesting that redox activity of HGA is important for the mechanism of inhibition. The work is well done, and the manuscript is well written.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their generous comments!</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, you have done an outstanding job in responding to the first set of reviews, and this manuscript is on-track for acceptance in eLife. However, the reviewers made a few suggestions that are constructive, which you will likely want to incorporate into your final manuscript prior to publication. The goal here is to help you polish your work one last time, but not to add onerous new experiments. No additional new experimentation is required, but should you want to try one quick experiment independently suggested by reviewer 1 and reviewer 3, please go for it.</p><p>We look forward to receiving your final revised manuscript and processing it for publication shortly!</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much! We have elected to perform this experiment and discuss its new results below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The experiments with cysteine and transposon mutagenesis point toward disruption of disulfide bonds and/or cysteine reactivity as plausible mechanisms of toxicity (even if not the only mechanisms). One straightforward experiment that might be helpful in testing whether oxidative intermediates are responsible for HGA toxicity would be for the authors to expose the cells to HGA under anoxic conditions, followed by a wash and plating under oxic conditions (in comparison to exposure and plating under oxic conditions).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to both reviewer 1 and reviewer 3 for the great suggestion. We have now performed this experiment, exposing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> to HGA in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Instead of doing a wash, we immediately diluted the samples to plate CFUs in rich media, which we reasoned would dilute and/or inactivate the HGA below an active concentration. We found that HGA had little to no toxicity under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that the toxicity is indeed due to some of HGA’s transient oxidative intermediates. The results are now included in Figure 7B, and discussed briefly in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Levin et al., have modified their previous manuscript in response to earlier reviews. The focus is narrowed to highlight the role of HGA in inhibiting Legionella spp. and that resistance to this inhibition is density dependent the producing species, Lp. This inhibition is shown to be independent of secreted surfactants, disproving a hypothesis previously set forth in the field. The secreted inhibitory factor is identified as HGA using a clever genetic screen for transposon mutants, and HGA is later shown to be inhibitory at biologically relevant concentrations. They show that this inhibitory activity is due to HGA and that catalase was not protective suggesting that inhibition is not due to the production of H2O2 through side reactions. They further show evidence that HGA inhibition is bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal in Lp and perform a forward genetic selection to identify genes that allow for growth in the presence of HGA. Unsurprisingly, they identify many genes that likely have global effects, and focus on one gene that was mutated in a subset of the population. The authors speculate that periplasmic disulfide bond formation may be important to mediate the cellular response to HGA, but no direct evidence is given. This resistance response may be density, but not growth phase, dependent and cell-intrinsic.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s summary and appreciation for the work. We also agree that we have not definitively proved that HGA toxicity occurs via periplasmic disulfide bond disruption. This speculation was intended to help motivate future, follow-up work. We have modified the language in the Discussion section to make this distinction more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several new experiments strengthen this version of the manuscript and address many questions raised previously. While the authors are unable to identify a mechanism by which HGA inhibits cells or LP gains resistance, many &quot;obvious&quot; candidates are tested and determined to not play a role and it is likely that resistance mechanisms will have global cellular effects that are difficult to tease apart. This is an interesting first observation of the phenomenon and should be of interest to a broad group of scientists.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we agree that the phenomenon is interesting and striking.</p></body></sub-article></article>
