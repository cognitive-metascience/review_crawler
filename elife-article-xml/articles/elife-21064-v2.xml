(polycomb repressive complex 1) known as PCGF6-PRC1. Here, we demonstrate that PCGF6-PRC1 plays a role in repressing a subset of PRC1 target genes by recruiting RING1B and mediating downstream mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A. PCGF6-PRC1 bound loci are highly enriched for promoters of germ cell-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Conditional ablation of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> in ESCs leads to robust de-repression of such germ cell-related genes, in turn affecting cell growth and viability. We also find a role for PCGF6 in pre- and peri-implantation mouse embryonic development. We further show that a heterodimer of the transcription factors MAX and MGA recruits PCGF6 to target loci. PCGF6 thus links sequence specific target recognition by the MAX/MGA complex to PRC1-dependent transcriptional silencing of germ cell-specific genes in pluripotent stem cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21064.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21064.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>germ cells</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientist (B) (#25871129)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Endoh</surname><given-names>Mitsuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (#16K07372)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Endoh</surname><given-names>Mitsuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (#26112516)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Endoh</surname><given-names>Mitsuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (#24116711)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Endoh</surname><given-names>Mitsuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koseki</surname><given-names>Haruhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koseki</surname><given-names>Haruhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Basic Research Programs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koseki</surname><given-names>Haruhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PCGF6 links sequence specific target recognition by the MAX/MGA transcription factor complex to PRC1 (polycomb repressive complex 1) -dependent transcriptional silencing of germ cell-specific genes in mouse pluripotent stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved epigenetic repressors of developmental genes. PcG-mediated gene silencing involves at least two distinct enzymatic activities directed to histone tails: the first mediates Histone H2A mono-ubiquitination at K119 (H2AK119ub1) by the polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1), while the second mediates H3 tri-methylation at K27 (H3K27me3) by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). According to the canonical view, H3K27me3 deposition by the EZH1/2 (enhancer of zeste homologs 1 and 2) histone methyltransferases leads to binding of the H3K27me3-reader protein CBX2 (chromobox protein homolog 2), in turn facilitating sequential recruitment of canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, H2AK119ub1 deposition by the non-canonical PRC1 (ncPRC1) promotes downstream recruitment of PRC2 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>). Myriad other accessory molecules interact with both PRC1 and PRC2, conferring robustness and reversibility to PcG-mediated gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The molecular complexity underlying PcG-mediated gene silencing could be partly explained by the diversity of the PCGF factors (from PCGF1 to PCGF6) that directly associate with RING1A/B proteins. For example, canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) may include PCGF2 (also known as MEL18: melanoma nuclear protein 18) or PCGF4 (also known as Bmi1: B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1). These cPRC1 complexes can be further classified into specific sub-complexes according to their association with CBX (CBX2/4/6/7/8) or PHC (PHC1/2/3: polyhomeotic homologs 1, 2 and 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vandamme et al., 2011</xref>). CBX proteins contribute to recognition of H3K27me3, and therefore mediate recruitment of cPRC1 into target loci; while PHC proteins mediate gene compaction through polymerization of the SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain to facilitate transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isono et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Non-canonical PRC1 (ncPRC1) associates with PCGF1, PCGF3, PCGF5 or PCGF6 and RYBP (RING1 and YY1-binding protein) or YAF2 (YY1 Associated Factor 2), but does not interact with CBX2/4/6/7/8 or PHC1/2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to the core subunits RING1A/B and PCGF1, ncPRC1-containing PCGF1 (PCGF1-PRC1) also incorporates KDM2B [Lysine (K)-Specific Demethylase 2B], BCOR (BCL6 Corepressor), BCORL1 (BCL6 Corepressor-Like 1), RYBP, YAF2 and SKP1 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gearhart et al., 2006</xref>). Non-canonical PRC1 complexes are functionally linked with their canonical counterparts (cPRC1), and most of their target genes overlap with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>). These overlapping genes often possess unmethylated CpG islands (CGI) in their promoters, and these are preferentially bound by the CXXC (two cysteines separated by two other residues) domain of KDM2B via recognition of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). KDM2B binding to target genes allows direct recruitment of PCGF1-PRC1, followed by binding of PRC2 through recognition of H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>). As PRC2 further recruits cPRC1, non-canonical PCGF1-PRC1 can therefore activate the PRC2-cPRC1 axis to ensure robust transcriptional silencing of developmental genes that harbor unmethylated CGIs.</p><p>Another PCGF homolog, PCGF6, was first identified in a multimeric protein complex associated with the E2F6 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>). This complex was annotated as PCGF6-PRC1, and was shown to form stable complexes with several other well-known epigenetic factors such as RING1A/B, PCGF6, L3MBTL2 [lethal(3)malignant brain tumor-like 2], RYBP, YAF2, G9A (also known as EHMT2: euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2), GLP (G9a-like protein 1, also known as EHMT1), and CBX1/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kloet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trojer et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, PCGF6-PRC1 also interacts with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as E2F6, MAX, MGA and TFDP1 (transcription factor Dp-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kloet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trojer et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that such DNA binding proteins could play a role in sequence specific recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 to target loci; however, this notion has not been experimentally validated.</p><p>In this study, we therefore purified the PCGF6-PRC1 complex and examined the contribution of PCGF6 to ESC maintenance and embryonic development. We demonstrate that PCGF6 mediates repression of target genes by recruiting RING1B and facilitating H2AK119ub1. Taking advantage of a <italic>Pcgf6</italic> conditional allele, we show that PCGF6 and RING1B common targets are enriched for meiosis- and germ cell-related genes in ESCs, and that such genes are robustly de-repressed in the absence of PCGF6 (<italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO). Importantly, silencing of germ cell-related genes by PCGF6 likely plays a role in proliferation and growth of ESCs.

We finally confirmed EZH2 or SET1 were not co-IPed with either FLAG-PCGF6 or FLAG-RING1B.

CBX7-bound genes were mostly co-occupied by RING1B, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). PCGF6 target sites, however, exhibited only a limited overlap with CBX7, supporting the model in which PCGF6 is predominantly involved in ncPRC1.</p><p>To gain insight into the binding profile of PCGF6 at target genes, we plotted PCGF6, RING1B, CBX7, MAX, KDM2B and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq reads in a ±4 kb region surrounding TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This analysis revealed that PCGF6 bound in close proximity to TSS, unlike RING1B, CBX7 and H3K27me3, all of which exhibited a broader distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We observed considerable association of MAX at PCGF6 targets irrespective of RING1B binding. In contrast, H3K27me3 deposition at PCGF6 targets was mainly seen at RING1B-bound genes. We also noted that PCGF6 target genes harbor CGIs that tend to be slightly shorter and more methylated than CBX7 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistently, PCGF6 targets were bound by KDM2B. KDM2B loss induced a subtle increase of RING1B binding at PCGF6 targets while RING1B binding at CBX7 targets was marginally decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

To gain insight into the association of PCGF6 and RING1B for gene regulation, we divided RING1B- or PCGF6-bound genes into three categories (PCGF6+RING1B+, PCGF6-RING1B+ and PCGF6+RING1B-) and examined their expression in WT ESCs using FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped sequence reads) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This analysis showed that the PCGF6+RING1B+ genes were barely transcribed in WT ESCs; likewise, the PCGF6-RING1B+ genes were marginally expressed. In contrast, the PCGF6+RING1B- group that harbors CGIs was robustly expressed. We went on to examine changes of respective gene expression levels in each category in the absence of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> (<italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left). We found both PCGF6+RING1B+ and PCGF6-RING1B+ genes were significantly up-regulated while expression levels of PCGF6+RING1B- or PCGF6-RING1B- genes were barely altered in <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left). We however also found that expression levels of highly up-regulated genes (more than 5-times; indicated by red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in the PCGF6+RING1B+ category were considerably higher than those in the PCGF6-RING1B+ category in <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO ESCs. Those categories were also up-regulated in <italic>Ring1A/B</italic>-dKO ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right), suggesting a functional link between PCGF6 and RING1A/B for down-regulation of such genes.

Previous reports have demonstrated that mutations of RING1B residue I53 (i.e., I53S or I53A), abrogated its E3 ligase activity by disrupting its interactions with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH5C (also known as UBE2D3: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Saadon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Endoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>). Rescuing the <italic>Ring1A/B</italic>-dKO cells with the I53 mutants failed to maintain transcriptional repression, demonstrating that repression of PCGF6 target genes depends on the catalytic activity of RING1B and likely also downstream H2AK119ub1 deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Since our previous report demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 plays a critical role for recruitment of PRC2 and downstream H3K27me3 deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>), we thus investigated H3K27me3 deposition at the representative PCGF6 bound genes, and indeed found a significant H3K27me3 enrichment at these targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As expected, the H3K27me3 level was markedly reduced in the absence of the key PRC2 component EED (embryonic ectoderm development), confirming that H3K27me3 deposition in these genes is mediated by the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We indeed found a considerable reduction in H3K27me3 level at these PCGF6-PRC1 targets in <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO ESCs, but only marginally at cPRC1 targets, suggesting a potential role for PCGF6-mediated H2AK119ub1 to recruit PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riising et al., 2014</xref>), PRC2<italic>-</italic>mediated mechanisms exhibited only limited impact on the repression of PCGF6-PRC1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PCGF6 recruits RING1B to target genes and facilitates downstream H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 deposition</title><p>Previous studies have reported that PCGF6 interacts with RING1B through its RING finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akasaka et al., 2002</xref>). Given that PCGF6 loss led to a marked reduction in H2AK119ub1 deposition specifically at PCGF6-PRC1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we wondered whether PCGF6 is directly involved in recruitment of RING1B and its catalytic activity. To test this model, we expressed a PCGF6 protein fused to the TET repressor (PCGF6/TETR), and ectopically tethered this fusion protein to a pre-integrated TetO array in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), taking advantage of an experimental system that we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>).

This experiment demonstrated that RING1B binding to PCGF6-PRC1 target genes such as <italic>Tex19.1</italic>, <italic>Tdrkh</italic>, <italic>Syce1</italic> (synaptonemal complex central element protein 1) and <italic>Mael</italic> (maelstrom spermatogenic transposon silencer) was indeed considerably depleted in the absence of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, RING1B binding to cPRC1 target sites, such as the <italic>Hoxb</italic> cluster, was unaffected.</p><p>To determine the role of PCGF6 in RING1B recruitment at ncPRC1 targets in a comprehensive manner, we divided RING1B-bound genes into four categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The first category consisted of genes bound by RING1B but not PCGF6 or CBX7 (PCGF6-CBX7-RING1B+). Genes in the second category were bound by both PCGF6 and RING1B, but not CBX7 (PCGF6+CBX7-RING1B+); and therefore represented the core targets of the non-canonical PCGF6-PRC1 complex. The third category consisted of the cPRC1 target genes, which were bound by CBX7 and RING1B, but not PCGF6 (PCGF6-CBX7+RING1B+). Finally, the fourth category was marked by all three factors (PCGF6+CBX7+RING1B+). We observed considerable reduction of RING1B binding to the core PCGF6-PRC1 target genes (PCGF6+CBX7-RING1B+) in <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO (green dot plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left; green lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). In contrast, cPRC1 target genes (PCGF6-CBX7+RING1B+) were not affected. Consistent with these observations, genetic ablation of <italic>Pcgf2</italic> (<italic>Mel18</italic>) and <italic>Pcgf4</italic> (<italic>Bmi1</italic>), both of which are essential components of the cPRC1 complex, led to reduction of RING1B binding of only cPRC1 target genes (PCGF6-CBX7+RING1B+) (blue dot plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left; blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). These observations were further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR for selected target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that PCGF6 preferentially recruits RING1B to PCGF6-PRC1 targets, but not to cPRC1 targets.</p><p>To determine whether PCGF6-dependent RING1B recruitment involved direct physical interactions between these two proteins, we tested a PCGF6 mutant with an amino acid substitution (H155Y) in a conserved residue critical for interaction with RING1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>). We expressed the mutant in <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO ESCs, and noted that it indeed failed to interact with RING1B, while retaining the ability to associate with L3MBTL2 and MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that although the mutant PCGF6 could bind the indicated target genes, it failed to recruit RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and, as a result, H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 marks were also not established in the target genes. Consistent with this interpretation, the mutant PCGF6 failed to repress PCGF6-PRC1 targets genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations, we concluded that PCGF6 contributes to the assembly and recruitment of the PCGF6-PRC1 complex by direct physical interactions with RING1B, which likely plays a critical role to mediate the repression. Previous and these studies, however, suggest potential involvement of other mechanisms, such as L3MBTL2, G9A/GLP and CBX1/3 for the repression by PCGF6-PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trojer et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we noted that PCGF6 was dispensable for L3MBTL2 binding of gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As L3MBTL2 has been reported as a recruiter of ncPRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trojer et al., 2011</xref>), this observation suggests that PCGF6 and L3MBTL2 may function in parallel to recruit ncPRC1 complexes. We went on to examine contribution of H3K9me2, which is mediated by G9A/GLP, for PCGF6-PRC1-target repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Unlike <italic>L3mbtl2</italic>-KO ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), we did not observe considerable changes in H3K9me2 levels in <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO. Together, we suggest that the L3MBTL2/G9A axis is marginally involved in PCGF6-mediated repression. We further investigated the role of CBX1/3 for the regulation of PCGF6-PRC1 targets by using tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Cbx1</italic> and <italic>Cbx3</italic> double knockout (<italic>Cbx1/3</italic>-dKO) ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We did not observe a significant change in the expression levels of PCGF6+CBX7-RING1B+ in <italic>Cbx1/3</italic>-dKO ESCs, suggesting that CBX1/3 have, if any, a marginal role for the repression of PCGF6-PRC1 targets in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The MAX/MGA heterodimer is required for recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 to target genes</title><p>The above results establish a role for PCGF6 in the recruitment of RING1B, however, the mechanism by which PCGF6-PRC1 is targeted to such loci is not understood.

For this purpose, we stably expressed a FLAG-tagged PCGF6 in WT or <italic>Eed</italic>-KO ESCs (deficient for H3K27me3), and compared PCGF6-binding levels at target genes. We did not observe any significant differences in FLAG-PCGF6 binding between WT and <italic>Eed</italic>-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that H3K27me3 is dispensable for locus-specific recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1. Consistently, H2AK119ub1 levels at genes bound by PCGF6 were not affected in the <italic>Eed</italic>-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, PCGF2, a component of cPRC1, barely associates with PCGF6 targets irrespective of H3K27me3 status, while it strongly associates with cPRC1 targets such as <italic>Zic1</italic> and <italic>Hoxb3</italic> in an EED-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings suggests that the H3K27me3-dependent pathway to recruit cPRC1 is barely active at PCGF6-PRC1 targets.</p><p>To determine the molecular mechanism that mediates recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 to target loci, we surveyed the DNA sequences of PCGF6-bound promoters to extract potential transcription factor binding motifs. We observed enrichment of the E-box motif CACGTG, a DNA sequence that is recognized by the bHLH-containing transcription factors including MAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991</xref>), within these promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, this motif was not enriched in RING1B- or CBX7-bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that the E-box motif is a feature of PCGF6-PRC1 targets. Consistent with this notion, we observed considerable overlap between PCGF6-bound and MAX-bound genes, while the overlap between PCGF6-bound and MYC-bound genes was much less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, MGA, a transcription factor that also forms a heterodimer with MAX and binds the CACGTG E-box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurlin et al., 1999</xref>), is included in the PCGF6 complex determined by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kloet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trojer et al., 2011</xref>).

To determine the impact of MAX or MGA depletion, we performed RNA-seq in <italic>Max</italic>-KD or <italic>Mga</italic>-KD ESCs. Interestingly, genes that were bound by MAX, PCGF6 and RING1B (MAX+PCGF6+RING1B+) showed significant up-regulation in <italic>Max</italic>-KD or <italic>Mga</italic>-KD ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Intriguingly, we observed significant up-regulation of genes bound only by RING1B (MAX-PCGF6-RING1B+). We however also noted that the expression level of up-regulated genes in this category was considerably lower compared to MAX+PCGF6+RING1B+ genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We thus suggest MAX and MGA primarily contribute to the repression of MAX+PCGF6+RING1B+ genes. GO analysis revealed that genes bound by PCGF6, RING1B and MAX but not by MYC (PCGF6+RING1B+MAX+MYC-), were significantly enriched in germ cell- and meiosis-related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), further supporting our model that PCGF6-PRC1 functions as a dedicated repressor of genes associated with germ cells and meiosis.</p><p>We investigated whether binding of PCGF6-PRC1 to gene promoters required MAX and its cofactor MGA. Indeed, ChIP-qPCR in the <italic>Max</italic>-KD or <italic>Mga</italic>-KD ESCs revealed that PCGF6 binding to target loci depends on MAX and MGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, MAX and MGA bind these targets in mutually dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that MAX and MGA may form a dimer to bind to their targets. We further used a previously reported <italic>Max-</italic>KO ES cell line to test MAX-dependent recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hishida et al., 2011</xref>). RING1B and RYBP, which form stoichiometric complexes with PCGF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), did not bind to PCGF6-PRC1 target loci in the <italic>Max-</italic>KO ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Likewise, local H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 levels were considerably decreased, and binding of L3MBTL2, another key regulator of ncPRC1, into PCGF6-PRC1 target genes was also depleted in the <italic>Max-</italic>KO ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, enrichment of RING1B, H2AK119ub1, H3K27me3 and RYBP at <italic>Zic1</italic>, a cPRC1 target, did not show considerable changes in the <italic>Max</italic>-KO ESCs. These results suggest that recruitment of both PCGF6 and L3MBTL2 requires MAX. We finally checked whether the decreased binding of PCGF6 is not due to secondary effects of transcriptional activation upon MAX depletion. We have selected genes bound by MAX and PCGF6, which were not up-regulated in <italic>Max</italic>-KO ESCs, and confirmed MAX-dependent binding of PCGF6 at these targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

These observations demonstrate a role of the MAX/MGA heterodimer in recruiting PCGF6-PRC1 by direct DNA motif recognition for maintenance of ESCs. To further examine this model, we expressed MAX/TETR, and ectopically tethered this fusion protein to a pre-integrated TetO array in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

These data again support MAX-dependent recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1. The limited effect of MAX/TETR to recruit PCGF6 could be due to a potential dimerization of MAX with other partners than MGA in this experimental setup.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>PCGF6-PRC1 is required for maintenance of ESCs and epiLCs in an undifferentiated state</title><p>Given that MAX and PCGF6 interact with each other, and that genetic ablation of <italic>Max</italic> causes reduced cell growth and germ cell-directed differentiation of ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hishida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>), we wondered whether knocking out <italic>Pcgf6</italic> would also lead to similar phenotypes. Indeed, the growth rate of <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO ESCs was significantly slower than the WT in the presence of three inhibitors (3i: SU5402 for FGFR, PD184352 for ERK, and CHIR99021 for GSK3) and fetal bovine serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

Unlike the <italic>Max</italic>-KO, however, <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-KO ESCs maintained an ESC-like morphology.

We therefore examined the impact of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> deletion in primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), which already express such germ cell-related genes. We induced the PGCLCs via epiblast-like cells (epiLCs), using an in vitro culture system that we have previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, we cultured the ESCs in 2i-containing (MAPK inhibitor and GSK3 inhibitor) media without feeders for 3 days (from day −5 to day −2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and induced epiLC by adding Activin A and bFGF into the media for 2 days (from day −2 to day 0). We further differentiated the epiLCs into the germ cell-lineage by adding BMPs, SCF, LIF, and EGF for 6 days (from day 0 to day 6). Genetic ablation of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> at day −5 induced growth arrest and cell death of ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); while ablation of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> at day −2 caused significant growth defects in epiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), revealing a stage-specific role of PCGF6 for growth and survival of ESCs and epiLCs. In contrast, OHT-treatment at day +2 (post-epiLC stage) did not induce growth arrest or cell death and, surprisingly, even accelerated differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>The disparate effects of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> ablation in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs raised the question of whether the PCGF6 targets in these cell types are different. We therefore performed RNA-seq before and after knocking out <italic>Pcgf6</italic> in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We observed that the same group of genes (the PCGF6+RING1B+ category in ESCs) were de-repressed in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs in the absence of <italic>Pcgf6</italic>. Furthermore, the extent of derepression of PCGF6 target genes was also similar among these three cell types. We observed similar trends for meiosis- and germ cell-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, right). Thus, these results indicate that the different phenotypic impacts of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> ablation in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs are not due to up-regulation of different sets of genes, but rather suggest that PCGF6-PRC1-mediated gene silencing is essential to maintain ESC and epiLC, but not PGCLC. PCGF6, therefore, plays a role in maintaining pluripotency, likely by suppressing germ cell potential in ESCs.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21064.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pleiotropic effects of PCGF6 loss during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>Pcgf6</italic> locus, the targeting vector, and the constitutive mutant allele.

As ESCs could not be established from <italic>Pcgf6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> lines, we surmised that <italic>Pcgf6</italic>-deficient ICMs are functionally different from their WT counterparts. Collectively, these results reveal a role for PCGF6 in both pre- and peri-implantation development.</p><p>A role of cPRC1 in the regulation of anterior-posterior (A-P) specification of the axial skeleton is well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akasaka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isono et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). Given the essential role of PCGF6 in the PCGF6-PRC1 complex, we therefore asked whether <italic>Pcgf6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice also exhibited defects in A-P specification. Intriguingly, we observed morphological alterations of the vertebrae that represent anterior transformations of the axis in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). To further confirm the role of PCGF6 for A-P patterning, we then tested the impacts of PCGF6 over-expression and, indeed, observed posterior transformations of the axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

PCGF6 physically interacts with RING1B, and plays a role in recruitment of RING1B to target genes, followed by deposition of H2AK119ub1 and transcriptional silencing. We have previously reported that the PCGF1-associated ncPRC1 (PCGF1-PRC1) recruits PRC2 to target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that PCGF6-PRC1 also has a similar role, as ectopic targeting of a PCGF6 protein fused to the Tet repressor (PCGF6/TETR) to a pre-integrated TetO array leads to sequential binding of RING1B, H2AK119ub1 deposition and PRC2 recruitment in cis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PCGF6-PRC1 target genes are different from those of PCGF1-PRC1 and canonical PRC1</title><p>Like PCGF1-PRC1, PCGF6-PRC1-mediated targeting of PRC2 also takes place in endogenous genomic loci, in particular at promoters of a certain group of genes that are enriched for germ cell-specific and meiosis-specific functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, these genes are distinct from those bound by PCGF1-PRC1 and canonical PRC1, which mainly include developmental genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>). Such developmental genes are evolutionarily conserved targets of PcG complexes, and are characterized by long CpG island (CGI) promoters that are usually not marked by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>). The CXXC domain containing protein KDM2B recruits PCGF1-PRC1 into these loci by binding unmethylated CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, PCGF6-PRC1 target loci tend to have slightly shorter and more DNA methylated CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), where KDM2B seems to play distinct roles from PCGF1-PRC1. Indeed, H3K27me3 depositions at PCGF6-PRC1 targets are less active to recruit cPRC1 though underlying mechanisms await elucidative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, our findings reveal that there are at least two major modes of gene silencing by PRC1; the first involves PCGF1-PRC1 and cPRC1 and silences developmental genes, while the second involves PCGF6-PRC1 and silences germ cell-specific and meiosis-specific genes (see the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21064.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Our model for the role of PCGF6-PRC1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation for two major modes of gene silencing by PRC1.

We further show that transcriptional silencing of such genes requires the function of RING1B and H2AK119ub1, but not PRC2 and H3K27me3. PCGF6-bound genes are enriched for short CGIs, frequently marked by methylated DNA, and are not bound by PCGF1-PRC1. Indeed, developmental genes, which are the main targets of PCGF1-PRC1, are not bound by PCGF6-PRC1, revealing distinct functional roles of these two ncPRC1 complexes. Consistent with this model, PCGF6-PRC1 is recruited to target sites by the MAX/MGA heterodimer, while PCGF1-PRC1 is recruited by the unmethylated CpG binding protein KDM2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robb Krumlauf as a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Giacomo Cavalli (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study presents an interesting investigation into the role of the PRC1 cofactor PCGF6 in PRC1-mediated gene silencing. Following up on the recent characterization of non-canonical PRC1 sub-complexes the authors investigate the function of one such sub-complex containing the PCGF6 protein. They present data suggesting that PCGF6 is involved in the recruitment of non-canonical PRC1 to a subset of genes that encode germ cell regulators. Mechanistically, they propose that recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 is mediated by MAX/MGA transcription factors.</p><p>Although the subject of the study is important in the field of Polycomb biology, the data presented lack clear evidence for a role of MAX in recruitment. It remains mostly correlative and does not provide direct evidence that MAX/MGA transcription factors recruit PCGF6-PRC1. There are a number of other concerns, controls and clarifications that need to be addressed in a revision before the study can be considered for publication.</p><p>1) A major concern of the work is that the evidence for a role of MAX in specifying PCGF6-PRC1 recruitment is overstated. Motifs enriched within PCGF6 binding sites are not exclusive to MAX. The effects of MAX knockdown on gene expression and observations based on the DNA-binding mutant of MAX do not rule out an indirect mode of action. There is no demonstration direct MAX-mediated recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 with the enforced tethering system used in the study. The mass spectrometry data uncover an interaction with MGA, but not MAX. Hence, one of the major conclusions of the study is not adequately demonstrated by the data presented in the manuscript. The authors must demonstrate direct MAX-mediated recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 with the enforced tethering system or alternative approach. If a Tet-MAX can recruit the PCGF6 ncPRC1 complex this would support their conclusions.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, it would help if a control Flag-Strep ChIP seq (i.e. of an FS2-empty vector cell line) is included alongside the FS2-Pcgf6 ChIP seq to understand the background signal in the experiment. This would ensure that all of the Pcgf6 signal shown is real. The reason for this is that sequencing of input chromatin alone often shows weak enrichment at transcription start sites relative to other regions of chromatin. Therefore, this requested control ChIP-seq would eliminate any doubt about the signal shown for FS2 tagged Pcgf6.</p><p>3) A suggestion to improve the paper would be to move the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-I</xref> to the main figures as this data unequivocally shows the biological importance of Pcgf6. The developmental defects identified in the absence of Pcgf6 in vivo are much starker than the in vitro differentiation defects currently featured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>4) In the subsection “PCGF6 forms complexes with PRC1 components”, the authors purify the PCGF6-PRC1 complex and report copurification of CBX1 and CBX3 (HP1) proteins. This is an intriguing result that could link this complex to H3K9me3 and heterochromatin. Later, they confirm the presence of L3MBTL2 at GF6-PRC1 target genes. In the second paragraph of the subsection “PCGF6 recruits RING1B to target genes and facilitates downstream H2K119ub1 deposition” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors show ChIP-seq of RING1B in WT and Pcgf6-KO ESCs. In light of the presence of HP1 proteins (as well as G9a and GLP, at least following Ogawa et al. 2002) in the PCGF6-PRC1 complex, it would be really important to perform ChIP-seq of H3K9me2 in the same condition. Likewise, KD of CBX1 and CBX3 followed by RT-PCR would help understand whether K9me2-HP1 repressive chromatin does contribute to silencing of PCGF6-PRC1 target genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21064.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Although the subject of the study is important in the field of Polycomb biology, the data presented lack clear evidence for a role of MAX in recruitment.

Although we failed to detect MAX in our mass spec analysis, we found a considerable association of MAX with FLAG-PCGF6 by IP-immunoblotting with several negative controls as shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. In addition, we further showed co-existence of MAX with PCGF6 mainly at PCGF6-bound genes irrespective of RING1B binding as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>. We further confirmed the enforced tethering of PCGF6 efficiently brought MAX as shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><p>Upon the request, we further examined whether the enforced tethering of MAX could recruit PCGF6-PRC1. We expressed MAX/TETR and ectopically tethered this fusion protein to a pre-integrated TetO array in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). ChIP-qPCR analysis showed binding of the MAX/TETR fusion protein at the TetO array, which accompanies mild enrichments of HA-tagged PCGF6, H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>) while barely RING1B (data not shown). These data again support MAX-dependent recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 though its impact is limited in this experimental setup. We guess this limited effect of MAX/TETR to recruit PCGF6 could be due to a potential dimerization of MAX with other partners than MGA in this experimental setup. We revised the main text (subsection “Interactions between MAX and PCGF6 play a role in ESC maintenance”, last paragraph) accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, it would help if a control Flag-Strep ChIP seq (i.e. of an FS2-empty vector cell line) is included alongside the FS2-Pcgf6 ChIP seq to understand the background signal in the experiment. This would ensure that all of the Pcgf6 signal shown is real. The reason for this is that sequencing of input chromatin alone often shows weak enrichment at transcription start sites relative to other regions of chromatin. Therefore, this requested control ChIP-seq would eliminate any doubt about the signal shown for FS2 tagged Pcgf6.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We included a control Flag ChIP-seq data (obtained from a Flag-empty vector cell line) alongside the Flag-PCGF6 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> (shown as NC) to ensure the Flag-PCGF6 signal shown is real.</p><p><italic>3) A suggestion to improve the paper would be to move the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-I</xref> to the main figures as this data unequivocally shows the biological importance of Pcgf6. The developmental defects identified in the absence of Pcgf6</italic> in vivo <italic>are much starker than the</italic> in vitro <italic>differentiation defects currently featured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate your suggestion and moved these figures to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the revised version.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “PCGF6 forms complexes with PRC1 components”, the authors purify the PCGF6-PRC1 complex and report copurification of CBX1 and CBX3 (HP1) proteins. This is an intriguing result that could link this complex to H3K9me3 and heterochromatin. Later, they confirm the presence of L3MBTL2 at GF6-PRC1 target genes. In the second paragraph of the subsection “PCGF6 recruits RING1B to target genes and facilitates downstream H2K119ub1 deposition” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors show ChIP-seq of RING1B in WT and Pcgf6-KO ESCs. In light of the presence of HP1 proteins (as well as G9a and GLP, at least following Ogawa et al. 2002) in the PCGF6-PRC1 complex, it would be really important to perform ChIP-seq of H3K9me2 in the same condition. Likewise, KD of CBX1 and CBX3 followed by RT-PCR would help understand whether K9me2-HP1 repressive chromatin does contribute to silencing of PCGF6-PRC1 target genes.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your important suggestion. We performed ChIP-seq for H3K9me2 and the summary of data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>. Unlike L3mbtl2-KO ESCs (Qin et al., 2012), we did not observe considerable changes in H3K9me2 levels in Pcgf6-KO. Consistent with this we also showed L3MBTL2 bound to the targets in Pcgf6-KO. We suggest L3MBTL2/G9A axis acts in parallel with PCGF6/RING1 pathway within the same complexes. Indeed, we also found L3MBTL2 bound to the targets in MAX-dependent manner. MAX/MGA heterodimer likely recruit PCGF6 and L3MBTL2 mutually independently as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>We also performed RNA-seq analysis of Cbx1/3-double knockout (dKO) ESCs to investigate the role of CBX1/3 for the regulation of PCGF6-PRC1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We did not observe a significant change in the expression levels of PCGF6+CBX7-RING1B+ in Cbx1/3-dKO ESCs, suggesting CBX1/3 have, if any, a marginal role for the repression of PCGF6-PRC1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>We revised the main text (subsection “PCGF6 recruits RING1B to target genes and facilitates downstream H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 deposition”, last paragraph) accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
