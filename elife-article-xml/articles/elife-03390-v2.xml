To understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining satellite cell quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were among the most significantly changed and included the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3′ untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates Tristetraprolin, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of Tristetraprolin precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03390.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03390.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03390.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When muscles are damaged, they can repair themselves to some extent by making new muscle cells. These develop from groups of cells called satellite cells, which are found near the surface of muscle fibers. Once the muscle is injured, the satellite cells are activated and can divide to form two cells with different properties. One remains a satellite cell, while the other forms a ‘myoblast’ that eventually fuses into a mature muscle fiber. Under normal conditions the satellite cells remain in a dormant state and do not divide, but it is not clear how they maintain this dormant state.</p><p>To create a protein, the gene that encodes it is first ‘transcribed’ to produce a molecule called mRNA, which is then used as a template to build the protein. A protein called Tristetraprolin (TTP) can bind to mRNA molecules and cause them to break down or decay, and so TTP can prevent the mRNA from being used to make a protein.</p><p>Hausburg, Doles et al. analyzed satellite cells from uninjured muscle and compared them with those from injured tissue. This revealed that when injured, the satellite cells reduced the abundance of several mRNAs, including TTP. Further investigation found that in satellite cells from uninjured tissue, TTP causes the decay of mRNA molecules that are used to produce a protein called MyoD. As MyoD helps the satellite cells to specialize, this decay therefore prevents the formation of myoblasts and keeps the satellite cells in a dormant state. In contrast, damage to the muscle tissue activates a signaling pathway that ultimately inactivates TTP. This enables more of the MyoD protein to be made and the myoblast population to expand.</p><p>When Hausburg, Doles et al. experimentally reduced the levels of TTP inside satellite cells, the cells developed into myoblasts even when the tissue was uninjured. Thus, TTP is an important regulator that allows satellite cells to remain in a dormant state. In dormant adult stem cells, regulation of protein availability by RNA binding proteins, such as TTP, may co-ordinate rapid changes in metabolic state to promptly repair injured tissue. A major challenge will be to identify the group of proteins involved and determine the precise mechanisms involved in regulating their availability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03390.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03390.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG GMC111896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lykke-Andersen</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM077243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olwin</surname><given-names>Bradley B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR039467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olwin</surname><given-names>Bradley B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR04996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olwin</surname><given-names>Bradley B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein Tristetraprolin promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA to maintain satellite cell quiescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are maintained as a quiescent stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schultz, 1976</xref>) possessing minimal cytoplasm, condensed chromatin, and few ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wakayama et al., 1979</xref>). Upon muscle injury, SCs activate and then enter S-phase to generate a proliferating myoblast population that differentiates, repairs skeletal muscle tissue, and self-renews to replenish the stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornelison et al., 2001</xref>). Induction of MyoD, a myogenic regulatory transcription factor, is a critical component of this activation cascade. Prior to MyoD induction, and immediately upon satellite cell activation, the p38α/β MAPK pathway is activated, serving as a molecular switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). In a subset of SCs, p38α/β is asymmetrically activated during cell division to promote SC self-renewal and re-acquisition of quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Troy et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, aged SCs exhibit an intrinsic self-renewal deficit that arises in part from a failure to asymmetrically activate p38α/β MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms, including translational repression, contribute to SC activation and play a key role in the maintenance of the quiescent SC state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crist et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>TTP (Tristetraprolin), a target of the p38α/β MAPK pathway, binds to AU-rich elements within the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target transcripts and recruits deadenylases, initiating mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2000</xref>). Rates of mRNA decay, which fluctuate depending on cellular conditions, are controlled by specialized mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) that bind target mRNAs and activate cellular mRNA decay enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parker and Song, 2004</xref>). TTP is the best studied of the four member Tis11 gene family, which is comprised of the genes: <italic>Zfp36</italic> (TTP), <italic>Zfp36l1</italic>, <italic>Zfp36l2</italic> and <italic>Zfp36l3</italic>. In macrophages, TTP suppresses the inflammation response by destabilizing proinflammatory mRNAs until extracellular stimuli activate p38α/β MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stumpo et al., 2010</xref>). The p38α/β MAPK signaling pathway then phosphorylates TTP, promoting association with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins and blocking the recruitment of deadenylases, thereby stabilizing transcripts with TTP 3′ UTR binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clement et al., 2011</xref>). TTP loss-of-function has profound effects on overall organismal health and is associated with a severe inflammatory syndrome caused by chronic over-expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)α mRNA, as loss of TNF receptor function largely rescues TTP KO phenotypes in TTP/TNFR1/2 triple knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carballo et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Transcripts encoding TTP family members are among the fastest declining and dynamically regulated mRNAs following SC activation, where the transcripts initially decline and then are re-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farina et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we identified the MyoD 3′ UTR as a TTP substrate, and show that p38α/β MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of TTP regulates MyoD mRNA decay, thereby regulating SC activation. Therefore our data, combined with recent reports of miRNA-mediated regulation of SC quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crist et al., 2012</xref>), identify post-transcriptional gene regulation as an effective and potent means of maintaining SC homeostasis in adult skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins decrease in activated SCs</title><p>Transitioning from a quiescent SC to an activated SC involves large-scale changes in mRNA expression as well as changes in miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farina et al., 2012</xref>) and subsequent events that permit SCs to begin DNA synthesis and proliferate as myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). To identify regulators involved in SC activation and myoblast commitment, we compared restricted gene expression profiles of FACS-enriched SCs isolated from uninjured muscle with expression profiles from SCs isolated 12 hr post-injury from wild type and <italic>Syndecan 4</italic> (<italic>Sdc4</italic>)<sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farina et al., 2012</xref>). Syndecan-4 null SCs are incapable of muscle repair, exhibit severely delayed activation, aberrant MyoD expression, poor growth kinetics, fail to self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cornelison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2010</xref>) and thus, transcripts differentially expressed between wildtype and <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> SCs may represent genes involved in SC activation and commitment. Genes unique to wild type SCs that change expression 12 hr post muscle injury but do not change in <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> SC are referred to as the ‘WT-S4 gene list’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplemental file 1A,1B</xref>). An unexpectedly high percentage of genes in this list decreased in expression during SC activation (47%), with ‘nucleic acid binding: RNA binding,’ (GO:0003723; p-value = 8.7e-05) as the most significantly overrepresented gene ontology (GO) term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Among these rapidly down-regulated transcripts are genes encoding mRNA destabilizing proteins and genes implicated in cell cycle entry of quiescent C2C12 cells following methylcellulose-induced G0 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sachidanandan et al., 2002</xref>). One of these decay factors, Z<italic>fp36</italic>, which encodes TTP, declines precipitously upon wild type SC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Additionally, transcripts for two other TTP family members, <italic>Zfp36l1</italic> and <italic>Zfp36l2</italic>, which encode Brf1 and Brf2, respectively, also decrease during SC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the minority of transcripts that are up-regulated upon SC activation are genes with known roles in myogenesis, including <italic>Elavl1</italic>, which encodes HuR, a MyoD mRNA-stabilizing protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figueroa et al., 2003</xref>), consistent with the induction of MyoD, which occurs as early as 3 hr following isolation of myofiber-associated SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cornelison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03390.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins are differentially regulated during SC activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram illustrating subtraction strategy used to obtain the WT-S4 gene list.

Any skeletal muscle perturbation such as induced injury or immediate dissection following sacrifice, activates SCs and p38α/β MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>), which in other cell types, phosphorylates and stabilizes TTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tchen et al., 2004</xref>).

We observed concurrent downregulation of MyoD in the MK2i treated SCs, suggesting that TTP may play a role in p38α/β MAPK-mediated MyoD regulation.</p><p>The rapid p38α/β MAPK-dependent phosphorylation (inactivation) of TTP upon SC activation suggests that TTP plays a role in maintaining SC quiescence. Furthermore, TTP inactivation preceding MyoD up-regulation is consistent with the hypothesis that TTP actively suppresses pro-myogenic mRNA targets. We therefore transfected myofiber-associated SCs with a constitutively active TTP mutant, TTP<sub>S52AS178A</sub> (TTP-AA-myc), to determine if direct manipulation of TTP influenced MyoD protein levels. TTP-AA-myc is unresponsive to p38α/β MAPK signaling, binds target transcripts, recruits mRNA decay factors, and reduces target mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stoecklin et al., 2004</xref>). Myofiber-associated SCs transfected with either a control (pcDNA3.1) or a TTP-AA-myc expression plasmid immediately following explant were fixed and scored for Syndecan-4 and MyoD immunoreactivity after 30 hr in culture. The majority (70%) of control transfected cells were MyoD immunoreactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>), while only 30% of the TTP-AA-myc transfected cells were MyoD immunoreactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), demonstrating that TTP reduces myogenic commitment. Importantly, 15% of SCs were MyoD immunoreactive on a subset of myofibers removed immediately following transfection at 6 hr post-explant (dotted line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, ectopic expression of TTP-AA-myc blocked virtually all cells from inducing MyoD post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>MyoD mRNA in skeletal muscle cell lines is stabilized by HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van der Giessen et al., 2003</xref>) and induction in SCs is concomitant with the loss of TTP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, TTP may regulate HuR since a polyadenylation variant of HuR mRNA contains an AU-rich element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009</xref>) and blocking p38α/β MAPK signaling prevents HuR induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Therefore, HuR is a potential TTP target that may stabilize MyoD mRNA in activated SCs promoting MyoD induction. If correct, HuR expression should be reduced by the TTP-AA-myc mutant similar or to a greater extent then that observed for MyoD. To test this, SCs on intact myofibers were transfected with either a control or TTP-AA-myc mutant plasmid, fixed (as described above) 30 hr post explant and then stained for Syndecan-4 (to identify SCs) and HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Scoring the percentage of Syndecan-4+ cells that were HuR immunoreactive showed that there were no detectable differences in HuR protein expression in control transfected SCs as compared to TTP-AA-myc transfected SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Therefore, loss of TTP from skeletal muscle tissue should precociously activate SCs, promoting inappropriate MyoD expression, and aberrant cell cycle entry. To test this prediction, we analyzed whole tibialis anterior (TA) muscle tissue from uninjured TTP-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>) and from uninjured TTP/TNFR1/2 triple knockout mice (3KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carballo et al., 2001</xref>).

Neither the TTP knockout mice nor 3KO mice exhibited any detectable gross morphological differences in muscle sections immunostained with laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Elegant experiments have established roles for maintenance of quiescence by microRNAs, where miR-489 represses Dek expression to maintain quiescence, miR-31 represses Myf-5 translation to maintain quiescence, and alternative polyadenylation regulates Pax3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crist et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we propose that SC quiescence is actively maintained by mRNA decay, an additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, via the Tis11 family of RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that a host of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms maintain the quiescent state of skeletal muscle stem cells and represent an efficient and rapid method for tissue-specific stem cell responses.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03390.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of TTP by p38α/β MAPK initiates a feed-forward circuit that commits SCs to the myogenic lineage.</title><p>Muscle regeneration requires SCs to rapidly exit from quiescence but to also renew the quiescent SC population upon completion of regeneration. We propose that TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence. Upon muscle injury, p38α/β MAPK is rapidly activated resulting in phosphorylation of TTP. Phospho-TTP no longer suppresses activation-associated transcripts resulting in rapid induction and SC activation. One such activation-associated transcript targeted by TTP is MyoD, which is rapidly induced due to inactivation of TTP by p38α/β MAPK concurrent with increased MyoD mRNA stability mediated by HuR and transcriptional upregulation of the MyoD gene locus. Since MyoD up-regulates its own transcription, muscle injury would trigger a rapid feed-forward loop resulting in MyoD expression driving SCs to commit to myoblasts. Additionally, we propose that TTP may be involved in down regulation of MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts expressed by myoblasts, during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in reacquisition of quiescence following an injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03390.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03390.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03390-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Gene chip analysis of SCs isolated from uninjured and injured skeletal muscle and gene chip analysis of quiescent SCs isolated following injection of p38α/β MAPK inhibitors, identified a cohort of transcripts rapidly down-regulated upon SC activation, prior to cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farina et al., 2012</xref>). Transcripts encoding proteins that directly regulate mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins involved in skeletal muscle diseases were highly represented, supporting a critical role for post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farina et al., 2012</xref>). The involvement of p38α/β MAPK signaling in SC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>), asymmetric SC division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Troy et al., 2012</xref>) and loss of SC function during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>) identifies p38α/β MAPK targets as likely mediators of these cellular processes. Therefore, we focused on TTP, which is a p38α/β MAPK signaling target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stumpo et al., 2010</xref>) and was down-regulated to the greatest extent during SC activation. The <italic>Tis11/Zfp36</italic> gene family is comprised of TTP and three related genes, of which TTP is the best characterized, containing a tandem zinc finger domain that binds AU rich sequences in the 3′ UTR of mRNAs and targets the mRNAs for sequestration or decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Potential TTP mRNA targets in SCs would most likely include positive regulators of myogenic commitment. One probable TTP target, HuR, is reported to stabilize MyoD and Myogenin transcripts in myogenic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figueroa et al., 2003</xref>). Although we found no evidence that TTP regulates HuR during SC activation, HuR is rapidly induced upon SC activation, suggesting that critical mediators of myogenic commitment, including the myogenic transcription factors MyoD and Myf5, are regulated by multiple post-transcriptional regulatory pathways. For example, Myf5 is sequestered from translation in quiescent SCs by miR-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crist et al., 2012</xref>). MyoD is a likely candidate for post-transcriptional regulation as MyoD mRNA is present at low but detectable levels in freshly isolated SCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplemental file 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornelison et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). MyoD protein is induced within 3h of SC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>) and requires p38α/β MAPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). Asymmetric p38α/β MAPK is required for commitment of one daughter cell to myogenesis during asymmetric SC division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Troy et al., 2012</xref>) and presumably, the TTP binding site in the 3′ UTR of MyoD would permit TTP-mediated mRNA decay in daughter cells lacking activated p38α/β MAPK. The behavior of SCs from aged mice is consistent with p38α/β MAPK-mediated regulation of MyoD as these SCs predominately commit to myogenesis with an accompanying reduction in self-renewal, consistent with their elevated p38α/β MAPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>). Although MyoD mRNA appears to be a TTP target, TTP likely regulates other mRNAs with AU-rich sites involved in maintenance of SC quiescence. Furthermore, the Tis11 family members Brf1 and Brf2 were also down-regulated upon SC activation. Ongoing work is focused on identification and characterization of additional TTP/Tis11 targets and their involvement in maintenance of SC quiescence.</p><p>In the absence of muscle injury, SC-specific TTP knockdown increased MyoD+ cells, presumably at the expense of Pax7+ progenitor cells. The increase in MyoD+ cells was accompanied by an increase in mCherry+ myofibers when compared to controls where SCs were infected with scrambled shRNAs. Thus, TTP inhibition breaks SC quiescence in uninjured muscle, providing strong evidence for the involvement of TTP in regulating SC homeostasis. Similarly, post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by miR-489 maintains SC quiescence, suggesting Dek and potentially other miR-489 targets regulate SC homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>). As we do not know the extent of functional diversity within the Pax7+ SC population it is possible that TTP loss-of-function and miR-489 preferentially affect sub-populations of Pax7+ SCs. Additional experiments will resolve whether SC quiescence is coordinately regulated by multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms or whether subsets of SCs are uniquely responsive to distinct skeletal muscle repair or maintenance requirements.</p><p>SC quiescence is maintained by multiple post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms including miRNA-mediated inhibition of Myf5 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crist et al., 2012</xref>) and Dek translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that in addition to Myf5 and Pax3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutet et al., 2012</xref>), MyoD mRNA is regulated post-transcriptionally via a distinct regulatory mechanism whereby MyoD mRNA is targeted for rapid decay in quiescent SCs. Post-transcriptional regulatory circuitry is required for SC homeostasis and appears to maintain SCs in a primed state, permitting a rapid response to skeletal muscle injury. Moreover, post-transcriptional gene regulation likely facilitates SC self-renewal by asymmetric division and may regulate SC homeostasis via multiple mechanisms. In other tissues undergoing rapid turnover, similar post-transcriptional regulatory networks may ensure that a primed stem cell pool is available to repair and maintain tissue function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were bred and housed according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals in a pathogen-free facility at the University of Colorado (Wildtype and Syndecan-4 null line) or at the at the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (TTP and TTP;TNFR1/2 null lines).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The comments of the reviewers converge to a considerable extent. We would ask you to address the points raised and to pay particular attention to the question of the role of TTP in satellite cells (using single fiber experiments for example), TTP effects on transcripts and protein levels, TTP, p38 phosphorylation and messenger RNA stabilisation should be clearly established in this context. The discussion in the paper of the role of TTP in quiescence is not very convincing and if retained requires data on MyoD transcription in these cells, although this does not necessarily have to include in vitro stability assays. The full reviews have been included to assist with your revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript identifies the RNA binding protein Tristetrapolin (TTP or <italic>Zfp36</italic>) as a factor that is up-regulated in quiescent versus activated satellite cells. The authors show that it binds to AU-rich sequences in the 3' UTR of MyoD mRNA, promoting messenger decay. Interestingly they find that MyoD is already transcribed in quiescent satellite cells and propose that accumulation of this myogenic determination factor, which would lead to myogenesis, is prevented by this post-transcriptional mechanism. Phosphorylation of TTP by p38 MAPK prevents its destabilising action and the authors propose that this takes place on muscle injury when satellite cells are activated and enter myogenesis. Mouse mutant analysis demonstrates the role of TTP in maintaining quiescence since in its absence satellite cells are activated. These results provide new insight into the regulation of satellite cell behaviour and are of interest to the wider field of stem cell research as well as to the muscle community.</p><p>A number of points need to be addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) HuR is another mRNA binding protein which is known to stabilise MyoD mRNA. Unlike TTP it is expressed at a higher level in activated satellite cells. The authors show that TTP does not regulate HuR, but this does not exclude competition between the factors. Does HuR bind to different sites on the MyoD mRNA? Can the factors bind together and what is the consequence in the critical period of transition at the time of satellite cell activation?</p><p>2) TTP is down-regulated at the transcriptional level in activated satellite cells. Why do the authors insist on the functional importance of TTP inactivation by phosphorylation in this context and what is the relative timing of these events? A weakness of the TTP phosphorylation data in this paper is that the antibody to phosphorylated TTP does not work well on sections so that evidence on its in vivo significance is largely circumstantial. More experiments on isolated fibres without TTP overexpression would be helpful.</p><p>3) The question of maintenance of satellite cell quiescence, versus return to quiescence after activation, is raised in the paper. The mutant TTP phenotype indicates inappropriate activation in the absence of injury, although this could be a failure of acquisition of quiescence by satellite cells in the postnatal period of growth. Experiments with isolated fibres and siRNA would permit analysis of the role of TTP in the maintenance of Pax7-positive cells that do not differentiate but normally reconstitute the quiescent satellite cell pool.</p><p>4) TTP targets pre-inflammatory mRNAs in macrophages and down-regulation of TTP activity leads to up-regulation of TNFa receptors. The authors examine triple mutants as well as the simple TTP mutant, showing rescue of the TTP mutant phenotype. The TTP mutation is not targeted to satellite cells and may therefore exert indirect effects on these cells via the inflammatory response which is known to be important for muscle regeneration. The authors should take this into account.</p><p>5) Experiments on TTP and mRNA stability are carried out in HeLa cells. It would be more satisfactory to show the effect on MyoD mRNA in satellite cells. Are many other mRNAs in satellite cells affected?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Hausburg et al. identify the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin (TTP) as a mediator of satellite cell (SC) quiescence. While the data supporting TTP as a regulator of MyoD transcript is convincing, the mechanism by which TTP is regulated from SC quiescence to activation needs further clarification.</p><p>1) The microarray and qPCR analyses do not appear to correlate with protein expression analysis of TTP. The authors clearly show that <italic>Zfp36</italic> transcript levels are highest in the quiescent state and this rapidly decreases upon SC activation (either following injury or in culture). At the same time, the authors suggest that in quiescent SCs TTP protein is active and will target its own mRNA for rapid decay. The authors use this reasoning to conclude why they only observe TTP protein expression in 50% of SCs. Yet, their microarray and qPCR analysis would suggest that mRNA levels should be high, and thus, protein levels should be readily detectable. To add to the confusion, the authors suggest that p38α/β activation results in TTP phosphorylation and stabilization of the protein. If this is the case, mRNA transcript levels should also be stabilized since the protein will no longer mediate decay of its transcript. Additionally, the protein should be readily detectable in all SCs due to its increased stability. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, however, this is not the case as the number of TTP+/Sdc4+ cells do not increase following injury. The authors need to re-evaluate and clarify their proposed mechanism for how TTP protein and mRNA are regulated from quiescence to activation.</p><p>2) The link made in this manuscript between p38α/β activation and TTP regulation is based solely on previously published work. In this study, however, experiments to confirm that this mechanism is active in SCs were not adequate. Inhibiting p38α/β activation by chemical inhibitors does not necessarily demonstrate a direct regulation by p38α/β on TTP. Does MK2 phosphorylate TTP directly in SCs? Proximity ligation assay between phospho-MK2 and TTP would enhance this claim. Specific siRNA knock-down of MK2 in SCs cultured on myofibers demonstrating reduced TTP phosphorylation is also needed.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> demonstrates immunoreactivity of phospho-TTP on an isolated SC. The authors should also provide staining of phospho-TTP from SCs cultured on myofibers comparing immediately isolated fibers (quiescent SCs) to SCs cultured on myofibers for 30 hours (activated).</p><p>4) Given that TTP is a proposed mediator of SC quiescence, it is very surprising that there were no differences in Pax7+ SC numbers in TTP KO and 3KO mice compared to WT. At what age were these mice examined? Would there be a difference in mice of older ages? Are other TTP family members compensating for the loss of TTP, and are mice with KO of multiple TTP family members available?</p><p>5) MyoD and Myf5 are known to be differentially regulated in satellite cells. Does TTP target Myf5? This is an important point to address and may highlight the differences in MyoD vs. Myf5 regulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Hausberg and colleagues addresses regulation of MyoD by the RNA binding protein, TTP. The study of RNA binding proteins in stem/progenitor cells is topical. Its role in MyoD regulation, a master regulator of myogenesis warrants investigation. Overall, the authors have done an excellent job of carefully analyzing the expression of TTP during satellite cell quiescence and transition to proliferation, and its regulation of MyoD. In addition, the germline knockout mice show a satellite cell phenotype in vivo showing that TTP is functionally relevant. However at present, I am less clear of the role of TTP in SC function/regulation as it pertains to MyoD.</p><p>I have two major points that need addressing: the stability and active transcription of MyoD in quiescence cells and the role of TTP as it pertains to p38 and MyoD on satellite cell function.</p><p>1) To conclude that TTP directly impacts MyoD stability in quiescent cells it is important to demonstrate that MyoD is actively transcribed in quiescent cells.</p><p>As a suggestion, could the authors perform an in-vitro stability assay whereby extract from quiescent vs activated cells is incubated with transcribed labeled 3'UTR MyoD reporter to see if stability of the reporter is differentially affected?

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The proximity ligation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) was performed in MM14 cells.

However, it is worth examining whether or not an increase in phospho-TTP staining can be detected during the course of SC activation.</p><p>3) It is unclear which TTP antibody was used for the myofiber experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>.

Unlike TTP it is expressed at a higher level in activated satellite cells. The authors show that TTP does not regulate HuR, but this does not exclude competition between the factors. Does HuR bind to different sites on the MyoD mRNA? Can the factors bind together and what is the consequence in the critical period of transition at the time of satellite cell activation?</italic></p><p>We have not addressed this point directly, however, our manuscript examines the transition of the satellite cell from the quiescent to an activated state. As we cannot detect HuR in quiescent satellite cells and HuR mRNA is induced when TTP declines, it is not likely that both proteins are present early during SC activation. We do show that TTP is not regulating HuR. During SC activation HuR is not present and knockdown or inhibition of TTP in quiescent SCs induces MyoD. Whether HuR is induced upon TTP knockdown is not known. Since our manuscript focuses on TTP, we believe these potentially interesting experiments are not relevant to the current work but we plan to explore the role of HuR and other RNA binding proteins in SC activation and SC self-renewal.</p><p><italic>2) TTP is down-regulated at the transcriptional level in activated satellite cells. Why do the authors insist on the functional importance of TTP inactivation by phosphorylation in this context and what is the relative timing of these events? A weakness of the TTP phosphorylation data in this paper is that the antibody to phosphorylated TTP does not work well on sections so that evidence on its</italic> in vivo <italic>significance is largely circumstantial. More experiments on isolated fibres without TTP overexpression would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We now show with new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that a short incubation (24h) with a MK2 inhibitor recapitulates the p38 inhibitor, preventing MyoD protein up-regulation. P38α/β MAPK is the only known kinase that phosphorylates MK2.Furthermore, we establish by PLA that TTP and MK2 are present in a complex in myogenic cells, directly confirming the role of MK2 and providing strong support that the p38α/β pathway regulates TTP activity.</p><p><italic>3) The question of maintenance of satellite cell quiescence, versus return to quiescence after activation, is raised in the paper. The mutant TTP phenotype indicates inappropriate activation in the absence of injury, although this could be a failure of acquisition of quiescence by satellite cells in the postnatal period of growth. Experiments with isolated fibres and siRNA would permit analysis of the role of TTP in the maintenance of Pax7-positive cells that do not differentiate but normally reconstitute the quiescent satellite cell pool</italic>.</p><p>We attempted to perform longer drug treatments in culture but ultimately decided an in vivo demonstration that inhibition of TTP disrupts SC quiescence would be the most convincing experiment. We utilized a novel retroviral approach to directly demonstrate that knockdown of TTP specifically in SCs breaks SC quiescence, induces MyoD protein accumulation, is accompanied by exit of SCs from G0, and increases myonuclear accretion. These data demonstrate directly the involvement of TTP in maintaining SC quiescence and SC homeostasis. We have not addressed the role of TTP in SC self-renewal as these experiments are not the focus of the current manuscript and are technically very challenging. Accordingly, references to TTP and SC self-renewal in the narrative were removed.</p><p><italic>4) TTP targets pre-inflammatory mRNAs in macrophages and down-regulation of TTP activity leads to up-regulation of TNFa receptors. The authors examine triple mutants as well as the simple TTP mutant, showing rescue of the TTP mutant phenotype. The TTP mutation is not targeted to satellite cells and may therefore exert indirect effects on these cells via the inflammatory response which is known to be important for muscle regeneration. The authors should take this into account</italic>.</p><p>Please see comments above to (3).</p><p><italic>5) Experiments on TTP and mRNA stability are carried out in HeLa cells. It would be more satisfactory to show the effect on MyoD mRNA in satellite cells. Are many other mRNAs in satellite cells affected?</italic></p><p>Myogenic cells express TTP and endogenous TTP will obscure interpretation of the data. We chose the HeLa system as these cells are nearly devoid of TTP and permit us to directly determine the effects of TTP and the p38α/β pathway on MyoD mRNA stability. It would be difficult to perform similar experiments in myogenic cells as the endogenous MyoD and TTP would pose significant technical challenges in experimental design and interpretation.</p><p>We are very interested in other mRNAs regulated by TTP and there are undoubtedly other mRNAs that play critical regulatory roles. We are performing unbiased sequencing experiments to identify these and plan to present the data in a subsequent manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) The microarray and qPCR analyses do not appear to correlate with protein expression analysis of TTP. The authors clearly show that</italic> Zfp36 <italic>transcript levels are highest in the quiescent state and this rapidly decreases upon SC activation (either following injury or in culture). At the same time, the authors suggest that in quiescent SCs TTP protein is active and will target its own mRNA for rapid decay. The authors use this reasoning to conclude why they only observe TTP protein expression in 50% of SCs. Yet, their microarray and qPCR analysis would suggest that mRNA levels should be high, and thus, protein levels should be readily detectable. To add to the confusion, the authors suggest that p38α/β activation results in TTP phosphorylation and stabilization of the protein. If this is the case, mRNA transcript levels should also be stabilized since the protein will no longer mediate decay of its transcript. Additionally, the protein should be readily detectable in all SCs due to its increased stability. According to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>, however, this is not the case as the number of TTP+/Sdc4+ cells do not increase following injury. The authors need to re-evaluate and clarify their proposed mechanism for how TTP protein and mRNA are regulated from quiescence to activation</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer has made an excellent point. The reviewer assumes that isolated SCs from which the RNA was obtained are quiescent, however, they are not quiescent but activated. We have previously reported that p38α/β MAPK is activated within minutes of injury and confirm those data here with our analysis of TTP phosphorylation. Thus, the high levels of TTP mRNA observed in freshly isolated SCs are likely due to TTP phosphorylation and subsequent TTP mRNA stabilization. Clearly, TTP mRNA is transcriptionally regulated by mechanisms that are not yet known as the mRNA declines following SC activation.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the observation was made 1h post BaCl<sub>2</sub>, a short time period after SC activation. Whether this is a sufficient time to change TTP levels is unclear but a worthwhile question. However, the ratio of phospho-TTP to TTP should change dramatically. Unfortunately, the available anti-phospho-TTP antibodies do not work in sections, where we have extensively attempted a variety of techniques to improve phospho-TTP detection. Alternatively, SCs isolated and analyzed in culture are 3-5h or more post activation and do show extensive phospho-TTP immunoreactivity in virtually all cells. For the final point, we agree that additional experiments would solidify the pathway. We have performed several additional experiments, particularly with MK2 that support our conclusions (see new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) Finally, to better address the role of TTP in satellite cells, we knocked down TTP in quiescent SCs in the absence of muscle injury. When TTP expression is reduced, SCs break quiescence, induce MyoD, and fuse into existing myofibers. These new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref> (see comment (3) for Reviewer 1).</p><p><italic>2) The link made in this manuscript between p38α/β activation and TTP regulation is based solely on previously published work. In this study, however, experiments to confirm that this mechanism is active in SCs were not adequate. Inhibiting p38α/β activation by chemical inhibitors does not necessarily demonstrate a direct regulation by p38α/β on TTP. Does MK2 phosphorylate TTP directly in SCs? Proximity ligation assay between phospho-MK2 and TTP would enhance this claim. Specific siRNA knock-down of MK2 in SCs cultured on myofibers demonstrating reduced TTP phosphorylation is also needed</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed both of these excellent points. First, we performed PLA for MK2 and demonstrate that MK2 and TTP are in a complex in myogenic cells. Second, we used a chemical MK2 inhibitor to demonstrate that inhibition of MK2 prevents MyoD protein induction, similar to p38α/β inhibition and constitutive TTP activation. See comment (2) to Reviewer 1.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref> <italic>demonstrates immunoreactivity of phospho-TTP on an isolated SC. The authors should also provide staining of phospho-TTP from SCs cultured on myofibers comparing immediately isolated fibers (quiescent SCs) to SCs cultured on myofibers for 30 hours (activated)</italic>.</p><p>First, on immediately isolated fibers SCs are not quiescent but activated. Thus, the experiment as suggested will not work as TTP is phosphorylated upon isolation (<underline>See</underline> ) as most/all SCs on myofibers are phospho- p38α/β+ upon isolation. We have performed additional experiments to address the concern. First, MK2 is not phosphorylated in uninjured muscle (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref>) and inhibition of MK2 prevents TTP phosphorylation and MyoD accumulation (new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Given that TTP is a proposed mediator of SC quiescence, it is very surprising that there were no differences in Pax7+ SC numbers in TTP KO and 3KO mice compared to WT. At what age were these mice examined? Would there be a difference in mice of older ages? Are other TTP family members compensating for the loss of TTP, and are mice with KO of multiple TTP family members available?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer and expected to see a reduction in SCs. While the numbers trend toward reduction, they are not significantly different in the knockout mice. With exercise or aging we expect to see a reduction but these experiments were not performed and are tangential to the focus of this manuscript. We performed a knock-down of TTP specifically in SCs and found that that these cells exit quiescence and fuse into myofibers in the absence of injury (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). For the knockdown, we do observe a significant reduction in Pax7+ cells (See new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in agreement with the reviewer’s expectations. Finally, there are no Brf1 or Brf2 cKO mice available. We are, however, interested in functional compensation between family members and are actively pursuing this hypothesis in a separate manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) MyoD and Myf5 are known to be differentially regulated in satellite cells. Does TTP target Myf5? This is an important point to address and may highlight the differences in MyoD vs. Myf5 regulation</italic>.</p><p>We did not test Myf5 directly but given the absence of a consensus AU rich binding site, it is unlikely that TTP targets Myf5 directly. Of particular interest are whether the post-transcriptional regulation of MyoD and Myf5 collaborate or are executed in different subpopulations of SCs. Experiments to test this latter possibility are the subject of an ongoing study and will be published in a future manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>I have two major points that need addressing: the stability and active transcription of MyoD in quiescence cells and the role of TTP as it pertains to p38 and MyoD on satellite cell function</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) To conclude that TTP directly impacts MyoD stability in quiescent cells it is important to demonstrate that MyoD is actively transcribed in quiescent cells</italic>.</p><p><italic>As a suggestion, could the authors perform an in-vitro stability assay whereby extract from quiescent vs activated cells is incubated with transcribed labeled 3'UTR MyoD reporter to see if stability of the reporter is differentially affected?

Despite this likely outcome, we performed a detailed short-term time course (0,3,6,12,24h) to query the extent of phospho-TTP in myofiber-associated SCs.
