distribution. Cdc42 and related GTPases are activated and accumulate in a patch of the cortex that defines the front of the cell. Positive feedback enables spontaneous polarization triggered by stochastic fluctuations, but as such fluctuations can occur at multiple locations, how do cells ensure that they make only one front? In polarizing cells of the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, positive feedback can trigger growth of several Cdc42 clusters at the same time, but this multi-cluster stage rapidly evolves to a single-cluster state, which then promotes bud emergence. By manipulating polarity protein dynamics, we show that resolution of multi-cluster intermediates occurs through a greedy competition between clusters to recruit and retain polarity proteins from a shared intracellular pool.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11611.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11611.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of fungi and other eukaryotic organisms are generally asymmetric in shape and structure. This is possible because newly-formed cells can establish front and back ends that influence how each cell grows and develops. A protein called Cdc42 – which can cycle between an active and inactive form – establishes this cell “polarity”. The front of the cell is specified by the accumulation of active Cdc42 proteins in a small area of the membrane that surrounds the cell.</p><p>However, it is not clear why the accumulation of active Cdc42 only happens in one place. Budding yeast is widely used as a model to study cell polarity. This yeast reproduces through the budding of new daughter cells out of one end of the mother cell. To achieve this, the mother establishes a single front end through the accumulation of active Cdc42. This marks the site where the daughter cell will emerge.</p><p>Previous research has shown that during the early stages of cell polarization, Cdc42 clusters start to form at several places on the inner surface of the membrane. Only a single cluster emerges as the winner, while the others lose and shrink away. How does this happen? One possibility is that Cdc42 clusters all compete with each other to attract polarity proteins from the cell interior, so that when a protein falls off one cluster it can be picked up by another.</p><p>Another possibility is that the winning cluster acquires a factor that stabilizes it, while the other clusters do not. Here, Wu et al. use microscopy and mathematical modelling to distinguish between these two possible scenarios in budding yeast. The experiments show that the speed of competition can be manipulated by altering how quickly key polarity proteins move between the membrane and the interior of the cell. Cells with slowed competition can maintain multiple fronts for long enough to make several buds at the same time.</p><p>Wu et al.’s findings suggest that the formation of a single front in budding yeast is due to competition for polarity factors. The next challenge will be to understand how some cells in animals and other fungi manage to suppress this competition in order to produce more than one front.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11611.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11611.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Cdc42</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>Turing model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM62300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lew</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM103870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elston</surname><given-names>Timothy C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lew</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM079271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elston</surname><given-names>Timothy C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lew</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISSF Non-clinical Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savage</surname><given-names>Natasha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In budding yeast, nascent polarity sites engage in a winner-takes-all contest to determine a single front.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Differentiated cells exhibit a stunning variety of morphologies that enable specialized cell-specific functions. Morphological diversity emerges, in part, from specialization of cortical domains, which are often demarcated by the local accumulation of active GTPases. Among the best-understood cortical specification events is the establishment of cell polarity, wherein local accumulation of a cortical Rho-family GTPase (Cdc42, Rac, or Rop depending on the organism) creates a region destined to become the 'front' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park and Bi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Lavagi, 2012</xref>). For some cells, restricting polarity to a single front is absolutely imperative: for example, a migrating leukocyte with two fronts would split itself apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houk et al., 2012</xref>). However, other cells routinely specify more than one front: for example, neurons can grow several neurites simultaneously, each with a front-like tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). Similar phenomena occur in plants and fungi, raising the question of how different cell types generate the correct number of fronts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu and Lew, 2013</xref>). Here we focus on the mechanism whereby budding yeast cells guarantee that they only establish a single polarity site, growing one and only one bud.</p><p>Polarity establishment is thought to occur through a cooperative process involving positive feedback, which allows localized fluctuations in concentration to set off growth of a cluster of polarity factors to establish a front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Park, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). But if stochastic effects can trigger production of a front, what restricts cells to form only one front? A potential mechanism involves competition between different fronts for a common pool of polarity factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2009</xref>). The strongest experimental support for this competition hypothesis comes from studies of 're-wired' yeast cells that were engineered to use a synthetic polarity factor created from a fusion between two endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2009</xref>). In that system, many cells were observed to initially form two fronts (cortical sites enriched for the synthetic protein). In the majority of cells that developed two fronts, one front then grew stronger while the other concurrently grew weaker and disappeared. When a cell initially developed only one front, that front never shrank or disappeared, suggesting that in the two-front cells, growth of the 'winning' front was responsible for the disappearance of the 'losing' front, as predicted by the competition hypothesis. In a few cells, the two initial polarity sites did eventually grow into buds, indicating that competition is not fully effective in re-wired cells.</p><p>Whether competition is responsible for the uniqueness of the front in yeast with a natural (as opposed to synthetic) polarity system is not known. Although we detected initial development of two or more polarity clusters prior to establishment of a single front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), others did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, even when a transient multi-cluster intermediate was observed, the process whereby such early intermediates were resolved to a single front remained unclear. Unlike in the strains with a synthetically rewired polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2009</xref>), in the natural system early polarity clusters were observed to disappear spontaneously even when there was no other cluster present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the disappearance of a cluster could not be unambiguously attributed to the presence of a competing cluster in the same cell.</p><p>Why would some polarity clusters spontaneously disappear? This behavior was traced to a negative feedback loop in the yeast polarity circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>). As the combination of positive and negative feedback can yield a pulse generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandman and Meyer, 2008</xref>), it could be that stochastic fluctuations routinely trigger growth of a cluster by positive feedback followed by cluster dissolution due to negative feedback. But if that is the case, then why don’t ALL polarity clusters disappear? Why does one and only one cluster remain stable following the initial dynamic behavior? One possibility is that during their brief existence, initial (unstable) polarity clusters have a chance to capture a critical stabilizing factor. Then, once a lucky cluster had captured the stabilizer, all other clusters would be doomed to disappear. Like the competition hypothesis, the stabilizer hypothesis can explain resolution of a multi-cluster intermediate to a final single-front state. Indeed, some models in the field posit that actin cables play roles analogous to the stabilizer, reinforcing polarity clusters and protecting them from dissolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Yeast actin is organized into two distinct types of structures. Actin cables are bundles of parallel actin filaments nucleated by formins: their primary role is to enable myosin-driven delivery of cargo towards the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pruyne et al., 2004</xref>). Actin patches are assemblies of branched actin filaments nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex: their primary role is to promote internalization of endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>). Both actin cable-mediated traffic of secretory vesicles and actin patch-mediated endocytosis have been proposed to stabilize and reinforce polarity clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jose et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slaughter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</xref>). When yeast cells were treated with Latrunculin to depolymerize actin, polarity clusters were observed to serially assemble and disassemble, sometimes relocating from one site to another, to a much greater degree than seen in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). This observation is consistent with a potential 'stabilizer' role for actin: in cells with two polarity clusters, the first one to capture some actin structure may be stabilized and persist while the other disappears due to negative feedback.</p><p>We now report experiments that distinguish between the competition and stabilizer hypotheses. Our findings suggest that uniqueness of the yeast front is due to competition for polarity factors, and not to a downstream stabilizer. We show that the speed of competition can be manipulated by altering the rates at which key polarity factors exchange between membrane and cytoplasm, and that cells with slowed competition can maintain multiple fronts for long enough to make two, three, or even four buds simultaneously. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of competition, uncovering how yeast cells can guarantee the uniqueness of the front.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In wild-type yeast cells, polarization is biased towards specific sites by a system of inherited bud-site-selection landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Park, 2012</xref>). Localized landmarks influence the site of polarization through the Ras-family GTPase Rsr1, and polarity clusters tend to form near the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Because polarity factors also accumulate at the cytokinesis site (which overlaps one pole), some polarity clusters are difficult to quantify separate from the cytokinesis signal. In the absence of Rsr1, polarity clusters can form over much of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bender and Pringle, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>), allowing easier imaging of the resolution from &gt;1 cluster to a single cluster. For that reason, our experiments were carried out in <italic>rsr1</italic> mutant strains.</p><p>Because GFP-tagged Cdc42 is not fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watson et al., 2014</xref>), we adapted a strategy recently shown to produce a functional internal mCherry-tagged Cdc42 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendezu et al., 2015</xref>). Although more functional than GFP-Cdc42 at single copy, this probe was still not fully functional in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Thus, when possible we used fluorescently tagged Bem1 as a functional marker for polarity clusters. Bem1 is a scaffold protein that participates in positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozubowski et al., 2008</xref>) and accumulates at the same sites as Cdc42 with very similar timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>); when a losing cluster disassembles, Cdc42 and Bem1 disappear in concert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polarity probes.</title> <p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Functionality of fluorescent Cdc42 probes.

In this scenario, the relevant factors must exchange dynamically between the cluster and the cell interior on a timescale that is rapid relative to the time it takes to resolve the multi-cluster intermediate. Indeed, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicate that polarity factors exchange in and out of clusters on a 2–4 s timeframe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slaughter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</xref>), whereas multi-cluster resolution occurs on a 1–2 min timeframe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>).

Cdc42 itself is attached to the membrane by a C-terminal polybasic-prenyl motif, but GDP-Cdc42 exchange is rapid due to dedicated factors called Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (Rho-GDIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michaelson et al., 2001</xref>).

Biochemical experiments indicated that Cdc42 was able to exchange between different lipid vesicles in vitro even in the absence of a GDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>), and there was still a substantial pool of Cdc42 in the cytoplasm of <italic>rdi1</italic>Δ mutants lacking a GDI, as detected either by fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tiedje et al., 2008</xref>) or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2012</xref>).

This fusion protein was able to replace endogenous Bem1, but created a situation in which formin-nucleated actin cables and actin patch-mediated endocytosis became essential for polarization, because the Bem1-Snc2 protein could only traffic on vesicles and not through the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike Bem1-Snc2, however, we found that Bem1-CAAX did not require the formin Bni1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) or F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) in order to polarize. The finding that Bem1-CAAX polarizes in these situations implies that its mobility is not dependent on actin-mediated vesicle traffic.</p><p>In a parallel approach to the same question, we used the 'anchor away' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) system to ask whether Bem1-CAAX was 'locked on' to membranes. This system is based on the ability of the drug rapamycin to induce a stable interaction between FKBP (Fpr1 in yeast) and the FKBP-binding domain (FRB) of Tor1. We fused two tandem copies of FKBP to the ribosomal protein Rpl13A, and two tandem copies of FRB to Bem1-CAAX. Upon addition of rapamycin, this should induce binding of Bem1-CAAX to ribosomes. If Bem1-CAAX is able to exchange between membrane and cytoplasm, then rapamycin should trap it in the cytoplasm, resulting in a loss of Bem1-CAAX from the polarity site. On the other hand, if Bem1-CAAX were locked onto membranes, then rapamycin should not affect Bem1-CAAX localization (though some ribosomes might become attached to the membrane). We found that rapamycin led to a rapid loss of detectable Bem1-CAAX from the polarity site in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), providing independent evidence that Bem1-CAAX exchanges between membrane and cytoplasm. In aggregate, these experiments indicate that the polybasic-prenyl motif slows but does not eliminate membrane-cytoplasm exchange, and that it is valid to use <italic>rdi1</italic>Δ mutants as a way to slow exchange of Cdc42, and Bem1-CAAX and Cdc24-CAAX as a way to slow exchange of Bem1 and Cdc24, between membrane and cytoplasm.</p><p>Strains in which Cdc24-CAAX replaced endogenous Cdc24 exhibited very poor viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Like earlier Turing-type models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turing, 1952</xref>), some of these can generate and maintain more than one peak of polarity factors in sufficiently large domains. However, a bottom-up model describing the activities and interactions of the yeast Cdc42, Cdc24, Bem1, and GDI proteins displays competition between polarity clusters for all parameters examined thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Savage et al., 2012</xref>). In this model, whose elements have considerable experimental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozubowski et al., 2008</xref>), clustering of Cdc42 occurs through a positive feedback loop involving a cytoplasmic complex that contains Bem1 and the GEF Cdc24. Cortical GTP-Cdc42 recruits Bem1-Cdc24 complexes from the cytoplasm, which then load neighboring Cdc42 with GTP, leading to further Bem1-Cdc24 recruitment and Cdc42 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Additional Cdc42 is delivered to the growing cluster from the cytoplasm by the GDI, as well as by other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). Because of positive feedback, stochastic activation of a small amount of Cdc42 somewhere on the membrane leads to further accumulation of active Cdc42 until depletion of the cytoplasmic pools of polarity proteins stops the process. With suitable parameter choices, the system develops a stable polarized peak of GTP-Cdc42: diffusion, inactivation, and release of Cdc42 into the cytoplasm is counteracted by recruitment of more Cdc42 to the peak from the cytoplasmic GDI-bound pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As discussed above, FRAP experiments confirm that apparently stable polarized peaks are indeed maintained by very dynamic recycling of the Cdc42, Bem1, and Cdc24.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Competition between clusters in a computational model.</title> <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting positive feedback.

However, this situation is unstable, as the addition of infinitesimally small noise leads to a stable single-peak steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). At either the two-peak (unstable) or one-peak (stable) steady state, Bem1-Cdc24 complexes and Cdc42 recycle between the peak(s) and the cytoplasm. The net transfer of polarity factors from the 'losing' to the 'winning' peak occurs without significant changes in the cytoplasmic concentrations of Cdc42 and Bem1-GEF for most of the competition time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><p>To understand why the two-peak state is unstable, we investigated what happens at the center of each peak when one peak acquires more Cdc42 and Bem1-GEF than the other. We first consider the Bem1-GEF complex. The larger peak has a higher concentration of GTP-Cdc42, which can bind Bem1-GEF from the cytoplasm: this gives it an advantage over the smaller peak in recruiting Bem1-GEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). To evaluate loss of Bem1-GEF from the peak, we started with an arbitrary amount of Cdc42-Bem1-GEF, and ran simulations to monitor the loss of Bem1-GEF from the membrane over time, for different values of GTP-Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). With higher levels of GTP-Cdc42 (i.e. for larger peaks), it takes longer for Bem1-GEF complexes to detach from the membrane, because when a complex detaches from one molecule of GTP-Cdc42 it is more likely to bind to another GTP-Cdc42 rather than release into the cytoplasm. From these data we extracted the half-life for membrane-bound Bem1-GEF (dwell time), which increased linearly with GTP-Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). See the Materials and methods for a quasi-steady state approximation demonstrating this effect of GTP-Cdc42 on the Bem1-GEF dwell time.</p><p>Now consider the recruitment/removal of Cdc42. To compute the dwell time of Cdc42 as a function of the membrane-bound Bem1-GEF concentration, we used a similar approach as described above for computing the Bem1-GEF loss according to the governing equations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>, inset). Delivery of Cdc42 from the cytoplasm by the GDI is unaffected by protein concentrations at the membrane, so a similar amount of Cdc42 will be delivered to the center of each peak from the cytoplasm. However, because the larger peak has more Bem1-GEF, GDP-Cdc42 in a larger peak is converted more rapidly to GTP-Cdc42. Because the GDI only extracts GDP-Cdc42, more GEF activity translates to a reduced loss of Cdc42 to the cytoplasm, and hence a longer dwell time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>). See the Materials and methods for a quasi-steady state approximation demonstrating how Cdc42 dwell time is related to GEF activity. In summary, the larger peak has an edge in recruiting Bem1-GEF complexes and in retaining both Cdc42 and Bem1-GEF. Thus, the net flux of both species from the cytoplasm to the center of the peak is greater for larger peaks. This mismatch in recruitment and retention for peaks of different sizes provides a mechanism that promotes competition.</p><p>Another mechanism that contributes to competition in the model is based on lateral diffusion of polarity factors in the plane of the membrane. As a peak grows or shrinks, its 'waistline' also grows or shrinks in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We define the 'waistline' as the circle at which Cdc42 concentration is half-maximal (i.e. circle diameter is the peak width at half-height) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>, inset). (The following qualitative argument is not sensitive to the exact definition of the waistline). Monitoring the dissipative flux of Cdc42 due to diffusion across the waistline, we see that a larger peak does not lose as great a proportion of its Cdc42 content as does a smaller peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>). Thus, diffusion provides a more powerful dissipative effect for the smaller peak, favoring the larger peak in a competition scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>If the diffusional flux of Cdc42 out of the peak is plotted on the same graph as the net recruitment rate of Cdc42 from the cytoplasm into the peak (defined as the area within the waistline), then the intersections of the curves represent steady states, where there is no net change in Cdc42 concentration and the peak size remains constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>). From this graph, which is derived from the full simulation of competition in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>, it is easy to understand why the two-peak solution is unstable. The steady state with two peaks of equal size corresponds to the middle intersection point on the flux plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>). If the peaks become slightly unequal, then the diffusional loss is greater than Cdc42 recruitment for the smaller peak (left of intersection point), causing this peak to shrink. However, for the larger peak (right of intersection point), the Cdc42 recruitment flux is greater than the diffusional flux, and this peak grows until the system reaches the one-peak steady state.</p><p>In summary, a computational model based on the behavior of the core polarity factors displays competitive behavior because a larger peak has advantages both in terms of reducing diffusional losses and improved recruitment and retention of factors from the cytoplasm. Thus, in a cell with unequal polarity clusters, the largest will grow at the expense of the others.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Substrate depletion and negative feedback</title><p>As polarity factors are recruited to one or more peaks, the cytoplasmic levels of the polarity factors decline, and it is this substrate depletion from the cytoplasm that ultimately stops clusters from growing further. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, it is apparent that the cytoplasmic levels of polarity factors at the one-peak steady state are slightly lower than those at the two-peak steady state. Thus, once a single peak has been consolidated, the levels of cytoplasmic factors are too low to support a second peak.</p><p>Because substrate depletion is what limits growth in the model, each peak at the two-peak steady state has a lower polarity protein content compared to the single peak that emerges from competition. However, in cells this is rarely the case: instead, the winning peak goes on to shed some polarity factors, and in some cases displays oscillations in polarity protein content or even disappears altogether, leading to polarization elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>). This behavior has been traced to a negative feedback loop that operates via inhibitory phosphorylation of the GEF Cdc24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>), reducing the level of active GEF available for positive feedback.</p><p>Mutants in which the GEF is nonphosphorylatable (<italic>CDC24</italic><sup>38A</sup>) largely short-circuit the major negative feedback mechanism, although a slower negative feedback may also occur via Cdc42-directed GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okada et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>CDC24</italic><sup>38A</sup> mutants, polarity clusters showed competition on similar timescales as that observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>).

As predicted by the substrate depletion scenario, cells that made a single bud developed polarity clusters with a higher polarity protein content than those in cells that made two buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Thus, competition in cells lacking negative feedback proceeds in a manner consistent with the critical features of the model: insatiable positive feedback combined with substrate depletion. The observation that competition proceeds similarly after eliminating a major negative feedback pathway suggests that negative feedback does not greatly affect the competition process in yeast cells.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media10" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11611-media10.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.021</object-id><label>Video 10.</label><caption><title>Simulation of competition between polarity peaks in a computational model.</title><p>Cross-section (left) and 2D (right: color represents Cdc42 concentration) views of the same simulation.

If instead simulations are initiated at the homogeneous steady state by addition of random noise, then several small clusters begin to grow and eventually compete, leaving a single winner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008</xref>). However, a recent modeling study challenged the idea that cluster competition is relevant to yeast polarity establishment, concluding instead that only a single peak of Cdc42, Bem1, and Cdc24 would emerge from initial random noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>). In those simulations, starting noisy distributions of polarity factors merged to form a single very broad but very shallow peak covering an entire hemisphere, which then grew into a single focused peak.

In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>), these were based on estimated molecule numbers per haploid cell as measured by quantitative Western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). However, those numbers were applied to a model sphere with volume 258 fL, whereas haploid yeast cells have an average volume of 44 fL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klis et al., 2014</xref>). We found that if the molecule numbers were adjusted to account for this volume discrepancy, then higher modes also had a positive growth rate in the linear stability analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Thus, with more protein the same model would often yield more than one initial cluster, which would then show competition.</p><p>Another difference between the models concerns the estimate of the diffusion constant for membrane-bound species: 0.0025 μm<sup>2</sup>/s in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008</xref>) and 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup>/s in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>). We repeated the linear stability analysis using different values for the diffusion constant, and found that with slower diffusion, higher modes now had a positive growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Combining slow diffusion with higher protein concentrations had a synergistic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>).</p><p>These findings demonstrate that the number of clusters likely to emerge from initial noise depends on parameter values. In particular, when polarity concentrations are very low and diffusion is fast in this model, the small initial clusters will tend to merge together before growing to form a single detectable peak. Slower diffusion, or the more powerful positive feedback that occurs in the model when polarity factors are more abundant, can lead to growth of separate clusters before they have a chance to merge. Resolution of those clusters then occurs by competition in both models.</p><p>A prediction of these computational findings is that if polarity factor concentrations were lowered, then multi-cluster intermediates should be less prevalent. To test this prediction, we imaged diploid strains in which one copy of <italic>CDC42</italic> or <italic>CDC24</italic> was deleted. Western blotting showed that hemizygotes contained half as much Cdc42 or Cdc24 as homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). We monitored polarity establishment in these strains using a Bem1-GFP probe, whose abundance was similar in all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). Whereas we detected more than one initial cluster in about 50% of wild-type cells, multi-cluster intermediates were detected in only 25% of <italic>CDC24</italic> hemizygotes and 5% of <italic>CDC42</italic> hemizygotes (n&gt;100 cells for each strain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). No multi-cluster instances were observed in cells doubly hemizygous for both <italic>CDC42</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> (n=73) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). In separate experiments, we detected 30% fewer instances of multicluster intermediates in <italic>BEM1-GFP/bem1</italic>Δ hemizygotes than in <italic>BEM1-GFP/BEM1-GFP</italic> homozygotes. Thus, multiple clusters are less frequent in cells that express lower levels of polarity factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most polarized cells generate only one front. Our findings indicate that in yeast, this rule is enforced by a greedy competition between potential polarity sites to accumulate polarity factors.</p><p>We detected multiple polarity clusters as an intermediate stage in polarity establishment in approximately 50% of cells under our imaging conditions (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>). As clusters can occur anywhere on the cell surface and resolution to a single cluster is typically rapid, the frequency with which we detect such intermediates will clearly depend on the spatiotemporal resolution at which imaging is conducted. This may explain why another recent study detected many fewer multi-cluster intermediates when imaging only the medial planes of large cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, there may be strain background differences in multi-cluster frequency, as we found that two-fold reductions in polarity factor abundance reduced the incidence of multi-cluster intermediates considerably.</p><p>Why would polarity protein abundance be correlated with the incidence of multi-cluster intermediates? When polarity factor concentration is low, small initial clusters grow more slowly, perhaps allowing more time for diffusion-based merging of nearby clusters to form a broad and shallow single peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is unclear whether merging is sufficient to explain the reduced incidence of multi-cluster intermediates. In our slow-exchange mutant strains, clusters often co-existed in close proximity for prolonged periods. This suggests that merging is inefficient, presumably because diffusion is very slow in the yeast plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valdez-Taubas and Pelham, 2003</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that whereas the models display hair-trigger Turing instability, in the cells it may take more than just a tiny asymmetry to set off growth of a cluster. Indeed, inclusion of negative feedback can produce this effect in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>). If stochastic events need to cross some threshold of local polarity factor concentration in order to trigger growth of a cluster, then the frequency of such stochastic events may be quite sensitive to polarity protein concentration.</p><p>Given that cells frequently develop more than one initial cluster of polarity factors, there must be a mechanism to eliminate excess clusters so that only one persists to form the front. We suggest that this mechanism involves competition between polarity clusters for components including Cdc42, Bem1, and Cdc24. Each of these factors exchanges constantly and rapidly (2–5 s half-time) between the polarity cluster and the cell interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slaughter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</xref>). Polarity factors released from one cluster may be captured by another, and if larger clusters have an advantage in recruiting and retaining such factors, then they would grow at the expense of smaller clusters. Consistent with that hypothesis, we found that slowing the exchange of Cdc42, Bem1, or Cdc24 in and out of the clusters resulted in correspondingly slower resolution of multi-cluster intermediates, leading to the occasional formation of more than one bud. Combinatorial slowing of polarity factor exchange had additive effects, yielding strains that frequently made more than one bud.</p><p>The finding that <italic>rdi1</italic>Δ mutants occasionally make two buds was also reported recently by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>). Those authors suggested that in the absence of <italic>RDI1</italic>, polarity establishment occurs through a pathway involving actin cables, and that once actin cables attach at a particular site the cell is committed to making a bud there. Our data argue against this hypothesis: we found that several polarity clusters could recruit actin cables (as judged by delivery of vesicles) in both wild-type and <italic>rdi1</italic>Δ mutant cells, but this did not prevent elimination of most clusters. Slow resolution of multi-cluster intermediates also continued in <italic>rdi1</italic>Δ and other slow-exchange strains after septins had been recruited, and even in some instances after buds had begun to grow. Thus, it would seem that neither actin cables nor indeed any other 'stabilizer' acts to lock in a polarity site in cells that have other polarity sites. Notably, slow-exchange mutant cells that developed only one cluster never eliminated that cluster. These findings imply that it is the presence of a competing cluster that promotes the dissolution of other clusters in the same cell.</p><p>In principle, clusters could actively inhibit other clusters in the same cell, rather than simply competing for shared components. Indeed, this type of mechanism has been proposed to explain why neutrophils maintain only one front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houk et al., 2012</xref>). As in yeast, more than one front can transiently co-exist in neutrophils. Each front promotes actin polymerization and membrane protrusion, leading to increased membrane tension, which in turn appears to inhibit GTPase activation. Thus, tension promoted by a dominant GTPase cluster actively extinguishes smaller clusters. This seems unlikely to account for the elimination of excess Cdc42 clusters in yeast. First, membrane tension in yeast (and other walled cells) is determined by turgor pressure rather than actin polymerization. Second, if a yet to be identified inhibition mechanism was functioning in yeast, it is not obvious why slowing the exchange of polarity factors would counteract it. Thus, the simplest hypothesis is that elimination of excess clusters reflects the depletion of polarity factors from losing clusters as they are acquired by a competing cluster.</p><p>As the slow-exchange mutant cells could make up to four buds simultaneously without overexpression or any increase in ploidy, all cell components required for budding must be present in considerable excess of what is required to make a functioning polarity site. If there are sufficient polarity factors to make several functional fronts, why is it that in wild-type cells, competition continues until there is only a single winner? Analyses of a computational model incorporating some of the known interactions among yeast polarity factors suggests that a larger cluster would have significant advantages over a smaller cluster in both recruiting and retaining polarity factors. The insatiably acquisitive nature of this competitive process would lead to an inexorable rich-get-richer spiral in which the winning cluster starves all others of polarity factors. This behavior has clear parallels (though with differences in mechanism) to coarsening phenomena in physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semplice et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Is competition for polarity factors also relevant to other situations in which cells generate a single front? In plant roots, each trichoblast cell polarizes to grow a single root hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole and Fowler, 2006</xref>). Root hair outgrowth is regulated by the GTPase Rop2, a member of a plant-specific 'Rop' family closely related to Cdc42 and Rac GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). Strikingly, mutations in a plant GDI gene lead to the frequent production of multiple growing root hair sites in a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carol et al., 2005</xref>). We speculate that competition between polarity sites for Rop2 may ensure that only one root hair grows per cell. By analogy to our findings for yeast, slowing the exchange of Rop2 may impair competition in that system, allowing more than one site to initiate tip growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>All yeast strains (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) are in the YEF473 background (<italic>his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 trp1-Δ63 ura3-52</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi and Pringle, 1996</xref>) or BF264-15Du background (<italic>ade1 his2 leu2‐3,112 trp1‐1 ura3Δns</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richardson et al., 1989</xref>).

In order to image polarity establishment, we used a hydroxyurea arrest/release synchrony protocol that allows us to catch more cells at the time of polarization and also protects cells from phototoxic stress during imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2012</xref>). Prior to imaging, cells were diluted to 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, arrested with 200 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 30°C for 3 hr, washed, released into fresh synthetic medium for 1 hr, harvested and mounted on a slab composed of medium solidified with 2% agarose (Denville Scientific Inc., Holliston, MA). The slab was placed in a temperature-controlled chamber set to 30°C for imaging. Images were acquired with an Andor Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan) with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 5000 r.p.m. disk unit, and a 100x/1.4 UPlanSApo oil-immersion objective controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Bedford Hills, NY). Images (stacks of 30 images taken at 0.24 µm z-steps or stacks to 15 images taken at 0.5 µm z-steps) were captured by an iXon3 897 EM-CCD camera with 1.2x auxiliary magnification (Andor Technology, UK). The laser power was used at 10% maximal output. An EM-Gain setting of 200 was used for the EM-CCD camera. Exposure to the 488 nm and 561 nm diode lasers was 200 ms.</p><p>To compare the whole cell intensities or peak intensities of polarized foci between strains, two strains were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and put on the same slab for imaging. Strain identity was distinguished using either a unique marker (e.g. Spc42-mCherry) or brief prestaining with fluorescent concanavalin A (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lew and Reed, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Scanning confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope with an Argon/2 and 561nm diode laser, a 63x/1.4 Oil plan-Apochromat 44 07 62 WD 0.19 mm objective, and captured with a GaAsP high QE 32 channel spectral array detector using Zen 2010 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Photobleaching of a polarized focus was performed using the Photokinetics function in the SoftWoRx 5.0 software (Applied Precision, Slovakia) with one iteration, 0.1 s bleaching at 10% power of a 488 laser. Three images were acquired before the bleaching event and the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was monitored by 23 image acquisitions with adapted time intervals. Images were captured using an Evolve<sup>TM</sup> 512 back-thinned EM-CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) with an EM gain of 200. 2% transmission of the light source was used to illuminate cells. Exposure was 250 ms for Bem1-GFP, Bem1-GFP-CAAX and GFP-Cdc42 probes.</p><p>FRAP analyses were performed on unbudded cells with a strong polarized focus. The bleach zone encompassed a circular region around the polarized focus with ~1 µm diameter. Changes in fluorescence intensities in the bleach zone were measured by MetaMorph, and after background intensity subtraction the signal was normalized to the pre-bleaching value. Normalized data were not well fitted by a single exponential, presumably because recovery of bleached cytoplasm within the circular region occurred on a rapid timescale relative to recovery of the membrane signal. Thus, curves were fitted with a double exponential model in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA), and the recovery half-time was calculated using the slower exponential rate constant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP)</title><p>The microscopic settings for FLIP experiments were the same as for FRAP except that the bleaching event was performed with 200 ms laser duration and the exposure was 500 ms for Bem1-GFP and Bem1-GFP-CAAX probes. Cells were imaged once pre-bleach, followed by 35 iterations of bleaching and imaging events at approximately 0.5 s (Bem1-GFP) or 5 s (Bem1-GFP-CAAX) intervals. FLIP analyses were performed on unbudded cells with a strong polarized focus. The bleach zone encompassed a circular region with ~1 µm diameter in the cytoplasm away from the focus. Fluorescence intensities were measured by MetaMorph. In addition to measuring the intensity at the polarity focus, fluorescence intensity in a neighboring cell was measured to correct for indirect bleaching. Changes in fluorescence intensities were calculated by (Intensity<sub>polarity_focus </sub>− Intensity<sub>background</sub>)/ (Intensity<sub>neighbor</sub>− Intensity<sub>background</sub>) and plotted against time. For the Bem1-GFP-TM probe, which does not polarize, fluorescence loss was measured at a patch on the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Deconvolution, image analysis, and quantification</title><p>For timelapse series, images were deconvolved using Huygens Essential software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Netherlands). The classic maximum-likelihood estimation and predicted point spread function method with signal-to-noise ratio 3 was used with a constant background across all images from the same channel on the same day. The output format was 16-bit, unscaled images to enable comparison of pixel values.</p><p>To detect polarity foci in different focal planes, maximum intensity projections were constructed and scored visually for the presence of more than one focus. The coexistence time is the interval between the first frame in which more than one spot was detected and the frame when only one spot was detected.</p><p>To quantify probe intensities in two-color movies, we developed a MATLAB-based <underline>G</underline>raphical <underline>U</underline>ser <underline>I</underline>nterface (GUI) named <italic>Vicinity</italic>. The GUI displays time-lapsed imaging records of summed-projection z-stacks (as TIFF stacks) from two fluorescence channels side by side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), identifies and tracks polarity spots in one of the channels (Bem1), and measures intensity levels of both markers in the vicinity of these spots. The vicinity of a polarity spot is defined as a circular region centered on the spot centroid. The radius of the circle is specified by the user. Image processing by <italic>Vicinity</italic> consists of the following steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>):<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.025</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Screenshot illustrating <italic>Vicinity</italic> GUI operation.</title><p>The upper left of this interface shows the sum projection z-stacks from two fluorescence channels (Bem1-tdTomato and GFP-Sec4 in this case) side by side. The upper right side is the control panel where the threshold for selecting cells and polarity spots, radius of circular regions, filter size, and target size are set. Users can choose to quantify either mean or sum intensity of the pixels in the circular regions. In this example, both the polarity spot and the neck signal were marked in circular regions because their intensities were above the spot threshold, but only the polarity spot was selected for quantification (the track was highlighted in yellow).

The centroid of the Bem1 focus was then used to define a circular region covering the polarity site. The mean pixel intensities within the circular region for both green and red channels were calculated and the corresponding background intensities (determined from one time frame before the polarization signal was detected) were subtracted. Changes in intensity were reported as percent of maximum (sum of all polarized foci) within the period of interest for that cell.</p><p>Quantification of cortical to cytoplasmic fluorescence for Bem1-GFP and Bem1-GFP-CAAX probes was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To compare the whole cell fluorescence intensities or peak intensities of polarized foci between two strains in a mixed-cell experiment, the raw images were denoised with the Hybrid 3D Median Filter plugin in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/hybrid3dmedian.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/hybrid3dmedian.html</ext-link>) and quantified using Volocity (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).</p><p>To measure Bem1-GFP intensity at the patch relative to whole cell fluorescence before bud emergence, a threshold was set to determine both total patch and cell fluorescence for each cell and quantified using Volocity.</p><p>To quantify whole-cell fluorescence, a constant threshold was set across all the stage positions on the same slab that selected the entire cell. The mean pixel intensity of each cell was normalized to the average of the control strain.

Membrane-localized Cdc42 exchanges between GDP-bound and GTP-bound states. GDP/GTP exchange is catalyzed by the GEF, in complex with Bem1. This complex exchanges between membrane and cytoplasm, and can bind reversibly to GTP-Cdc42. Two other Cdc42 regulators are represented implicitly by first-order reactions: GAPs promote GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 (rate constant k2b), and the GDI reversibly exchanges GDP-Cdc42 between membrane and cytoplasm (rate constants k5a and k5b). Positive feedback occurs because binding of the Bem1 complex to GTP-Cdc42 increases local GEF activity in regions with higher GTP-Cdc42, generating more local GTP-Cdc42, which can in turn recruit more Bem1 complex. The equations are deterministic with the exception of the Bem1 complex, which is subject to Gaussian white noise <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mo

At this unstable steady state, each peak maintains a dynamic balance of recruitment and loss of Cdc42 and Bem1 complexes. Continued simulation with noise yielded a minuscule difference between peaks, initiating the growth of one peak at the expense of the other (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). During most of this 'competition' phase, cytoplasmic levels of Cdc42 and Bem1 complexes remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). During competition, we tracked the net rates of recruitment of Cdc42 and Bem1 complexes from the cytoplasm, and the Cdc42 fluxes are plotted as a function of total Cdc42 amount within the peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>. Note that net fluxes from the cytoplasm can be positive even for losing peaks: the losing peak nevertheless shrinks because these fluxes are no longer sufficient to combat loss via diffusion. Towards the end of the competition, the winning peak grew further and cytoplasmic concentrations decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), leading to a reduced net flux from the cytoplasm to the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>).</p><p>The recruitment rate of Bem1-GEF complexes from the cytoplasm to the center of a polarity peak by active Cdc42 (Cdc42T) is given by k<sub>7</sub><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mo>·</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>BemGEF<sub>c</sub><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mo>·</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>Cdc42T.

Here we provide a brief summary of the procedure. A full description of the model and details of the method appear in the Supplemental Information of the original paper. A diagram of the model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>. The model consists of 4 membrane bound species: GTP-Cdc42, GDP-Cdc42, Bem1, and Bem1-Cdc24 complex; and 3 cytosolic species: Cdc42-GDP, Bem1, and Cdc24.</p><p>LSA is used to determine when the spatially homogenous solution to the model equations becomes unstable to infinitesimally small perturbations. The first step in the process is to linearize the model equations around the homogenous solution. The linear equations govern the system’s response to small perturbations and can be used to determine which spatial modes become unstable as a model parameter is varied. Because the computational domain is a sphere, solutions to the linearized equations can be represented as a series solution in terms of spherical harmonics and a modified Bessel function of the first kind. The eigenvalues associate with the modes (l,m) of the spherical harmonic expansion satisfy characteristic equations determined by the model equations and boundary conditions. We numerically find the roots of the characteristic equations and look for eigenvalues that have positive real parts. Eigenvalues with positive real parts indicate exponential growth of that mode and are a sufficient condition for demonstrating the homogenous solution is unstable. A necessary condition for competition between peaks is the existence of more than one eigenvalue with positive real part.</p><p>We first reproduced the published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>) to verify our numerical methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C–E</xref>). We then repeated the analysis for cases in which: 1) the molecular abundance of all components was increased 5.86-fold (258/44) to account for the increased volume of the model sphere (258 fL) compared to the average haploid cell (44 fL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>), 2) the Cdc42 diffusion coefficient was varied between 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and 0.0025 μm <sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>) and 3) both the Cdc42 abundance and diffusion coefficient were varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). In each case, our analysis revealed multiple eigenvalues with positive real parts suggesting the existence of competition between polarity factors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Felipe Bendezu and Sophie Martin (UNIL, Switzerland) for sharing information on <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cdc42-mCherry<sup>sw</sup> prior to publication.

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Role of competition between polarity sites in establishing a unique front&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a member of the Board of the Reviewing Editors and two peer reviewers with expertise in modelling as well as cell polarity, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers and the editors. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviewers and editors acknowledge the importance of the topic they remain concerned about the design of the study itself (articulated by Reviewer 1) and the extent of advance from the computational analyses (as discussed by Reviewer 2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>This manuscript deals with the mechanism that ensures formation of a single polarized cell front. Positive feedback mechanisms are known to promote spontaneous polarization by enhancing stochastic fluctuations of Cdc42 at the cell cortex. Previous observations from the same group showed that, in budding yeast, the emergence of polarized sites can occur at multiple sites simultaneously, but then evolves into a single site. These observations suggest that polarity sites are in competition with each other. However, the underlying mechanism of this competition for singularity is not well understood. Here, the authors propose that competition is governed by the dynamic turnover of polarity proteins at the polarized site.</p><p>While the question is very interesting, the manuscript falls short of demonstrating the mechanism behind polarity sites competition. I believe the main issue is a conceptual flaw in the design of the study, described below.</p><p>To slow down Bem1 and Cdc24 (a scaffold and GEF part of a positive feedback mechanism on Cdc42, respectively) exchange between membrane and cytosol, the authors choose to add a prenylation CAAX box (from Cdc42). Can prenylated proteins readily detach and re-attach at the membrane? For Cdc42, extraction from the membrane requires a dedicated GDI (and indeed their own model does not hypothesize any attachment/detachment of Cdc42-GTP, which is not a substrate (or a poor substrate) for the GDI). The authors state that &quot;Bem1-CAAX exchange between membrane and cytosol was slower than that of Bem1&quot;. However, I do not see any evidence that Bem1-CAAX is cytosolic at all. The internal signal shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> may also be due to endo-membrane association. In addition, as prenylation occurs post-translationally at the ER, prenylated proteins are trafficked through the secretory system. Thus, Bem1-CAAX may well be delivered and retrieved from the plasma membrane via exo- and endocytosis. This allele may thus not be too dissimilar from the Bem1-Snc2 fusion previously published by this group, which also led to multi-bud formation, but was interpreted to do so because it used the slower actin-based feedback system (Howell, Cell 2009). Because of its enhanced membrane binding, the Bem1-CAAX allele certainly also has effects on the levels of available Bem1 (even if global levels are unchanged) and on Bem1 diffusion rates at the membrane. I thus do not think that this approach allows them to specifically slow down membrane-cytosol exchange, nor make any strong conclusion about it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic></p><p>Most or all of the study appears to be conducted in an <italic>rsr1∆</italic> background, though this is not stated. This should be made explicit.</p><p>The first part of the manuscript investigates candidate proteins that may be involved in stabilizing the polarity patch, and concludes that neither actin nor septins appear to have this function. Though I would agree with this conclusion, the description of the septin data seems inaccurate. In <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">video 4</xref>, there is a weak Cdc3 signal on the disassembling left patch at timepoint 8:15, and one before the transient disassembly of the right patch at 9:45 to 11:15, in agreement with recent data that septins contribute in negative feedback for Cdc42 patch disassembly (see for instance Okada et al. Dev Cell 2013). Thus, septins may well contribute to patch destabilization in addition to any competitive mechanism.</p><p>The data on <italic>rdi1∆</italic> slowing down Cdc42 exchange and producing multi-buds reproduces previously published data (see Slaughter, Dev Cell 2009; Freisinger, NatComm 2013). This data could be provided as supplement.</p><p>I am bothered by the fact that the authors explain at the beginning of their manuscript that GFP-Cdc42 is poorly functional (and thus justify use Bem1-GFP instead), but use this allele to quantify Cdc42 turnover without any disclaimer. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, they use a Cdc42-mCherry<sup>SW</sup> allele modeled on a recently published functional allele in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Bendezu et al., PLoS Biol 2015; which should be cited), which they show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is not fully functional in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This information should be better integrated in the text. As it stands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is only referenced in the Materials and methods section (and this also applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Also, the Cdc42-mCherry<sup>SW</sup> strain construction is not entirely clear. This construct is said in the Materials and methods to be integrated at the URA3 locus (under which promoter is not stated), but is said in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> to replace endogenous cdc42. This should be clarified.</p><p>The reasons for the poor viability of the Cdc24-CaaX allele are unclear. Previous work showed that a myristoylated allele of Cdc24, also targeted to the membrane, grows well even in absence of <italic>rsr1</italic> (Shimada et al., EMBO 2004).</p><p>The Bem1-Caax localization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> looks very different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Why?</p><p>I am confused by the limiting or non-limiting nature of polarity factors and the statements made around this by the authors.

They conclude that a competition between different sites rather than a stabilizing factor is responsible for the collapse of all but one polarity zone. They test the corresponding mathematical models of the two hypotheses and find that their earlier published model explains the underlying mechanism. Results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are convincing that a growing bud can be outcompeted and turned off, disproving the stabilizer hypothesis. The comparison of the computational models supports this conclusion, but does not go beyond earlier explanations of the system.</p><p>The conclusion that the competition mechanism works through positive feedback loops without an inhibitor tells me that it works with substrate-depletion. The sentence in the second paragraph of the subsection “Mechanism of competition in a computational model” does not support this idea, but as Bem1 overexpression can also lead to multi-budded cells and its level goes down on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, I</xref> assume Bem1 is (at least part of) the limiting substrate in this Turing-like system. If we follow the theory on such systems (Segel, L. A., and Jackson, J. L. (1972) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 37(3), 545-559), then not only changes in diffusion rate, but also changes in the size of cells could have similar effects as the critical wavelength of the underlying Turing mechanism depends on both. Thus it would support the conclusions if the authors could show that cells with larger size (e.g. HU block and release) can form multiple peaks, especially if combined with the slow diffusing membrane bound proteins. From their current data they might be already able to analyze if there is a correlation between cell size and number of appearing buds in the strains investigated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-E</xref>.</p><p>If it is a competition mechanism with positive feedbacks in a Turing-like system then a gradient of the limiting compound could be shown.

This indeed allowed them to explain the issue with the uniqueness of the final peak, but does not explain how the single peak disappears sometimes. Furthermore, the choice of dropping a potential inhibitor restricted the Turing-type of explanation to the substrate-depletion model. Probably both work better than the stabilizer model, but I feel this as a step back from their earlier results. Indeed it is not clear what new we learned from the model compared to earlier analysis of various versions of it.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Role of competition between polarity sites in establishing a unique front&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I have only minor suggestions for possible further tests of the limiting factor hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic>The authors cite the paper by Otsuji et al. claiming that any initial pattern could end up with a single peak in a substrate-depletion reaction system, but as they correctly also add, this was shown only for mass-conserved Turing systems. They claim that their system is mass-conserved, which might be true for the time window they investigate the cells (&lt; 15 mins). The simulations were initiated with identical perturbations on two sites and followed what steady state is reached. To further validate the limiting factor idea it would be interesting to test what happens as the cells grow. There are several papers (by Crampin and Maini) on the behaviour of the Turing pattern in growing domains. I was wondering how the proposed model would behave if growth is considered.</p><p>A related question could be if and how the model could explain the periodic budding of clb1-6del cells. Could the increase in the concentration of the limiting factor induce a second tip to assemble?</p><p>In general the point I would like to see (at least by the model) is that the second tip can be formed not only for slowed down competition, but also if the second zone is above a given distance from the first or the limiting factor is not limiting anymore. These could further prove the limiting factor hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>My main concern, which was that addition of a prenyl group would lock the proteins on the membrane, has been largely addressed, but I would encourage the authors to slightly extend their work on Cdc24, as suggested below.</p><p>For Bem1-CAAX, the anchor-away experiment is convincing and indeed shows that Bem1-CAAX is mobile on and off the membrane. I would suggest that, in the flow of the paper, it would be better to describe this at the top of the Bem1-CAAX allele description as a way of introducing it as a tool to reduce exchange dynamics, rather than at the end. The conclusions made in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Testing the competition model: reducing polarity protein” would then be more straightforward. In these lines, I would also suggest rephrasing the meaning of FLIP and FRAP quantification, as these do not directly show membrane-cytosol exchange dynamics, because lateral diffusion will also be a contributing factor. The proposed re-organization would also help in understanding the next paragraph, in which the logical link between the slowed membrane-cytosol exchange of prenylated protein and the previous analysis of Cdc42 dynamics is not entirely clear.</p><p>By contrast, the localization of Cdc24-CAAX to the nuclear membrane in haploid cells does not imply a detachment from the membrane. The nuclear membrane is connected to the ER, and it is possible that the relocation occurs as Cdc24-CAAX remains bound to the membrane rather than transit through the cytosol. Thus, the manuscript has been significantly improved and now convincingly shows that Bem1-CAAX shuttles between membrane and cytosol, but the same level of confidence does not apply to Cdc24-CAAX, as it would be predicted to be nuclear, rather than at the nuclear periphery in haploids if that were the case. I would feel much more comfortable if the data was confirmed using an alternative mode of binding these proteins (or at least Cdc24) peripherally to the plasma membrane, for instance through an amphipathic helix, a C2 or a PH domain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1: <italic>While the question is very interesting, the manuscript falls short of demonstrating the mechanism behind polarity sites competition. I believe the main issue is a conceptual flaw in the design of the study, described below. To slow down Bem1 and Cdc24 (a scaffold and GEF part of a positive feedback mechanism on Cdc42, respectively) exchange between membrane and cytosol, the authors choose to add a prenylation CAAX box (from Cdc42). Can prenylated proteins readily detach and re-attach at the membrane? For Cdc42, extraction from the membrane requires a dedicated GDI (and indeed their own model does not hypothesize any attachment/detachment of Cdc42-GTP, which is not a substrate (or a poor substrate) for the GDI). The authors state that &quot;Bem1-CAAX exchange between membrane and cytosol was slower than that of Bem1&quot;. However, I do not see any evidence that Bem1-CAAX is cytosolic at all. The internal signal shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> may also be due to endo-membrane association. In addition, as prenylation occurs post-translationally at the ER, prenylated proteins are trafficked through the secretory system. Thus, Bem1-CAAX may well be delivered and retrieved from the plasma membrane via exo- and endocytosis. This allele may thus not be too dissimilar from the Bem1-Snc2 fusion previously published by this group, which also led to multi-bud formation, but was interpreted to do so because it used the slower actin-based feedback system (Howell, Cell 2009).</italic></p><p>We fully agree that it is critical to show that Bem1−CAAX is not locked onto the membrane like Bem1−Snc2; if it were, then we would just have recapitulated the rewiring results of Howell 2009. We apologize for not making a convincing case for that, and thank the reviewer for catching the flaw. We have revised the paper significantly, and now show new data to bolster our case, as follows:</p><p>For Bem1−Snc2, polarization requires active endocytosis mediated by a Snc2 endocytosis motif (Howell et al. Cell2009) and actin−directed secretion on cables nucleated by the formin Bni1 (Chen et al. Mol. Biol. Cell2012). In contrast, Bem1−CAAX has no added endocytosis motif, and we now show that it does not require Bni1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Moreover, we show that Bem1−CAAX polarizes in the presence of Latrunculin A, implying that neither actin cable−directed secretion nor actin patch−dependent endocytosis is required (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, using a rapamycin−induced dimerization “anchor away” strategy we show that Bem1−CAAX can become sequestered away from the polarity site through binding to ribosomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), implying that it exchanges between membrane and cytoplasm.</p><p>We have not repeated these experiments for Cdc24−CAAX, but we believe that it behaves similarly. This is supported by Cdc24−CAAX localization in haploids. Unlike diploids, haploids express Far1, a protein that is important for mating and sequesters a pool of Cdc24 in the nucleus. Similarly, haploid but not diploid Cdc24−CAAX cells displayed Cdc24−CAAX enriched in the nuclear periphery (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Neither Bem1−Snc2 nor Cdc24−Snc2 displayed this nuclear signal. We conclude that Bem1−CAAX and Cdc24−CAAX do exchange (albeit slowly) between the membrane and the cytoplasm, and do not polarize by the different vesicular mechanism employed by Bem1−Snc2.</p><p>We note that considerable published data from other labs supports the idea that Cdc42 itself can transit through the cytoplasm without GDI. For example, Das et al. (2012, Nature Cell Biology 14, 304−312) show using FCS that the rapid−mobility fraction of Cdc42 (presumably freely diffusing protein) drops only about 2−fold in <italic>rdi1</italic> mutants compared to wild−type cells (see their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). That is, there is still a substantial pool of cytoplasmic Cdc42 in cells lacking the GDI. In biochemical assays involving the exchange of Cdc42 from one liposome to another, Johnson et al. (2009, J Biol Chem 284, 23860−23871) also concluded that Cdc42 comes off membranes with or without the GDI, and that the main effect of the GDI is to stabilize Cdc42 in the aqueous phase. Thus, it seems most likely that Cdc42 exchanges between membrane and cytoplasm readily (if slowly) without the GDI. We speculate that binding interactions of GTP−Cdc42 make it much less prone than GDP−Cdc42 to come off the membrane. We now include some of this discussion in a newly added paragraph (fifth paragraph of the subsection “Testing the competition model: reducing polarity protein mobility”).</p><p><italic>Because of its enhanced membrane binding, the Bem1-CAAX allele certainly also has effects on the levels of available Bem1 (even if global levels are unchanged) and on Bem1 diffusion rates at the membrane. I thus do not think that this approach allows them to specifically slow down membrane-cytosol exchange, nor make any strong conclusion about it.</italic> </p><p>It is not clear to us that diffusion of Bem1−CAAX at the membrane would be different from that of Bem1, as the majority of Bem1 at the membrane is expected to be associated (directly or indirectly) with Cdc42, which has the same prenyl tail.</p><p>However, we do agree that Bem1−CAAX association with the membrane may translate to less “available” Bem1, as peak Bem1−CAAX levels at the polarity site are lower than peak Bem1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). To ask whether reducing available Bem1 might similarly slow competition and cause multi−budding, we have now examined <italic>BEM1/bem1Δ</italic> (and <italic>CDC24</italic>/<italic>cdc24Δ</italic>) hemizygous strains. Except for a lower incidence of multi−cluster intermediates, these cells behave similarly to the wild−type in terms of competition timing and do not produce multibudded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1</xref>). We conclude that unlike Bem1−CAAX or Cdc24− CAAX, reducing available Bem1 or Cdc24 does not dramatically slow competition. On the other hand, overexpression of Bem1 does slow competition (Howell et al. Cell 2009), though nowhere near as much as Bem1−CAAX.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Competition in <italic>BEM1/bem1Δ</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic>/<italic>cdc24Δ</italic> hemizygotes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coexistence time for multi−cluster intermediates is plotted (each dot is one cell) for strains of the indicated genotypes.

In the multi-site, multi-budded cells, is the local abundance of the polarity factors reduced compared to the single-site, single-budded situation?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in our presentation. The polarity protein amounts that need to be clustered to specify a successful polarity site may be quite small, so that a cell has enough polarity factors to form several buds, and could do so if each site were content to amass only as much as they needed. But instead polarity sites are insatiable due to positive feedback, and the “winner” of the competition continues to grow until the cytoplasmic pool of polarity factors is sufficiently depleted to stop further growth. At this point, there are insufficient cytoplasmic levels to support another cluster.</p><p>We have added a section, “Substrate depletion and negative feedback”, that deals with some of these questions, including the reviewer’s query regarding the levels of polarity factors in each site in multi−site cells. This issue is complicated by the presence of negative feedback: as published elsewhere (Howell et al. Cell 2012, Kuo et al. Current Biology 2014), the winning peak proceeds to disperse polarity proteins and its content can oscillate after it has won the competition. The negative feedback involves Cdc24 phosphorylation. To address the reviewer’s question, we crippled negative feedback by replacing Cdc24 with the mostly nonphosphorylatable Cdc24<sub>38A</sub>, and we deleted <italic>RDI1</italic> so that cells would sometimes make two buds. Then we quantified the amount of Bem1−GFP in the polarity patch immediately before bud emergence, for cells that made either just one bud or two buds (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Despite considerable cell−to−cell variability, the results show that two−site cells indeed have less Bem1 in each site than one−site cells.</p><p><italic>I am further confused by how the statement &quot;because of positive feedback, stochastic activation of a small amount of Cdc42 somewhere on the membrane leads to further accumulation of active Cdc42 until depletion of the cytoplasmic pools of polarity proteins stops the process&quot; can be reconciled with the statement in the next paragraph that &quot;the uniqueness of the Cdc42 peak is not due to insufficient Cdc42 or Bem1-Cdc24&quot;. Does the drop in cytosolic Bem1 after competition resolution predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> really happen?

But <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> showed an overshoot of Bem1 during competition and lower level after.</italic> </p><p>Please see the answer to the previous question. The more complex situation in cells is due to negative feedback.</p><p> <italic>One conclusion from the data is that the reduced competition observed in Bem1-CaaX and</italic> rdi1∆ <italic>conditions does not qualitatively alter the model, but quantitatively changes parameters and thus the timescale of competition. This would suggest that the multi-budding phenotype could be rescued by delaying G1-S transition until resolution of the polarity patches to a single one. Is that the case?</italic> </p><p>Good question. Unfortunately we do not understand what determines the approximately 10 minute interval between initial polarization and bud emergence. Blocking G1ƒS (e.g. with HU) does not affect the timing of polarity or bud emergence, and blocking Start (ClnƒCDK activation) would affect both polarization and budding. We do not know how to delay budding without affecting polarity establishment. We are working on this question, but cannot yet do the requested experiment.</p><p> <italic>In the final part of the manuscript, the authors aim to resolve a difference between the output of their model, which yields multiple initial clusters resolving into one, and the model from Klunder et al., 2013, which showed a single initial broad peak sharpening over time, and conclude that the differences are due to parameter value choices. This is an interesting reconciling finding, but their choice of parameters for Cdc42 lateral diffusion is low. The value chosen, 0.0025µm2/s was measured for transmembrane proteins. More recent values for Cdc42 were obtained, ranging from 0.013 µm2/s to 0.0061 µm2/s in</italic> S. cerevisiae <italic>(Marco et al., Cell 2007 and Freisinger et al., NatComm 2013) and up to 10-fold higher using functionally tagged Cdc42 in</italic> S. pombe <italic>(Bendezu et al., PloS Biol 2015).</italic> </p><p>The question of the membrane diffusion constant for Cdc42 is a difficult one. The estimate from Marco et al. involved fitting FRAP data on the assumption that CAAX−containing proteins cannot exchange between membrane and cytoplasm. But as discussed above, we believe that assumption to be wrong. Thus, the fit would overestimate the diffusion constant because it doesn’t take “hopping” on and off into account. The Bendezu work is much more convincing, because the shape of the cell permits bleaching of a larger area and GDP−Cdc42 diffuses much more rapidly in the membrane so the measurement is not confounded by the relatively slower exchange (which unlike Marco they do incorporate in generating their fits). But, as they point out, their measurement refers only to GDP−Cdc42:GTP−Cdc42 diffusion was too slow to measure. Of course, there is also no guarantee that the two yeasts would necessarily have a similar diffusion environment as their cell walls are quite different. The relevant (slow) diffusion constant in our model applies to GTP−Cdc42, since GDP−Cdc42 already has high mobility due to its ability to exchange into the cytoplasm. We admit that we do not have a valid measure for this, but we note that no model with rapid diffusion of GTP−Cdc42 would be able to explain how polarity sites in such close proximity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> cell 2, or especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> cell 2) could avoid merging together. With specific reference to our re−analysis of Klunder et al. 2013, we note that our main conclusion holds even if we keep their higher diffusion constant, once the volume correction is applied.</p><p> <italic>Finally, given most the experiments are done modifying Bem1 properties, it would be necessary to test the effect of limiting Bem1 levels and thus constructing Bem1 hemizygote diploids.</italic></p><p>We have now constructed the <italic>BEM1</italic> hemizygote diploids: the frequency with which we observe multi−cluster intermediates was reduced (by approximately 33%, based on Bem1−GFP movies), while resolution of the intermediates occurred normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1</xref>). This is in contrast to Bem1−CAAX, where multi−cluster intermediates were morefrequent and took much longer to resolve. Thus, we would argue that the slowed competition is due to slower trafficking of Bem1−CAAX rather than reduced availability.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Wu et al. test two alternative hypotheses on the regulation of the establishment of a unique polarity site in budding yeast cells.

Results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are convincing that a growing bud can be outcompeted and turned off, disproving the stabilizer hypothesis.

The sentence in the second paragraph of the subsection “Mechanism of competition in a computational model” does not support this idea, but as Bem1 overexpression can also lead to multi-budded cells and its level goes down on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, I</xref> assume Bem1 is (at least part of) the limiting substrate in this Turing-like system. If we follow the theory on such systems (Segel, L. A., and Jackson, J. L. (1972) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 37(3), 545-559), then not only changes in diffusion rate, but also changes in the size of cells could have similar effects as the critical wavelength of the underlying Turing mechanism depends on both. Thus it would support the conclusions if the authors could show that cells with larger size (e.g. HU block and release) can form multiple peaks, especially if combined with the slow diffusing membrane bound proteins. From their current data they might be already able to analyze if there is a correlation between cell size and number of appearing buds in the strains investigated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-E</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct with regard to substrate depletion, and we have added a new section to emphasize that point. The sentence was intended to convey the idea that the total amount of polarity factors suffices for several buds, which does not contradict the substrate depletion idea, but we concede that the text was unclear and have deleted that sentence and re−written to try to make the issue clearer, as discussed above.</p><p>Stability analysis as in Segel and Jackson only refers to the system very close to the homogeneous steady state: once we leave that regime (and competition occurs well into the nonlinear regime), stability analysis cannot predict how many peaks will survive to the polarized steady state. It is true that a precondition for &gt;1 peak is instability to higher wave numbers (which is why Klunder et al. appeared to provide a challenge to the competition hypothesis), but beyond that, stability analysis does not predict anything about how many peaks there will be.</p><p>With regard to the expectation that larger cells would develop more (stable) clusters, Otsuji et al. (2007, PLoS Comp Biol 3, 1040−1054) showed that a mass−conserved Turing system (of which ours is one example) could in principle yield a single−peak final steady state regardless of size. They did not determine what it is that causes some models to behave this way while others don’t, and it is one of our goals to elucidate that, but we aren’t there yet.</p><p>Experimentally, we have not noticed a consistent correlation between cell size and the number of buds, but it may be we simply have not reached a large enough size.</p><p><italic>If it is a competition mechanism with positive feedbacks in a Turing-like system then a gradient of the limiting compound could be showed. Probably by expressing in low level, an extra copy of Bem1-GFP could show an actual gradient around polarity zones and the change in size of these zones during competition.</italic> </p><p>The gradient in the cytoplasm predicted by modeling is minuscule (&lt;0.1%), because of rapid cytoplasmic diffusion. There is also a technical issue that would preclude detection of dips in cytoplasmic concentrations under each membrane peak: diffraction of light from the probes concentrated in the peak at the membrane would mask the dip in the cytoplasm. We apologize if we misinterpreted this question.</p><p><italic>The authors chose to drop the negative feedback loop from their last model (Kuo et al. 2014) and replace with a constant high GAP activity. This indeed allowed them to explain the issue with the uniqueness of the final peak, but does not explain how the single peak disappears sometimes. Furthermore, the choice of dropping a potential inhibitor restricted the Turing-type of explanation to the substrate-depletion model. Probably both work better than the stabilizer model, but I feel this as a step back from their earlier results. Indeed it is not clear what new we learned from the model compared to earlier analysis of various versions of it.</italic> </p><p>We believe that we have learned two things.</p><p>1) We provide the first explanation as to why the model shows competition (the fact that it does so was known, but we dissect the basis by breaking the process down to its parts). This was not obvious (to us, at least) from just looking at the rather complex model.</p><p>2) We explain why the Klunder et al. model did not allow for competition, and account for the discrepancies between the models.</p><p>We completely agree that negative feedback is necessary to explain features like single−peak disappearance, but that is not the focus of this study. Mutants that reduce negative feedback considerably (<italic>CDC24</italic><sup>38A</sup>) still show competition, with dynamics similar to wild−type (Kuo et al. 2014). In addition, we now show that mutants with reduced negative feedback still generate two−budded cells when exchange of Cdc42 is slowed (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, we believe that negative feedback is unlikely to be central to the process of competition. We also note that a similarly−parameterized model that includes negative feedback displays competition behavior that looks quite similar to that in the model lacking negative feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11611.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Competition in a model with negative feedback.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshots of competition from two−peak unstable steady state.

This makes the full model very complex to analyze, and we prefer to defer that analysis until we get a better understanding of the factors that can eliminate competition to allow coexistence in models with negative feedback.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</p><p><italic>The authors cite the paper by Otsuji et al. claiming that any initial pattern could end up with a single peak in a substrate-depletion reaction system, but as they correctly also add, this was shown only for mass-conserved Turing systems. They claim that their system is mass-conserved, which might be true for the time window they investigate the cells (&lt; 15 mins). The simulations were initiated with identical perturbations on two sites and followed what steady state is reached. To further validate the limiting factor idea it would be interesting to test what happens as the cells grow. There are several papers (by Crampin and Maini) on the behaviour of the Turing pattern in growing domains. I was wondering how the proposed model would behave if growth is considered.</italic> </p><p>This is certainly an interesting question, which we are beginning to investigate. However, we do not yet know what general rules apply (if any) in growing domains, and we believe that this is an issue that will require considerable work to resolve, and lies outside the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>A related question could be if and how the model could explain the periodic budding of clb1-6del cells. Could the increase in the concentration of the limiting factor induce a second tip to assemble?</italic> </p><p><italic>In general the point I would like to see (at least by the model) is that the second tip can be formed not only for slowed down competition, but also if the second zone is above a given distance from the first or the limiting factor is not limiting anymore. These could further prove the limiting factor hypothesis.</italic> </p><p>The clb1-6del cells are really interesting, but not directly related to the issue of competition. Basically they always have one polarity/growth site like wild-type cells (at least for the first few cycles): it is just that after growing in one direction for a while the site shifts back to the mother and starts a new bud, repeatedly. Why the site switches is unclear, though Haase and colleagues argue that it is driven by an internal transcriptional oscillator.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>My main concern, which was that addition of a prenyl group would lock the proteins on the membrane, has been largely addressed, but I would encourage the authors to slightly extend their work on Cdc24, as suggested below. For Bem1-CAAX, the anchor-away experiment is convincing and indeed shows that Bem1-CAAX is mobile on and off the membrane. I would suggest that, in the flow of the paper, it would be better to describe this at the top of the Bem1-CAAX allele description as a way of introducing it as a tool to reduce exchange dynamics, rather than at the end. The conclusions made in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Testing the competition model: reducing polarity protein” would then be more straightforward. In these lines, I would also suggest rephrasing the meaning of FLIP and FRAP quantification, as these do not directly show membrane-cytosol exchange dynamics, because lateral diffusion will also be a contributing factor. The proposed re-organization would also help in understanding the next paragraph, in which the logical link between the slowed membrane-cytosol exchange of prenylated protein and the previous analysis of Cdc42 dynamics is not entirely clear.</italic> </p><p>We have reorganized the text and reordered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> as suggested. In addition we have rephrased the interpretation of FLIP and FRAP as suggested. We agree that this flow is more intuitive and thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p><italic>By contrast, the localization of Cdc24-CAAX to the nuclear membrane in haploid cells does not imply a detachment from the membrane. The nuclear membrane is connected to the ER, and it is possible that the relocation occurs as Cdc24-CAAX remains bound to the membrane rather than transit through the cytosol. Thus, the manuscript has been significantly improved and now convincingly shows that Bem1-CAAX shuttles between membrane and cytosol, but the same level of confidence does not apply to Cdc24-CAAX, as it would be predicted to be nuclear, rather than at the nuclear periphery in haploids if that were the case. I would feel much more comfortable if the data was confirmed using an alternative mode of binding these proteins (or at least Cdc24) peripherally to the plasma membrane, for instance through an amphipathic helix, a C2 or a PH domain.</italic> </p><p>We agree that localization of Cdc24-CAAX to the nuclear membrane could in principle occur without detachment from the membrane (though the fact that the integral membrane Cdc24-Snc2 does not go to the nuclear membrane suggests it actually does involve detachment). We have removed that data and argument from the paper. However, it seems to us logical that if the polybasic-prenyl motif doesn’t anchor Bem1-GFP to the membrane, it wouldn’t anchor any other cytoplasmic protein (like Cdc24) either.</p><p>With regard to amphipathic helix, C2, or PH domains: these are already present in the endogenous polarity proteins – Cdc24 has a PH domain, Bem1 has a PX domain, and Cdc42 effectors (Ste20, Cla4, Gic1, Gic2, Boi1, Boi2) that bind Bem1 all have amphipathic helices or PH domains. These are thought to provide very weak but essential membrane binding domains (Takahashi and Pryciak, 2008., Mol Biol Cell 18: 4945-4956). Because they are so weak, we believe that adding them to Cdc24 would be unlikely to slow dynamics significantly enough to have a big effect on competition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
