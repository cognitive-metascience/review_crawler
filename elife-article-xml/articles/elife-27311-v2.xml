Nevertheless, most antibodies have similar architectures, with the variable immunoglobulin domains of the heavy and light chain each providing three hypervariable loops, which are varied to generate diversity. The recent identification of a novel class of antibody in humans from malaria endemic regions of Africa was therefore surprising as one hypervariable loop contains the entire collagen-binding domain of human LAIR1. Here, we present the structure of the Fab fragment of such an antibody. We show that its antigen-binding site has adopted an architecture that positions LAIR1, while itself being occluded. This therefore represents a novel means of antigen recognition, in which the Fab fragment of an antibody acts as an adaptor, linking a human protein insert with antigen-binding potential to the constant antibody regions which mediate immune cell recruitment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27311.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27311.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27311.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When bacteria, viruses or parasites invade the human body, the immune system responds by producing proteins called antibodies. Antibodies recognize and bind to molecules (known as antigens) on the surface of the invaders. This binding can either neutralize the invader directly or trigger signals that cause other parts of the immune system to destroy it.</p><p>Our blood contains a huge range of different antibody molecules that each bind to a different antigen. This is despite most human antibodies having the same basic shape and structure. Six loops, known as complementarity determining regions (CDRs), emerge from the surface of the antibody to form the surface that recognizes the antigen. However, variations in the structure of the loops alter this surface enough to allow different antibodies to recognize completely different molecules.</p><p>In 2016, a new class of antibodies was identified. Unlike previously identified antibodies, these molecules had an entire human protein, called LAIR1, inserted into one of their CDR loops. Members of this group of antibodies bind to a molecule, known as a RIFIN, that is found on the surface of human red blood cells that are infected with the parasite that causes malaria.</p><p>How do LAIR1-containing antibodies bind to their RIFIN targets? Hsieh and Higgins investigated this question by using a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the antibody. This revealed that instead of binding directly to an antigen, all of the six CDR loops in the LAIR1-containing antibody bind to the LAIR1 insert. By doing so, LAIR1 is oriented in a manner that enables it to bind to the RIFIN molecule from the parasite.</p><p>This is the first known example of an antibody that recruits another protein to bind to an antigen rather than binding directly to the pathogen itself. A future challenge will be to see if other antibodies exist that use this mechanism and whether it can be employed to design new therapeutic antibodies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27311.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27311.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>antibody structure</kwd><kwd>LAIR1</kwd><kwd>novel antigen recognition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101020/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>Fu-Lien</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taiwan Bio-Development Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>Fu-Lien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of a human antibody in which the variable loops position a human protein LAIR1 for antigen recognition, reveals a novel and indirect mode of antibody function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The antigen-binding sites of human antibodies commonly adopt similar structures, with the light and heavy chains each providing three hypervariable loops that combine to form a surface that is complementary to the epitope. While the sequences of these complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are highly variable, five of the six CDRs (L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2) can be classified into a number of relatively small sets, with similar lengths and architectures, and their structures are predictable from sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chothia et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">North et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the third CDR loop of the heavy chain (CDR H3) is more structurally diverse, most likely due to its location close to the V(D)J recombination site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Weitzner et al., 2015</xref>). Human antibodies typically have CDR H3 lengths of 8–16 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zemlin et al., 2008</xref>) while mouse antibodies have CDR H3 lengths of 5–26 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zemlin et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>However, recent years have seen the discovery of antibodies with major differences from the norm, in particular due to changes in the length of the third CDR of the heavy chain. A set of antibodies with broadly neutralizing potential against HIV is one such example. Here, the third CDR loop of the heavy chain is elongated, allowing it to reach through the glycan shield that surrounds the gp120 protein to bind an otherwise concealed epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McLellan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pancera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pejchal et al., 2010</xref>). Such antibodies are rare, making the induction of a broadly inhibitory response against HIV a major challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In a more extreme example, while the majority of bovine antibodies have CDR H3 loops of around 23 residues, around 10% contain a highly elongated third CDR loop of up to 69 residues, containing a small disulphide rich domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Saini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). These domains adopt a conserved β-sheet structure that displays variable loops and are each presented on an elongated, but rigid β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stanfield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). While it is clear that the additional domains play an important role in ligand binding, the remaining five CDR loops are also exposed and further studies are needed to see the contribution that they make (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A recent study identified a group of even more unusual human antibodies in malaria endemic regions of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). These antibodies were discovered through their capacity to agglutinate human erythrocytes infected with different strains of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum,</italic> and they bind to a subset of RIFIN proteins. These RIFINs are displayed by the parasite on infected erythrocyte surfaces and are of uncertain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kyes et al., 1999</xref>). The antibodies show a remarkable adaptation with an intact 96 residue protein, LAIR1, inserted into the third CDR loop of the antibody heavy chain. Indeed, LAIR1 was shown to be essential for the antibody to interact with RIFINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we reveal the structure of the Fab fragment of one of these antibodies, showing how LAIR1 is presented on the antibody surface and drawing conclusions about how this class of antibody can recognize its ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We expressed the two chains that make up the Fab fragment of antibody MGD21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>) in a secreted form from HEK293 cells. This antibody has a kappa light chain (VK1-8/JK5) and a heavy chain in which LAIR1 has been inserted into CDR H3. This fragment was purified and crystallised, allowing a dataset to be collected to 2.52 Å resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using LAIR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brondijk et al., 2010</xref>) and the Fab fragment of antibody OX117 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nettleship et al., 2008</xref>) as search models. This identified two copies of the MGD21 Fab fragment in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. A model was built for residues 2–211 of the light chain and 1–351 (with 214–219 and 264–270 disordered) of the heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The long axis of the LAIR1 insert is positioned with the β-strands aligned approximately perpendicular to the groove between the heavy and light chain CDRs and the insertion and linkers interact with, and occlude all five of the remaining CDR loops. The N- and C-termini of LAIR1 lie at opposite ends of its structure, necessitating long linkers between the sites from which CDR3 emerges from the antibody heavy chain and each terminus of the LAIR1 insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The N-terminal linker (linker 1) is 10 residues long and adopts a simple loop structure that joins the antibody variable domain to the N-terminus of the LAIR1 insert. The C-terminal linker (linker 2) is longer at 34 residues and is more complex in structure. It extends out from the C-terminus of the LAIR1 insert before zigzagging back towards the insertion site in the heavy chain variable domain. It is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the LAIR1 insert and to the antibody heavy chain as well as by a disulphide bond to C93 of the antibody light chain. The linkers of the LAIR1-containing antibodies sequenced to date are variable both in length and content, involving different parts of the intronic regions of the LAIR1 gene, or intergenic sequences of chromosome 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). The arrangement of these linkers, which radiate away from the remainder of the antibody, will in theory accommodate almost limitless variation in both length and sequence without disturbing the packing of LAIR1 against the variable domains of the antibody.</p><p>The five CDR loops lacking the LAIR1 insertion are representatives of previously identified canonical classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Martin and Thornton, 1996</xref>). However, a search using the Abcheck server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Martin, 1996</xref>) identified seven unusual residues within the antibody structure; C91, C93, D97 and I106 from the light chain and Y28, R34 and Q54 from the heavy chain, all within the CDR loops. In particular, C91, C93 and D97 all lie in CDR3 of the light chain, perhaps facilitating its interaction with linker 2. Indeed, the most unusual residue is C93, which is found in only 0.096% of light chains, and is the residue that forms a disulphide bond with linker 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The heavy chain CDR H3 loop has a base that adopts the ‘kinked’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shirai et al., 1999</xref>), with the loop rapidly spreading to the two termini of LAIR1.</p><p>In previous structures of antibodies with extended heavy chain CDR3 loops, the remaining five CDRs of the antibody are exposed, with the potential to engage in antigen binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McLellan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stanfield et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). One of the remarkable features of the LAIR1-containing antibody is therefore the occlusion of large parts of each of the remaining five CDRs, with these loops each interacting directly with the LAIR1 insert and/or linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The degree of occlusion of the CDRs by LAIR1 was determined by accessibility to a 1.4 Å probe in the presence and absence of LAIR1 and the linkers. Each of these five CDR loops was partly occluded by the presence of LAIR1 or the linkers (occluding 12.7% of the accessible surface area of CDR L1, 18.3% of CDR L2, 47.3% of CDR L3, 34.7% of CDR H1 and 16.0% of CDR H2). Indeed, both the first and second CDRs of the heavy chain directly contact the LAIR1 insert (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, each of the three CDR loops of the light chain interacts with one of the two linkers, with interactions including a disulphide bond between C93 of the light chain and C223 of linker 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

Firstly, the structures of the two molecules of the antibody in the asymmetric unit of the crystal superimpose closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is unlikely that this is due solely to constraints from crystal packing as LAIR1 is anchored to the variable domains of the antibody through three fixed positions: the attachment sites of the two linkers, and the disulphide bond between light chain C93 and heavy chain C223 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, each of the five CDR loops not baring a LAIR1 insertion makes direct interactions with either LAIR1 or the linker, through contacts found in both copies of the antibody in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. This will stabilize a tight association between LAIR1 and the antibody variable domains. As these antibodies can include multiple different light chains, and very different linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>), these interaction will not be replicated precisely across the antibody family, but some variant of interaction between light chain CDRs and the linkers is likely.</p><p>A comparison of the LAIR1 insert with that of the chromosomal copy of LAIR1 (referred to below as germ line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brondijk et al., 2010</xref>) reveals that no global structural changes have taken place (root mean square deviation 0.43 Å for the 82 Cα residues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,F</xref>). Indeed, the LAIR1 insertion in the MDG21 antibody differs in only 13 positions relative to the germ line sequence. Mapping these sites onto the structure reveals that they do not alter residues through which the LAIR1 insert interacts with the rest of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Presumably, the stable interaction between LAIR1 and the antibody has therefore come instead from adaptations to the CDR loops. In contrast, polymorphisms are mostly located on the surface of LAIR1 distal to the rest of the antibody and have the potential to alter its interaction with its original ligand, collagen, and with the RIFIN proteins which are the target of these antibodies.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27311.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure and polymorphism in the LAIR1 insertion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An alignment of germ line LAIR1 (cyan) with the antibody LAIR1 insertion (red).

The structure of germ line LAIR1, together with NMR analysis and mutagenesis, allowed the mapping of residues critical for the collagen interaction onto a LAIR1 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brondijk et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, mutations in residues R59, E61 and R65 have a significant impact on collagen binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brondijk et al., 2010</xref>). These residues map onto the surface of LAIR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that is most exposed in the context of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, mapping of the polymorphisms found in the 27 LAIR1-containing antibodies sequenced to date shows that large parts of this surface are mutable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The polymorphisms in LAIR1 include R149N, which is in the position equivalent to R65 in germ line LAIR1 and this change may impact collagen binding. A second polymorphism, found in 7/27 of the antibodies (including MGD21) alters the N-linked glycosyation site at residue 69 of LAIR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wollscheid et al., 2009</xref>), which may alter collagen binding and/or increase RIFIN binding, but is not conserved across the antibody family. Indeed 11 of the 27 sequenced antibodies have mutations in at least one of the residues implicated in collagen binding, or other polymorphisms that reduce the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The LAIR1-containing antibodies are a remarkable variant of the standard immunoglobulin fold. While the majority of mammalian antibodies have predicable and short CDRs, the third CDR of the heavy chain can accommodate usual diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McLellan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Weitzner et al., 2015</xref>). This is seen in the elongated CDR3 of the broadly neutralizing antibodies that interact with HIV surface proteins and in the insertion of a β-hairpin and disulphide-rich domain in a fraction of bovine antibodies. However, in both of these cases, only the heavy chain CDR3 is altered and the remaining CDR loops remain exposed for antigen binding. The LAIR1-containing antibodies are an exception to this, with the LAIR1-insert interacting with, and partly occluding, all five of the remaining CDR loops. In many ways, the structure resembles an antibody with CDR loops adapted for LAIR1 binding, into which LAIR1 has also been inserted.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27311.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the LAIR1-containing antibody with other unusual antibodies.</title><p>The structure of the LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibody is compared with a classical mouse monoclonal antibody (9AD4; PDB code 4U0R), a human monoclonal antibody with broadly neutralizing potential against HIV (PG16; PDB code 4DQ0) and a bovine monoclonal antibody (BLV5B8; PDB code 4K3E).

Indeed, it has been shown that the LAIR1 insert alone can bind to infected erythrocytes, as can a LAIR1-containing antibody with the heavy and light chain regions exchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly an antibody in which the LAIR1 insert has been exchanged for the unaltered germ line LAIR1 did not bind to erythrocytes, although the folding of this chimera was not tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the capacity of RIFINs to bind to unaltered LAIR1 alone has not yet been reported. Indeed, it seems most likely that LAIR1, or a highly related homologue, is the physiological ligand of the group of RIFINs that are recognized by these antibodies and that its insertion into the Fab fragment of an antibody allows it to be affinity matured to mobilise it for immune recognition and recruitment of immune cells. This remarkable LAIR1-containing antibody therefore uses the classical hypervariable loops for a novel function: to position an inserted auxillary domain for antigen recognition. The classical Fab fragment therefore now acts as a link between a ligand for a pathogen surface receptor and the Fc region of the antibody with its immune recruitment capability. It will be fascinating to see if this is a paradigm that is repeated in other novel antibodies, as yet undiscovered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction, protein expression and purification</title><p>Two synthetic complementary DNA clones based on MGD21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2016</xref>) were obtained from GeneArt (ThermoFisher, UK).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Robyn Stanfield (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a very interesting structure, that of a LAIR1-containing Fab from a human antibody. This is possibly one of the most interesting Fab structures ever reported, and the paper could become a real classic if the authors will include a more detailed analysis of the structure and comparison of its features with those from 'normal' Fabs. We have the following suggestions and concerns:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most interesting part of the new structure is that the inserted LAIR1 domain occludes the antibody's combining site, which is relevant if the LAIR1 domain is rigidly anchored in such a way to truly preclude access to the CDRs. However, the manuscript makes the point that the CDR H3 linkers are long and flexible, so perhaps the occlusion of the combining is not obligate, but represents the arrangement of the LAIR1 domain in this crystal packing. This should be addressed by an analysis of the different crystal packing environments for the two Fabs in the asymmetric unit of the crystals and a discussion of whether the LAIR1 addition shows the same interactions with the Fab in both copies. A deeper discussion of whether the LAIR1 domain is rigidly docked to the Fab or not, including consideration of crystal contacts limiting domain movement, should be added to a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) Related to point 1, the authors can also address whether the LAIR1 domain is rigidly docked to the Fab by discussing whether there are any unusual residues in the Fab framework regions that might be important for interactions with the LAIR domain. Andrew Martin has a website that will identify unusual amino acids in Fabs.</p><p>3) Also related to point 1, the authors should show surface areas accessible to a 1.4 Å probe on the CDRs for the structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This would be a nice way to demonstrate that the CDRs are inaccessible in the LAIR1 mAb but not in the other Fab structures. Also, what is the buried surface area between Fab and LAIR1 insert? It would be informative to show these numbers as a function of CDRs (i.e., how much surface is buried at each CDR, and how much at the framework, and on the other side how much of LAIR 1/insert are buried). It was hard to tell from figures and text if the LAIR1 domain is really binding to the CDRs or is just suspended over them? Please explain in more detail.</p><p>4) Do the CDR L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 structures belong to the expected canonical classes?</p><p>5) Is the light chain a lambda or kappa chain?</p><p>6) Is the H3 base conformation kinked or extended or something else? The Asn at H242 that may be glycosylated can play a role in the conformation of the H3 base, so might see if potential glycosylation there has altered the expected structure.</p><p>7) Do you see any residual Nag density? Fabs can by glycosylated, but I don't recall ever seeing a Fab with 3 N-linked glycosylation sites, so could you comment on whether the full-length glycans would likely interact with the LAIR1, or with the RIFIN antigen? And would the germline LAIR1 glycan (at H153) have clashed with the Fab, or would it have been pointing outward toward antigen?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, it would be helpful to show under the sequences the alignment of the putative V, D, and J genes- to show for example in the H3 region which residues in the linker were likely derived from LAIR1 gene, and which residues derived from antibody gene segments. Also, in addition to the sequential numbers, please show the Kabat numbering for light chain and for the heavy chain (except for the LAIR1 insert which will be impossible to number by the Kabat system).</p><p>9) Refinement: The <italic>R<sub>free</sub></italic> is a bit high and the Ramachandran statistics are not great for a 2.5 Å structure.

A deeper discussion of whether the LAIR1 domain is rigidly docked to the Fab or not, including consideration of crystal contacts limiting domain movement, should be added to a revised manuscript.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers start by asking if the arrangement of LAIR1 relative to the rest of the Fab fragment is obligate. Our structure suggests that it is, and we have included a deeper discussion of the evidence in the manuscript. Firstly, when we align the two copies of the antibody structure, they agree extremely well, with an RMSD of 0.26Å, as reported in the Results section. We now include a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) to show this alignment. This shared structure is very unlikely to be due to crystal packing due to the interactions that LAIR1 and the linker make with the remaining CDR loops. In addition, the presence of a disulphide bond between light chain C93 and heavy chain C223 is seen in both copies in the asymmetric unit (labelled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This provides a third anchor point between LAIR1 and the rest of the antibody (together with the junctions with the linkers) and will stabilise their relative organisation. Finally, the interactions between each of the antibody CDRs and the LAIR1 insert and linker (as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) are replicated in both copies of the asymmetric unit. This evidence all points to a rigid association between the antibody and the LAIR1 insertion. We have collected this argument together into a single place in the Results section to make it clearer.</p><p><italic>2) Related to point 1, the authors can also address whether the LAIR1 domain is rigidly docked to the Fab by discussing whether there are any unusual residues in the Fab framework regions that might be important for interactions with the LAIR domain. Andrew Martin has a website that will identify unusual amino acids in Fabs.</italic> </p><p>Use of Andrew Martin’s server identified seven amino acids which are usual in this antibody. Four of these occupy the third CDR of the light chain. The most unusual of the residues is light chain C93, which we had previously discussed as forming a disulphide bond with the LAIR1 insert, and is only found in 0.096% of antibody chains. We have added three sentences to the Results section to describe this analysis and have cited the paper related to this server in the paper.</p><p><italic>3) Also related to point 1, the authors should show surface areas accessible to a 1.4 Å probe on the CDRs for the structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This would be a nice way to demonstrate that the CDRs are inaccessible in the LAIR1 mAb but not in the other Fab structures. Also, what is the buried surface area between Fab and LAIR1 insert? It would be informative to show these numbers as a function of CDRs (i.e., how much surface is buried at each CDR, and how much at the framework, and on the other side how much of LAIR 1/insert are buried). It was hard to tell from figures and text if the LAIR1 domain is really binding to the CDRs or is just suspended over them? Please explain in more detail.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we determined the percentage of each of the CDR loops that is occluded by LAIR1 and the linkers. To achieve this, we used AREAIMOL from the CCP4 suite to calculate the accessible surface area of each CDR loop to a 1.4Å sphere, both in the intact antibody and an antibody in which we removed CDR H3. This confirmed that each of the five remaining CDR loops was partly occluded by the presence of LAIR1. We have provided this information in the Results section, together with the percentage occlusion, and have also described the procedure used in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>4) Do the CDR L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 structures belong to the expected canonical classes?</italic> </p><p>The five CDR loops which do not bare the extension are all members of the canonical classes of CDRs (CDR L1 class 2/11AA; CDR L2 class 1/7AA; CDR L3 class 1/9AA; CDR H1 class 2/11AA; CDR H2 class 1/16AA). We have provided this information in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, in the boxes that indicate the locations of the CDR loops.</p><p><italic>5) Is the light chain a lambda or kappa chain?</italic> </p><p>The light chain of MGD21 is kappa (VK1-8/JK5). We have provided this information in the first paragraph of the Results section.</p><p><italic>6) Is the H3 base conformation kinked or extended or something else? The Asn at H242 that may be glycosylated can play a role in the conformation of the H3 base, so might see if potential glycosylation there has altered the expected structure.</italic> </p><p>We have confirmed that the base of the H3 loop is of the kinked conformation, as defined by the rules of Shirai et al. We have mentioned this in the text.</p><p><italic>7) Do you see any residual Nag density? Fabs can by glycosylated, but I don't recall ever seeing a Fab with 3 N-linked glycosylation sites, so could you comment on whether the full-length glycans would likely interact with the LAIR1, or with the RIFIN antigen? And would the germline LAIR1 glycan (at H153) have clashed with the Fab, or would it have been pointing outward toward antigen?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers ask about the glycosylation state of the antibody chains. Two of the putative N-linked glycosylation sites (light chain N30 and heavy chain N61) show no evidence of glycosylation in the electron density, while a single GlcNAc is observed on N242 of the heavy chain in each of the copies in the asymmetric unit. We have added a sentence to the first paragraph of the Results section to provide this information and have now shown the sugars in stick representation on the structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p>The reviewers also ask about the location of residue 153 of the heavy chain as the equivalent site in germ line LAIR1 is modified by N-linked glycosylation (residue N69) and this Asn has been mutated to Ser in the form of LAIR1 inserted into the antibody. This residue points away from the rest of the Fab and had already been highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> as a residue whose mutation has a minor effect on collagen binding by LAIR1. It is possible that this glycosyation site has been lost to increase RIFIN binding, but in ~75% of the LAIR-1 containing antibody sequences reported to date the glycosylation site is intact. We have now discussed this in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p><p><italic>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, it would be helpful to show under the sequences the alignment of the putative V, D, and J genes- to show for example in the H3 region which residues in the linker were likely derived from LAIR1 gene, and which residues derived from antibody gene segments. Also, in addition to the sequential numbers, please show the Kabat numbering for light chain and for the heavy chain (except for the LAIR1 insert which will be impossible to number by the Kabat system).</italic> </p><p>We have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to label the regions of the heavy chain that derive from the V and J genes, and from the LAIR1 intron. We have also labelled the sequences of both light and heavy chains with Kabat numbers.</p><p><italic>9) Refinement: The R<sub>free</sub> is a bit high and the Ramachandran statistics are not great for a 2.5 Å structure. Additional refinement cycles and/or rebuilding should be done. Also, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> is too brief. Please include the PDB code, # of observations/unique reflections collected, Rmerge, R<sub>meas</sub>, mean I/σ, # of reflections in the R<sub>free</sub> test set, the B values (Wilson B, and overall B's for solvent, variable, constant, and LAIR1 domains), and the all-atom clashscore. Please also include at least one figure in the supplemental material showing some electron density.</italic> </p><p>We have completed the refinement of the structure with significant improvements in the Ramachandran statistics. We have deposited it in the PDB with code 5NST and a final validation report is included in this submission. We have also updated <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> to include the additional statistics requested by the reviewers. For note, we chose to use the CC<sub>1/2</sub>&gt;0.5 cut off for data processing after observing increased detail in the electron density maps by including the extra data. We have also included a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) to show electron density for the whole antibody as well as two important regions of the molecule where CDR loops contact and stabilise the LAIR1 insertion.</p><p><italic>10) Figures:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>.

The disulphide bond is shown with the cysteine residues as sticks (as it is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and we have given each of the CDR loops a different colour, which matches the colour of their label.</p><p>We have labelled each of the residues shown as sticks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and have altered the legend with regard to the description of the glycosylation site.</p><p>We prefer to keep <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> unchanged, rather than labelling the individual CDRs, as this keeps the figure ‘cleaner’ and focuses the attention of the reader more onto the key region of the CDR H3 loop that we are aiming to highlight here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
