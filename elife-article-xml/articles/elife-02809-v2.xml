This functional decline begins with β cell stress and de-differentiation. Current drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) lower blood glucose levels but they do not directly alleviate β cell stress nor prevent, let alone reverse, β cell de-differentiation. We show here that Urocortin 3 (Ucn3), a marker for mature β cells, is down-regulated in the early stages of T2D in mice and when β cells are stressed in vitro. Using an insulin expression-coupled lineage tracer, with Ucn3 as a reporter for the mature β cell state, we screen for factors that reverse β cell de-differentiation. We find that a small molecule inhibitor of TGFβ receptor I (Alk5) protects cells from the loss of key β cell transcription factors and restores a mature β cell identity even after exposure to prolonged and severe diabetes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02809.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02809.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02809.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Diabetes is a condition that develops when the body does not produce or use a hormone called insulin effectively. Insulin helps fat and muscle cells absorb glucose from the blood, and so diabetes can result in high levels of blood glucose, which can cause strokes, blindness, and heart disease.</p><p>In healthy individuals, beta cells in the pancreas (a large gland located behind the stomach) produce insulin. The beta cells develop from endocrine progenitor cells, which are unspecialised cells that can either duplicate themselves or ‘differentiate’ to form one of the specialised cell types found in the pancreas.</p><p>In diabetic patients, however, certain stresses (such as an immune attack in type-1 diabetics or insulin-resistance due to obesity, pregnancy, or ageing in type-2 diabetics) can cause mature beta cells to lose their identity in a process known as ‘de-differentiation’.

Using small molecules to block the activity of a protein called TGF beta receptor 1 was found to protect against beta cell de-differentiation and to restore the identity of mature beta cells. The findings of Blum et al. represent a first step towards the possible development of new drugs to prevent or even restore the loss of healthy, mature beta cells in diabetic patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02809.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02809.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>beta cell</kwd><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>Alk5 inhibitor II</kwd><kwd>Ucn3</kwd><kwd>Tgf-beta</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrandon</surname><given-names>Ornella</given-names></name><name><surname>Melton</surname><given-names>Douglas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000901</institution-id><institution>Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blum</surname><given-names>Barak</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Quinn P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of mature β cell identity in diabetes can be prevented and rescued by small molecule inhibitors of the TGFβ pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysfunction or death of pancreatic β cells underlies all types of diabetes. In the case of Type 1 diabetes, it is unknown whether the initiating cause of β cell destruction is an immune attack or a β cell pathology that instigates autoimmunity. β cell failure in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is thought to begin as a compensatory response to peripheral insulin resistance and eventually results in the loss of a mature β cell phenotype, without necessarily leading to β cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weir et al., 2013</xref>). The loss of a mature β cell phenotype, sometimes called de-differentiation, can result from exposure to high levels of glucose, lipids, and inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accili et al., 2010</xref>). De-differentiation of β cells in the context of diabetes has been shown in vivo with the genetic disruption of key transcription factors, including <italic>FoxO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>NeuroD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), and is also seen in isolated islets cultured in vitro on an adherent substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gershengorn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weinberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russ et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Nur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Negi et al., 2012</xref>). In both the <italic>FoxO1</italic> knockout mice and obese diabetic (Lepr<sup>Db/Db</sup>) mice, de-differentiating β cells gradually lose insulin expression and begin to express progenitor-cell markers including Ngn3 and Sox9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>). Oxidative stress, also associated with T2D, inactivates the β cell specific transcription factors <italic>MafA</italic>, <italic>Nkx6.1</italic>, and <italic>Pdx1</italic>, again leading to the loss of mature β cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). β cell de-differentiation may represent a reversal of the normal ontogeny of β cells, or follow a different pathway, but it is clear that de-differentiation depletes the pool of functionally mature β cells in T2D patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weir et al., 2013</xref>). It is not known whether there are stages of de-differentiation at which the cells can recover or re-differentiate back into fully mature β cells. The commonly used T2D drugs act by suppressing glucose production in the liver (e.g., Metformin), by enhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity (e.g., Rosiglitazone and other thiazolidinediones), or by forcing the secretion of more insulin from the already-stressed β cells (e.g., sulfonylureas such as Glyburide). There is no evidence that any of these drugs reverse β cell de-differentiation or restore the functionally mature β cell mass after β cell de-differentiation has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accili et al., 2010</xref>).

The intensity of insulin staining in diabetic mice is indistinguishable from non-diabetic controls, but the immunoreactivity of Ucn3 is almost completely abolished in islets of diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To confirm that loss of <italic>Ucn3</italic> is an early marker of diabetes, we divided the diabetic mice from all three models (Lep<sup>Ob/Ob</sup>, Lepr<sup>Db/Db</sup>, and Ins2<sup>Akita</sup>) into groups according to the severity of their diabetes, regardless of the genetic cause. Thus, the expression levels of Ins1 and Ucn3 mRNAs in the mildly diabetic (blood glucose levels between 200–500 mg/dl) and the severely diabetic (blood glucose levels &gt;500 mg/dl) groups was compared to that of age-matched non-diabetic controls (C57BL/6, blood glucose levels &lt;200 mg/dl). The average (non-fasting) blood glucose level was 381 ± 18 mg/dl in mildly diabetic mice, 588 ± 8 mg/dl in the severely diabetic mice, and 167 ± 5 mg/dl in the non-diabetic control mice. The expression level of <italic>Ins1</italic> mRNA was slightly, but not significantly, higher in islets of mildly diabetic mice as compared to non-diabetic controls, but was reduced to 28% of control levels in islets of the severely diabetic group (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast to the late reduction in insulin expression, the levels of <italic>Ucn3</italic> mRNA in the mildly diabetic group were already reduced threefold, to 34% of the level in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.001), and by 10-fold, to approximately 10% of the control levels, in the severely diabetic group (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We conclude that the loss of <italic>Ucn3</italic> mRNA is an early event in β cell de-differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Using Ucn3 as a marker for the mature β cell state reveals reversibility of β cell de-differentiation</title><p>Because <italic>Ucn3</italic> expression is reduced early during β cell de-differentiation, its expression could be used to test whether β cells at early or late stages of de-differentiation are able to regain a fully mature state. The hypothesis is that while late-stage de-differentiated β cells (negative for both insulin and Ucn3) may not be able to re-differentiate into fully mature β cells, cells at an earlier stage (negative for Ucn3, but still expressing insulin) may be able to recover from their de-differentiation if the stress inducing factor (i.e., the diabetes) is removed.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we induced transient insulin resistance in healthy, lean wild-type mice with the insulin-receptor antagonist S961 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vikram and Jena, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Mice treated with S961 develop acute insulin resistance and severe diabetes within 1 week, with non-fasting glucose levels of ≥500 mg/dl. Removal of S961 relieves the diabetes, and the mice restore their glucose control within 1 week. We thus induced transient hyperglycemia in wild-type mice with S961 for 1 week; control animals were similarly treated with PBS. At the end of the first week, half of the animals were sacrificed for analysis, and half were taken off S961 treatment and allowed to recover from diabetes for another week by which time their blood glucose levels returned to normal (≤200 mg/dl). Immunostaining of pancreata from all groups shows the levels of Ucn3 and insulin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, animals treated with S961 developed diabetes (reaching blood glucose levels ≥460 mg/dl) and show an increase in insulin staining, while Ucn3 staining was almost completely abolished. In the diabetic animals that recovered and showed normoglycemia following withdrawal of S961 for 1 week, there was a complete recovery of Ucn3 staining, with a staining intensity comparable to that of the PBS-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses on islets at different time point during the development of S961-induced diabetes and its subsequent recovery showed that the levels of <italic>Ucn3</italic> mRNA are significantly (p &gt; 0.005) reduced to about half of the levels in control mice as early as 4 days after S961 induction and are down to about a third by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A small reduction of the <italic>Ins1</italic> mRNA was also seen, but this was not statistically significant. The expression of both <italic>Ins1</italic> and <italic>Ucn3</italic> increases to its normal levels (and even slightly higher) 3 days after pump removal, followed by a non-statistically significant decline 7 days after the withdrawal of the S961 pumps, which is not observed at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,A</xref>, respectively). A similar trend was seen with the expression of <italic>MafA</italic>, <italic>Nkx6.1</italic>, and <italic>Pdx1</italic>, confirming the loss and re-gain of the mature β cell state in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02809.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Insulin resistance-induced β cell de-differentiation is reversible.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining with antibodies against insulin (red) and Ucn3 (green) in pancreata from wild-type C57BL/6 mice treated with either vehicle (PBS) or S961 (insulin receptor antagonist) for 7 days (upper and middle panels) or treated with S961 for 7 days followed by a 7-day-recovery period in the absence of S961 (lower panel).

Similar to the results with mouse islets, human islets treated with Alk5 inhibitor II show an increase in mRNA expression for Insulin, <italic>MafA</italic>, <italic>Nkx6.1</italic>, and <italic>Pdx1</italic> mRNAs, but not for <italic>FoxO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The response of β cells to the progression of T2D begins with an adaptive stage, in which the cells compensate for insulin resistance by over-production and over-secretion of insulin, as well as increasing β cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). This adaptation is reversible, as can be seen when β cell function returns with the remission from T2D after bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradley et al., 2012</xref>). However, if the metabolic stress persists, β cells succumb to the metabolic overload and de-differentiation occurs. De-differentiation begins with translocation of the transcription factor <italic>FoxO1</italic> to the nucleus, and continues with an inactivation of β cell-specific transcription factors including <italic>MafA</italic>, <italic>Nkx6.1</italic>, and <italic>Pdx1</italic> and consequently, a reduction in insulin production and secretion. All together, these changes result in the escalation of the disease and eventually to a non-recoverable loss of a functionally mature β cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results put the loss of Ucn3 expression as an early event in β cell stress, occurring at the compensatory stage, before reduction in insulin expression and deterioration to frank diabetes. Ucn3 protein and mRNA were dramatically down regulated even in mildly diabetic mice, some of which had blood glucose levels that were just slightly above normal. This is further demonstrated by the loss of Ucn3 in S961-treated mice, exposed to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia for only a week. In severely diabetic mice, we observed a dramatic reduction in insulin expression indicative of advanced β cell de-differentiation, and the expression of <italic>Ucn3</italic> mRNA was almost completely abolished.</p><p>Ucn3 is a small neuropeptide hormone, expressed mainly in the Islets of Langerhans (where, in the mouse, it is restricted to β cells), the small intestine, the skin, and specific brain regions such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Meulen and Huising, 2014</xref>). Ucn3 has been suggested to regulate GSIS in response to high blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2007</xref>) and was linked to peripheral glucose homeostasis and food intake behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuperman and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuperman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>). The precise role of Ucn3 in the pancreatic islets is not yet clear, but the expression of its receptors in mouse and human islets suggests an islet-autonomous autocrine and/or paracrine action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huising et al., 2011</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that loss of expression of Ucn3 per se is not a driver of diabetes, but is rather caused by it, as mice homozygous for a <italic>Ucn3</italic>-null allele are not diabetic, and even show slightly better glucose tolerance under high-fat feeding and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To utilize the finding that Ucn3 is an early marker of β cell de-differentiation, we developed triple-transgenic mice, in which a sensitive <italic>Ucn3</italic>-regulated GFP reporter is combined with β cell lineage tracing. This genetic system allows one to trace β cells even after profound de-differentiation. Using this system, we show that β cell de-differentiation can be reversed after 1 week of S961 treatment in vivo or after 1 week of adherent culture in vitro. A screen for pathways that can rescue β cells from de-differentiation identified three growth factors that restored <italic>Ucn3</italic>-GFP expression, namely BMP9, TGFβ sRIII, and Artemin, all belonging to the TGFβ superfamily. Of those, only BMP9 had previously been identified as having an active role in glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). The gene encoding TGFβ receptor III has been shown to be up regulated in pancreata from obese human patients compared to lean subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muharram et al., 2005</xref>), while Artemin and its receptor GFRα3 have, to the best of our knowledge, not been described in pancreatic islet function.</p><p>Tests on small molecule mediators of BMP/TGFβ and Artemin signaling identified Alk5 inhibitor II as a potent compound able to restore mature β cell identity even in islets from severely diabetic mice. This inhibitor also blocked the loss of specific β cell gene expression under cytokine-induced stress. Alk5 inhibitor II, identified using mouse β cells, can induce the expression of key β cell transcription factors in human islets. While human UCN3 is a marker of the functional maturation for both β and α cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Meulen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benner et al., 2014</xref>), and despite evidence that UCN3 is not a faithful marker for functional β cell maturation in human islets during human pancreas development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hrvatin et al., 2014</xref>), the signals that reverse β cell de-differentiation (i.e., inhibition of Alk5 signaling) may be conserved between mouse and human.</p><p>Alk5 inhibitor II has been previously identified by Rezania et al. in an independent screen aimed at inducing functionally mature endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rezania et al., 2011</xref>). Ichida et al. showed that this inhibitor can replace Sox2 in cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ichida et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, it was recently reported that β cells of mice carrying a conditional deletion of both Alk5 (referred to as TGFβ receptor I) and TGFβ receptor II do not proliferate in response to inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). In our results, Alk5 inhibitor II restored specific β cell gene expression in de-differentiated β cells, blocked cytokine-induced β cell stress, and stimulated over-expression of these genes in β cells from healthy, non-diabetic mice, and humans. It is noteworthy that the up regulation of SMAD7, a downstream mediator of TGFβ signaling, promotes β cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of Alk5 would inhibit SMAD7-induced proliferation. This may hint on the intriguing idea that β cell proliferation, at least under inflammatory stress, may require a phase of de-differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that Alk5 signaling may be constitutively active in β cells, that sustaining mature β cell phenotype depends on constant inhibition of this signal, and that the inhibition of Alk5 signaling may confer its effect by inducing expression of β cell transcription factors including <italic>MafA</italic>, <italic>Nkx6.1</italic>, and <italic>Pdx1</italic>. This postulated inhibition of Alk5 signaling in mature β cells develops during the first postnatal weeks, when the cells reach their fully mature state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szabat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szabat et al., 2011</xref>), and is reduced under diabetic stress or when the cells are taken out of their proper niche and grown in vitro. If inhibition of Alk5 signaling is not restored, the β cells will evidently de-differentiate and disappear. Alk5 is a broadly expressed protein and its activity is required in many other tissues besides β cells. Indeed, our preliminary attempts to inject high dosage of Alk5 inhibitor II to diabetic mice resulted in overall poor health without significant reduction of blood glucose. We therefore suggest that screening for compounds that inhibit Alk5 signaling specifically in β cells may yield compounds that in combination with traditional blood-glucose lowering medicines will delay, prevent, or perhaps restore the loss of healthy, mature β cell function in T2D patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Harvard University International Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.

The authors show that Ucn3, a marker for mature beta cells, is down regulated in T2D, and thus stands as a useful marker for detecting early beta cell failure. The authors then used Ucn3 as a readout to screen for factors that reverse beta cell dedifferentiation and identified a small molecule inhibitor of TGFbeta receptor I (Alk5) that showed protective effects on beta cells and restored mature beta cell identity. They found that Alk5 inhibitor II induced expression of Maf, Nkx and Pdx in de-differentiated b cells. However, the inhibitor failed to induce insulin.</p><p>While both of the reviewers agree that this is a very interesting study, the authors need to appropriately address the reviewers' constructive comments before the manuscript is acceptable. The summaries of the reviewers' major comments are follows:</p><p>1) The authors state that Ucn3 is an early marker of de-differentiation. This is a very interesting point. On the other hand, a more detailed examination should be done to give more information on early molecular events that lead to T2D. In this manuscript, comparison of Ucn3 expression in normal vs T2D mice shows correlation of Ucn3 expression and severity of diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, this is not sufficient to support de-differentiation. The data showing down-regulation of Ucn3 expression precedes insulin down-regulation should be provided. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors used S961 to induce de-differentiation. However, the data shown were obtained at a single time point and it does prove Ucd3 is an early marker. In addition, no quantitative analysis was performed. Quantitative evaluation of the expression levels of Ucn3, Maf, Nkx, Pdx and insulin at different time points during de-differentiation and also re-differentiation is necessary.</p><p>2) Although de-differentiation by culture of islets reduced glucose response, the data shown are not sufficient to prove de-differentiation. At least gene expression of some of b cell genes in this culture system should be shown. To prove the effect of Alk5 inhibitor II on de-differentiated cells, the inhibitor should be added to cultured de-differentiated islets. Alternatively, the inhibitor may be administrated to T2D mice to see if it ameliorates the disease by up-regulating the b cell genes. The manuscript should be strengthened by performing in vivo functional assays to show whether the chemical, Alk5i, could restore Glucose stimulating insulin secretion (GSIS) or blood glucose, and also protein level of Ucn3 by immunostainings of Ucn3.</p><p>3) Other suggestions for revision of the Figures:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors mixed three diabetic mice (Ob/Ob, Db/Db and Akita) and divided them together into groups of mildly and severely diabetic group and compared the expression of markers. They should show individual disease instead of mixing them. No results of Akita mice were found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p>Figure 2–figure supplement 4: There is no unit for Y axis. From the legends, it seems that each bar represents average gene expression. The author should clarify this.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The GSIS of islets treated with IL1, INFga, and TNFa should be examined.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: It is not clear to what extent the expression of the transcription factors recovered. The levels should be compared with that of the healthy BL5, or with isolated islets from healthy adult mice. It is necessary to show that Ucn3 expression is restored by treatment with Alk5i by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>4) Suggestions for revision of the text:</p><p>Authors should add some descriptions on these issues in the Discussion on the following points: As the reviewer 2 suggests, BMP9, TGFb-sRIII and Alk5 inhibitor II reversed de-differentiation. However, the mechanism of action of those factors and physiological significance of the finding remains unknown. As Alk5 inhibitor II failed to induce insulin, clinical significance of the finding is unclear. It might be worthy to comment on the recently reported observation that up-regulation of SMAD7 promotes proliferation of b cells (Xiao et at, PNAS 2014). Inhibition of Alk5 would inhibit SMAD7 up-regulation and hence it may suppress re-differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02809.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their valuable remarks and comments. We have now revised the manuscript to accommodate these comments.

This is a very interesting point. On the other hand, a more detailed examination should be done to give more information on early molecular events that lead to T2D.

However, this is not sufficient to support de-differentiation. The data showing down-regulation of Ucn3 expression precedes insulin down-regulation should be provided</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows immunostaining and qRT-PCR analyses of insulin and Ucn3 in three diabetic mouse models, with severity of diabetes ranging from mild to severe. The data presented demonstrate that both Ucn3 protein and Ucn3 mRNA are significantly reduced in the diabetic mice while insulin protein is still present in all models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and insulin mRNA levels are significantly reduced only in the most severely diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). This shows that the down-regulation of Ucn3 expression precedes that on insulin. We have now amended the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the relevant text.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, the authors used S961 to induce de-differentiation.

These data confirm that Ucn3 levels are reduced to about half the normal levels as early as four days after the beginning of S961 treatment, and are down to one third by day seven. Insulin mRNA levels, on the other hand, are not significantly reduced by this time. This supports the conclusion that Ucn3 is an early marker of S961-induced de-differentiation. Nkx6.1 and Pdx1 and MafA mRNA levels are also reduced at the same time as Ucn3, to about the same magnitude, supporting the notion that the phenomenon represents β cell de-differentiation or at least a loss of the mature β cell state. These new results are discussed in the main text.</p><p><italic>2) Although de-differentiation by culture of islets reduced glucose response, the data shown are not sufficient to prove de-differentiation. At least gene expression of some of b cell genes in this culture system should be shown. To prove the effect of Alk5 inhibitor II on de-differentiated cells, the inhibitor should be added to cultured de-differentiated islets</italic>.</p><p>We have now added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), dedicated to culture-induced de-differentiation and Alk5i-induced re-differentiation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> thus show live insulin-lineage tracing mCherry and Ucn3-GFP fluorescence in RCU islets cultured on 804G for two weeks. These data show that addition on Alk5i to the islets after one week of de-differentiation restores Ucn3-GFP fluorescence to levels comparable to that of fresh islets. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of FACS-sorted mCherry-labelled β cells from these cultures shows that the mRNA levels of Ucn3, MafA, Nkx6.1, Pdx1 and Insulin1 are diminished in the untreated cultures, supporting the idea of β cell de-differentiation, i.e., the loss of β cell mature gene expression. Strikingly, addition of Alk5i one week after the start of de-differentiation is sufficient to restore the expression levels of Ucn3, MafA, Nkx6.1 and Pdx1, and to a lesser extent insulin1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows by immunostaining the reduction of Ucn3 and insulin proteins in the de-differentiated cultures, and their recovery following Alk51 treatment.</p><p><italic>Alternatively, the inhibitor may be administrated to T2D mice to see if it ameliorates the disease by up-regulating the b cell genes. The manuscript should be strengthened by performing in vivo functional assays to show whether the chemical, Alk5i, could restore Glucose stimulating insulin secretion (GSIS) or blood glucose, and also protein level of Ucn3 by immunostainings of Ucn3</italic>.</p><p>We agree that our conclusion would be strengthened by performing in vivo experiments with Alk5i, and we have indeed attempted to do this. Unfortunately, Alk5 is a broadly expressed gene with significant roles in many tissues, and our attempts to inject high doses of the chemical into diabetic mice resulted in poor general health and no apparent amelioration of blood glucose levels. We discuss this attempt in the Discussion section, and suggest that screening for mediators of Alk5 signaling that are expressed specifically in β cells, or at least are not as crucial as Alk5 itself, may yield potent drugs for manipulating this pathway in vivo.</p><p><italic>3) Other suggestions for revision of the Figures</italic>:</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, the authors mixed three diabetic mice (Ob/Ob, Db/Db and Akita) and divided them together into groups of mildly and severely diabetic group and compared the expression of markers.

However, the mechanism of action of those factors and physiological significance of the finding remains unknown. As Alk5 inhibitor II failed to induce insulin, clinical significance of the finding is unclear. It might be worthy to comment on the recently reported observation that up-regulation of SMAD7 promotes proliferation of b cells (Xiao et at, PNAS 2014). Inhibition of Alk5 would inhibit SMAD7 up-regulation and hence it may suppress re-differentiation</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise an excellent point. While inhibition of Alk5 by Alk5i restores β cell maturation, as is described in our manuscript, it may simultaneously have an inhibitory effect on β cell proliferation by inhibiting SMAD7. This points to the interesting idea that in order to proliferate, β cells may need to undergo some sort of de-differentiation. We now discuss this hypothesis and we have added the above citation to our references.</p><p>The down-regulation of insulin mRNA by Alk5i in these figures is intriguing, and we don’t yet have a good explanation to it. We assume that it happens because the experiments are done in low-glucose medium. We discuss this point in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
