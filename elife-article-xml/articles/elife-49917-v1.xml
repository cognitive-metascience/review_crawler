secretion of numerous insulin peptides. Here, we describe a novel, non-signaling isoform of the nematode insulin receptor (IR), DAF-2B, that modulates insulin signaling by sequestration of insulin peptides. DAF-2B arises via alternative splicing and retains the extracellular ligand binding domain but lacks the intracellular signaling domain. A <italic>daf-2b</italic> splicing reporter revealed active regulation of this transcript through development, particularly in the dauer larva, a diapause stage associated with longevity. CRISPR knock-in of mScarlet into the <italic>daf-2b</italic> genomic locus confirmed that DAF-2B is expressed in vivo and is likely secreted. Genetic studies indicate that DAF-2B influences dauer entry, dauer recovery and adult lifespan by altering insulin sensitivity according to the prevailing insulin milieu. Thus, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> alternative splicing at the <italic>daf-2</italic> locus generates a truncated IR that fine-tunes insulin signaling in response to the environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dauer formation</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>insulin sensitivity</kwd><kwd>DAF-2</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG050172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK108801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A truncated, non-signaling insulin receptor regulates insulin sensitivity in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> by sequestering insulin peptides and preventing their interaction with full length receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing of messenger RNA provides a mechanism for generating protein diversity, and it has been suggested that up to 95% of the human genome undergoes some form of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Manley, 2009</xref>). Indeed, it is well established that alternative splicing at the insulin receptor (IR) locus in mammals leads to the expression of two isoforms of the IR that differ in their affinity for ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belfiore et al., 2009</xref>). There is also evidence in mammals and insects for the existence of alternatively spliced, short isoforms of the IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Västermark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>) but their functional significance remains unknown. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of alternative splicing is not only associated with disease, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozlovski et al., 2017</xref>) and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dlamini et al., 2017</xref>), but also occurs as a function of normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heintz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Latorre and Harries, 2017</xref>). Thus, a better understanding of the function and regulation of novel alternatively spliced IR isoforms may be useful in understanding the pathophysiology of insulin resistance.</p><p>Truncated IR isoforms that retain the ligand binding domain, but lack the intracellular signaling domain, have the potential to sequester insulin away from full length receptors thereby inhibiting signal transduction. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, an insulin binding protein (SDR) with significant homology to the extracellular domain of the fly insulin-like receptor (InR) has been shown to antagonize insulin signaling by binding insulin-like peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamoto et al., 2013</xref>). However, this variant is encoded by a distinct gene rather than arising via alternative splicing of the InR locus. In mammals, intronic polyA activation has been proposed as a mechanism by which truncated tyrosine kinase receptors may be generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>) and has been demonstrated to be functionally significant in the case of the mammalian platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>). Although it is hypothesized that such a mechanism may exist to create truncated IR isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>), their functional relevance has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>daf-2</italic> gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with sequence and structural homology to both the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>). Hypomorphic genetic mutations in <italic>daf-2</italic> lead to phenotypes such as developmental arrest and lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gems et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> also has an unusually large number of insulin-like peptides in its genome which can act as both functional agonists and antagonists of insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to other species, multiple isoforms of <italic>daf-2</italic> have been described, including <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic> which are analogous to mammalian IR-A and IR-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>). Other isoforms of <italic>daf-2</italic> have also been suggested to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>), including a truncated isoform, <italic>daf-2b</italic>, which was first identified based on expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA evidence. However, when and where truncated IR isoforms, such as DAF-2B, are generated and what functional role truncated IR isoforms play remains unknown.</p><p>We reasoned that DAF-2B has the potential to act as a modifier of insulin signaling since it retains the ligand binding domain but lacks the signaling domain. We show a <italic>daf-2b</italic> transcript exists in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>daf-2b</italic> cDNA is detected at all larval stages, as well as in the alternative dauer larval stage. In vitro biochemical results indicated that DAF-2B dimerizes, suggesting that it could bind insulin-like peptides and thereby modulate insulin signaling by acting as a decoy receptor. Using a transgenic splicing reporter, we determined that <italic>daf-2b</italic> splicing in vivo was subject to temporal and spatial regulation, distinct from that of the <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic> full-length receptor isoforms, most noticeably during the alternative dauer larval stage. Furthermore, characterization of an endogenous translational fusion protein confirmed that DAF-2B is expressed and likely acts as a secreted protein. Analysis of dauer formation and recovery, established paradigms for insulin-like peptide activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornils et al., 2011</xref>), indicated that DAF-2B modifies insulin signaling both positively and negatively, in a manner consistent with the sequestration of insulin peptides. This mechanism was confirmed by co-expression of DAF-2B with both agonist and antagonist insulin-like peptides. Thus, our results indicate that a truncated IR isoform arising via alternative splicing represents a new fundamental principle for how the insulin signaling axis is regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> expresses a truncated isoform of <italic>daf-2</italic></title><p>The <italic>daf-2a</italic> transcript spans 17 exons and encodes a 1846 amino acid (aa) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>), while <italic>daf-2c</italic> includes an alternative exon, exon 11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic> both encode an extracellular ligand binding domain (α subunit, exons 1–11/11.5) and a transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (β subunit, exons 12–17). We noted the existence of EST cDNAs (EC006316, EC004351) in Wormbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>) that aligned with <italic>daf-2</italic> exon 11, exon 11.5 and 128 bp of intronic sequence following exon 11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Receptor tyrosine kinase EST sequences that span an intron/exon boundary as well as an upstream exon/exon boundary have been associated with truncated transcripts derived from activation of alternative intronic polyadenylation (polyA, AAUAAA) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>). Inspection of the <italic>daf-2</italic> genomic sequence indicates that the exon 11.5 5’ splice site (UUguaugga) diverges from the consensus (AGguaaguu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zahler, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Failure to utilize this splice site would result in the addition of 46 bp of intronic sequence before reaching an in-frame stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, downstream of this stop codon we observed multiple possible polyA sites, including a variant (AAUGAA) 84 bp away and matching sequence from the ESTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These EST sequences previously formed the basis for the existence of the <italic>daf-2b</italic> isoform, which was predicted to share the first 11 exons with the <italic>daf-2a</italic> full-length receptor but lack the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains encoded by exons 12–17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Consequently, a <italic>daf-2b</italic> transcript would encode for a protein with 1020 aa that retains the complete extracellular ligand binding domain but would lack the intracellular signaling domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>daf-2b</italic> encodes a truncated insulin receptor that is capable of dimerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic organization of the <italic>daf-2</italic> locus.

To do so, we designed two reverse primers (R1, R2) specific to the predicted <italic>daf-2b</italic> transcript, which were used with two forward primers (F1, F2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first reverse primer (R1) was complementary to the retained intron sequence, and the second reverse primer (R2) was just upstream of the first predicted polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used an exon 1 forward primer (F1) and primer R1 to amplify full length <italic>daf-2b</italic> from total cDNA prepared from polyadenylated RNA isolated from synchronized, staged populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sequencing confirmed that the 3 kb product was identical to the predicted full length <italic>daf-2b</italic> transcript. Using an exon 11-specific forward primer (F2) and primer R2, we also amplified a <italic>daf-2b</italic> cDNA fragment from all developmental stages that included the predicted 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Comparison of the pairwise PCR reactions with the multiplex reaction using a pooled cDNA template indicated that the three amplicons could be differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of stage-specific cDNA showed that <italic>daf-2b</italic> is present at all life stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and <italic>daf-2a</italic> is between 4 and 7 times more abundant than <italic>daf-2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DAF-2B forms homodimers as well as heterodimers with DAF-2A</title><p>In mammals, dimerization of the IR (via the formation of four disulfide bonds in the α subunit) is required for high affinity insulin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belfiore et al., 2009</xref>).

To examine these possibilities, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells expressing epitope-tagged DAF-2A and DAF-2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Similarly, when we immunoprecipitated DAF-2B::HA under non-reducing conditions coprecipitating DAF-2A::MYC was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

To report on <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic> expression, we amplified a 3.2 kb <italic>daf-2</italic> genomic fragment comprised of exon 11 and exon 12, including the intervening intron, and placed it upstream of tdTomato and the <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This construct was capable of reporting splicing that would result in expression of both <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic> but could not distinguish between each of these different splicing events. To examine splicing that generates <italic>daf-2b</italic>, we placed tdTomato between the retained intronic sequence at the end of exon 11.5 and the in-frame stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, this reporter contains all the regulatory elements between exon 11 and exon 12 that likely influence <italic>daf-2b</italic> expression.

The insulin signaling pathway is arguably the most well-studied pathway in the worm, yet our knowledge of the exact mechanisms by which insulin signals are transduced remains incomplete. The existence of a large number of insulin-like peptides and multiple signaling isoforms of the DAF-2 receptor suggests that precise control of receptor-ligand interactions is likely to be important in maintaining insulin specificity and facilitating differential IR signaling. Although this is achieved in part by spatial and temporal control of insulin peptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandes de Abreu et al., 2014</xref>), our results now indicate that DAF-2B further modulates IR signaling, and provides an additional level of regulation in the worm insulin signaling pathway.</p><p>Our study focused on the hypothesis that DAF-2B might modulate insulin signaling by acting as a decoy receptor and sequestering insulin peptides away from full-length DAF-2 receptors. Indeed, prior work indicates that receptor tyrosine kinases in mammals, such as PDGFRα, deploy this strategy to restrict receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>). These truncated isoforms arise by intronic poly A activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>) and the <italic>daf-2b</italic> EST sequence (EC004351) we identified in Wormbase spans exon 11, exon 11.5 and contains intronic sequence, suggestive of a similar mechanism. To monitor <italic>daf-2b</italic> expression in vivo, we first constructed a <italic>daf-2b</italic> splicing reporter, using an approach that has proven useful in understanding the differential regulation of other alternatively spliced transcripts in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heintz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuroyanagi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuroyanagi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuroyanagi et al., 2010</xref>). This revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern for <italic>daf-2b</italic> that both overlapped with and was distinct from <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic> expression across life stages. This suggests <italic>daf-2b</italic> expression provides a mechanism to regulate insulin signaling activity in a tissue-specific and temporally-regulated manner.</p><p>To confirm endogenous expression of DAF-2B protein, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to insert mScarlet into the <italic>daf-2</italic> genomic locus such that fluorescence would only be observed when DAF-2B protein is generated. Interestingly, while some neuronal expression of DAF-2B::mScarlet was observed, consistent with the splicing reporter, we were unable to detect fluorescence in the hypodermis or intestine. However, DAF-2B::mScarlet was detected in coelomocytes in all larval stages, as well as in dauers and adults. Coelomocytes are macrophage like cells that are involved in uptake and degradation of macromolecules that are secreted into the pseudocoelomic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fares and Greenwald, 2001</xref>). Indeed, accumulation of GFP-tagged proteins in these cells has been used as a marker of neuropeptide secretion in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including the insulin peptide DAF-28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sieburth et al., 2007</xref>). The lack of DAF-2B::tdTomato fluorescence from the splicing reporter in coelomocytes indicates that they are not a site of expression of DAF-2B, and thus, the appearance of DAF-2B::mScarlet in these cells supports the idea that DAF-2B may act as a secreted protein. However, it should also be noted that differences in the pattern of expression between the endogenous fusion protein and the splicing reporter could arise from the absence of important regulatory sequences and/or the presence of the <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’ UTR in the splicing construct.</p><p>Coimmunoprecipitation from a cell-based expression system confirmed that DAF-2B can form homodimers, which is a prerequisite for high affinity insulin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002</xref>). Studies of the soluble ectodomain of the mammalian IR, which comprises the α subunit and the extracellular portion of the β subunit, have shown it binds insulin with high affinity, as do other truncated isoforms of the IR that lack the β-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brandt et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, DAF-2B dimers are likely to bind insulin peptides. Computational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eisenhaber et al., 2000</xref>) indicates that the C-terminal extension of DAF-2B is unlikely to contain a transmembrane domain, or a GPI anchoring motif. Therefore, DAF-2B homodimers could act as secreted, soluble decoy receptors. This model is well supported by the accumulation of DAF-2B::mScarlet in coelomocytes. However, cell-based experiments also demonstrated that DAF-2B can form heterodimers with full length DAF-2A. This might act as a second mechanism to restrict insulin signaling, as DAF-2B/2A heterodimeric receptors would be unlikely to transduce signals but should bind insulin peptides. More work will be required to elucidate the precise details of DAF-2 molecular species in vivo and their physiological relevance.</p><p>We used a combination of overexpression and genetic deletion to demonstrate a physiological role for the DAF-2B isoform. While expression of DAF-2B generally declined with reproductive growth, expression was retained in the dauer larva, specifically in neurons, suggesting a physiological role in regulating this process. Ohno and colleagues previously found that expression of <italic>daf-2b</italic> cDNA was unable to rescue the dauer phenotype of a hypomorphic <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>). This is not surprising, as DAF-2B lacks an intracellular signaling domain. We took a very different approach and focused on examining whether DAF-2B modulates insulin signaling. We found that overexpression of DAF-2B promoted dauer entry and inhibited dauer recovery in a temperature sensitive <italic>daf-2</italic> hypomorph with reduced insulin signaling. These findings are consistent with DAF-2B further reducing insulin signaling. We also examined phenotypes of a <italic>daf-2b</italic> loss of function mutant generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ward, 2015</xref>). Importantly, <italic>daf-2b</italic> loss of function resulted in the opposite phenotype to DAF-2B overexpression studies. Loss of <italic>daf-2b</italic> in the <italic>pdk-1</italic> insulin-signaling mutant resulted in suppression of dauer formation and promoted recovery from dauer. These latter data are consistent with a model in which loss of <italic>daf-2b</italic> promotes the activity of agonist insulin peptides.</p><p>In order to test the insulin sequestration model, we reasoned that if DAF-2B binds endogenous insulins to prevent signal transduction, then overexpression of an agonist insulin peptide should restore signaling. We were able to demonstrate this in a <italic>daf-2</italic> hypomorph using DAF-28 in the context of dauer entry and using INS-6 in a dauer recovery paradigm. In these experiments we used an integrated transgenic line expressing DAF-2B in the nervous system under the control of the <italic>rab-3</italic> promoter, while DAF-28 and INS-6 were expressed from extrachromosomal arrays using the <italic>daf-28</italic> and <italic>rgef-1</italic> promoters respectively. This approach mitigates the possibility that the reduced DAF-2B effect is a function of promoter dilution and suggests that DAF-2B is indeed sequestering insulin peptides. We also generated transgenic lines expressing a mutant form of DAF-2B that is predicted to compromise insulin binding. Dauer formation was significantly reduced in transgenic lines expressing the mutant DAF-2B compared with lines overexpressing the wild type DAF-2B, supporting the idea that DAF-2B mediates its effects through insulin sequestration. However, the fact that mutant DAF-2B still significantly enhanced dauer formation compared with <italic>daf-2</italic> controls suggests that there may also be insulin-independent effects of DAF-2B, such as via heterodimerization with full length receptors. This latter mechanism would be consistent with our observation of DAF-2A/DAF-2B heterodimer formation in coimmunoprecipitation studies. Furthermore, this mechanism may explain the appearance of punctate DAF-2B::mScarlet observed in neuronal tissues, which could be membrane bound DAF-2B in the form of a heterodimer with a full length receptor isoform.</p><p>In contrast to the temperature sensitive insulin signaling mutants, we observed that DAF-2B overexpression suppressed dauer formation in the pheromone paradigm, suggesting that it can also promote insulin signaling. This is further supported by the observation that loss of <italic>daf-2b</italic> enhanced dauer entry in response to pheromone. At first glance this seems paradoxical, until placed in the context of what is known about insulin peptide activity under these conditions. Upon exposure to dauer-inducing pheromone extracts, expression of agonist insulins, such as <italic>daf-28</italic> and <italic>ins-6,</italic> is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornils et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, expression of antagonist insulins, such as <italic>ins-1</italic> and <italic>ins-18,</italic> remains stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornils et al., 2011</xref>) or is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsunaga et al., 2012</xref>), with the net result that insulin antagonism prevails and signaling through DAF-2 is diminished. However, in a <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant background loss of <italic>ins-1</italic> has only a modest effect on dauer entry at semi-permissive temperatures, while loss of the agonist peptide <italic>daf-28</italic> has a strong enhancer effect on dauer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornils et al., 2011</xref>). This means that temperature-dependent dauer formation in insulin signaling mutants is a consequence of reduced insulin agonism, rather than a relative increase in antagonist activity. Thus, our results suggest that loss of DAF-2B in these hypomorphic insulin signaling mutant backgrounds suppresses dauer formation due to increased agonist activity, while extra copies of DAF-2B enhances dauer entry through agonist sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, in wild type animals exposed to pheromone, loss of DAF-2B enhances dauer entry due to increased activity of insulin peptide antagonists such as INS-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). On the other hand, increased DAF-2B suppresses pheromone-induced dauer formation via sequestration of insulin antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for the effect of DAF-2B on dauer formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In temperature-sensitive hypomorphic mutants that affect the insulin signaling pathway, such as <italic>daf-2(e1368)</italic> and <italic>pdk-1(sa709)</italic>, dauer entry is driven by a reduction in agonist insulin peptides.

In this paradigm, loss of <italic>daf-2b</italic> enhances dauer formation. Conversely, overexpression of DAF-2B promotes reproductive growth via sequestration of insulin antagonists.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49917-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Overexpression studies have indicated that a number of insulin peptides in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can have mixed function, in that they act as agonists or antagonists depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). This functional or phenotypic antagonism suggests that DAF-2B should be equally capable of sequestering antagonist peptides, as well as agonist peptides. This is supported by our observation that DAF-2B overexpression reduced dauer formation in wild type animals exposed to dauer-inducing pheromone. Furthermore, when we over-expressed INS-18, an antagonist peptide that enhances pheromone-induced dauer formation, we found that DAF-2B was still able to suppress dauer entry. One interpretation of this is that the binding capacity of DAF-2B in this transgenic line is sufficient to sequester the additional INS-18 arising from overexpression. Another possibility is that sequestration of INS-18 also affects the availability of agonist peptides. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the expression of INS-18 is reciprocal to that of the agonist INS-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, reduced INS-18 signaling due to DAF-2B sequestration could lead to an upregulation of INS-7 expression, thereby further suppressing dauer formation.</p><p>Using tissue specific promoters, we found that neuronal and hypodermal expression of DAF-2B, but not intestinal or muscle, was sufficient to influence dauer entry. Thus, although DAF-2B::mScarlet CRISPR experiments support a model in which DAF-2B is secreted, we think that DAF-2B is acting locally rather than systemically, with outcomes depending on the prevailing insulin milieu. For example, neuronal changes in insulin peptide expression and secretion are known to be an important driver of the decision to proceed with reproductive growth or entry the dauer stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murphy and Hu, 2013</xref>). Thus, the neuronal effect of DAF-2B on dauer entry is not unexpected, and the hypodermal effect is perhaps due to the close proximity of these two tissues. However, it is also possible that the failure of the intestinal and muscle drivers to elicit a dauer formation phenotype is an artefact of how these heterologous promoters function during dauer entry. On the other hand, expression of DAF-2B from any tissue was sufficient to influence dauer recovery and lifespan. Hypomorphic <italic>daf-2</italic> mutations that lead to reduced insulin signaling also confer lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>). In these animals <italic>ins-7</italic> gene expression is repressed and <italic>ins-7</italic> RNAi is sufficient to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, <italic>ins-7</italic> is not only expressed in the nervous system but also in the intestine and has been proposed to form part of a feed-forward loop that amplifies or abrogates insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the robust effect of DAF-2B expression from multiple tissues on longevity could be mediated via sequestration of agonists such as INS-7. Interestingly, loss of <italic>daf-2b</italic> did not have an appreciable effect on lifespan. Although DAF-2B::mScarlet was observed in coelomocytes of adult animals, the level of expression of the splicing reporter was low in these animals. Thus, under physiological conditions endogenous DAF-2B may be more important for regulating dauer formation than lifespan.</p><p>The discovery that the truncated DAF-2B isoform in <italic>C. elegans</italic> undergoes changes in expression during dauer formation and functions to regulate entry and exit from this alternative life-stage indicates DAF-2B is an important modulator of insulin signaling. Given evidence for conserved, truncated IR isoforms in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Västermark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamoto et al., 2013</xref>), our findings have potentially revealed a fundamental principle for how insulin signaling is regulated.

Further study of how alternative splicing affects IR signaling in other systems is now warranted and may uncover regulatory mechanisms similar to DAF-2B that could play an important role in normal physiology and pathophysiology of metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans)</italic></td><td><italic>daf-2</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link></td><td>WBGene00000898</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>))</td><td>OP50</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td>OP50</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used and generated in this study</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC) and this paper</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>HEK293T/17</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-11268</td><td>This cell line has been re-verified and has tested negative for mycoplasma</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>715500</td><td>IP: 3 ul for 20 mg protein</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-myc</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>2276S</td><td>Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-HA</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>2367S</td><td>Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat #9491974</td><td>Dilution 1:4000</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Protein G agarose</td><td>Sigma</td><td>11719416001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Plasmids generated in this study</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Primers used in this study</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Snapgene</td><td>GSL Biotech</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015052">SCR_015052</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.snapgene.com/">https://www.snapgene.com/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism 8</td><td>Graphpad Software</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/scientificsoftware/prism/">https://www.graphpad.com/scientificsoftware/prism/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Illustrator CS5</td><td>Adobe</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010279">SCR_010279</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Photoshop CS5</td><td>Adobe</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014199">SCR_014199</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Zen Digital Imaging for Light Microscopy</td><td>Zeiss</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013672">SCR_013672</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en_us/products/microscope-software/zen.html#introduction">http://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en_us/products/microscope-software/zen.html#introduction</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/">https://imagej.net/</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title><italic>daf-2a/c::</italic>tdTomato splicing reporter</title><p>3 kb of the <italic>daf-2</italic> promoter, amplified using primers that introduced a 5’ HindIII site and a 3’ AgeI (primers 1 and 2), was cloned into pBGY487.

Blots were visualized with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Fisher cat# 9491974), enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (West Femto, Pierce), and x-ray film.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pheromone extract preparation</title><p>Dauer pheromone extract was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karp, 2018</xref>) with modifications. N2 worms harvested from 6 to 8 medium plates were inoculated into 4 2L flasks containing 200 mL S-medium + 20 µg/mL nystatin and 25 mL 20x concentrated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli </italic>OP50 and incubated in Innova 44 Incubator Shaker at 150 RPM and 23.5°C for 1 week. Flasks were removed every 24–48 hr to monitor growth. Flasks were reinoculated with 25 mL <italic>E. coli </italic>OP50 and fresh nystatin powder (5 mg per flask) after 1 week or when the initial food was cleared. Worms were grown for an additional week until cultures took on an oily, yellow-brown appearance.</p><p>To generate the crude pheromone extract, the conditioned growth media was collected into a 1L cylindrical flask and placed overnight in a 4°C incubator to allow gravity settling of worms and debris, before the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 7,000 RPM for 15 min to remove remaining worms, debris, and bacteria. The pale-yellow liquid was then transferred to a 2L beaker onto a 60°C hotplate in a fume hood and allowed to evaporate until approximately 50 mL of a brown slurry remained. This slurry was transferred to a ceramic mortar to evaporate the rest of the solution, leaving behind a thick brown sludge. This sludge was kept slightly wet with water (roughly 1 mL) and mixed with the pestle. Pheromones were extracted in 25 mL of anhydrous ethanol by using the pestle to slowly release the pheromones into solution. The ethanol was recovered after approximately 10 mins of gentle stirring and the extraction procedure was repeated 5–7 times until the ethanol solution being pulled off was mostly clear. Afterwards, the combined ethanol solution containing the dauer pheromones was placed under a nitrogen evaporator until about 10 mL of the solution remained. This final solution was passed through a 0.2 μm PES filter and distributed to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and kept at −20°C until needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Dauer entry assays with dauer pheromone</title><p>Dauer pheromones extracted in ethanol were mixed into molten NGM without added peptones at an empirically derived dosage that is dependent on the extraction efficiency and concentration of pheromones from batch to batch (generally 300–500 μL per 100 mL molten agar (v/v) yielding plates that do not exceed 0.5% ethanol). Peptone-free NGM plates with added pheromone extract were seeded with 200 μL of an overnight culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 resuspended in S-basal and 1 mg/mL ampicillin to prevent growth and allowed to dry in a sterile hood. Bacterial concentration was adjusted to 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming-units/mL S-basal. 10 gravid hermaphrodite N2 animals at the first day of adulthood were placed onto the bacterial lawn of each analysis plate per biological replicate per condition for 2 hr followed by removal. Plates were then maintained at 25°C for 44 hr. Dauers were scored on the basis of morphology and expressed as a percentage of the population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Dauer entry assays with insulin-signaling mutants</title><p>35 mm diameter petri dishes containing peptone-free NGM media were seeded with 200 µL of an overnight culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 resuspended in S-basal (5 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming-units/mL) and 1 mg/mL ampicillin to prevent growth and allowed to dry in a sterile hood. 10 gravid hermaphrodite animals at the first day of adulthood were placed onto the bacterial lawn of each analysis plate per biological replicate per condition for 2 hr followed by removal.

Dauers were collected in ddH20 solution and washed once. Equal volume 2% SDS solution was added to worm populations in water and animals were incubated at room temperature for 45 min with periodic gentle mixing by tube inversion. After SDS treatment, populations were washed twice with ddH20 and worms (living dauers and dead carcasses) were placed onto the center of an unseeded cholesterol-free, peptone-free 1.5% agarose in S-basal plate. After 1 hr SDS-resistant dauers were recovered and 30–40 animals were placed in the center of a fresh 1.5% agarose plate seeded with <italic>E. coli </italic>OP50 (5 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units/mL). Recovery plates were maintained at 20°C except where noted and scored every 12 hr for the presence of non-dauers, indicating exit from the dauer state.

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes ~40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs) which appear to signal via the single DAF-2 insulin receptor. Multiple DAF-2 isoforms generated via alternative splicing have been described previously and exhibit distinct functions and localization patterns. In this work, the authors describe a novel non-signaling DAF-2b isoform that retains the ligand-binding and transmembrane but not the intracellular signaling domain, and that may be secreted. This isoform can homodimerize and heterodimerize with the full-length DAF-2A protein and appears to modulate insulin signaling via sequestration of both agonistic and antagonistic ILPs. The authors also demonstrate active developmental stage-specific regulation of expression of the <italic>daf-2b</italic> isoform. This work describes a new mechanism by which the single DAF-2 receptor fine tunes ILP signaling as a function of developmental stage and conditions in the nematode.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An alternatively spliced insulin receptor modulates insulin sensitivity via insulin peptide sequestration in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Given the critical role of insulin signaling via the DAF-2 receptor in the regulation of multiple aspects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior and development, all reviewers appreciated the importance of identifying the <italic>daf-2b</italic> alternatively spliced isoform. However, there were several issues raised that will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that this is the first description of the <italic>daf-2b</italic> isoform, all reviewers agreed that its expression pattern needs to be described in greater detail and at higher resolution.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>a) Please address how abundant this isoform is relative to <italic>daf-2A/daf-2C</italic>. Generally, this could be achieved by designing a primer mixture to multiplex/amplify/detect all three isoforms simultaneously on the gel (each isoform amplicon should be resolved on an agarose gel from the same reaction). Although semi-quantitative, this would give a better impression of how abundant the B isoform is relative to the other two species.</p><p>The authors should already have the RNA collected to do this experiment across developmental stages. It would also be interesting to collect RNA from dauer animals as a comparison as this is a key developmental stage discussed throughout the manuscript.</p><p>b) The fluorescence micrographs are of insufficiently high resolution. The authors should take higher magnifications of different anatomical regions of transgenic animals in order to give a better impression of the results presented.</p><p>Moreover, it is difficult to clearly ascertain cell types objectively from the micrographs given how zoomed out they are (especially the most important Figure 2D). The cell/tissue types need to be definitively identified.</p><p>Since these are tdTomato transgenes, the authors should obtain available GFP marker strains for neurons and hypodermis (intestine would be good as well but this is a bit more obvious to see even at lower magnification), and present co-localization data with cell types of interest at higher magnification.</p><p>2) &quot;Most of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> insulin peptides are thought to act as agonists&quot; is not quite correct, as the authors acknowledge in the last section of the Results. Many act in agonist/antagonist pairs (e.g., <italic>ins-7</italic> and <italic>ins-18</italic>, Murphy et al., 2003, Shaw et al., 2007; Fernandez de Abreu et al., 2014) and were recently well characterized as agonists and antagonists (Zheng et al., 2018). Given that there are both agonists and antagonists, how do the authors propose that antagonists are affected by the DAF-2B isoform? The authors have somewhat touched on this topic indirectly in Figure 7 using dauer pheromone, but with no details that directly test an antagonistic insulin. This part of the model should be better addressed, as it is hard to reconcile a &quot;sopping up&quot; model with antagonist insulin-like peptides.</p><p>3) Much of the data in the paper are derived from overexpressed transgenes from extrachromosomal arrays. While this is reasonable in some cases, the main conclusions do need to be confirmed using endogenously tagged proteins. Specifically, the recommendation is to generate splicing reporters using CRISPR knockins to demonstrate spatiotemporal regulation of production of the <italic>daf-2b</italic> isoform from the endogenous locus. This would also allow you to confirm that DAF-2b forms homodimers and heterodimerizes with DAF-2A via co-IP of endogenously tagged proteins in vivo from the animal. An alternative would be to create mosSCI/miniMos insertions with endogenous promoter, all exons/introns and native UTRs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An alternatively spliced insulin receptor modulates insulin sensitivity via insulin peptide sequestration in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We generated new RNA samples in triplicate for L1-YA and in duplicate for dauer animals. We used the suggested multiplex approach, with a common forward primer in exon 11, a reverse primer in exon 12 which amplifies both <italic>daf-2a</italic> (568bp) and <italic>daf-2c</italic> (814bp), and a primer specific to the <italic>daf-2b</italic> transcript (500bp product). All samples were amplified at the same time and run on the same gel, with the amplification performed on two separate occasions. As expected, the most abundant isoform was <italic>daf-2a</italic>, with <italic>daf-2b</italic> detected at lower abundance in all samples including dauer. We have included a representative gel from one of the replicates in Figure 1 and included the following text:</p><p>“To estimate the relative abundance of the <italic>daf-2b</italic> transcript relative to <italic>daf-2a</italic> and <italic>daf-2c</italic>, we performed multiplex PCR.

Likewise we did not detect hypodermal expression of <italic>daf-2a/c::tdTomato</italic> in dauers. This has been corrected in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;Most of the C. elegans insulin peptides are thought to act as agonists&quot; is not quite correct, as the authors acknowledge in the last section of the Results. Many act in agonist/antagonist pairs (e.g., ins-7 and ins-18, Murphy et al., 2003, Shaw et al., 2007; Fernandez de Abreu et al., 2014) and were recently well characterized as agonists and antagonists (Zheng et al., 2018). Given that there are both agonists and antagonists, how do the authors propose that antagonists are affected by the DAF-2B isoform? The authors have somewhat touched on this topic indirectly in Figure 7 using dauer pheromone, but with no details that directly test an antagonistic insulin. This part of the model should be better addressed, as it is hard to reconcile a &quot;sopping up&quot; model with antagonist insulin-like peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now generated INS-18 over-expression lines (using the native <italic>ins-18</italic> promoter) and found that overexpression of INS-18 enhances dauer formation in response to pheromone in wild type animals, indicating that INS-18 is acting as an antagonist in this context. In the presence of extra copies of DAF-2B, INS-18 is no longer able to enhance dauer entry, supporting the model that DAF-2B is also capable of sequestering insulin peptide antagonists. These data have been included in Figure 7F. The following section has been added to the Results:</p><p>“To test whether DAF-2B could sequester antagonist insulin peptides under these conditions, we generated INS-18 overexpressing animals and examined their ability to influence pheromone-induced dauer formation in the presence or absence of DAF-2B. When over-expressed alone, INS-18 enhanced dauer entry in the presence of pheromone, indicating antagonist activity (Figure 7F). […]</p><p>The question of how do insulin peptides act as antagonists and perhaps more intriguingly, how do some peptides act as both agonists and antagonists, depending on the context, has not been resolved. However, we favor a model in which DAF-2B is equally capable of sequestering an antagonistic peptide or an agonist as we show in the current manuscript. However, more work will be required to fully elucidate the mechanism, which may well be insulin specific.</p><p>We have also added a paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“Overexpression studies have indicated that a number of insulin peptides in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can have mixed function, in that they act as agonists or antagonists depending on the context [Zheng et al., 2018]. […] Thus, reduced INS-18 signaling due to DAF-2B sequestration could lead to an upregulation of INS-7 expression, thereby further suppressing dauer formation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Much of the data in the paper are derived from overexpressed transgenes from extrachromosomal arrays. While this is reasonable in some cases, the main conclusions do need to be confirmed using endogenously tagged proteins. Specifically, the recommendation is to generate splicing reporters using CRISPR knockins to demonstrate spatiotemporal regulation of production of the daf-2b isoform from the endogenous locus. This would also allow you to confirm that DAF-2b forms homodimers and heterodimerizes with DAF-2A via co-IP of endogenously tagged proteins in vivo from the animal. An alternative would be to create mosSCI/miniMos insertions with endogenous promoter, all exons/introns and native UTRs.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to confirm that DAF-2B is expressed from the endogenous locus, we performed CRISPR knockin of mScarlet to generate a C-terminal DAF-2B::mScarlet translational fusion. Specifically, we identified a PAM site just before the in-frame stop codon in the portion of the intron that is retained in DAF-2B. Using a crRNA targeting this PAM site and a PCR-derived homology directed repair template, we were able to generate 2 independent knockins of mScarlet into the <italic>daf-2b</italic> locus. Sequencing confirmed the correction insertion of mScarlet. Both lines showed identical expression patterns and thus we chose just one for co-localization experiments.</p><p>We used confocal microscopy to characterize the expression pattern of this endogenous DAF-2B translational fusion through development into adulthood, as well as in dauers. We also introduced extrachromosomal arrays into this background to confirm tissue localization. We were able to confirm some neuronal expression of DAF-2B::mScarlet, but we did not observe intestinal or hypodermal expression, even in L1 animals, which have the strongest expression of the DAF-2B:tdTomato splicing reporter in these tissues. However, we did observe DAF-2B::mScarlet in coelomocytes in all developmental stages, including dauers, which we confirmed by colocalization with an <italic>unc-122p::gfp</italic> coelomocyte marker. Accumulation of translational GFP fusions in coelomocytes is a hallmark of a secreted protein, as has been demonstrated for the insulin peptide DAF-28. We interpret these data as an indication that DAF-2B is likely secreted. In support of this, we introduced the <italic>unc-122p::gfp</italic> coelomocyte marker into the DAF-2B::tdTomato splicing reporter strain and failed to see colocalization, indicating that DAF-2B is not expressed in coelomocytes.</p><p>In light of these new observations, we have made some modifications to Figure 2. We now include confocal images that demonstrate expression of DAF-2B::mScarlet in the nervous system and the coelomocytes, with colocalization markers, in L1, young adults and dauers. With respect to neuronal expression, we do not see explicit colocalization of DAF-2B::mScarlet with <italic>rgef-1p::gfp</italic> which could be due to the cytosolic location of GFP versus a cell surface localization of DAF-2B::mScarlet. However the location of DAF-2B::mScarlet around the periphery of the GFP positive cells leads us to believe that DAF-2B is in neurons in these images. In terms of the coelomocyte expression, DAF-2B::mScarlet localizes to the vacuoles of the coelomocyte and is clearly within the boundaries of the coelomocyte. We have also included <italic>unc-122p</italic>::GFP/DAF-2B::tdTomato images to demonstrate that DAF-2B splicing does not occur in coelomocytes.</p><p>It was mentioned in the recommendation that generation of a genomic knockin for DAF-2B would also facilitate co-immunoprecipitation experiments with DAF-2A. While we agree with the reviewers that this would be interesting, we have not pursued this line of experiments in this revised manuscript. There are a number of methodological considerations that make this a technically challenging approach that would demand more time than was available in this revision period. However, we remain interested in this aspect of DAF-2B biology and thank the reviewers for pushing us toward generating this knockin. It will be a valuable reagent for future studies of DAF-2B biology.</p><p>Based on these data, we have included the following section in the Results:</p><p>“To establish whether DAF-2B protein is expressed in vivo, we used CRISPR-Cas9 editing to introduce the coding sequence for the mScarlet fluorescent protein into the <italic>daf-2b</italic> genomic locus immediately after exon 11.5 (Figure 2E). […] For example, this might explain why we observed expression of <italic>daf-2b</italic> splicing in intestine, but couldn’t detect DAF-2B:mScarlet in this tissue..”</p><p>The following section has been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“To confirm endogenous expression of DAF-2B protein, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to insert mScarlet into the <italic>daf-2</italic> genomic locus such that fluorescence would only be observed when DAF-2B protein is generated. […] The lack of DAF-2B::tdTomato fluorescence from the splicing reporter in coelomocytes indicates that they are not a site of expression of DAF-2B, and thus, the appearance of DAF-2B::mScarlet in these cells supports the idea that DAF-2B may act as a secreted protein.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We agree that the revised manuscript has been substantially improved by the addition of new data.

We have also included bright field images for Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2.

As suggested, we established the linear range of amplification by examining product accumulation between 33 and 43 cycles and found that the signal started to plateau at 37 cycles. For quantitation, we therefore used 35 cycles to amplify cDNA from our larval samples and ran the reactions on the same gel, using Image J to quantify band intensities. Using this approach, we found that <italic>daf-2a</italic> was between 4 and 7 times higher abundance than <italic>daf-2b</italic>. We have included these data as Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and we have included the following sentence in the Results:</p><p>“Analysis of stage-specific cDNA showed that <italic>daf-2b</italic> is present at all life stages (Figure 1E) and <italic>daf-2a</italic> is between 4 and 7 times more abundant than <italic>daf-2b</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>A legend for Figure 1—figure supplement 2 is included:</p><p>“Multiplex PCR was performed within the linear range of amplification and band intensities were measured using Image J. Each larval stage was examined in triplicate except dauer (duplicate) and data are presented as mean + sd.”</p><p>The gel image shown in Figure 1E was from multiplex PCR at 40 cycles and has been over-exposed which was necessary to show the presence of the <italic>daf-2c</italic> isoform. We have noted the cycle number for these data and as well as the quantification data in the Materials and methods section (subsection “RNA extraction and generation of cDNA by RT-PCR”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With regards to trying to reconcile the endogenous protein expression vs. the splicing reporter expression data:</p><p>The authors provide one interpretation for the discrepancy of the two experimental datasets. However, it is possible that the daf-2 promoter fragment / unc-54 UTR combination used in the splicing reporter is missing regulatory information or causing spurious expression that is distinct from the endogenous protein expression pattern generated by the CRISPR fusion. This additional possibility should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the alternate explanation for the discrepancy between the endogenous protein expression and the splicing reporter and have included the following sentence in the Discussion:</p><p>“However, it should also be noted that differences in the pattern of expression between the endogenous fusion protein and the splicing reporter could arise from the absence of important regulatory sequences and / or the presence of the <italic>unc-54</italic> UTR in the splicing construct.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
