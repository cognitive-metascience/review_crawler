regulators of cell homeostasis and steer cell death, differentiation and longevity in mammalian cells. By combined pharmacophore-modeling-based in silico and fluorescence polarization-based screening we identified small molecules that physically interact with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of FOXO3 and modulate the FOXO3 transcriptional program in human cells. The mode of interaction between compounds and the FOXO3-DBD was assessed <italic>via</italic> NMR spectroscopy and docking studies. We demonstrate that compounds S9 and its oxalate salt S9OX interfere with FOXO3 target promoter binding, gene transcription and modulate the physiologic program activated by FOXO3 in cancer cells.

In mammals, FOXO3 and its family members recognize and bind the same core DNA elements (TTGTTTAC) to control the transcription of direct target genes. However, despite sharing the same consensus sequences, FOXO members serve distinct functions and may act as tissue-specific homeostasis regulators.</p><p>FOXO3 was initially considered as a tumor suppressor that induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calnan and Brunet, 2008</xref>). However, its functions in cellular detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Keizer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salcher et al., 2014</xref>), and drug-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>), maintenance of cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naka et al., 2010</xref>) as well as inhibition of other death-inducers such as TP53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rupp et al., 2017</xref>) suggest also a tumor-promoting role in certain types of cancer.</p><p>Multiple cellular signaling pathways converge on FOXO3, most importantly the pro-proliferative PI3K-PKB pathway that inactivates target gene transcription. On the other hand, stress conditions, such as genotoxic stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) or hypoxic stress, override growth-factor-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3, which results in the relocation of FOXO3 to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hagenbuchner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hagenbuchner et al., 2013</xref>). Thereby, stress induced signaling kinases, such as JNK or MST1 that cause FOXO3 activation and nuclear accumulation also in presence of PKB signaling critically contribute to FOXO3-triggered therapy-resistance programs that protect cancer cells during therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagenbuchner et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rupp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naka et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, FOXO3 regulates the differentiation of naïve regulatory T-cells <italic>via</italic> its transcriptional target FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerdiles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harada et al., 2010</xref>), which limits the cytotoxic anti-cancer T-cell response by immune-suppressive regulatory T-cells that infiltrate tumor tissue. A reversible inhibition of FOXO3 activity by small compounds thereby might boost anti-tumor immune responses and limit side effects of FOXO3 functional inactivation.</p><p>In contrast to the small, defined substrate binding pockets on catalytic enzymes, the DNA binding domain (DBD) of transcription factors are usually regarded as ‘undruggable’ due to the large surfaces and the fact that the only known ligand is a DNA molecule. Small molecules have been described for the transcription factor FOXM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gormally et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hegde et al., 2011</xref>) and one compound was shown to regulate FOXO1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nagashima et al., 2010</xref>), but no compounds have been discovered that directly physically interact with the DBD of FOXO proteins to regulate their transcriptional activity. By a pharmacophore model-based, virtual in silico screening approach we identified compound S9 and demonstrate that this molecule inhibits FOXO3-binding to target promoters, affects the cell-wide transcriptional program of FOXO3, as well as FOXO3 effects on cellular ROS-production and cell growth in 2D and 3D cell culture systems. By NMR we demonstrate that S9 directly interacts with FOXO3 DBD, elucidate the mode of binding and how this molecule structurally interferes with FOXO3 transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of compound S9 as FOXO-DBD ligand</title><p>In the absence of known small molecule ligands, a structure-based modeling workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) was developed, employing the crystal structure of FOXO3 DBD in complex with a 13 bp FOXO3 consensus sequence DNA strand (PDB entry 2UZK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>).

The data analysis provided a resonance assignment for 99 out of 114 residues (87% of the FOXO3-DBD sequence). To identify the S9-binding site in FOXO3-DBD, the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled FOXO3-DBD was titrated with S9OX and <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of the backbone amide groups of FOXO3-DBD were followed in <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The oxalate salt of S9 was used for its higher solubility in water, thus avoiding the use of DMSO and the associated chemical interferences. The presence of S9OX induced significant dose-dependent CSPs of backbone amide groups of fifteen FOXO3-DBD residues (the chemical shift change was greater than σ<sup>0</sup><sub>corr</sub> above the mean), thus suggesting their involvement in the interaction or their conformational change induced by S9 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). When these residues were mapped onto the solution structure of FOXO3-DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), they revealed the binding surface for S9 in the region formed by the DNA recognition α-helix H3 and the N-terminal part of β-strand S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The most affected residues (the chemical shift change was greater than 2σ<sup>0</sup><sub>corr</sub> above the mean) were Arg211, His212, Asn213, Ser215 and Leu216 from the helix H3; Phe220 and Asn237 from the wing W2; and Thr167 from the helix H1. In addition, the gradual shift of resonances during titration indicated fast exchange of the ligand on the NMR time scale, thus suggesting that the S9OX binding is of moderate affinity.</p><p>To obtain greater insight into the interaction of S9 with FOXO3-DBD, docking calculations using Autodock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>) were performed.

The calculated poses with the lowest binding energy were extracted and further validated against results from STD NMR measurements. The final pose is consistent with results from both STD and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments and suggests that S9 binds into the groove formed by residues Arg211, His212 and Ser215 at the C-terminus of α-helix H3 and residues Met221 and Arg222 from the N-terminus of β-strand S2. This region is a crucial part of the FOXO3-DBD/DNA interface as the DNA recognition α-helix H3 is responsible for most of the direct base contacts with DNA and the N-terminal part of β-strand S2 is involved in contacts with the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, these data indicate that S9 binding blocks the DNA binding surface of FOXO3-DBD in the region of the recognition α-helix H3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Compounds S9 and S9OX affect the FOXO3 transcriptional program</title><p>To analyze the effect of compound S9 on mRNA steady state levels of FOXO3-regulated genes we assessed genome-wide regulatory events by mRNA expression profiling. SH-EP/FOXO3 cells were treated with 50 nM 4OHT for three hours in presence or absence of 50 µM compound S9 and the transcriptome was measured with Affymetrix U133 2.0 whole genome chips. 1262 probesets were induced and 889 probesets showed statistically significant repression upon activation of ectopic FOXO3(A3)ERtm as demonstrated in heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and volcano blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). When 4OHT-driven activation of ectopic FOXO3 was combined with S9, the gene induction was much less pronounced, with the expression of only 208 probesets upregulated of which 35 were common with FOXO3 activation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). We examined whether the presence of S9 reversed FOXO3-mediated gene induction and identified 193 probesets showing significant repression in presence of S9, suggesting an inhibition of FOXO3-mediated induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Furthermore, 779 probesets have shown the reversal of expression although they did not reach statistical significance. This suggests that S9 inhibited FOXO3-mediated induction of the majority of mRNAs (77% of FOXO3 induced probesets overall, 15% statistically significant). We also observed an increase in steady state levels of 173 probesets that were not regulated by ectopic FOXO3. These changes in mRNA expression might result from differences in target gene regulation between ectopic FOXO3(A3)ERtm and endogenous FOXO3, as ectopic FOXO3(A3)ERtm carries mutations at the major PKB phosphorylation sites (T32, S253 and S315) or off-target effects. This effect of S9 is well visualized in the heatmap analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) where S9 attenuates the strong induction of a large cluster of genes (top-part of heatmaps) or repressed highly expressed FOXO3 targets by its own (bottom part of heat map), suggesting inhibition of endogenous FOXO3. Interestingly, S9 alone also induced a cluster of strongly repressed FOXO3-targets (middle part of heatmaps) and, for a small number of genes, S9 increased FOXO3-mediated induction (arrows). When comparing S9 with DMSO control, 412 probesets were repressed. Therefore, although S9 mainly exerts an inhibitory effect on FOXO3 transcriptional activity, this compound also induces mRNA expression of a small number of FOXO3 target genes.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Compounds S9/S9OX affect induction of FOXO3 target gene mRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heatmaps of Affymetrix microarray analyses (U133 plus 2.0 expression profiling chips).

The combined data suggest that S9 and S9OX both modulate FOXO3-transcriptional program and target protein regulation. Biochemical results from FPA and NMR-based structural analyses suggest that in vitro the compounds S9/S9OX bind to the DBD of FOXO3 and inhibit DBD – DNA interaction. To address, whether S9 directly interferes with FOXO3 target promoter recognition in living cells we next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses and assessed the binding of FOXO3 to the promoters of BIM, NOXA, SESN3 and DEPP1. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, activation of the conditional FOXO3 allele for three hours significantly increased FOXO3 promoter binding, which is consistent with the previously demonstrated induction of these FOXO3 targets on mRNA and protein level. Importantly, for all investigated promoters, the addition of S9 almost completely reduced the interaction of FOXO3 with endogenous promoters to control level. To assess, whether this reduced promoter binding also correlates with reduced transactivation we used a luciferase reporter vector containing a 544 bp DEPP1 promoter fragment that carries three putative FOXO3 consensus sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salcher et al., 2014</xref>).

We next investigated whether S9 can still modulate FOXO3 effects in a cell system with a 4OHT-activated FOXO3(A3)-H212R-ERtm mutant. H212 is strongly affected by binding of S9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) suggesting that this amino acid critically participates in S9 binding. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> activation of FOXO3(A3)-H212R still induced apoptotic cell death in SH-EP cells although to a significantly lower extent than the FOXO3(A3) construct. However, in contrast to FOXO3(A3)-induced cell death, S9 did not affect apoptosis by the FOXO3(A3)-H212R mutant suggesting that the H212 mutation completely abrogates FOXO3-inhibitory effects of S9. As to this point all experiments were done using ectopically expressed, conditional FOXO3(A3) alleles we next tested whether S9 might also interfere with the regulation of target genes by endogenous FOXO3 in response to chemotherapeutics and/or serum withdrawal. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology we generated FOXO3 knockout cell lines that completely lack endogenous FOXO3, transiently transfected luciferase reporter plasmids for BIM and DEPP1 and treated these cells with etoposide (after serum withdrawal) to activate endogenous FOXO3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hagenbuchner et al., 2012</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5bc</xref>, etoposide treatment increases promoter activity of the BIM and the DEPP1 promoter two- to threefold and S9 completely prevents this induction. Knockout of endogenous FOXO3 abrogates the effect of etoposide treatment on FOXO3-responsive promoters and S9 does not further affect promoter activity suggesting that the inhibitory effect of S9 depends on the presence of endogenous FOXO3 protein and is not due to unspecific effects on transcription. To assess this question further on endogenous expression of FOXO3 target genes we analyzed expression levels of BIM, DEPP1 and SESN3 by qRT-PCR under conditions of etoposide treatment and/or serum withdrawal (0.5% FBS). Serum withdrawal significantly increased expression of DEPP1 and SESN3 and additional treatment with etoposide strongly induced the expression of all three target genes. In FOXO3 knockout cells, still some increase of DEPP1 and SESN3 expression was observed which was not affected by S9. The strong induction of all three genes by a combination of serum-withdrawal and etoposide treatment, which was efficiently inhibited by S9 was also almost completely abrogated by FOXO3 knockout. The combined data clearly demonstrate that S9 transcriptional inhibition of FOXO target genes depends on the presence of cellular FOXO3. To further assess the selectivity of S9 within forkhead proteins and in specific FOXO family members in vitro we established and performed FP assays with recombinant FOXO1-DBD (159-272), FOXO3-DBD, FOXO4-DBD (82-207) and FOXO6-DBD (87-200) as well as with FOXM1-DBD (222 - 360). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>, at a concentration of 250 nM, S9 most efficiently displaced the FAM-labelled IRE-oligonucleotide from FOXO3-DBD and FOXO4-DBD and had a less pronounced effect on FOXO1-DBD. Interestingly, the substance did not interfere with FOXO6-DBD – DNA binding at all. Differential binding/selectivity for FOXO-family members might be explained by the fact that although the amino acid sequences of FOXO-DBDs are highly homologous, NMR solution structures reveal significant differences between the DBDs of these closely related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Psenakova et al., 2019</xref>).

SH-EP/crispCtr and SH-EP/crispFOXO3#1 and #2 cells were transfected with either a Bim-promoter-, a DEPP1-promoter-, or control luciferase reporter plasmid. 24 hr after transfection cells were seeded into 24 wells and kept under 0.5% FBS for 16 hr. Pre-incubation (30 min) with 50 µM S9 or S9OX was performed before 20 µg/ml etoposide were applied for three hours. Luciferase-activity of Bim- and DEPP1-promoters was assessed using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RLU were normalized to control luciferase reporter and expressed as % of control.

SH-EP/crispCtr and SH-EP/crispFOXO3#1 and #2 cell lines were kept at 10% FCS or 0.5% FCS for 16 hr, treated for 30 min with 50 µM of compounds S9 and then for another three hours with 20 µg/ml etoposide as indicated.

To assess the effect of S9 and S9OX on ROS accumulation by FOXO3 we either activated ectopic FOXO3(A3)ERtm by 4OHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) or treated the cells with 20 µg/ml etoposide to activate endogenous FOXO3 <italic>via</italic> DNA-damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Direct activation of ectopic FOXO3 by 4OHT or etoposide treatment cause significant accumulation of cellular ROS as demonstrated by live-cell fluorescence microscopy using the ROS-sensitive dye reduced mitotracker red. Both S9 and S9OX completely prevent ROS accumulation in 4OHT- and etoposide-treated cells demonstrating that S9 and S9OX efficiently prevent cellular ROS accumulation in response to FOXO3 activation. Since results obtained with 2D cell culture only partially reflect effects of compound treatment in tissues or solid tumors we assessed the effect of S9 and its oxalate salt S9OX in 3D spheroids of neuroblastoma cells formed by magnetic bioprinting and magnetic levitation culture. For these experiments the FOXO3-sensitive, high-stage neuroblastoma cell line NB15/FOXO3-GFP was used to directly image cell growth/viability by fluorescence microscopy. To define at which concentrations S9 and S9OX are still biologically active and how long physiologic effects may be observed upon single treatment we reduced the concentrations of S9 and S9OX to 5 µM. Tumor spheres grown for 72 hr floating in a magnetic field were treated with 10 nM 4OHT for 72 hr in presence or absence of S9 and S9OX and then cultured for another week. After this time, sphere-size and number of spheres per well were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–e</xref>). Metabolic activity and cell viability were assessed by measuring ATP-content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) and reduction of resazurin salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>), respectively. Both, S9 and S9OX prevented FOXO3-induced cell death in 3D tumor spheroids at a concentration of 5 µM and after single administration. Although sphere diameter was slightly reduced in S9/S9OX + 4OHT-treated cells compared to controls, still normal numbers of well-formed tumor spheres were present. Importantly, ATP-content and resazurin salt reduction, which are both parameters for cell viability, demonstrated that S9 and S9OX preserved the viability of tumor spheres and strongly inhibited the apoptosis-inducing effect of FOXO3 in this 3D tumor model. The combined data demonstrate that S9 and its oxalate salt S9OX physically interact with the FOXO3-DBD, inhibit FOXO3 transcriptional program and modulate FOXO3 physiologic function in the low micromolar range in living cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effects of compounds S9/S9OX on FOXO3-induced ROS and sphere growth in 3D cell culture models.</title><p>SH-EP/FOXO3 cells were treated either for four hours with 100 nM 4OHT (<bold>a</bold>) or for two hours with 20 µg/ml etoposide (<bold>b</bold>). 50 µM S9 or S9OX were pre-incubated for 15 min.

Based on structural data of FOXO3 and FOXO4 we developed six different pharmacophore-models that were then used for in silico screening of structural compound databases. Candidate compounds were tested biochemically by FPA and for biological efficacy in a cell system stably expressing a conditional FOXO3(A3)ERtm allele that can be activated by the addition of 4OHT. We identified compounds that hamper FOXO3-DNA interaction and enter living cells. We selected S9 which also shows increased binding to FOXO3 within FOXO family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) for further investigation due to its relatively high solubility in water, established the whole chemical synthesis pathway and synthesized an oxalate salt of S9 with increased solubility in water (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>NMR measurements together with molecular docking simulations suggest that S9 binds to the pocket formed by the C-terminal part of α-helix H3 and the wing W1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). This region is a crucial part of the DNA binding surface as it includes residues important for DNA recognition: Arg211, His212 and Ser215 from α-helix H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>) and mutation of His212 also significantly hampers death induction by FOXO3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Furthermore, residues Arg222 and Trp234 from the β-strand S2 at the stem of wing W1 are involved in contact with the phosphate group of the DNA backbone. It is somehow surprising that compound S9 differentially binds to FOXO family members as demonstrated by FPAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) despite high homology. However, in a recent paper we demonstrated that the solution structures of DBD between these closely related FOXO proteins significantly differ thereby also explaining the differences in compound S9 – FOXO-DBD interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Psenakova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, S9 binding could obstruct FOXO3-DBD interaction with the target DNA, thus blocking its transcriptional activity. The pharmacophore models used for virtual screening all reflected interactions with Arg211 and His212, in addition to (and dependent on the respective model) interactions with Asn208, Ser209, and Ser215. Model 1, which mapped compound S9, for example included hydrophobic interactions with Arg211 and His212 as well as hydrogen bonds with His212 and Asn208. The experimentally identified residues involved in binding overall align well with the in silico modeling and small re-arrangements of the proposed binding mode can be expected in solution.</p><p>Gene expression profiling provided an interesting three hours snap-shot on the mRNA changes induced by ectopic FOXO3 activation in presence or absence of compound S9. S9 strongly prevented the induction of FOXO3-induced genes or by its own repressed clusters of highly expressed FOXO3 targets, which is consistent with its interaction to a region in FOXO3-DBD including R211, H212 and S215 which all contribute to helix H3-DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, S9 per se strongly induced a cluster of genes that was actively repressed by ectopically switched on FOXO3 suggesting that these genes are permanently repressed by endogenous FOXO3 in manner that requires the DNA-binding domain either for protein-DNA or protein-protein interaction and that this repression is abrogated by S9. A small cluster of genes was identified that was only moderately induced by ectopic FOXO3, but strongly up-regulated in presence of S9. One explanation for this phenomenon might be that DNA-binding independent transactivation by endogenous FOXO3 is further supported by S9 preventing intra-molecular protein-protein interaction of the C-terminal FOXO3 transactivation domain with the FOXO3-DBD as it involves the C-terminus of α-helix H3, which is part of the S9 binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). These aspects concerning inhibition of intra- or inter-molecular protein-protein interaction at the FOXO3-DBD by S9 are investigated in currently ongoing studies.</p><p>Besides genome-wide regulation we tested the effect of S9 and S9OX on FOXO3 transcriptional targets. The BCL2-family members BIM and NOXA are mediators of FOXO3-induced intrinsic cell death and BIM critically triggers transitory accumulation of ROS at the mitochondria, which is counteracted by the parallel induction of the detoxifying protein SESN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hagenbuchner et al., 2012</xref>). DEPP1 sensitizes neuroblastoma cells for ROS and is strongly induced by FOXO3 via three functional FOXO consensus sequences in its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salcher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salcher et al., 2017</xref>). We demonstrated that FOXO3 induction of these four <italic>bona fide</italic> targets was efficiently reduced by both S9 and S9OX on mRNA level as well as on protein expression level. To further prove direct inhibition of the FOXO3-DBD-DNA interaction in living cells, ChIP analyses on the four <italic>bona fide</italic> targets was performed which demonstrated that increased FOXO3 binding upon ectopic FOXO3-activation was almost completely abrogated by S9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). This was consistent with results from primary FP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and dose-dependent repression of promoter activity by S9 and S9OX as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). If H212 in the S9-interacting region of the FOXO3-DBD is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) or endogenous FOXO3 is knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 technology also the physiologic effects of S9 are abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–f</xref>). This suggests that at least in the used model systems, S9 selectively acts via binding to the DBD of FOXO3. Consistent with the repression of target gene regulation, also FOXO3-induced ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hagenbuchner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salcher et al., 2014</xref>) was efficiently prevented by S9 and S9OX providing evidence that S9 directly interferes with physiological effects of FOXO3 in living cells. Of note S9 might also sterically hamper protein-protein interactions that take place at the FOXO3-DBD such as the binding of the tumor suppressor protein TP53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rupp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). As affinity measurements using recombinant protein fragments provide only limited information about biologically effective concentrations, we generated magnetic 3D tumor spheres that allowed us on one hand to assess possible long term toxicity of S9/S9OX in 3D culture and on the other to test effective doses of these compounds. S9/S9OX neither reduced sphere-numbers nor diameter when spheres were treated 72 hr with 5 µM of these drugs, but efficiently prevented FOXO3-induced cell death. Interestingly, the growth-inhibitory effects of FOXO3 were only partially inhibited, which corresponds to the observation that gene-dosage effects of FOXO3 lead to, in part, contrary physiological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagenbuchner et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>FOXO transcription factors have been implicated in a plethora of different cellular functions, in cancer immunity where loss of FOXO3 exerts anti-cancer effects, but also hampers other arms of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luo and Li, 2018</xref>), in neuronal development and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McLaughlin and Broihier, 2018</xref>), cancer angiogenesis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). This excludes the permanent ablation of FOXO activity in mammals as a therapeutic option. More complexity is added by the fact that the DBD of FOXO transcription factors participates in intra-, but also intermolecular interactions with other cellular key regulators of death and longevity, such as TP53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) and thereby also affects drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rupp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Salcher et al., 2019</xref>) or aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baar et al., 2017</xref>). Due to its mode of binding, S9 might well interfere with some of these protein-protein interactions. The effect of the small drug-like molecule S9 on specific tissues has to be investigated in detail to evaluate, whether S9 can serve as a chemical starting point for developing FOXO-regulatory compounds that steer distinct target gene subsets/functions of FOXO transcription factors. The advantage of small drug-like molecules such as S9 is the strict control of application-dose and -time and the fact that they are not immunogenic allowing repeated applications – so dose- and application time can be adjusted to damage cancer cells or boost anti-cancer immunity, but also limit unwanted side effects of FOXO-inhibition on stem cells and other somatic tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key Resources Table (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Analysis of FOXO3-DNA interactions and generation of interaction maps</title><p>The experimentally observed interactions of the FOXO3 consensus sequence DNA strand and the FOXO3-DBD were extracted in LigandScout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wolber and Langer, 2005</xref>) version 3.0 and represented by pharmacophore features.

The molecular strategy chosen by the author is to target the DNA binding domain of FOXO3 transcription factor, using a pipeline that relies on: 1) an in silico-based approach (docking FOX/DNA to identify hot spot- generate 76 hits for in vitro testing via virtual screening using 2 chemical databases). 2) modelling of protein DNA interface to identify putative residues involved in small compound interaction. 3) combination of in vitro homogenous assay (FP) and in vitro cell-based assay with transcriptomics and tumour sphere assay as a readout for FOXO3 activity to validate inhibitor activity in living cells.</p><p>Overall the quality of the data is high and the manuscript clearly written. There is no doubt that the identified compound (S9) has some biological effects, at least in part mediated by FOXO3 inhibition, however the on-target engagement on FOXO3 lack some experimental evidences. With the current data set as it stands one cannot definitely come to the conclusion that S9 mostly acts via FOXO3 inhibition and interference of DNA binding.</p><p>Key experimental evidences missing to support the claims:</p><p>1) The rationale is to target the DNA binding activity of FOXO3. Aside from the FP data there is no evidence that S9 acts with this mode of action in cells to interfere with gene transcription. To address this the authors would need to perform ChiPSeq for FOXO3 in presence or absence of the compound and show that genome wide binding locations are interfered with by S9. At least the author should be able to provide some evidence on a subset of known FOXO3 direct target genes that FOXO3 binding is altered at known binding sites – This can be done by ChIP-qPCR analysis.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to perform thermal stability assay in presence of FOXO3 or a FOXO3 mutant (Arg 211, His 212, Ser215 amino acid thought to be involved with S9 interaction) with and without S9. This to further support the modelling data for compound/protein interaction.</p><p>3) It is difficult to understand how S9 achieve such a high level of selectivity to FOXO3 at least in FP while targeting such a highly conserved region as the DNA binding domain of FOX protein. Of note the FP experiments run for FOXO3 and other FOXO protein use different concentrations of S9 molecules (250nM for FOXOs vs. 500nM for FOXO3). To be able to compare selectivity it is necessary to perform the same dose response of S9 across all the FOXO protein.</p><p>4) The work rely solely on the use of 1 compound, it is therefore difficult to assess the level of selectivity of this molecular space. How are other compounds closely related (with a similar pharmacophore) but with no predicted DNA binding activity behave (at least in FP). Can S9 affect FOXM1 DNA binding activity? These data would help to assess specificity and efficacy of S9 as a protein/DNA disruptor.</p><p>5) It Is possible that S9 and 4-OHT have a synergic or additive effect on FOXO3 gene regulatory network. The analysis of the RNAseq data set should revised and include an analysis of DEseq for -4OHT with -4OHT+S9. This would be useful to assess the effect of the inhibitor on endogenous FOXO3 activity.</p><p>6) The authors highlight that the SH-EP neuroblastoma cell line used in this work has some level of FOXO3 activity. In the tumour sphere assay there is no effect of S9 in condition without 4OHT. It seems that S9 only works in over-expression condition- if there is endogenous FOXO3 expression in SHEP cells why is there no effect of S9?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hagenbuchner et al. describe inhibition of the transcription factor FOXO3 by small molecule targeting of its DNA-binding domain. Therapeutic targeting of transcription factors is highly desirable, but remains a significant challenge. Practical advancements in this area are thus potentially impactful, and the topic of this study is thus relevant for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are some key elements of the work where improvements are warranted:</p><p>1) – Given that a major concern of small molecule perturbation of DNA-binding is the specificity of this approach, it is important to clearly establish selectivity of S9/S9OX, across the FOXO family and beyond. While the fluorescence polarization assay measuring binding of FOXO-DBD to labelled oligo provides some evidence of potential selectivity (though the result for FOXO4 is borderline), the NMR data (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) suggests an overlap in residues impacted by S9OX in FOXO1 and FOXO3, with distinct regions of the protein impacted in FOXO4 – suggesting that the DBD of all these family members may bind to S9OX, to some degree. These data do not support the statement that the NMR data &quot;suggests selectivity of S9 and S9OX within the FOXO-family of transcription factors.&quot;</p><p>2) – Given the above, it would be useful to see the primary biochemical validation data (i.e. fluorescence polarization assay) for the 76 virtual hits that were experimentally tested, to understand the dynamic range, sensitivity and specificity of the in vitro screening assay e.g. what did an unconfirmed hit look like, vs. S9? Ideally, a secondary screen would have been performed against an unrelated DBD – was this done?</p><p>3) – The mRNA expression data showing attenuation of 4OHT-induced transcription by S9(OX), and the CHIP data showing a prevention of 4OHT-induced DNA binding of FOXO3 are highly encouraging. However, a limitation is that much of the functional data is in the context of exogenously expressed, ER-tagged, mutant FOXO3. Activity states of endogenous FOXO3 can be &quot;toggled&quot; using PI3K/AKT inhibitors (e.g. Santo et al., Cancer Research, 2013). An assessment of how S9(OX) impacts endogenous FOXO3-mediated transcription and DNA-binding under these conditions would provide more compelling support for S9 mechanism.</p><p>4) – For the viability experiments on the NB15 cells, the S9 dose is dropped to 5µM, while the FOXO3-specific pathway assessments were conducted at 50µM – it would be worthwhile to show a dose response of both the transcriptional and physiological effects to demonstrate that the physiological consequences of S9-treatment are due to an on-target effect on transcription i.e. the transcriptional and physiological phenotypes should occur/arise at similar drug concentrations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48876.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers and myself judge the work to be important and timely for this field.

We also explain there, how the different compounds were clustered according to the combined FP- and cytometry live/dead screening results. We replaced also the previous FP graph (now Figure 1F) and cell based validation assay (now Figure 1G) by experiments showing dose dependent effects of S9 and S9ox. In Figure 1G we used a constant concentration of 4OHT to activate ectopic FOXO3, varied the concentration of S9 from 3.1 µM to 50 µM and nicely demonstrate that S9 and S9OX inhibit cell death in a dose dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I consider all the points raised by reviewers essential, with the exception of developing new variants of S9 that I consider super interesting but out of the scope of this paper. following is a summary of the concerns to address.</p><p>1) Selectivity issue: following is a list of the points raised by the two reviewers.

This demonstrates that the compounds S9 and S9OX do not induce programmed cell death per se and that above a certain level of activation of ectopic FOXO3 (i.e. approx. 20 nM 4OHT) cell death induction reaches a plateau in this model system within 48 hours. As S9 inhibits FOXO3 and also ectopic FOXO3-induced cell death triggered by 4OHT, synergistic effects between 4OHT and S9 cannot be detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Cellular source of FOXO3: overexpression of FOXO3 is a problem and one would want to see some other approach. Reviewer 2 in her point 3 suggest a great possibility that would offer an orthogonal system to perform this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Selectivity issue and cellular source of FOXO3:</p><p>We agree with the editors and the reviewers that the selectivity issue / possible off target effects of S9 were not fully investigated in the previous manuscript. In addition, the reviewers noted correctly that all biological studies were performed using a conditional ectopically expressed FOXO3 construct that might behave different to endogenous FOXO3.</p><p>We tried to address these questions in detail and generated cell lines where endogenous FOXO3 was homozygous deleted by CRISPR/Cas 9 technology and cell lines carrying a conditional FOXO3 allele with a mutation at histidine H212 (H212 is central to the S9 binding pocket and showed a significant shift upon S9 binding, see Figure 2B and C). Cell biological experiments demonstrate that FOXO3 is essential for the induction of target genes Bim, DEPP1 and SESN3 under low serum conditions or genotoxic stress (Figure 5B-F). Upon deletion of endogenous FOXO3 the compound S9 does not repress above FOXO3 targets in response to serum withdrawal and / or etoposide treatment any longer. This proves that S9 exerts its inhibitory effect exclusively via endogenous FOXO3. Importantly, mutation of H212 markedly inhibits the death-inducing abilities of ectopic FOXO3, but completely abrogates S9 effects suggesting that H212 is essential for S9 – FOXO3 interaction. We now added a complete new Figure 5 to the manuscript showing these data.</p><p>To address the relevance of endogenous FOXO3 for the growth of tumor spheroids we cultured NB15/crispFOXO3 cells (FOXO3 knockout) for three days with/without S9 and observed that knockout of endogenous FOXO3 has no significant effect on viability of 3D tumor spheroids.</p><p>To address possible binding of S9 beyond FOXO family members we performed FPAs with recombinant FOXM1 protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) and the suggested Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) assays (reviewer #1, point 3) with the newly generated FOXO3 mutant (Arg211, His212 and Ser215). Like for the FOXO-family member FOXO6, S9 did not affect FOXM1-DBD – DNA interaction as measured by FPA, suggesting that S9 is not effective on FOXM1. DSF analyses did not provide clear results which might be explained by too low sensitivity of this method. Nevertheless, a subtle stabilization was observed for the wildtype and a subtle destabilisation for the triple mutant.</p><p>In an ongoing project we are also investigating the chemical spaces and are trying to generate improved chemical derivatives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>This work by Psenakova and colleagues is really exciting and will directly contribute to the emerging and expanding field of drugging transcription.

As noticed, the sensitivity of this technique is not high enough to detect weak interaction between FOXO3-DBD and S9. Nevertheless, we observed subtle stabilization in the case of WT and subtle destabilization for the mutant, however in both cases observed changes in Tm were not statistically significant. Listed values are mean +/- SD from six measurements. Protein concentration was 15 µM. In addition, we also generated cell lines expressing a conditional FOXO3-H212R mutant allel and tested the effect of this mutant in presence or absence of S9. As shown in Figure 5A, this mutant has residual cell death inducing activity, which is not affected by S9 or S9OX any longer. As death induction in this cell model depends on the transcriptional induction of Bim (Hagenbuchner et al., 2012) these data suggest that the residual transcriptional activity of this mutant is not affected by S9 due to significant changes in the S9 binding pocket that hamper S9 binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is difficult to understand how S9 achieve such a high level of selectivity to FOXO3 at least in FP while targeting such a highly conserved region as the DNA binding domain of FOX protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the DBD is highly conserved within the FOXO family members detailed analyses of NMR solution structures of FOXO1-DBD, FOXO3-DBD and FOXO4-DBD demonstrates that the positions of helices H1, H2 and H3 and the interactions between hydrophobic residues at the interface between the N-terminal segment, the H2-H3 loop and the recognition helix H3 differ within the FOXO protein family members (Psenakova et al., 2019).

Only in the FPA shown in previous Figure 1 we had a concentration of 500 nM.

Of note, as S9 or S9OX do not affect viability per se, on a physiologic level no synergism between 4OHT and S9 can be observed. We now mentioned in the text that S9 by its own caused repression of 412 genes (subsection “Compounds S9 and S9OX affect the FOXO3 transcriptional program”. To further assess the effect of S9 on endogenous FOXO3 we generated FOXO3 knock out cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and analyzed the effect of serum withdrawal and/or etoposide treatment on target gene regulation in presence or absence of S9 and S9OX.

The fact that FOXO3 is dispensable at normoxic conditions (Hagenbuchner et al., 2017) for the survival of SH-EP as well as of NB15 neuroblastoma cells that we used for formation of tumor spheres is further demonstrated by the fact that FOXO3 knockout cells show no reducedproliferation or viability (Figure 5B-F). In Figure 5 we also demonstrate that compound S9 and S9OX exert pronounced effects on endogenous gene regulation under conditions of serum withdrawal and/or genotoxic stress – so the compound acts also on endogenous FOXO3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Hagenbuchner et al. describe inhibition of the transcription factor FOXO3 by small molecule targeting of its DNA-binding domain.

Although the FPA demonstrated that DNA-interaction of the FOXO family member FOXO6 was not affected by S9 we also performed FPA assays with recombinant FOXM1-DBD protein. The data suggest that S9 does not affect the interaction of FOXM1-DBD with its cognate consensus sequence (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). In addition, we also generated cell lines with a conditional FOXO3-H212R allele. In this FOXO3 allele the H212, which had the most pronounced shift in NMR upon S9 binding, is mutated. This mutant shows strongly reduced, but still visible induction of cell death (Figure 5A), which depends on the induction of Bim in these neuroblastoma cells (Hagenbuchner et al., 2012). Importantly, in these cells the addition of S9 does not affect cell death at all, suggesting that the loss of H212 in FOXO3 prevents S9 – FOXO3-DBD interaction.</p><p>To address the selectivity issue we knocked out endogenous FOXO3 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, applied growth factor withdrawal and/or genotoxic stress by etoposide treatment which both trigger activation of endogenous FOXOs (Hagenbuchner et al., 2012; Hagenbuchner et al., 2013). S9 and S9OX block the activation of reporter plasmids for Bim and DEPP1 promoter (Figure 5B, C), as well as the induction of endogenous Bim, DEPP1 and SESN3 (Figure 5D-F). Importantly, in FOXO3 knockout cells S9 did not show any inhibitory effect, thereby demonstrating that S9 / S9OX acts onto stress- and growth factor withdrawal-induced genes via FOXO3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mRNA expression data showing attenuation of 4OHT-induced transcription by S9(OX), and the CHIP data showing a prevention of 4OHT-induced DNA binding of FOXO3 are highly encouraging.

Therefore, the induction (or repression by S9 / S9OX) of one gene might not correlate directly with the physiologic outcome. To demonstrate dose-dependent inhibition of FOXO3-induced cell death we now included a dose-response curve as Figure 1G. We hope that the reviewer agrees with us that the selective knockout of FOXO3 is a good strategy to demonstrate that S9 acts via FOXO3-induced transcription. Please note that serum withdrawal also increases the expression of FOXO3 target genes, primarily involved in stress-detoxification (Figure 5D-F) in the FOXO3 knockout background suggesting that another serum responsive regulator induces the transcription and that this induction is not affected by S9 or S9OX.</p><p>References:</p><p>Hagenbuchner, J., and M.
