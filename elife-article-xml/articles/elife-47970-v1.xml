Although various protocols achieve myogenic differentiation in vitro, resulting myotubes typically display an embryonic identity. This is a major hurdle for accurately recapitulating disease phenotypes in vitro, as disease commonly manifests at later stages of development. To address this problem, we identified four factors from a small molecule screen whose combinatorial treatment resulted in myotubes with enhanced maturation, as shown by the expression profile of myosin heavy chain isoforms, as well as the upregulation of genes related with muscle contractile function. These molecular changes were confirmed by global chromatin accessibility and transcriptome studies. Importantly, we also observed this maturation in three-dimensional muscle constructs, which displayed improved in vitro contractile force generation in response to electrical stimulus. Thus, we established a model for in vitro muscle maturation from PS cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>myotubes</kwd><kwd>maturation</kwd><kwd>small molecules</kwd><kwd>myogenic differentiation</kwd><kwd>3D culture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR055299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlingeiro</surname><given-names>Rita CR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR071439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlingeiro</surname><given-names>Rita CR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER DMR-1151529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>394378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mondragon-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ADVault, Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlingeiro</surname><given-names>Rita CR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MyDirectives.com</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlingeiro</surname><given-names>Rita CR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Treatment of human pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes with a cocktail of small molecules induces their maturation, as shown by gene expression, biochemical and functional assays.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pluripotent stem (PS) cells represent an attractive model system for disease modeling, drug screening and cell therapy applications for genetic diseases. PS cells possess the unique feature of unlimited proliferative potential and the ability to differentiate into all cell types of the body. The advent of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology enables the easy derivation of PS cells from any individual, including patients with genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). This allows for the generation of unlimited numbers of patient-specific cell derivatives, which can potentially recapitulate a given disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avior et al., 2016</xref>). For this to be successfully accomplished, two critical aspects need to be fulfilled. One is the use of an efficient methodology for generating the cell type of interest. The second critical aspect is maturation. This latter point in particular has been a conundrum in the field since extensive literature suggests that PS cell-derivatives are predominantly embryonic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelalim and Emara, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigha and Raynaud, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiwlawat et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To date, attempts to induce maturation of PS cell-derivatives involve maintaining the cells in culture for long periods of time, generally longer than one month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lainé et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paavilainen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). A recent study comparing the transcriptional profile of transgene-free PS cell-derived myotubes with fetal myotubes revealed inhibition of TGFβ signaling as an approach to enhance in vitro PS cell-derived skeletal muscle maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, inhibition of the TGFβ signaling pathway through the use of small molecules has been extensively reported to result in enhanced myotube differentiation and hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furutani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schabort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watt et al., 2010</xref>). These studies suggest that small molecules have the potential to modify the profile of differentiation and maturation of skeletal muscle cells in vitro.</p><p>In this study, we performed a small molecule screening and identified four candidates whose combinatorial treatment enhances the maturation of PS cell-derived myotubes in a time frame of 5 days of myotube differentiation. This was evident by the striking increase in the expression profile of neonatal myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform as well as in other genes associated with neonatal and adult muscle, as revealed by chromatin accessibility and RNA sequencing analyses. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of the combinatory small molecule treatment for inducing maturation and improving contractile force generation of three-dimensional (3D) PS cell-derived muscle constructs, thus contributing to the use of organoid-like platforms for in vitro modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimal differentiation of PS cells into somite-like stage enhances PAX7-induced myogenesis</title><p>To induce mesoderm differentiation of PS cells, we utilized CHIR99021 (GSK3β inhibitor) treatment for two days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which we and others have previously reported to improve skeletal myogenic differentiation from PS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borchin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). This treatment resulted in the expression of the early mesoderm marker <italic>T</italic> as well as the paraxial mesoderm markers <italic>MSGN1</italic> and <italic>TBX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Considering the recent literature demonstrating the ability of the BMP inhibitor LDN193189 and the TGFβ inhibitor SB431542 to induce somitic mesoderm-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xi et al., 2017</xref>), we investigated whether these inhibitors would enhance myotube generation in the context of PAX7-induced myogenic differentiation. Treatment of differentiating PS cells from day 4 to day 6 with LDN193189 and SB431542 (+LS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) resulted in increased expression of <italic>MEOX1</italic>, <italic>TCF15</italic>, <italic>PAX3</italic> and <italic>FOXC2</italic> on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Induction of PAX7 expression with doxycycline began on day 5, two days earlier than our standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darabi et al., 2012</xref>), as we reasoned that optimal myogenic specification by PAX7 would be achieved if it was induced when cells are at the peak of somite-like state. On day 12, PAX7<sup>+</sup> myogenic progenitors were purified based on GFP expression, expanded in the presence of doxycycline and bFGF for three cell passages, and then subjected to terminal differentiation culture conditions, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darabi et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, MyHC-expressing myotubes were detected only when cultures were subjected to terminal differentiation following withdrawal of doxycycline. Our results showed significant improvement in the differentiation efficiency of several of the seven PS cell lines investigated (unaffected and diseased), when compared to the unmodified protocol (-LS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result was particularly evident in PS cell lines displaying limited in vitro differentiation potential using the unmodified protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Small molecule library screening for enhancing myogenic differentiation/maturation</title><p>Despite the promising results described above, PS cell-derived myotubes remained immature, as indicated by their thin morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and predominant expression of the embryonic isoform of myosin heavy chain (<italic>MYH3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether small molecule compounds may enhance the maturation of PS cell-derived myotubes, we performed a small molecule library screening using the Tocriscreen stem cell toolbox kit (Tocris). This library consists of 80 stem cell modulator compounds. Myogenic progenitors were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated for three days in the presence of expansion medium (bFGF and Dox). Then, culture medium was switched to differentiation medium supplemented or not with small molecules from the library, with each well containing an individual compound in a final concentration of 10 μM. Five days later, cells were stained for MyHC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We reasoned that an increase in the ratio of MyHC (+) to DAPI (+) area would indicate thicker myotubes as a consequence of increased multinucleation, hypertrophy and/or enhanced differentiation, which could be potentially accompanied by increased maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biressi et al., 2007b</xref>). We identified several compounds exhibiting a positive or negative effect on terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). For the purposes of this study, we selected five compounds that consistently showed statistically significant increase (p&lt;0.001) in MyHC/DAPI area ratio in myotubes derived from multiple PS cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This set includes the TGFβ signaling inhibitor SB431542 (S), the γ-Secretase inhibitor DAPT (Da), the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (De), the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (P), and the adenylyl cyclase activator Forskolin (F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Since concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 μM of the selected compounds did not significantly change the MyHC/DAPI area ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), in subsequent studies we used 10 μM for each compound.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47970.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Combinatorial treatment with four small molecules augments myotube generation from human PS cells and their fusion ability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar graph shows expression profile of <italic>MYH</italic> isoforms in hiPSC-1-derived myotubes. Data are shown as mean ± S.E.M.; n = 3, ***p&lt;0.001.

For this analysis, we focused on the loci characterized by increased chromatin accessibility upon S/Da/De/F treatment. Upon annotation of the ATAC-seq peaks to the two nearest genes followed by comparison with the transcriptomic data, we observed that 42% of the loci were associated to differentially expressed genes (1727/4145 annotated genes). Of these, 878 and 849 transcripts were upregulated and downregulated, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Gene ontology classification of these two lists of genes confirmed that loci characterized by increased chromatin accessibility and increased expression are associated with muscle contraction, regulation of calcium storage and muscle development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, loci with increased chromatin accessibility and decreased expression demonstrated enrichment for non-myogenic developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that S/Da/De/F treatment alters the epigenetic landscape of differentiating PS cell-derived myogenic progenitors by increasing chromatin accessibility at elements associated with key myogenic genes and pathways, potentially underlying the mechanism of small molecule-induced maturation of myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Functional maturation using 3D muscle constructs</title><p>To determine the effect of the combinatorial treatment on the contractile function of resulting myotubes, we tested them on 3D muscle constructs that allow force measurement of PS cell-derived myotubes.

After 3 days, the medium was switched to differentiation medium supplemented with DMSO or combinatorial treatment and cultured for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At this point, the contractile force generation (twitch and tetanus) in response to electrical stimulus was measured. We found a remarkable increase in both twitch and tetanus force generation in the treated group (about 15-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>).

Skeletal muscle reaches full functionality through tissue maturation from embryonic, to fetal, neonatal and adult stages. These stages of maturation are characterized by the expression of specific proteins and protein isoforms, such as MyHC variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiaffino et al., 2015</xref>). This is particularly relevant when studying muscular dystrophies with adult onset or where progression of the disease occurs at the post-neonatal stage. For instance, in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), absence of dystrophin at the sarcolemma is compensated to some extent by utrophin during early gestational stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helliwell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pons et al., 1993</xref>). However, upon birth utrophin is located preferentially at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohlendieck et al., 1991</xref>). Although in regenerating fibers utrophin can be detected at the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gramolini et al., 1999</xref>), it is insufficient to sustain its stability, leading to the severe DMD phenotype in the adult muscle.</p><p>While several approaches have been reported to differentiate PS cells towards the myogenic lineage, there is still a limitation in promoting the full maturation of resulting myotubes. This issue compromises the biological relevance of in vitro studies data using PS cell- derivatives. Our small molecule screening in search for potential candidates able to promote maturation of PS cell-derived myotubes identified the compounds SB431542, DAPT, Dexamethasone, Forskolin and PD0325901 as potent enhancers of maturation, in particular when used in combination. Interestingly, SB431542 (TGFβ signaling inhibitor) and DAPT (Notch signaling inhibitor) have been described to promote hypertrophy and fusion of myoblasts lines, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitzmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watt et al., 2010</xref>). Dexamethasone was an unexpected finding based on its well-known function in promoting atrophy in myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong and Forsberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thompson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). This suggests that dexamethasone may have an opposite role during differentiation of embryonic myotubes compared to adult counterparts, although a detailed mechanism remains to be further dissected. Forskolin has been reported to increase myoblast proliferation through activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, our studies show that Forskolin treatment enhances the differentiation efficiency of PS cell-derived progenitors into myotubes. Finally, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MEK1) has been shown to have contrary effects on myoblast differentiation depending on the time point of activation. For instance, MEK1 activation during the first 24 hr after switching to terminal differentiation conditions decreases differentiation while at a mid-stage stabilizes MyoD and promotes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jo et al., 2009</xref>). We observed that MEK1 inhibition, through PD0325901, enhanced differentiation of PS cell-derived progenitors. Our findings corroborate the idea that although there are common factors involved in embryonic and adult myogenesis, the molecular signature of these processes is not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czerwinska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lepper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Conboy, 2010</xref>), and therefore, compounds should not be expected to cause the same effects.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that S/Da/De/F combination dramatically increased fusion, differentiation and maturation of resulting myotubes compared to individual treatments, and this coincided with increased chromatin accessibility in elements associated with myogenic specification at day 2, which suggests that treatment is beneficial from the beginning upon switching to terminal differentiation conditions. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis at day 5 revealed an increase in the expression of genes associated with muscle functionality and maturation processes. This is relevant as it shows that the combinatorial treatment is also beneficial to sustain myotube maturation. Importantly, the differentiation and maturation switch occur within 5 days upon switching to differentiation medium and is applicable to MD patient-specific iPS cell-derived myotubes, in addition to unaffected cell lines. We also found that the maturation induced by this treatment is relevant to iPS cell-derived myotubes generated using a transgene-free differentiation protocol, confirming its broad applicability. Our data show that S/Da/De/F treatment is not only significant for the expression of genes associated with maturation in 2D cultures, but it also enhances the contractile capacity of PS cell-derived 3D muscle constructs. This is relevant as the development of organoid-like structures have been shown to provide improved structural organization and, therefore, enhanced tissue functionality, which are critical in the development of reliable platforms for disease modeling and therapy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clevers, 2016</xref>). Taken together, we show that the combinatorial treatment of S/Da/De/F contributes to enhanced myotube differentiation and maturation of PS cell myogenic derivatives, and therefore represents an advance for studying skeletal muscle function and disease in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Minnesota (Ref: 0904M63241). PS cell lines used in this study are described in key resources table. hiPSC-3, hiPSC-4 and hiPSC-DMD1 were generated by the Pluripotent Stem Cell Facility at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Pluripotency characterization is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Teratoma studies were performed by injecting 1.5 × 10^6 PS cells in the quadriceps of NSG mice (from Jackson labs). Before injection, cells were resuspended in 1:1 solution DMEM-F12 and Matrigel (final volume including cells: 65 µl).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture and myogenic differentiation of PS cells</title><p>ES and iPS cells were maintained in mTeSR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies) on Matrigel-coated plates. ES/iPS cells were dissociated with Accumax and passaged once they reached 90% confluency and plated with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632 (APExBIO). To induce conditional expression of PAX7, ES/iPS cells were co-transduced with lentiviral vectors, pSAM2-iPAX7-IRES-GFP and FUGW-rtTA to generate iPAX7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darabi et al., 2012</xref>). For myogenic differentiation, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> iPAX7-ES/iPS cells were plated with 10 μM Y-27632 in a 60 mm petri dish and incubated for 2 days on a shaker at 60 rpm at 37°C to derive embryoid bodies (EBs). Cells were then switched to myogenic medium (MM) supplemented with 10 μM GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR99021; Tocris). Myogenic medium consisted of IMDM basal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% glutamax (Gibco), 1% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KOSR; Gibco), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 4.5 mM monothioglycerol (MP biomedicals). After 2 days, cells were switched to MM supplemented with 200 nM BMP inhibitor (LDN193189; Cayman Chemical) and 10 μM TGFβ inhibitor (SB431542, Cayman Chemical). 24 hr later, on day 5, 1 μg/ml Doxycycline (Dox; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium. After 24 hr, cells were switched to fresh MM with 1 μg/ml Dox and incubated at 37°C for 2 days. EBs were collected and 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the EBs volume was plated on gelatin coated T75 flasks in expansion medium (EM), consisting of MM with 1 μg/ml Dox and 5 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; PeproTech). After 4 days, cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and FACS sorted for GFP to derive myogenic progenitors which were plated at a density of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup>/T75 flask in EM. Myogenic progenitors were passaged upon reaching 90% confluence with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at a ratio of 1:6 to 1:8. To induce terminal differentiation, myogenic progenitors at P3-4 were plated at a density of 75,000 cells/well of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow confluent for 3 days. The medium was then switched to low nutrient differentiation medium (DM) consisting of DMEM-KO supplemented with 20% KOSR, 1% Non-Essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco), 1% glutamax and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and incubated for 5 days to derive myotubes.</p><p>Transgene-free myogenic differentiation was performed following a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xi et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, hiPS cells were plated as single cells onto a well of a Matrigel-coated 6-well dish in mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 (day 0). The next day (day 1), medium was switched to basal medium (1% ITS-G and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in DMEM/F12) supplemented with 3 μM CHIR99021. At day 3, medium was switched to basal medium supplemented with 200 nM LDN193189 and 10 μM SB431542. At day 5, medium was switched to basal medium supplemented with 3 μM CHIR99021 and 20 ng/ml bFGF. At day 7, medium was switched to 15% KOSR and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in DMEM supplemented with 10 ng/ml HGF and 2 ng/ml IGF1 for 14 days. Medium was replaced every other day. At day 21, cells were dissociated with Collagenase IV for 5 min followed by TryPLE Express for 5 min. Cell suspension was filtered through 100 μm and 40 μm cell strainers, sequentially. Cells were cultured and expanded on Matrigel coated dishes in MM. For terminal myotube differentiation, cells were grown to confluency and then MM was replaced by DM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Small molecule library screening</title><p>Small molecule library screening was performed using the Tocriscreen Stem Cell Toolbox Kit (Tocris), which consists of 80 compounds. Myogenic progenitors were seeded at 12,000 cells/well in 96-well plates (triplicates) and incubated at 37°C for 3 days to reach 100% confluency. After 3 days, the cells were switched to DM supplemented with 10 μM of the compounds from the library or with DMSO. Each well contained an individual compound. Cells were incubated in this differentiation medium for 5 days to derive myotubes. Cells were then fixed and processed for immunostaining of MyHC and counterstained with DAPI. Stained plates were imaged such that most of the well area was covered. The ratio of area of MyHC/DAPI staining was quantified using Image J and normalized to that of DMSO treated cells. Compounds showing a significant increase of 1.2-fold or more in ratio of MyHC/DAPI relative to DMSO among replicates and among the three cell lines tested were used for further studies: S (Cayman Chemical), Da (Selleckchem), De (Cayman Chemical), P (Cayman Chemical) and F (Cayman Chemical. Different combinations were made with selected compounds and their effect on differentiation was tested and quantified as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>For immunofluorescence staining, samples were fixed with 4% PFA for 20–30 min at RT, followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at RT. Samples were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr. Primary antibody diluted in 3% BSA was added after blocking and was incubated overnight at 4°C. Following this incubation, samples were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody and DAPI for 45–60 min at RT in dark. After this incubation, samples were washed with PBS and stored in dark at 4°C until imaging. For immunofluorescence staining of 3D muscle constructs, these were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr at RT, followed by incubation in a solution of 30% Sucrose and 5% DMSO for 4 hr at RT and then incubated in a solution of 15% Sucrose, 2.5% DMSO and 50% OCT embedding medium at 4°C overnight. Next, constructs were embedded in OCT and frozen with liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane. Frozen 3D constructs were cryosectioned longitudinally at 45 µm thickness. Frozen sections were allowed to dry at RT for 15 min and the sections were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min prior to 10 min fixation with 4% PFA. Following staining procedure, slides were mounted with coverslips using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen). The stained sections were imaged using Zeiss upright microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Myotubes fusion index</title><p>Differentiated myotubes were processed for pan-MyHC immunostaining. Cells were imaged using Zeiss upright microscope and analysis was performed from aleatory fields of the well. Myotubes were identified as elongated MyHC (+) cells containing at least two nuclei. Fusion index was calculated as the percentage of nuclei within myotubes relative to the total number of nuclei. Approximately 500 nuclei and 100 myotubes were counted for fusion index and number of nuclei per myotube, respectively, for each replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>EdU cell proliferation assay</title><p>This was performed using iClick EdU Andy Fluor 555 Imaging Kit (GeneCopoeia). Cells were incubated with 10 µM of EdU for 24 hr. After this incubation, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at RT and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT. Following this, EdU staining was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained cells were imaged using Cytation 3 (BioTek) and EdU positive nuclei were quantified using Image J.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein extraction was performed using lysis buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 28 μM E64 and 2 mM PMSF) combined with 1X Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 10 min. The total protein concentration of the lysate was quantified using Bradford assay. 100 μg of total protein was electrophoresed in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred onto immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore). The blot was blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST for 1 hr at RT. After blocking, the blot was incubated with primary antibody diluted in 5% BSA in TBST overnight at 4°C. Following this incubation, the blot was washed three times with TBST and then incubated with HRP conjugated secondary antibody. After three washes with TBST, protein detection was performed using Pierce ECL or Supersignal west chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chemiluminescence signal was captured in X-ray film or using chemidoc imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used for immunofluorescence or western blot: pan-MyHC (MF20; DSHB), Titin (9D10; DSHB), MyHC-neo (N3.36; DSHB) (MHCN; Leica), MYH3 (F1.652; DSHB), MYH1/2 (SC-71; DSHB), α-actinin (MA122863; Thermofisher), Desmin (sc-23879; SCBT), ACTB (sc-4778; SCBT), OCT3/4 (C-10; SCBT), SOX2 (Y-17; SCBT), NANOG (H-2; SCBT), Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (A12379; Thermofisher), Alexa fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (A-21424; Thermo Fisher), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (A-11008; Thermo Fisher), and mouse IgG HRP-linked (NA931; GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Cells were lysed using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher) and RNA was extracted using purelink RNA mini kit (Thermo Fisher) with on-column DNAse treatment following manufacturer’s instructions.

Cells were pre-fixed at room temperature for one hour in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde 2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS, then rinsed and stored in PBS for a few days. Samples were prepared by post-fixation in 1% (w/v) OsO4 in PBS, followed by gradual dehydration in ethanol that includes a staining with step with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate in 70° ethanol and embedding in Epon resin (EMS, Fort Washington, PA, USA). Blocks were cut in 70 nm ultrathin sections which were further stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined using a Philips CM120 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) operated at 80kV, and photographed with SIS Morada digital camera (Olympus, Münster, Germany). Experiments were carried out in triplicates and in a blind manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ATAC-seq</title><p>Analysis of chromatin accessibility was performed following the protocol described by Buenrostro and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, 50,000 cells from 2 day DMSO- and S/Da/De/F-treated cultures were collected using trypsin/EDTA and washed with cold PBS prior to permeabilization and Tn5-mediated transposition for 30 min at 37°C. Following DNA extraction using MinElute Qiagen columns, transposed DNA was used for primer extension and 5 cycles of PCR amplification to insert Illumina-compatible adapter-barcodes. Final number of cycles required for library amplification was determined by qPCR. Libraries were purified using AMPure beads and then resuspended in H<sub>2</sub>O. Libraries were sequenced at the University of Minnesota Genomic Center on a lane of the NextSeq 550 in paired-end mode at an average depth of 40M reads/sample.</p><p>Reads were then mapped to the human genome (hg38) using bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) (parameters <monospace>-I 25 -X 2000 --local --dovetail --no-mixed --no-discordant</monospace>) and filtered to remove PCR duplicates. Peaks were identified using MACS2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) (parameters --nomodel --nolambda --keep-dup all --call-subpeaks) and then analyzed using BEDtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) to identify treatment-specific peaks. For this analysis, we considered peaks detected in 2 of 3 biological replicates. Analysis of differential accessibility was performed by generating a list of peaks representative of all samples using the peak summits identified by MACS2. Each summit was extended 50 bp in both directions and the resulting lists of peaks were combined, sorted and merged to obtain a dataset of unique and non-overlapping loci. This list was then used to extrapolate the sequencing depth coverage from each sample bedgraph file. Coverage files were then analyzed using DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to identify loci with differential chromatin accessibility. For the subsequent analyses, loci were converted to the hg19 human genome release. Annotation of the S/Da/De/F specific peaks was performed using GREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) using a two gene association and 500 kb regulatory domain. Analyses included proximal promoters and distal enhancers. GO analysis was performed using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). Enriched motifs were identified in a region of ±200 bp from the peak center using MEME-ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machanick and Bailey, 2011</xref>). Files for visualization using IGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>) were generated by converting. wig files to the bigwig format.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Myotubes treated with DMSO or S/Da/De/F differentiated for 5 days were used for RNA sequencing in triplicates. RNA was isolated as described above. 500 ng of total RNA was used for generating dual-indexed libraries using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library kit. The libraries were sequenced in NextSeq 550 sequencer using 75 bp paired end run at around 20 million reads per sample. 75 bp FastQ paired-end reads (n = 20.9 Million per sample) were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v 0.33). Quality control on raw sequence data was performed with FastQC. Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38) reference using Hisat2 (v2.1.0). Gene quantification was done via Cuffquant for FPKM values and Feature Counts for raw read counts. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the edgeR (negative binomial) feature in CLC genomics work bench (Qiagen) using raw read counts. We filtered the generated list based on a minimum 2X Absolute Fold Change and FDR corrected p&lt;0.05. These filtered genes were then imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software (Qiagen) for identification of canonical pathways, upstream regulators and their targets. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed by uploading the list of differentially expressed genes in the GO database to identify the top enriched cellular components and biological processes. Heatmap of differentially expressed genes was generated using the heatmapper web tool as per the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Three-dimensional muscle construct generation and contractile force measurement</title><p>Three-dimensional muscle constructs were generated in home-made culture wells having dimensions of 15 mm ×5 mm × 5 mm (length ×width × depth), with each well containing two posts near the ends of the well. A suspension of hiPS cell-derived myogenic progenitors (10 million cells/mL, passage 4) was prepared in a solution containing 6 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> bovine fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich), 1-unit bovine thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% (v/v) growth factor reduced Matrigel (R and D), and the suspension was quickly pipetted into the culture wells, followed by gelation at 37°C for 1 hr. All the constructs were cultured in the myogenic expansion medium for 3 days, followed by differentiation for 5 days in the KOSR medium supplemented with S/Da/De/F (each dissolved in DMSO at 10 μM). Controls in which the KOSR differentiation medium containing the same amount of DMSO (0.4% v/v) were conducted. On day 3 of differentiation, 25% of the medium was replaced with the fresh medium. All the media were supplemented with 2 mg/mL ε-aminocaproic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent fibrin degradation.</p><p>Contractile forces generated by the constructs in response to electrical stimulation at 0.5 Hz (twitch) or 20 Hz (tetanus) were measured on a custom-built apparatus after five days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, a construct was maintained at 37°C, and the two ends were mounted on two pins, one of which was adjustable and connected to a force transducer (Harvard Apparatus, 60–2994 model). Prior to measurements, the construct was stretched by 20% of its initial length with the adjustable pin. Electrical pulses were generated with a cardiac stimulator (Astro-Med Inc, S88 × Model, 10 ms pulse width) at a frequency of 0.5 or 20 Hz for 6 s. Contractile forces were recorded using LabView and the data were analyzed using MATLAB (the code is available at GITHUB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/weishenumn/contractile-force-analysis.git">https://github.com/weishenumn/contractile-force-analysis.git</ext-link> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/contractile-force-analysis">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/contractile-force-analysis</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2009</xref>). For each twitch peak or tetanic plateau, the maximum force was used for analysis. The construct was then treated with TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for qPCR analysis or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blotting. For each differentiation condition, three constructs were quantitatively examined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Differences between samples were assessed by using the Student’s two-tailed t test for independent samples or two-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bradley B Olwin (Reviewer #2); Pier Lorenzo Puri (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the reviewers find the work of significant interest, there are some issues that should be addressed before acceptance, mainly related to myotube maturation and to the cellular mechanism affected by the compound combination, listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the upregulation of fetal and adult myogenic genes is clearly presented, it would be useful to show and discuss the downregulation of embryonic muscle genes by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, in order to further strengthen the interpretation of a switch in developmental stage. As relevant controls, inclusion of human embryonic and adult skeletal muscle should be included. Alternatively, a comparison of the presented RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data with available human embryonic and adult gene expression should be performed, in order to evaluate the extent of myotube maturation generated this novel protocol compared to embryonic and adult tissues.</p><p>2) While expression of mature forms of MyHCs is some evidence for enhancing maturity, the authors never provided data that the mature MyHCs are translated and present in sarcomeric-like structures within the differentiated myotubes. The only protein data provided were for neonatal MyHC, which is expressed perinatally but is not a mature myosin. Complicating the interpretation is the fact that the antibody used recognizes adult fast and perinatal myosin. It is absolutely critical that the authors identify and quantify the &quot;mature&quot; myosins that are translated and present in contractile structures as this is the predominant discovery of the manuscript. Translation of mature MyHC isoforms and insertion into the relevant cellular structures is bona fide evidence of maturity. Indeed, the degree of maturity might be quantitatively measured from a ratio of the protein present for immature vs. mature myosin isoforms.</p><p>3) The inhibitors and one activator act on signaling pathways but the authors did not provide evidence for whether the pathways targeted were affected. Moreover, it would be useful to know whether the combinatorial effect was substantially different than individual factors or lesser combinations. These data might provide better knowledge regarding the mechanisms involved as opposed to much further downstream analysis of transcriptomics and epigenetics.</p><p>4) In the protocol for HTS, the increased ratio of MyHC (+)/DAPI was used as readout to screen for compounds that could improve maturation of PS-derived myotubes. The author's rationale is that statistically significant increase in MyHC/DAPI area ratio in myotubes reflects increased maturation. This approach revealed to be correct, as retrospectively the strategy led to the selection of compounds that actually improve maturation; however, the lack of some details on the experimental protocol does not help on the mechanistic interpretation of the data. For instance, the authors state that the small molecules were added after cells were cultured for three days in the presence of expansion medium (bFGF and Dox), and in concomitance with the switch to differentiation medium, and MyHC expression was evaluated 5 days later. There is no information on whether cells were already differentiated or were proliferating at the time of the beginning of exposure to small molecules. Thus, it remains unclear whether the increased MyHC/DAPI area ratio is due to an effect on cell proliferation, myoblast fusion and/or transcriptional activation of specific genes in post-mitotic myotubes. This also precludes a functional interpretation of the mechanism by which the combined effect of TGFβ, MEK and γ-Secretase inhibition, adenylyl cyclase activation and glucocorticoids exerts the observed effect. As this information seems crucial to further optimize this approach, I encourage the authors to test the effects of these small molecules at sequential stages of PS-derived formation of skeletal muscles, while monitoring cell proliferation, cell fusion and multinucleation with a time course from the beginning of exposure through the whole time of treatment with small molecules.</p><p>5) Within the same line of point #1, the authors have tested the small molecules in combination (or by subtraction of each of them) always within the same protocol (e.g. exposure at the time of medium switch). It is unknown what is the differentiation status of the cells at that timing, but presumably they are not synchronous, but are rather quite heterogeneous in term of proliferation/differentiation stages. As each of these molecules seems to affect different processes along the sequential stages of skeletal myogenesis, it is highly possible that their optimal synergistic effect can be appreciated by protocols of sequential exposure to each of them, likely with some overlaps of exposures, rather than by an empirical treatment with simultaneous exposure to all compounds, as reported here. The authors should therefore consider evaluating the effect of protocols of sequential exposure in various combinations as compared to simultaneous exposure. As this approach will require multiple experimental points, I would recommend reducing the burden of work by taking one representative endpoint easy to detect – e.g. one representative <italic>MYH</italic> isoform, as <italic>MYH8</italic>.</p><p>6) More details on the methods used for generating myogenic progenitors in transgene-free conditions should be provided.</p><p>7) The 3D culture data are not sufficiently developed. Are these myotubes more or less mature than the 2D cultures? The Western blot in Figure 6D is relevant for the last two issues raised above as it is clear that neonatal MyHC is a minority of the total MyHC present. This aspect of the work should be further developed or not included as aside from the force measurements, it adds little to demonstrating maturity of the myotubes or aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms involved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47970.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the upregulation of fetal and adult myogenic genes is clearly presented, it would be useful to show and discuss the downregulation of embryonic muscle genes by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, in order to further strengthen the interpretation of a switch in developmental stage.

Since we do not have access to human embryonic and adult skeletal muscle tissue samples, we investigated a selected set of embryonic genes based on a previous study that compared the gene expression profile of human embryonic vs. fetal myoblast-derived myotubes (Biressi, Tagliafico, et al., 2007). We have now included qPCR data showing that genes associated with embryonic myotubes, including <italic>MEOX1, PAX3, CDH11, EYA2</italic> and <italic>FST</italic>, are significantly downregulated upon treatment with small molecules (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B of revised manuscript). Since these genes were reported to be expressed at higher levels in embryonic when compared to fetal myotubes (Biressi, Tagliafico, et al., 2007), downregulation of these genes upon small molecule treatment corroborates our findings suggesting developmental stage switch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While expression of mature forms of MyHCs is some evidence for enhancing maturity, the authors never provided data that the mature MyHCs are translated and present in sarcomeric-like structures within the differentiated myotubes.

We observed that neonatal MyHC and F-actin showed cross-striation staining pattern, suggesting the presence of neo-MyHC in contractile structures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A of revised manuscript). We also followed the valuable suggestion of analyzing the protein expression levels of adult <italic>MYHs</italic> by western blot. Whereas <italic>MYH1</italic> and <italic>MYH2</italic> gene expression levels are increased upon combinatorial treatment, we were not able to find detectable levels of adult <italic>MYHs</italic> at the protein level (Figure 2C of the revised manuscript). We have revised the manuscript accordingly to focus on the reliable increased expression of <italic>MYH8</italic>, which is not expressed in early embryonic development but at later stages of development and in the neonatal stage (Cho et al., 1993). Furthermore, we have now validated the protein expression data with antibodies specific for embryonic (MYH3), neonatal (MYH8) and adult (MYH1/2) MHC isoforms, as shown in Figure 2C of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In addition, we now include transmission electron microscopy analysis, which show important differences between treated myotubes and respective controls, including the high occurrence of SR-TT junctions and more abundance in mitochondria content.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The inhibitors and one activator act on signaling pathways but the authors did not provide evidence for whether the pathways targeted were affected.

To complement this observation, as suggested by the reviewers, we confirmed by gene expression analysis that the pathways related to each of the small molecules were affected upon combinatorial treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-D of the revised manuscript).</p><p>We have shown that the combinatorial treatment is substantially better than the individual treatment, as evidenced by the quantification of the ratio of area of MyHC/DAPI (Figure 1B and 1C). We agree that a comparison of the effect of each small molecule on the targeted pathways against the combinatorial treatment would reveal whether these pathways are affected differently by the inclusion of additional small molecules. However, we believe that our analysis would then be limited to those four pathways. Instead, we provide whole RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, allowing us to analyze the data in an unbiased manner. As mentioned above, these analyses revealed that the pathways targeted by the four small molecules were indeed affected in the treated myotubes, as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B (ATAC-seq) and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A (RNA-seq).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the protocol for HTS, the increased ratio of MyHC (+)/DAPI was used as readout to screen for compounds that could improve maturation of PS-derived myotubes.

We observed that proliferation and differentiation in myotubes exposed to DMSO or combinatorial treatment followed a similar pattern at days 1 and day 3. However, we identified dramatic differences at day 5, suggesting that the small molecule treatment predominantly affects the cell proliferation and differentiation between D3 and D5 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and 1D of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Within the same line of point #1, the authors have tested the small molecules in combination (or by subtraction of each of them) always within the same protocol (e.g. exposure at the time of medium switch).

We would like to clarify the steps of the protocol and that cultures of myogenic progenitors are not heterogeneous in terms of differentiation before induction of terminal differentiation. At day 12 of the iPAX7 myogenic differentiation protocol that we describe here, PAX7<sup>+</sup> myogenic progenitors are sorted from the bulk population (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Under PAX7 expression, induced by Dox, the cells maintain a proliferative and non-differentiating state (PAX7<sup>+</sup>). These PAX7<sup>+</sup> myogenic progenitors are expanded with Dox in the culture media. When myogenic progenitors reach confluency, we switch culture conditions to terminal differentiation, by removing Dox and switching to low nutrient medium, and thus allowing myogenic progenitors to undergo myotube differentiation. In this regard, although we may have ignored the degree of heterogeneity of the myogenic progenitor population at the molecular level, we do know that at day 0 of myotube differentiation (when we also start the combinatorial treatment), the cells are still in a proliferating state and there are no differentiating or differentiated myotubes in the cultures. In fact, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and 1D of the revised manuscript shows that even at day 1 of myotube differentiation, there are no MyHC (+) myotubes in our cultures, as these begin to arise only at day 3. Therefore, there is no such heterogeneity of proliferating and differentiated cells when we start the small molecule treatment.</p><p>As accurately pointed out by the reviewers, we do acknowledge that a potential limitation in the optimization of our combinatorial treatment is that we add all the small molecules at the same time. Following this comment, we have attempted to perform sequential incubations with small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We started by using a single compound (S, Da, De or F) on D0 and then adding the remaining compounds on D1 or D3. Then, MYH8 protein expression was assessed by western blot. In this first attempt, we did not see a significant difference in any condition when compared to using all the small molecules from D0. Although this attempt was an initial optimization effort that we tried following the suggestion raised by the reviewers, we believe that the number of possible small molecule combinations that can be tried at different sequential and overlapping exposures, and at different days of terminal differentiation, is quite exponentially large, and since we would not be following a particular rational, we would need to try all of these. Thus, we consider this assessment out of the scope of the present study. We do want to emphasize that in spite of the potential for additional optimization, we are confident on the dramatic improvement in differentiation and maturation of differentiated myotubes when performing the combinatorial treatment at day 0, which was validated in many PS cell lines, as shown along the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47970.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47970-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) More details on the methods used for generating myogenic progenitors in transgene-free conditions should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation.

Since MYH7 is expressed even at early stages of muscle development (Cho et al., 1993), the downregulation observed in the presence of S/Da/De/F may not be relevant to maturation. At the protein level, we observed a similar increase in the levels of emb-MyHC and neo-MyHC with combinatorial treatment in both 2D and 3D-cultures when compared to DMSO (Figure 7D). As stated in Materials and methods section, 3D constructs were switched to terminal differentiation conditions for five days. It is possible that a longer timeframe of terminal differentiation would result in a more pronounced increased in maturation, as it has been previously reported (Rao et al., 2018).</p></body></sub-article></article>
