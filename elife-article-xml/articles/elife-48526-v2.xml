underpinning decision making have primarily been investigated using highly simplified tasks in which stimulus onsets cue observers to start accumulating choice-relevant information. Yet, in daily life we are rarely afforded the luxury of knowing precisely when choice-relevant information will appear. Here, we examined neural indices of decision formation while subjects discriminated subtle stimulus feature changes whose timing relative to stimulus onset (‘foreperiod’) was uncertain. Joint analysis of behavioural error patterns and neural decision signal dynamics indicated that subjects systematically began the accumulation process before any informative evidence was presented, and further, that accumulation onset timing varied systematically as a function of the foreperiod of the preceding trial. These results suggest that the brain can adjust to temporal uncertainty by strategically modulating accumulation onset timing according to statistical regularities in the temporal structure of the sensory environment with particular emphasis on recent experience.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perceptual decision making</kwd><kwd>temporal uncertainty</kwd><kwd>electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>centroparietal positivity</kwd><kwd>decision onset timing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002081</institution-id><institution>Irish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postgraduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devine</surname><given-names>Ciara A</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Redmond G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant 63829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Redmond G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-1358955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Simon P</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Redmond G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Temporal uncertainty interferes with the timely onset of evidence accumulation in perceptual decision making prompting the brain to rely instead on statistical regularities in the temporal structure of the environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To date, perceptual decision making, described as the process whereby noisy sensory information is accumulated over time towards a decision bound, has been studied predominantly using tasks in which there is little ambiguity as to when observers should begin accumulating sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ratcliff and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</xref>). It has been documented extensively throughout the temporal attention literature, that there are significant advantages, across a wide-range of perceptual tasks, to knowing precisely when sensory evidence will be available (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Correa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jepma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niemi and Näätänen, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nobre and van Ede, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vangkilde et al., 2012</xref>). However, in the natural sensory world we are not always afforded the luxury of making decisions based on sensory events that have the same high degree of perceptual salience and/or predictability in terms of their onset timing as those typically used in experimental tasks. Such uncertainty presents a critical challenge because mistiming accumulation onset can have detrimental consequences: premature accumulation can lead to false alarms and fast errors while commencing accumulation late can lead to information loss and slow or missed responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teichert et al., 2016</xref>). The aim of this study was to shed light on the timing of evidence accumulation initiation when sensory evidence onsets are temporally uncertain and hard to detect.</p><p>Recent research has highlighted a few mechanisms that the brain could feasibly deploy. Several studies have pointed to the possibility that, under some circumstances, the brain relies on sensory-driven mechanisms that detect the appearance of goal-relevant sensory changes to trigger evidence accumulation. For instance, the Gated Accumulator Model, suggests that evidence accumulation onset is contingent on sensory input surpassing a threshold level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purcell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schall et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, evidence from human electrophysiology suggests that in a continuous monitoring context, where the timing of target sensory changes are unpredictable, early target selection mechanisms are involved in triggering evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>). However, the amplitude of target selection signals was found to be heavily dependent on the strength of the sensory evidence and therefore it is not clear how broadly such a stimulus-driven strategy can be applied. An additional possibility suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teichert et al. (2016)</xref> is that the onset of sensory evidence accumulation may be subject to top-down control and adapted in accordance with the temporal context or demands of the sensory environment. Specifically, decision onset timing may be calibrated internally in order to optimise the trade-off between accumulating information too early, thereby risking performance errors, and accumulating too late, thereby losing valuable information. In the context of temporal uncertainty, behavioural modelling and psychophysics studies have indicated that prior knowledge of sensory evidence onset does modulate the timing of accumulation onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bausenhart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jepma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seibold et al., 2011</xref>), while others have pointed to |effects on the quality of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rohenkohl et al., 2012</xref>). However, these studies have relied on indirect behavioural metrics for inferring accumulation onset time and direct neurophysiological evidence has been lacking.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to examine the mechanisms of perceptual decision making when subjects have imperfect foreknowledge of the precise timing of a subtle, goal-relevant sensory change. To this end, we conducted two experiments, both of which required subjects to discriminate a subtle change in a single stimulus feature (relative contrast of two overlaid gratings in experiment one and coherent dot motion in experiment 2). Temporal uncertainty was created by pseudorandomly imposing one of three delays intervening between stimulus onset and this sensory change (from hereon referred to as the ‘foreperiod’) on each trial. We traced activity in two previously characterised decision variable signals that trace sensory evidence accumulation: the centro-parietal positivity (CPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly and O'Connell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>) and effector-selective Mu/Beta band (10–30 Hz) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>). Each of these signals builds gradually during decision formation at a rate proportional to evidence strength, peaks around the time of a decision-reporting movement, predicts choice accuracy and RT across trials and exhibits amplitude modulations consistent with decision bound adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, the CPP has been further characterised within the same decision theoretic framework for a diverse range of perceptual tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afacan-Seref et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boubenec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herding et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luyckx et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Philiastides et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rungratsameetaweemana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spitzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">von Lautz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Vugt et al., 2019</xref>), has been shown to correlate strongly with subjective reports of stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tagliabue et al., 2019</xref>) and predict the timing and probability of choice error signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>). Recent work has highlighted some key functional distinctions between the CPP and premotor Mu/Beta signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Twomey et al., 2016</xref>). First, the evidence-dependent build-up of the CPP has been shown to reliably precede that of motor preparation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</xref>). Second, it has been shown across several studies that the CPP and motor signals undergo distinct strategic adjustments: premotor Mu/Beta-band activity contralateral to the decision reporting effector always reaches a stereotyped threshold level prior to response execution but both contralateral and ipsilateral signals exhibit systematic shifts in their starting levels in response to prior information about time constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>) and stimulus probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), as well as a temporally increasing urgency component to their build-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the CPP has been found to not change its starting level and its pre-choice amplitude varied systematically as a function of RT for discrete decisions with a time limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the CPP encodes a pure representation of cumulative evidence that is fed to the motor level where it is combined with other strategic influences.</p><p>We found that in this situation where subjects are unable to time the onset of decision formation to coincide with the uncertain onset of choice-relevant sensory evidence (contrast change in experiment one or coherent motion onset in experiment 2), they systematically initiated evidence accumulation in advance of the evidence. This was reflected in the build-up of the CPP during the foreperiod, which, in experiment 2, directly reflected random fluctuations in motion energy, and also in choice-predictive lateralisation of Mu/Beta band activity. The timing of accumulation onset relative to the sensory change accounted for the pronounced foreperiod effects that were observed on choice behaviour including increased miss rates on short foreperiod trials and elevated premature responses and fast errors on long foreperiod trials. Furthermore, we found that accumulation onset timing was not fixed across trials but varied systematically according to recent trial foreperiod duration, with accumulation commencing earlier if the previous foreperiod was shorter. This also gave rise to a congruency effect whereby choice accuracy was greater if the foreperiod duration on consecutive trials was congruent.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: contrast discrimination</title><p>We analysed 128-channel EEG data from 23 human subjects performing a two-alternative contrast discrimination task (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). in which they compared the contrast of two overlaid grating stimuli presented at fixation. At the outset of each trail, the gratings were presented and held constant at 50% contrast for one of three foreperiod durations (800 ms/1200 ms/1600 ms). Once the foreperiod had elapsed, the gratings underwent antithetical changes in contrast (one increased while the other decreased), and the participant was asked to report whether the left or right tilted grating was higher in contrast by clicking the corresponding mouse button with their corresponding thumb. The magnitude of the contrast change for each grating was determined separately for each subject during preliminary training using a staircase procedure (choice accuracy at 65–70%, mean contrast: 5.5% ± 1.35, see Materials and methods). Participants were informed clearly at the beginning of the study about the variability in the foreperiod durations. This was demonstrated to them during practise trials in which the contrast change was very large and evidence onset clearly noticeable. Points were awarded on each trial in order to encourage participants to respond both as quickly and as accurately as possible. 40 points were awarded for correct responses with a speed bonus of 0–40 additional points. Meanwhile, incorrect, missed or premature responses were awarded 0 points. Performance feedback was presented on a trial-by-trial (correct/incorrect/clicked too soon/too late) and block-by-block basis (accuracy, mean reaction time and cumulative points earned).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two-alternative forced choice contrast discrimination task and behaviour separated by foreperiod (fp) duration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Task Schematic: Each trial commenced with the presentation of two overlaid left- and right-tilted gratings (45° relative to the vertical midline) within a circular aperture against a grey background.

Post-hoc tests (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–h</xref>; asterisks indicate significance levels) indicate that a longer (1600 ms) foreperiod resulted in faster but less accurate responses and an increased tendency to respond prematurely. The opposite was true of short (800 ms) foreperiod trials where responses were slower and less error prone but misses more common. Overall performance peaked on intermediate (1200 ms) foreperiod trials which yielded the highest levels of accuracy and greatest number of points earned per trial with relatively low levels of both misses and premature responses.</p><p>Next, we analysed accuracy as a function of RT separately for each foreperiod ('conditional accuracy functions'; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This analysis revealed two key trends. Firstly, the diminished accuracy on longer foreperiod trials manifested specifically on trials with faster RTs, reaching chance levels for the subset of long foreperiod trials with RTs closest to the contrast-change onset. This observation suggests that responses made close to the target change onset were based on little or no valid sensory evidence. Secondly, the conditional accuracy functions also highlight that beyond 2400 ms, accuracy diminished monotonically as a function of RT across all three foreperiod durations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Sensory evidence representation unaffected by foreperiod duration</title><p>In order to determine whether sensory evidence representations were stable across the three foreperiod durations, we flickered each of the grating stimuli at a different frequency (20 Hz for left-tilted gratings, 25 Hz for right-tilted gratings) thereby eliciting separate SSVEPs in those corresponding frequency bands (20 Hz and 25 Hz respectively) over the occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Consistent with this we found a main effect of stimulus (target vs non-target) on SSVEP SNR in windows centred on 500 ms post-contrast change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; F(1, 18)=13.93, p=0.002) and 200 ms pre-response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; F(1, 18)=30.12, p=3.27×10<sup>−5</sup>).

To this end we separated the data, within each foreperiod, into six equally sized bins, according to RT. Our analyses found that the CPP amplitude prior to evidence onset was larger on longer foreperiod trials (F(1.27, 22.91 = 25.00, p=1.6×10<sup>−5</sup>; linear contrast: p=4.75×10<sup>−5</sup>; quadratic contrast: p=0.17). Moreover, there was an inverse relationship between the amount of pre-evidence CPP build up and RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; F(5, 90)=6.56, p=3×10<sup>−5</sup>), irrespective of foreperiod duration (RT x foreperiod interaction: F(5.33, 95.91)=1.07, p=0.39), indicating that greater pre-evidence CPP build-up was associated with faster responses. Further, the build-up rate of the CPP during the foreperiod (measured as the slope of a line fit to the CPP waveform between −250 ms and 50 ms relative to the contrast change) also predicted RT, irrespective of foreperiod duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>; main effect of RT: F(5, 90)=4.42, p=0.001; main effect of foreperiod: F(2,36)=2.39, p=0.11; RT x foreperiod interaction: F(4.81 86.54)=0.63, p=0.67).</p><p>In fact, an overall inverse relationship between pre-evidence accumulation and RT should not necessarily be expected: whereas pre-evidence accumulation should accelerate responses when it happens to favour the ultimately chosen alternative, it would slow responses when it happens to favour the ultimately unchosen alternative because it would serve to push the decision process further from its final bound. Thus, the degree to which a statistically significant inverse relationship between pre-evidence CPP and RT would manifest would depend on the prevalence of this latter subset of ‘change of mind’ trials. Such changes of mind should be far more prevalent on correct trials and accordingly, we observed a significant RT by Choice Accuracy (RT x Choice (correct vs incorrect) interaction: F(3, 54)=3.94, p=0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>) reflecting a stronger relationship between pre-evidence CPP and RT on error trials.</p><p>Further interrogation of the CPP-RT relationship observed in experiment one revealed that pre-evidence accumulation was systematically biased in favour of left choices. Subjects were 4.17 times more likely to choose left when responding prematurely (&lt;150 ms; t(18)=3.20, p=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), 1.95 times more likely to respond left when responding quickly (&lt;500 ms; t(20)=5.62, p=0.1.69<sup>−4</sup>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and had faster RTs when left targets were presented (F(1, 20)=63.65, p=1.22<sup>−7</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This systematic bias can be attributed to the difference in flicker frequency between left (20 Hz) and right-tilted (25 Hz) gratings. Psychophysical research has previously shown that within this range the perceived brightness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartley, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartley, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu et al., 1996</xref>) and contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solomon and Tyler, 2018</xref>) of flickering stimuli diminishes as a function of flicker frequency, even when they are matched in terms of physical contrast and luminance. Since the left-tilted grating appeared higher-contrast during the foreperiod despite physical equivalence, this may have caused pre-evidence accumulation to be biased toward left choices resulting in fewer changes of mind when the left choice was the correct one. Indeed pre-evidence CPP declined significantly more steeply as a function of RT for left choices than it did for right choices (RT x Choice interaction: F(3, 54)=3.19, p=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the overall statistically significant relationship between pre-evidence CPP and RT in this experiment arises from this choice bias which reduced the prevalence of change of mind trials.</p><p>We also measured and analyzed CPP build-up rates in the response-aligned waveforms. There was no main effect of either RT (F(5, 90)=0.75, p=0.59) or foreperiod duration (F(2, 36)=0.56, p=0.58) but there was a significant cross-over interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>; F(10, 180)=4.24, p=2.7×10<sup>−5</sup>), suggesting that the relationship between RT and pre-response CPP build-up rate was reversed for short relative to long foreperiod trials. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> shows that when the foreperiod was short, faster RTs were associated with steeper pre-response CPP slope, in line with previous observations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>). By comparison, the opposite was true of long foreperiod trials where faster responses were associated with shallower pre-response CPP slope. The shallower build-up rate of the pre-response CPP on faster RT trials can be explained in light of the close temporal proximity of these responses to the timing of the contrast change and hence the lesser contribution of valid sensory evidence to those decisions.</p><p>Alongside the early CPP build-up, we observed a progressive increase in motor preparation reflected in Mu/Beta desynchronisation over the hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to the response-executing hand throughout the pre-evidence foreperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). To specifically isolate the choice-predictive component of motor preparation, we examined the differential motor preparation for the ultimately executed response relative to the withheld response, by computing the Mu/Beta lateralisation index (contralateral minus ipsilateral to the response hand). This analysis indicated that there was significant pre-evidence Mu/Beta lateralisation on longer foreperiod trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref> inset; one-sample t-tests: 800 ms: t(18)=-1.27, p=0.22; 1200 ms: t(18)=-3.64, p=0.002; 1600 ms: t(18)=-3.91 p=0.001). To further examine this choice-predictive motor activity we analysed Mu/Beta lateralisation as a function of foreperiod and RT using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Similar to the CPP, longer foreperiods gave rise to greater pre-evidence Mu/Beta lateralisation (F(2, 36)=3.64, p=0.04) which in turn scaled inversely with RT, irrespective of foreperiod duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k</xref>; main effect of RT: F(5, 90)=2.94, p=0.017; RT x foreperiod interaction: F(5.22, 93.99)=1.68, p=0.14). Thus greater choice-selective motor preparation during the pre-evidence foreperiod predicted faster RTs. In addition, the rate of Mu/Beta lateralisation during the foreperiod (also measured as the slope of a line fit to the Mu/Beta lateralisation waveform between −250 ms and 50 relative to evidence onset) predicted RT irrespective of foreperiod duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3m</xref>; main effect of RT: F(5, 90)=3.56, p=0.006; main effect of foreperiod: F(2, 36)=0.47, p=0.63; RT x foreperiod interaction: F(4.82, 86.70)=1.45, p=0.22). Also in line with the findings reported for the CPP, there was no main effect of foreperiod on the pre-response build-up rate (measured between −450 and −150 ms) of Mu/Beta lateralisation (F(2, 36)=0.25, p=0.78) but there was a main effect of RT (F(5, 90)=5.13, p=0.01) which was dependent on foreperiod duration (foreperiod x RT interaction: F(10, 180)=2.08, p=0.03). This interaction indicates that the predicted pattern of faster pre-response Mu/Beta lateralisation build-up rates for earlier responses occurred only on short foreperiod trials but not when the foreperiod was longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3n</xref>). To further examine possible interactions between biased motor preparation in the pre-evidence window and the early build-up of the CPP we divided the long foreperiod data of each subject into two bins based on a median split of the single-trial pre-evidence CPP amplitude values (excluding trials with RT &lt;0 and&gt;500 ms relative to evidence onset) and tested for cross-bin differences in motor preparation prior to the CPP measurement window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). No such differences were observed for the window 800–1600 ms (t(18)=1.12, p=0.28; all p&gt;0.1 for t-tests on contra-ipsi lateralisation in contiguous 50 ms bins from 800 ms to 1600 ms). This observation accords with recent demonstrations that prior-infromed motor level adjustments do not impact on the CPP process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Subtle sensory evidence onsets do not elicit early target selection responses</title><p>Recent research and models of perceptual decision making have pointed to the importance of sensory-driven target selection mechanisms in triggering the onset of evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purcell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schall et al., 2011</xref>). In the human brain, this target selection role has long been attributed to a negative potential over occipital scalp elicited approximately 200–300 ms after the onset of a goal-relevant sensory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luck and Hillyard, 1994</xref>). Recently we showed that the target selection process is invoked bilaterally even for a single stimulus at fixation that has no ostensible need for ‘selection’ and that in a continuous monitoring context, where target onsets are completely unpredictable, the signal temporally precedes and has a predictive influence on the onset and rate of evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>). This highlights the potential general role for this target selection signal in triggering the accumulation process under conditions of temporal uncertainty, but given its reliance on the presence of strong, detectable stimulus transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>), it is not clear whether it could play a major role in the current task. In fact, here, we did not observe any deflection in bilateral occipital ERP waveforms in the N2 time window although there was a slow, sustained negativity over the bilateral occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>). Thus, in contrast to previous continuous tasks with larger evidence steps, low-level target-selection processes do not appear to play a role in dealing with temporal uncertainty in the present context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>Foreperiod duration does not affect decision signal amplitudes at response</title><p>Recent neurophysiological studies have highlighted that when decisions must be made to a strict deadline, time-dependent urgency signals serve to expedite the decision process, progressively lowering the quantity of cumulative evidence required to trigger commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thura and Cisek, 2016</xref>). In a recent study we showed that these urgency effects manifested in a time-dependent reduction in CPP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>). Here, however, we did not find any variation in the CPP amplitude prior to response as a function of foreperiod duration (F(2, 36)=0.47,p=0.63; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) or response time (F(5, 90)=0.64, p=0.67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

By comparison, ipsilateral Mu/Beta prior to response, though not modulated significantly by foreperiod duration (F(1.46, 26.30)=2.82, p=0.09), was more desynchronised prior to response on slower RT trials (F(1.86, 33.40)=6.50, p=3×10<sup>−5</sup>) reflecting more preparation of the unchosen response hand on these trials and a closer ‘race’ between the alternative outcomes. Correspondingly, mu-beta lateralisation prior to response was stronger on faster response trials (F(2.68, 48.31)=3.99, p=0.01), a finding that is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-6"><title>Summary: experiment 1</title><p>The key results from experiment one show that in the absence of foreknowledge about the precise onset timing of a subtle goal relevant sensory change, subjects were unable to align the onset of decision formation to sensory evidence onset. On longer foreperiod trials, subjects consistently commenced decision formation before the target contrast change occurred, resulting in a higher incidence of false alarms and fast errors. The premature onset of the decision process was reflected in the build-up of the CPP and the emergence of choice predictive Mu/Beta lateralisation during the foreperiod. However, these data do not allow us to definitively establish whether the early build-up of decision-related activity reflected the accumulation of sensory noise, as opposed to some other process such as urgency (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cisek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thura and Cisek, 2016</xref>). To address this in experiment 2, we used the random dot motion task in which variability in physical dot motion energy from one frame to the next can be directly quantified by applying dot motion energy filtering.

Specifically, the relationship between RT and pre-evidence CPP amplitude (F(2, 34)=0.12, p=0.89), pre-evidence CPP slope (F(1.45, 24.57)=1.96, p=0.16) and pre-response CPP slope (F(2, 34)=2.08, p=0.14) did not reach statistical significance. Likewise, there was no relationship between RT and Mu/Beta lateralisation in the pre-evidence (Amplitude: F(2, 34)=1.73, p=0.19; Slope: F(2, 34)=0.71 p=0.50) or pre response time periods (Amplitude: F(2, 34)=1.80, p=0.18; Slope: F(2, 34)=0.33, p=0.72). We believe that the absence of these effects can be attributed to the fact that, unlike in experiment 1, there was no evidence that premature responses were biased in favour of either choice outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>; Ratio of Left to Right choices = 0.88; t(16)=-.69, p=0.50; subjects with fewer than 10 premature choices were excluded) and no difference in RT between left and right targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>; Left Responses: <italic>M</italic> = 998 ms, <italic>SD</italic> = 89.28 ms; Right Responses: <italic>M</italic> = 1091 ms, <italic>SD</italic> = 117.37 ms; F(1, 21)=0.94, p=0.34). This is unsurprising given that the movement of the dots during the foreperiod was entirely random and thus, by comparison with experiment one where left and right stimuli differed in flicker frequency, it was not possible for the sensory evidence to systematically favour either choice. In the absence of any bias early accumulation would have the effect of speeding up responses on some trials (e.g. when evidence during the foreperiod by chance favoured the upcoming target or was strong enough to cause subjects to cross a decision bound) and slowing responses on others (change of mind trials). It is also possible that experiment two was less sensitive to RT effects compared to experiment one due to the lower trial numbers that were acquired per subject.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>Pre-evidence cumulative motion energy predicts fast choices and pre-evidence CPP build-up</title><p>In order to quantify the degree to which the dot motion stimulus by chance favoured one decision alternative or the other during the incoherent motion foreperiod, we performed dot motion energy filtering (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelson and Bergen, 1985</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Urai et al., 2017</xref>).

This enabled us to to isolate trials where the cumulative motion energy during the foreperiod strongly and consistently favoured one choice or another by chance alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). For each subset of trials we measured the slope of the pre-evidence CPP over a broad window (600 ms-1600ms) and the amplitude of the CPP in a 100 ms window centred on the time of coherent motion onset (1600 ms). We found that there was significant pre-evidence build-up of the CPP on trials where the cumulative motion energy consistently favoured a particular choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; one-sample t-tests: Amplitude: t(17)=3.21 p=0.005; Slope: t(17)=3.25, p=0.005) but not on those where the dot motion weakly and/or inconsistently favoured a specific choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; Amplitude vs 0: t(17)=1.37, p=0.19; Slope vs 0: t(17)=1.59, p=0.13).

However, relative to baseline, the magnitude of this component was not statistically significant for any of the foreperiods (all p&gt;0.5 for t-tests against 0).

Next, we sought to examine the degree to which evidence accumulation onsets varied systematically as a function of trial history. Prior research in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</xref>) and in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref>) suggests that we exploit previous experiences and statistical knowledge in order to overcome uncertainty when estimating time or anticipating events. To further explore this idea we conducted additional analyses of the data from experiment 1, hypothesising that, if decision onset timing is indeed affected by prior knowledge of temporal structure, then recent experiences may be particularly influential. For instance, in the temporal attention literature, the widely-documented sequential foreperiod effect suggests that the speed with which perceptual decisions are made is affected by previous trial timings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capizzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Los and Heslenfeld, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mento, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mento, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van der Lubbe et al., 2004</xref>), though this phenomenon has not explicitly been linked or investigated with respect to the timing of evidence accumulation onset. Here, we separated trials according to the foreperiod on the current trial (foreperiod<sub>n</sub>) and the foreperiod on the immediately preceding trial (foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub>). We found that behavioural performance on foreperiod<sub>n</sub> was modulated significantly by foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub>, such that responses were faster when foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> was shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>; F(2, 40)=140.17, p=2.49×10<sup>−19</sup>) and this effect was more pronounced when foreperiod<sub>n</sub> was long (foreperiod<sub>n</sub> x foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> interaction: F(4, 80)=7.37, p=4.17×10<sup>−5</sup>). Moreover, foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> also affected accuracy (F(2, 40)=5.23, p=0.01), but this effect was dependent on foreperiod<sub>n</sub> (foreperiod<sub>n</sub> x foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> interaction: F(4, 80)=14.90, p=3.85×10<sup>−9</sup>). The trends shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> indicate that on short or long foreperiod<sub>n</sub> trials, foreperiod repetition led to a gain in accuracy whereas a change in foreperiod duration from one trial to the next was associated with a cost to accuracy. Furthermore, in line with the above effects, we found that the rate of missed responses on short foreperiod<sub>n</sub> trials was reduced if short foreperiods occurred consecutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>; F(2, 40)=36.51, p=9.52×10<sup>−10</sup>) while the rate of premature responses on long foreperiod<sub>n</sub> trials was reduced when long foreperiods occurred consecutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>; F(2, 40)=8.12, p=0.001).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Behavioural performance as a function of foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> and foreperiod<sub>n</sub>.</title><p>Mean accuracy (<bold>A</bold>) and mean RT (<bold>B</bold>) as a function of foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> and foreperiod<sub>n</sub>.

Convergent behavioural and neurophysiological data reveal that when evidence onsets are difficult to discern, participants initiate the accumulation of sensory information endogenously, before the actual evidence appears.</p><p>Recent work has highlighted that when sensory evidence onsets are unpredictable but relatively salient, early target selection signals are involved in triggering evidence accumulation onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purcell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schall et al., 2011</xref>). Here, our titration procedure ensured that the onset of the sensory changes were very weak and, by consequence, sensory driven target selection signals were not reliably observed in our data, forcing participants to rely on alternative strategies. Importantly, and in line with the observations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teichert et al. (2016)</xref>, our data indicate that participants adapted the onset timing of accumulation strategically, using their knowledge and recent experience of the underlying temporal structure of the task. For instance, the CPP data suggest that subjects in this study timed the onset of evidence accumulation to approximately coincide with the earliest possible time point at which evidence could be presented to them (800 ms). Rather than optimising overall performance on shorter foreperiod trials (which had a notably high rate of missed responses and earned the lowest number of points), this strategy instead led to a peak in performance on intermediate foreperiod trials (which had notably high levels of accuracy and low levels of both missed and premature responses thus earning a higher number of points). One speculative explanation for this is that subjects may have adopted a Bayesian approach, ‘regression to the mean’, in estimating the response deadline, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref>). Given that the foreperiod durations used in this experiment were equally probable, this strategy would cause subjects to bias their timing estimates of the impending deadline towards the trial duration on intermediate foreperiod trials. This is an interesting avenue for further investigation and could be examined by repeating this study, drawing the foreperiod duration from various asymmetrical distributions. More generally, the above highlights that several features of the present paradigm, including subtlety of evidence onsets, time pressure and temporal uncertainty were key drivers of the observed premature evidence accumulation. An important challenge for future work will therefore be to establish the degree to which the present findings generalise to other paradigms and to precisely delineate the task parameters that encourage/discourage pre-evidence accumulation.</p><p>Although the overall temporal structure of the task clearly affected evidence accumulation, our data indicate that subjects did not simply time the onset of evidence accumulation to a fixed point on all trials. Here we show that the timing of evidence accumulation onset is, at least in part, calibrated based on the duration of the foreperiod on recent trials, with shorter foreperiods leading to earlier accumulation onset on subsequent trials and correspondingly faster RTs. Moreover, trial-by-trial adjustments in accumulation onset timing were also consequential for accuracy. When the same foreperiod duration was, by chance, repeated from one trial to the next, decision onset timing was more aligned to the physical sensory change than when the foreperiods were mismatched, and this incurred a corresponding benefit for accuracy. In turn, when consecutive foreperiods were highly mismatched (i.e. short followed by long or vice-versa), there was greater misalignment of sensory evidence onset relative to the physical sensory change and, correspondingly, greater decrements in accuracy were incurred. According to the normative theories, intertrial dependencies such as this may reflect the inherent tendency for the brain to monitor and exploit local statistical patterns in the environment in order to reduce uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu and Cohen, 2008</xref>). Thus, these trial-by-trial adjustments in accumulation onset timing may reflect continuous updating of temporal expectations that inform accumulation onset timing.</p><p>With regard to the precise nature of the evidence accumulated during the foreperiod on later onset trials, our data show that this, at least partly, reflects the accumulation of sensory noise. In experiment two, we were able to show that early CPP build-up was driven by random fluctuations in motion energy, which, on some trials, cumulatively favoured one choice or another. However, we do not exclude the possibility that the CPP may be subject to other influences. For instance, many studies have shown that individuals exhibit a variety of idiosyncratic choice-history biases that manifest as trial-by-trial adjustments in the starting point of evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bode et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu and Cohen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) or biases in the weighting of sensory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kloosterman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Talluri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Urai et al., 2019</xref>). It remains to be established whether such biases may be directly represented in the CPP. Nevertheless, our findings add to and complement the ever-growing body of research into serial dependency in perceptual decision making and speak directly to the question of how temporal uncertainty affected decision onset timing.</p><p>Our results also have the potential to shed light on the mechanisms underpinning a well-known phenomenon in the temporal attention literature, known as the sequential foreperiod effect. This effect, which is another example of serial dependency, is characterised by the modulation of RT by previous trial foreperiod in the context of target detection tasks with variable foreperiods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capizzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capizzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capizzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Los et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Los and Van Den Heuvel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinborn and Langner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vallesi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vallesi et al., 2007</xref>). Our results replicate the sequential foreperiod effect using a task in which respondents performed a difficult perceptual discrimination task where the foreperiod varied pseudorandomly from trial to trial. In this context at least, the sequential foreperiod effect, the underlying mechanisms of which have not yet been fully explained, can be attributed to the adjustment in evidence accumulation onset timing. Interestingly, in the broader literature on temporal orienting, data from psychophysical and computational modelling studies have implicated decision onset timing in temporal orienting more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bausenhart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jepma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rolke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rolke and Hofmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seibold et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings provide the first neurophysiological evidence in support of this idea.</p><p>Finally, our study also highlights how neural decision signals can be leveraged to gain insights into the timing of accumulation onset that are otherwise very difficult to discern through behaviour. Previous studies investigating decision onset timing have relied on indirect behavioural measures such as fast error rate, shifts in the leading edge of response time distributions, and estimates of non-decision time derived from sequential sampling models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teichert et al., 2016</xref>). The use of non-decision time is problematic because the timing of evidence accumulation is just one of a number of factors, alongside afferent (e.g. sensory encoding, neural transmission) and efferent (e.g. motor execution) decision-related processes, that contribute to this parameter. Our data highlight that it is possible to infer the timing of accumulation onset directly from the temporal dynamics of the CPP.</p><p>In summary, this study has shed light on the important role of accumulation onset timing in perceptual decision-making and has yielded two key insights in this regard. Firstly, we have shown that in the absence of foreknowledge about the precise timing of a subtle goal relevant sensory change, observers are unable to accurately time the onset of sensory evidence accumulation with respect to that event, resulting in instances where accumulation commences too early, leading to premature responses and fast errors, as well as instances where accumulation is delayed, leading to missed responses. Secondly, we have demonstrated that accumulation onset timing is not governed solely by sensory driven mechanisms but instead can be controlled by top-down processes. To this end, we appear to rely on and continuously update our average representation of the temporal structure of a given task.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Experiment 1: contrast discrimination task</title><p>Twenty-three subjects aged 19–30 (12 males, 11 females) were recruited to take part in a two-alternative, forced choice, contrast discrimination task as part of a study on perceptual learning taking place over the course of 6 separate experimental sessions.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devine, 2019b</xref>). The task consisted of discrete trials, in which they were required to discriminate the direction (left or right) of a target (tilted grating stimulus) based on a change in the relative contrast between two overlaid grating stimuli (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The experiment consisted of 10 blocks, each containing 50 trials and was conducted in a dark, sound-attenuated room with subjects seated in front of a 51 cm cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor (refresh rate: 100 Hz, 1024 × 768 resolution) at a distance of approximately 57 cm. Stimuli used in this task were created using Psychtoolbox and the experiment was presented using Matlab. The stimuli consisted of two overlaid grating patterns (spatial frequency = 1 cycle per degree) presented in a circular aperture (inner radius = 11 outer radius = 6°) against a dark grey background (luminance: 65.2 cd/m2). Each grating stimulus was tilted by 45° relative to the vertical midline (left tilt = −45°, right tilt = +45°). The gratings were ‘frequency tagged’ in order to allow independent measurement of sensory evidence in favour of both possible choices, with the left-tilted grating flickering at 20 Hz and the right-tilted grating flickering at 25 Hz. On each trial the gratings were phase-reversed and these phase-reversals were pseudorandomly counterbalanced across trials.</p><p>Subjects commenced each trial by simultaneously clicking the left and right mouse button. A central fixation dot was presented, followed 200 ms later by the presentation of the overlaid grating stimuli at 50% contrast. The stimuli were held constant for the duration of an initial foreperiod, which, as subjects were informed, varied pseudorandomly from trial to trial between 800 ms, 1200 ms and 1600 ms. After the foreperiod, the gratings underwent opposite changes in contrast (the magnitude of which were determined individually using a staircase procedure - see <italic>Staircase Procedure</italic> below) whereby the target stepped up in contrast while the non-target stepped down in contrast by a corresponding amount. The gratings remained at the new contrast level for 2000 ms and subjects were required to indicate the direction of the target stimulus by clicking the corresponding left or right mouse button with their left or right thumb.

At the end of each block, feedback was presented on screen informing subjects of their mean accuracy and response time during the block. This feedback remained on screen until either the subject or experimenter exited the screen. With this feedback, subjects were also given a score for each block reflecting their cumulative points earned during the block. Points were awarded on a trial by trial basis according to the accuracy and speed with which subjects responded. Every correct response was awarded 40 points plus a speed bonus, while incorrect, missed or premature responses were awarded 0 points. The maximum speed bonus was 40 points and this amount diminished linearly from 40 to 0 across the range of possible response times (150–2000 ms).

Subjects were required to judge the direction (left or right) of motion based on a cloud of moving dots. The experiment consisted of 8 blocks, each containing 66 trials and was conducted in a dark, sound-attenuated room with subjects seated in front of a 51 cm CRT monitor (refresh rate: 100 Hz, 1024 × 768 resolution) at a distance of approximately 57 cm. The stimuli used in this task, random dot kinematograms (RDK), were created using Psychtoolbox and the experiment was presented using Matlab. The RDKs consisted of a patch of 100 moving white dots (diameter = 4 pixels) presented within a circular aperture (outer radius = 4º) against a black background. From frame to frame, the dots were displaced throughout the circular aperture creating a perception of motion.</p><p>At the onset of each trial, a central fixation dot was presented, followed 400 ms later by the onset of the dot motion stimulus. Initially, the dots were displaced within the aperture at random (0% coherence) giving rise to the perception of random, incoherent motion. The displacement of the dots remained at 0% coherence for the duration of a foreperiod, which as subjects were informed, varied pseudorandomly from trial-to-trial between 800 ms, 1200 ms and 1600 ms. After this foreperiod a portion of the dots began to move coherently in the same direction (either leftward or rightward). This coherent motion was produced by displacing a portion of the dots on each frame, chosen at random, in a common direction relative to their position on the previous frame. All other dots on a given frame were displaced randomly to a new location within the aperture. The percentage of coherently moving dots was determined separately for each subject in the study during a pre-experimental introduction phase (see <italic>‘Staircase Procedure’</italic> below). The duration of coherent motion was 2000 ms and subjects were required to indicate its direction by clicking the corresponding left or right mouse button with their left or right thumb.

In order to estimate the momentary sensory evidence favouring a particular choice we applied dot motion energy filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelson and Bergen, 1985</xref>) to the random dot motion stimuli during the pre-evidence foreperiod, using the implementation provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Urai and Wimmer (2016)</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Urai et al. (2017)</xref>. This yielded momentary motion energy estimates with positive values reflecting residual rightward motion energy and negative values reflecting residual leftward motion energy. These estimates provided a fine-grained estimate of the momentary sensory evidence favouring the alternative decision outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Behavioural analysis</title><p>Across both experiments the data were segmented according to foreperiod duration (800/1200/1600 ms). In experiment 1, the data were collapsed across experimental sessions. Response accuracy was defined as the percentage of trials where participants correctly reported the direction of the target. Response time was calculated in milliseconds (ms) relative to the time of the sensory change (i.e. the contrast change or onset of coherent motion). Missed responses were defined as those in which no response was made within the two-second response deadline (marked by the disappearance of the stimulus from the screen). Premature responses were defined as those made prior to or within 150 ms of the onset of sensory evidence (i.e. the contrast change or onset of coherent motion). Points earned per trial were defined as the average number of points earned per trial including trials where no points were awarded due to missed, erroneous or premature responses. Each of these behavioural measures was analysed as a function of foreperiod duration using separate one-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by pairwise comparisons (paired-samples t-tests). The alpha level following Bonferroni corrections for each set of pairwise comparisons was. 017 (.05/3). Accuracy was further examined as a function of response time by computing condition accuracy functions. To this end the data were broken down into equally spaced bins based on RT (eight bins in experiment 1 and 6 bins in experiment 2) and analysed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVAs.</p><p>In all of the analyses conducted here, prior investigation was carried out to determine whether the data were suitable for parametric analysis. Firstly, the data were screened for any major violations of normality. In the case of repeated measures ANOVAs, Mauchley's test of sphericity was also carried out to assess the assumption of equal variances of the differences across all combined levels of a single factor. In all instances where the assumption of sphericity was violated, greenhouse-geisser corrections were applied to the degrees of freedom and p-values reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>The relationship between pre-evidence cumulative motion energy and choice</title><p>In light of evidence suggesting that the accumulation process may have commenced before the onset of the goal relevant sensory change, we sought to establish, in experiment 2, whether there was a relationship between random fluctuations in the sensory stimulus during the pre-evidence foreperiod and choice. Specifically, we examined whether fast choices on long foreperiod trials could be attributed to dot motion energy favouring the chosen response by chance. To this end we expressed momentary motion energy values in terms of whether they favoured the chosen or unchosen response for a given trial. Positive values were attributed to motion energy values favouring the chosen response and negative values were assigned to those favouring the unchosen response. We then divided trials into fast (RT &lt;500 ms) and slow (RT &gt;500 ms) responses and calculated the integral of motion energy during the foreperiod by computing the cumulative sum of the momentary motion energy values expressed with respect to the chosen responses. The cut-off of 500 ms between fast and slow responses was chosen in order to capture a sufficiently large subset of trials in which accuracy was very low, as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>. In the case of responses made after the coherent motion onset, the integral was calculated between 100–1600 ms. For responses made prior to the onset of coherent motion, the integral was calculated between 100 ms and the time of the response. The integral at 1600ms and the slope of the pre-evidence integral (measured as the slope of a line fit to the pre-evidence motion integral) for fast and slow responses was compared against 0 using single sample t-tests. Whereas the absolute value of the integral at 1600 provides a measure of how much evidence cumulatively favoured the chosen response, the slope of the integral is sensitive to the extent to which sensory evidence consistently favoured the chosen response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>EEG acquisition and preprocessing (experiments 1 and 2)</title><p>The following procedures for acquiring and preprocessing EEG data apply to data from experiment 1 and experiment 2. Continuous EEG data were acquired using an ActiveTwo system (BioSemi, The Netherlands) from 128 scalp electrodes and digitized at 512 Hz. Vertical eye movements were recorded using two vertical electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes placed above and below the left eye. Data were analysed using custom scripts (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CiaraDevine/Temporal_Uncertainty_DevineCA_2019">https://github.com/CiaraDevine/Temporal_Uncertainty_DevineCA_2019</ext-link>) in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and the EEGLAB toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devine, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>). The full datasets for experiment 1 and experiment two can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzs8r">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzs8r</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devine, 2019a</xref>). Continuous EEG data were low-pass filtered below 35 Hz, high-pass filtered above. 05 Hz and detrended. EEG data were then re-referenced offline to the average reference. EEG data were segmented into stimulus- and response-aligned epochs. Stimulus-aligned epochs were extracted from stimulus onset to stimulus offset, which yielded different length windows for each foreperiod condition: 800 ms (Epoch: 0–2,800 ms), 1200 ms (Epoch: 0–3,200 ms) or 1600 ms (Epoch: 0–3,600 ms). Response-aligned epochs were measured from –1000 ms pre-response to 600 ms post response. The purpose of extending the epoch 600 ms post-response was to allow four full fast fourier transform (FFT) windows to be calculated post-response (<italic>see Time Frequency Decomposition below</italic>). All epochs were baseline-corrected relative to the interval of 500–550 ms post stimulus onset. This baseline window was chosen, with the aid of visual inspection of the grand-average event-related potential (ERP) waveform, to fall before the onset of the CPP but after the conclusion of evoked potentials elicited by the appearance of the stimulus on the screen and the mouse click performed by subjects in order to initiate each trial.</p><p>Trials were rejected if the bipolar vertical EOG signal (upper minus lower) exceeded an absolute value of 200 μV or if any scalp channel exceeded 100 μV at any time during the stimulus-aligned epoch. To avoid excessive trial loss, channels were interpolated if their individual artefact count exceeded 10% of the total number of trials for a given session. To avoid excessive channel interpolation, a maximum of 10% of the total number of channels were permitted to be interpolated for any given subject’s data in a given session. Subjects were excluded from electrophysiological analyses entirely if, following these steps, more than 40% of trials were lost due to blinks and/or EEG artefacts. In order to mitigate the effects of volume conduction across the scalp, single-trial epochs underwent current source density (CSD) transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kayser and Tenke, 2006</xref>), a procedure that helps to minimise spatial overlap between functionally distinct EEG components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</xref>), an issue that may confound our interpretation of key signals such as the CPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Philiastides et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Stimulus- and response-aligned epochs were then decomposed into time frequency representations using the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) procedure. Each epoch was divided up into a series of overlapping 400 ms time segments taken at 50 ms intervals across the epoch. The FFT was computed for each 400 ms segment. For the purpose of data analysis and plotting, each 400 ms segment was identified by its median time point. The resulting time-frequency representations had a frequency resolution of 2.5 Hz and as such allowed for the direct measurement of SSVEPs at 20 Hz and 25 Hz, which corresponded to the flicker frequencies used in experiment one for the left- and right-tilted gratings respectively. Each 400 ms window captured precisely 8 and 10 cycles of the 20 and 25 Hz SSVEPs respectively, thereby minimising spectral leakage. FFT power measurements were converted into amplitude measurements by dividing by half the length of the measurement window in samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of electrophysiological signals</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>The effect of foreperiod duration on sensory evidence representation</title><p>Sensory evidence representation was examined by tracing the time course of the SSVEPs elicited by the left- and right-tilted stimuli flickering at 20 Hz and 25 Hz respectively. The SSVEPs were normalised with respect to the average activity in the immediately adjacent frequencies by computing signal to noise ratios (SNR). In order to obtain a direct measurement of the sensory evidence upon which observers based their decisions (i.e. the relative contrast of the overlaid gratings) we then computed the difference SSVEP (d-SSVEP) by subtracting the non-target SSVEP from the target SSVEP. Based on visual inspection of the sample grand-average topography of the d-SSVEP (calculated at approximately 200 ms prior to response) we identified a broad cluster of electrodes over the occipital cortex (centred around Oz) at which the d-SSVEP was maximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At the single-subject level we then measured the SSVEPs by averaging data from the four electrodes within this cluster, at which the subject grand-average d-SSVEP was maximal. Single trial data were rejected from subsequent analyses if the d-SSVEP prior to response exceeded + /- 3 standard deviations from the within subject mean.</p><p>To determine whether foreperiod duration had any effect on sensory evidence representation the SSVEPs were examined as a function of foreperiod duration in the following windows: i) 500 ms post evidence onset (the earliest time-point at which the SSVEP SNR has already reached a plateau) and ii) 200 ms prior to response (The time-point closest to response at which there would be little or no effect of post-response attentional disengagement). Trials were excluded from this analysis if subjects responded quicker than 500 ms in order to ensure that response-aligned SSVEP measurements did not include time windows prior to the contrast change and that post evidence measurements overlapped minimally with time points post response. This analysis was carried out using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (factor 1: foreperiod duration; factor 2: stimulus). Effects of foreperiod duration on the d-SSVEP were inferred from the interaction between foreperiod duration and stimulus factors. We predicted that the target and non-target SSVEPs should undergo antithetical changes in SNR after the contrast change giving rise to a main effect of stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>The effect of foreperiod duration on pre-evidence decision formation</title><p>Domain-general decision formation was examined by measuring the dynamics of the CPP. Based on visual inspection of the sample grand-average topography of the pre-response CPP (response aligned window: −150 ms to −50 ms) we identified a broad cluster of electrodes over the centroparietal cortex (centred around Pz) at which the CPP was maximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; 6a). For each subject, the CPP was measured by averaging data from the four electrodes within this cluster, at which the subject grand-average was maximal. Effector selective decision formation was examined by measuring desynchronisation in the Mu/Beta frequency band (10–30 Hz) over the contralateral and ipsilateral response hemispheres (20 Hz and 25 Hz were excluded in order to avoid mixing motor and sensory activity). In order to measure its excursion and to minimise the effects of general changes in mu/beta amplitudes across testing sessions or between trials, Mu/Beta was baseline-corrected relative to 550 ms post stimulus onset. This window was chosen with the aid of visual inspection of the grand average waveforms to ensure that the motor activity relating to the mouse button click at the beginning of each trial in experiment one was fully resolved. The Mu/Beta lateralisation index was computed by subtracting ipsilateral from contralateral Mu/Beta. Based on inspecting the grand average topography of pre response Mu/Beta lateralisation (response aligned window: −150 to −50 ms), a cluster of electrodes was identified in each hemisphere over premotor regions of the scalp (C3 left hemisphere; C4 right hemisphere; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>; 6 hr) that exhibited the largest lateralisation index. For each subject Mu/Beta was measured by averaging data from the four electrodes within this cluster, at which the subject grand-average was maximal. Single trial CPP and Mu/Beta data were rejected from subsequent analyses if the values estimated prior to response exceeded + /- 3 standard deviations from the within-subject mean.</p><p>Inspection of grand average CPP and lateralised Mu/Beta waveforms indicated that there was substantial build-up of both signals during the foreperiod on longer foreperiod trials suggesting that decision formation may have commenced prematurely on those trials. To investigate this phenomenon we initially pooled data from correct, incorrect, missed and premature response trials and separated the data according to foreperiod duration. We examined the amount of pre-evidence build-up in each signal by calculating the average amplitude of each signal within a 100 ms window centred on the time of the sensory change. This window was selected so as to capture the full extent of the pre-evidence build-up while avoiding overlap with activity that could feasibly be driven by the sensory change. We also measured the rate of build-up during the foreperiod as the slope of a line fit to the waveforms between −250 ms and 50 ms relative to the sensory change. This window was selected to ensure that it did not reach back before the onset of the CPP (which would result in underestimation of the slope) and, in the case of short FP trials, to ensure that there was no overlap with visual-evoked potentials driven by the stimulus onset (500 ms prior to evidence onset). Nevertheless, after repeating the analyses using wider time windows for the pre-evidence slope measurement −550 to 50 ms and −950 to 50 ms windows), we found that the key trends presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> were unchanged. In order to determine whether there was significant pre-evidence decision related activity, the slope and amplitude of CPP and Mu/Beta lateralisation at each level of foreperiod duration were compared against 0 using one-sample t-tests. We repeated this analysis for long foreperiod trials using only data from experimental session 1. Next, we divided the data into equally sized bins based on RT (six bins in experiment 1; three bins in experiment 2) and examined the relationship between RT and pre-evidence decision related activity (amplitude and slope as defined above) using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs including foreperiod duration and RT bin as factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>The effect of foreperiod duration on pre-response decision related activity</title><p>Decision formation dynamics were further investigated relative to response. We measured the amplitude of the CPP and magnitude of Mu/Beta desynchronisation and lateralisation prior to response in the window −150 ms to −50 ms. This window was selected in light of the assumption that there is a time lag between decision commitment and response execution. Here we centred the measurement window on −100 ms as this coincides with the onset timing of the sharp pre-response deflection in the motor readiness potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>). Contralateral and ipsilateral Mu/Beta were examined separately so as to evaluate preparation of both the chosen and unchosen responses. The build-up rate of the CPP was measured by calculating the slope of a line fit to the waveform in the window −500 ms to −200 ms relative to response. The build-up rate of Mu/Beta lateralisation was examined by measuring the slope of a line fit to the lateralisation indices contained within the window −500 ms to −200 ms relative to response. The pre-response slope measurement windows were chosen so as to ensure that the estimates of build-up rate were determined during the pre-commitment time period and to avoid the possibility that the slope would be underestimated as a result of an excessively long time window that extended to pre accumulation onset. In particular there was a very strong likelihood that by using a wider pre-response slope measurement window on longer foreperiod trials that the slope estimate would be based on pre-evidence accumulation as opposed to post evidence accumulation. Again, we did not find any change in the key trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) reported on short﻿﻿er foreperiod trials as a result of using a wider pre-response slope measurement window (e.g. −900 ms to −200 ms and −1200 ms to −200 ms). As before, the data were separated according to foreperiod duration and RT and analysed using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Examining the relationship between motion energy and premature sensory evidence accumulation (experiment 2)</title><p>In experiment two we sought to establish a relationship between cumulative motion energy during the foreperiod and pre-evidence CPP build-up. To this end, focusing exclusively on long foreperiod (1600 ms) trials, we separated trials into two equally sized bins according to the slope of the dot motion integral during the foreperiod. This yielded a subset of trials in which the cumulative motion energy during the foreperiod strongly and consistently favoured either leftward or rightward motion by change and a subset of trials where the cumulative motion energy fluctuated closer to 0, favouring neither direction consistently. Single sample t-tests were first carried out, comparing the pre-evidence CPP amplitude and slope against 0, in order to determine whether there was any significant build-up of the CPP during the foreperiod on steep or shallow integral trials. The amplitude of the CPP was again measured in a 100 ms window centred on coherent motion onset while the slope was measured in a broad window of 600 ms to 1600 ms. This window was again selected so as to avoid any overlap with early visual evoked potentials. By focusing this analysis on 1600 ms foreperiod trials we were able to estimate the pre-evidence CPP slope over a longer period of time. To distinguish between the CPP on steep and shallow pre-evidence integral trials, additional paired samples t-tests were carried out comparing the amplitude and slope of the CPP between shallow and steep integral trials.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Examining the effect of previous trial foreperiod on accumulation onset timing</title><p>In order to examine the sequential effect of foreperiod on evidence accumulation, the single trial data from experiment were subsequently further subdivided according to the duration of the foreperiod on the previous trial (foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub>) and the duration of the foreperiod on the current trial (foreperiod<sub>n</sub>). At the behavioural level accuracy and response times were examined using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs including foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> and foreperiod<sub>n</sub> as separate independent factors. Missed response rate and premature response rate were examined using one-way repeated measures ANOVAs including only foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> as an independent factor. The exclusion of foreperiod<sub>n</sub> as a factor in these analyses was necessary because missed responses were made almost exclusively on short foreperiod<sub>n</sub> trials while premature responses were made almost exclusively on long foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> trials. At the neural level, we also further analysed the CPP as a function of foreperiod<sub>n-1</sub> in order to determine whether the amount or rate of build-up, in either the pre-evidence onset or pre-response windows, was modulated by the duration of the previous trial foreperiod.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Examining target selection signals under temporal uncertainty</title><p>The target selection process was examined by measuring the bilateral N2 which is thought to play a role in triggering the onset of evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>).

change, against 0 using separate single sample t-tests for each level of foreperiod.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Marios Philiastides as the Guest Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Laurence Tudor Hunt (Reviewer #1.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Guest Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Most laboratory studies of (perceptual) decision making are designed such that there is little ambiguity as to when participants need to start integrating information for the decision. The main aim of this study was to study how information accumulation is initiated when the temporal onset of the relevant information is temporally uncertain. The authors used human psychophysics and electrophysiology to shed some light on this issue. The question is interesting and timely and the paper is generally well-motivated and well-written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Three accounts were presented in the Introduction as possible mechanisms for how the process of evidence accumulation is initiated (gated accumulator model, early target selection, temporal trade-off based on temporal structure of the task). The paper argues that the latter account might be more likely given the behavioural and neural observations but it stops short from formally arbitrating between the possible mechanisms, for example, by building and comparing generative models of the various alternatives. This exercise would help validate the main conclusions of the paper. At the very least the new analyses suggested below should be used to further tease these accounts apart.</p><p>2) Some of the most relevant effects (e.g. amplitude/slope of CPP as a function of RT) failed to replicate in Experiment 2, which in turn challenges the general nature of the reported effects (i.e. could this, instead, be due to differences in the type of sensory evidence across the two experiments). The authors state this is due to low power. Given the reproducibility crisis in the field, this point needs to be rectified, possibly with the addition of more data. (Please let us know if you do decide to collect more data and would like to request additional time for revision).</p><p>3) One concern is the missing link between the origin of the actual sensory signals and the proxy signatures of evidence accumulation as detected by the CPP. For instance, do the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the SSVEPs before trial onset already play a role in biasing the decision (CPP) signals? Similarly, it remains unclear whether premature signals have a sensory origin alone (i.e. primarily due to motion energy), or perhaps are related to motor biases due to experiences of previous trials (including correct, incorrect choices, temporal structure, etc). For instance, it is possible that pre-trial absolute levels of mu/beta activity in the left and right hemispheres (or lateralization index) cause early drifts in evidence accumulation. Similarly, temporal structure can also have an impact on the slope of evidence accumulation. It would be beneficial to investigate which of these variables explain the most variance in the reported neural and behavioural effects.</p><p>4) More broadly, what is the relationship between the CPP and motor preparation signals? Is one derived from the other? Is there some sort of meaningful (functionally significant) trial-by-trial association? Currently there is a disconnect between these two signals and their relative contributions to the observed choices.</p><p>5) By design, the experiment has a number of trials where the subjects respond incorrectly and/or miss the trial altogether. Would it be possible to look at these trials separately, and examine how the CPP and lateralised motor responses vary as a function of making a correct response versus making an error? Do the EEG responses during the foreperiod have different properties on error trials than correct trials? The current approach (combining all trials) is potentially masking interesting interactions between accuracy and foreperiod duration (as Figure 1B/4B suggest, correct and error RTs are quite similar in the 1600ms but different in the 800ms condition).</p><p>6) There is a potential limitation of only examining trials which have a relatively limited foreperiod (only up to 1.6s). This means that subjects can reasonably infer that they will be in a trial within a certain period after foreperiod onset. How would this change in situations where the foreperiod is far longer than this, and so subjects really cannot estimate when a trial begins or ends? Which of the 'foreperiod' EEG signals could still be looked for in a design with far longer foreperiods? Following from this, the CPP build-up appears to develop roughly at the same time point (~800ms) across all three conditions, consistent with a strategy whereby participants calibrate their onset of evidence accumulation to the shortest foreperiod (i.e. inconsistent with the regression to the mean interpretation discussed in the paper). This should be discussed explicitly along with the caveat that these effects might be specific to the intricacies of the task used here.</p><p>7) Methodological Considerations: The selection of the windows over which the CPP/Mu/Beta slopes and amplitudes were estimated in the two experiments is somewhat arbitrary. How were these decided and how robust are the results relative to the choice of these windows? Given the slow nature of the CPP signal (unfolding over a second or more) it would seem that a longer window might be more appropriate to accurately estimate the slope. Relatedly, the choice of a linear line fit needs to be better motivated since the CPP appears to build-up quadratically. Baseline correction might be masking important neural signatures of decision formation in the absence of sensory evidence (i.e. pre-trial influences). Do the main effects presented in the paper persist when CPP, mu/beta and lateralization estimates are derived without any baseline correction?</p><p>8) Treating the literature: There is a somewhat biased sampling of the literature. There are multiple groups that have provided evidence on the role of CPP in decision making using human electrophysiology and ideally would need to be acknowledged appropriately.</p><p>9) Data availability: Data sharing is central to e<italic>Life</italic>'s mission as well as the ERC (&quot;FAIR data principles&quot;) funding this work.

My main criticism (related to the summarized reviewer comment #3 in the first round of reviews) was that there is little insight on what causes biases in the decision (CPP) signals, issue that was not addressed by the authors. I think this could have been partially addressed based on the acquired EEG data. For instance, it could be examined whether baseline visual or motor activity contribute to evidence accumulation biases, and how much this affects physical input information (as done in Experiment 2) beyond what is known of CPPs from previous studies by the authors. In my opinion, this information could help to understand the current data and findings a bit more &quot;mechanistically&quot; beyond the more descriptive domain.</p><p>We will look forward to hearing from you with a revised article and a response letter describing the changes made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48526.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Three accounts were presented in the Introduction as possible mechanisms for how the process of evidence accumulation is initiated (gated accumulator model, early target selection, temporal trade-off based on temporal structure of the task).

Our data thus give strong qualitative grounds for adjudicating between these three accounts – since the first two entail no evidence accumulation until some post-evidence event triggers it, the empirical evidence for pre-evidence accumulation rules them out for this task. Ultimately, it will indeed be important to construct models in future work that can account for the full range of behavioural and neural observations in the present data in addition to the foreperiod effects, which will require careful consideration of a number of potentially interacting factors including the role of static and dynamic urgency adjustments and drift rate variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some of the most relevant effects (e.g. amplitude/slope of CPP as a function of RT) failed to replicate in Experiment 2, which in turn challenges the general nature of the reported effects (i.e. could this, instead, be due to differences in the type of sensory evidence across the two experiments).

(Please let us know if you do decide to collect more data and would like to request additional time for revision).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment which has prompted us to reconsider and re-examine the relationship between pre-evidence CPP accumulation and RT across the two experiments.</p><p>In fact, an overall inverse relationship between pre-evidence accumulation and RT should not necessarily be expected: whereas pre-evidence accumulation should lead to faster responses when it happened to favour the ultimately chosen alternative, it would also cause slower responses when it happened to favour the ultimately unchosen alternative because it would serve to push the decision process further from its final bound. Thus, the degree to which a statistically significant inverse relationship between pre-evidence CPP and RT would manifest would depend on the prevalence of this latter subset of ‘change of mind’ trials. This led us to further interrogate the CPP-RT relationship observed in Experiment 1 with some new analyses. First, because such changes of mind from the pre- to post-evidence period should be far more prevalent on correct trials, we examined the relationship between RT and pre-evidence CPP amplitude separately for correct and error trials. As expected, we found that the relationship was significantly stronger on error trials than on correct ones (repeated measures ANOVA RT bin x Choice (correct vs. error) interaction: F(3, 54)=3.94, p=.02; Figure 3—figure supplement 2B). Second, we discovered that, because of the nature of the stimulus used in Experiment 1, pre-evidence accumulation was systematically biased in favour of left choices. Subjects were 4.17 times more likely to choose left when responding prematurely (&lt;150ms; t(18)=3.20, p=.005; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), 1.95 times more likely to choose left when responding quickly (&lt;500ms; t(20)=5.62, p=.1.69<sup>-4</sup>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and had overall faster RTs when left targets were presented (F(1, 20)=63.65, p=1.22<sup>-7</sup>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). This systematic bias can be attributed to the difference in flicker frequency between left (20Hz) and right-tilted (25Hz) gratings. Psychophysical research has previously shown that within this range the perceived brightness (Bartley, 1938; 1951; Wu, Burns, Reeves and Elsner, 1996) and contrast (Solomon and Tyler, 2018) of flickering stimuli diminishes as a function of flicker frequency, even when they are matched in terms of physical contrast and luminance. Since the left-tilted grating appeared higher-contrast during the foreperiod despite physical equivalence, this may have caused pre-evidence accumulation to be biased toward left choices. Consequently, there are likely to be far more change of mind trials when “right” was the correct response than when “left” was the correct response. Correspondingly, we found that the relationship between pre-evidence CPP and RT was stronger for left than right choice trials (RT x choice interaction: F(3, 54)=3.19, p=.03; Figure 3—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>In contrast, in Experiment 2 there was no significant choice bias on premature response trials (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B; Ratio of Left to Right choices =.88; t(16)=-.69, p=.50; subjects with fewer than 10 premature choices were excluded) and no overall RT bias (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C; Left Responses: <italic>M</italic>=998ms, <italic>SD</italic>=89.28ms;Right Responses: <italic>M</italic>=1091ms, <italic>SD</italic>=117.37ms; F(1, 21)=.94, p=.34). This indicates that pre-evidence accumulation was not systematically biased in experiment two. Thus we conclude that the most likely explanation for the discrepant CPP-RT results across the two experiments is the presence of a choice bias in Experiment 1 which caused a reduction in the number of slow change of mind trials and ensured that pre-evidence accumulation was more likely to accelerate, rather than delay, responses. There is nothing in our data to suggest that this choice bias impacted substantially on the participants’ decision making strategies or on the timing or extent of pre-evidence accumulation – participants were made fully aware of the foreperiods during the initial training for both experiments (including an initial set of trials for which the evidence onsets were highly salient to render the zero evidence foreperiods more obvious) and the distinct foreperiods had highly similar effects on RT distributions, choice accuracies and CPP build-ups across the two experiments. We are grateful to the reviewers for bringing this matter to our attention. These discussion points and empirical observations are now included in the revised manuscript (see subsections “Premature Decision Formation on Trials with Longer Foreperiods” and “Decision Formation Commenced Prematurely on Longer Foreperiod Trials and Was Predictive of Behaviour”) alongside relevant figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One concern is the missing link between the origin of the actual sensory signals and the proxy signatures of evidence accumulation as detected by the CPP. For instance, do the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the SSVEPs before trial onset already play a role in biasing the decision (CPP) signals? Similarly, it remains unclear whether premature signals have a sensory origin alone (i.e. primarily due to motion energy), or perhaps are related to motor biases due to experiences of previous trials (including correct, incorrect choices, temporal structure, etc). For instance, it is possible that pre-trial absolute levels of mu/beta activity in the left and right hemispheres (or lateralization index) cause early drifts in evidence accumulation. Similarly, temporal structure can also have an impact on the slope of evidence accumulation. It would be beneficial to investigate which of these variables explain the most variance in the reported neural and behavioural effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers highlight an important question in asking to what extent the build-up of the decision signals, such as the CPP, directly reflect the integration of sensory evidence alone as opposed to other factors. We would argue that the key contribution of our paper is to show that the CPP’s build-up is at least in part driven by sensory evidence in Experiment 2 which is most compellingly manifested in its sensitivity to cumulative residual dot motion energy in the pre-evidence period. This observation provides some of the first empirical data supporting the claim that accumulation onset timing is a strategically modifiable parameter of the decision process (Teichert et al., 2016). We have previously demonstrated that fluctuations in the SSVEP do indeed influence the CPP (O’Connell et al., 2012) and would expect similar relationships to exist here but the motion energy analyses provide a more powerful test because they do not rely on noisy single-trial SSVEP measurements, the temporal resolution of which is poor (each estimate is based on a 400ms FFT window). While we believe our results provide a convincing demonstration that the early build-up of the CPP at least partly reflects an early accumulation of sensory information, we certainly do not exclude the possibility that the CPP is subject to other influences. For example, with respect to temporal structure, we have indeed demonstrated in Experiment 1 that the onset time of the CPP is highly sensitive to the foreperiod of the previous trial. This is an important and intriguing result because it highlights that decision onset times were not fixed (e.g. to coincide with stimulus onset) but continually adjusted in light of recent events. It is very likely that additional factors such as choice history biases and attentional fluctuations also affect the CPP’s build-up but while quantifying such contributions has been a focus of our own research and that of other groups, this particular matter does not appear to bear on the central claim of the current paper. We thank the reviewers for highlighting a lack of clarity in our articulation of the key contributions of this paper. We have now made amendments to the text in order to address this (see Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More broadly, what is the relationship between the CPP and motor preparation signals? Is one derived from the other? Is there some sort of meaningful (functionally significant) trial-by-trial association? Currently there is a disconnect between these two signals and their relative contributions to the observed choices.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting that we had not provided background of sufficient depth to explicate how the two signals most likely relate to each other, and the recent evidence that bears on this matter. We have thus now given a more complete account of the known functional characteristics of the CPP and mu/beta decision signals in the Introduction. The reviewer correctly points out that the precise relationship between the CPP and motor preparation signals is yet to be fully determined, but previous work has shed some light on this matter. First, the evidence-dependent build-up of the CPP has been shown to reliably precede that of motor preparation signals (Kelly and O’Connell, 2013). Second, it has been shown across several studies that the CPP and motor signals undergo qualitatively distinct strategic adjustments: premotor Mu/Beta-band activity contralateral to the decision reporting effector always reaches a stereotyped threshold level prior to response execution but both contralateral and ipsilateral signals exhibit systematic shifts in their starting levels in response to prior information about time constraints (Steinemann et al., 2018) and stimulus probability (Kelly et al., 2019), as well as a temporally increasing urgency component to their build-up (Kelly et al., 2019; Murphy et al., 2016; Steinemann et al., 2018). In contrast, in two recent studies it was observed that the CPP did not change its starting level and its pre-choice amplitude varied systematically as a function of RT for discrete decisions with a time limit (Kelly et al., 2019; Philiastides et al., 2014; Steinemann et al., 2018). Together, these data suggest that the CPP encodes a pure representation of cumulative evidence which is fed to the motor level and combined with other strategic influences. Though more precisely establishing the functional relationship between mu/beta and the CPP is an interesting and important avenue for further research we would argue that the CPP has been sufficiently characterised to support our interpretation of the key results of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) By design, the experiment has a number of trials where the subjects respond incorrectly and/or miss the trial altogether. Would it be possible to look at these trials separately, and examine how the CPP and lateralised motor responses vary as a function of making a correct response versus making an error? Do the EEG responses during the foreperiod have different properties on error trials than correct trials? The current approach (combining all trials) is potentially masking interesting interactions between accuracy and foreperiod duration (as Figure 1B/4B suggest, correct and error RTs are quite similar in the 1600ms but different in the 800ms condition).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, separating trials according to response accuracy does in fact reveal some interesting interactions, most notably (addressed in response to reviewer comment 2), the interaction between RT and choice accuracy with regard to pre-evidence accumulation on long foreperiod trials (RT x choice interaction: F(3, 54)=3.94, p=.02; Figure 3—figure supplement 2B). Specifically we see that the linear relationship between RT and pre-evidence accumulation is much stronger on error trials, an observation which can be attributed to the fact that ‘changes of mind’ (where pre-evidence accumulation initially favours one alternative but the physical evidence then favours the other) responses are far more likely on correct response trials and will counteract the otherwise inverse relationship between pre-evidence CPP and RT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is a potential limitation of only examining trials which have a relatively limited foreperiod (only up to 1.6s). This means that subjects can reasonably infer that they will be in a trial within a certain period after foreperiod onset.

Which of the 'foreperiod' EEG signals could still be looked for in a design with far longer foreperiods? Following from this, the CPP build-up appears to develop roughly at the same time point (~800ms) across all three conditions, consistent with a strategy whereby participants calibrate their onset of evidence accumulation to the shortest foreperiod (i.e. inconsistent with the regression to the mean interpretation discussed in the paper). This should be discussed explicitly along with the caveat that these effects might be specific to the intricacies of the task used here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is likely that the phenomenon of premature accumulation will only manifest under certain conditions. In a previous study from our lab (Loughnane et al., 2016) subjects performed a continuous version of the dot motion discrimination task in which the inter-target interval varied between 3-7.3 seconds but coherence levels were set at much higher levels (35-45%). At these higher evidence strengths we found that, the CPP showed no sign of premature onset but was reliably preceded, within 200ms following coherent motion onset, by a sensory-driven target selection signal (N2). In the current study, however, our data indicate that, due to the weaker evidence, subjects were unable to rely on such target selection processes in order to accurately align accumulation onset to the timing of the sensory change, and had to instead time their accumulation onset with respect to stimulus onset despite the variable timing in the sensory change thereafter. It would indeed be very interesting to expand the range of foreperiod durations and to examine evidence accumulation processes. Such a study, and the examination of all of the decision signals considered in the current paper would be entirely feasible. For now, we feel that the present paper makes an important contribution by drawing attention to the fact that evidence accumulation onset time is an endogenously set parameter of the decision process and that the CPP provides access to these adjustments.</p><p>Secondly, we welcome the reviewer highlighting that regression to the mean is not the only plausible interpretation of the strategy deployed in our task with respect to timing the onset of accumulation and we are glad to have the opportunity to revise and clarify this point (see Discussion). As per the reviewers comments, it is clear based on the CPP that subjects timed the onset of evidence accumulation to approximately coincide with the earliest possible time point at which evidence could be presented to them (800ms). Interestingly, rather than optimising overall performance on shorter foreperiod trials (which had a notably high rate of missed responses and earned the lowest number of points), this strategy instead led to a peak in performance on intermediate foreperiod trials (which had notably high levels of accuracy and low levels of both missed and premature responses thus earning a higher number of points). One speculative explanation for this is that, despite timing accumulation onset relative to the shortest foreperiod, in estimating the response deadline, subjects may have relied on the bayesian approach, ‘regression to the mean’, which is deployed in estimating uncertain time intervals (Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010; 2015). Given that the foreperiod durations used in this experiment were drawn from a uniform distribution, this strategy would cause subjects to bias their timing estimates of the impending deadline towards the trial duration on intermediate foreperiod trials. This is an interesting avenue for further investigation and could be examined by repeating this study, drawing the foreperiod duration from various asymmetrical distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Methodological Considerations: The selection of the windows over which the CPP/Mu/Beta slopes and amplitudes were estimated in the two experiments is somewhat arbitrary. How were these decided and how robust are the results relative to the choice of these windows? Given the slow nature of the CPP signal (unfolding over a second or more) it would seem that a longer window might be more appropriate to accurately estimate the slope. Relatedly, the choice of a linear line fit needs to be better motivated since the CPP appears to build-up quadratically. Baseline correction might be masking important neural signatures of decision formation in the absence of sensory evidence (i.e. pre-trial influences). Do the main effects presented in the paper persist when CPP, mu/beta and lateralization estimates are derived without any baseline correction?</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the reviewers' concern that our choice of amplitude and slope measurement windows may have been arbitrary we have edited the appropriate sections in the methodology of the paper to clearly explain how these windows were chosen based on previously established criteria and adapted to account for certain features of the data that are particular to the present task structure. We have also addressed the reviewers specific concern about whether our findings are robust when using a wider slope measurement window confirming this to be the case. These additions can be found on in the subsection “Analysis of Electrophysiological Signals”.</p><p>With regard to baseline correction, we acknowledge that, as the reviewer suggests, there may be interesting pre-trial effects at play within these data. Here we have elucidated one such effect by demonstrating that the timing of evidence accumulation varied from one trial to the next according to the temporal structure of recent trials (see Discussion). However we are precluded from examining other possible pre-trial influences due to the necessity to use baseline correction for broad-band ERP components like the CPP (Luck, 2005). Our choice of baseline window was constrained by certain key factors. Firstly, in Experiment 1 subjects initiated each trial with a simultaneous left/right mouse button click. In addition to preventing us from examining the data before stimulus onset in order to identify pre-trial, cognitive effects, this also prevented us from using a pre-trial window for baseline correction. Secondly, due to the use of a discrete trial task, the onset of the stimulus on each trial gave rise to early visual evoked potentials. In light of these two issues it was necessary to choose a later baseline window to ensure that motor and sensory components had resolved. Our chosen window of 500-550ms appears to precede the onset of the CPP but the possibility cannot be ruled out that some early evidence accumulation was subtracted away. Consequently, we felt it was important also to baseline correct mu/beta to a similar timepoint in order to maximise consistency across these two key signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Treating the literature: There is a somewhat biased sampling of the literature. There are multiple groups that have provided evidence on the role of CPP in decision making using human electrophysiology and ideally would need to be acknowledged appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for flagging this and we have now included a number of additional references from other lab groups (Introduction, third paragraph).

Fully anonymised data from normal control groups as in this study (raw data or subject-wise IVs required to reproduce the findings presented in the main figures) should be shared openly.</p></disp-quote><p>We will provide fully anonymised behavioural and neural data in the form of single trial matrices.

One possibility to address this issue would be to define a new &quot;baseline&quot; during the presentation of the 50% contrast (ambiguous) stimulus. Since the earliest onset time of the accumulation signal in the current data appears around 800ms after the ambiguous stimulus is presented, this could serve as an objective cutoff for defining a new pre-accumulation baseline window.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewer for these detailed suggestions. Indeed the functional interactions between motor-level and evidence accumulation processes is an important and interesting question. The reviewer’s comments prompted us to more carefully consider the possibility that, in addition to reflecting an accumulation of sensory noise, the pre-evidence build-up of the CPP could also be party driven by baseline variations at the motor-level. In fact, our recent work would lead us to hypothesise that no such relationship should exist. In Steinemann et al., 2018, we showed that while experimental manipulations in speed vs. accuracy emphasis led to substantial adjustments of baseline motor preparation levels, no such adjustments were evident in the CPP. Similarly, in Kelly et al., 2019, predictive cues led to corresponding biases in pre-evidence motor preparation but had no detectable impact on baseline CPP levels. These observations accord with the hypothesis that the CPP provides a relatively ‘pure’ representation of cumulative sensory evidence that is divorced from any strategic adjustments implemented at the motor level. To further test this hypothesis in the present data, we divided the data of each participant into two equal sized bins based on a median split of the single-trial pre-evidence CPP amplitude values (1500-1600ms) and tested for differences in motor-level bias in the preceding time-windows (see Figure 1). This analysis, which is now reported in the subsection “Premature Decision Formation on Trials with Longer Foreperiods” of the revised manuscript indicated that there were no systematic differences in baseline motor bias prior to large versus small pre-evidence CPP build-ups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Original comment #6] Please discuss the implications of short-vs.-long foreperiods explicitly, along the lines of what was highlighted in your response to the reviewers. That is, the effect of premature accumulation is likely to manifest only under certain conditions (e.g. when rapid decisions are required).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
