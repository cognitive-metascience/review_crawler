Extracellular stimuli that modulate HIV-1 egress are currently unknown. We found that CCL2 induced by HIV-1 clade B (HIV-1B) infection of macrophages enhanced virus production, while CCL2 immuno-depletion reversed this effect. Additionally, HIV-1 clade C (HIV-1C) was refractory to CCL2 levels. We show that CCL2-mediated increase in virus production requires Gag late motif LYPX present in HIV-1B, but absent in HIV-1C, and ALIX protein that recruits ESCRT III complex. CCL2 immuno-depletion sequestered ALIX to F-actin structures, while CCL2 addition mobilized it to cytoplasm facilitating Gag-ALIX binding. The LYPX motif improves virus replication and its absence renders the virus less fit. Interestingly, novel variants of HIV-1C with PYRE/PYKE tetrapeptide insertions in Gag-p6 conferred ALIX binding, CCL2-responsiveness and enhanced virus replication. These results, for the first time, indicate that CCL2 mediates ALIX mobilization from F-actin and enhances HIV-1 release and fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CCL2</kwd><kwd>ALIX</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>HIV-1 clade C</kwd><kwd>Gag p6</kwd><kwd>late domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AI030861</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>Vinayaka R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH083579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>Vinayaka R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM112520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalpana</surname><given-names>Ganjam V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajasin</surname><given-names>David O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AI127295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajasin</surname><given-names>David O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruiz</surname><given-names>Arthur P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Effect of CCL2 on HIV-1 replication is mediated by mobilization of ALIX from F-actin leading to enhanced virion release and improved fitness and this requires the Gag late motif, LYPX.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 budding and release are mediated by the host ESCRT machinery, which facilitates membrane scission at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Votteler and Sundquist, 2013</xref>). HIV-1 Gag polyprotein includes two motifs in the C-terminal p6 - late motif I (PTAP) and late motif II (LYPX) - which recruit host proteins TSG-101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pornillos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">VerPlank et al., 2001</xref>) and ALIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Usami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munshi et al., 2007</xref>), respectively. TSG101 is a subunit of the cellular ESCRT-I complex and ALIX is an accessory protein of ESCRT-III complex. These two proteins physically link late domains I and II of HIV-1 Gag-p6 to ESCRT I and ESCRT-III complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strack et al., 2003</xref>) and are both essential for membrane fission steps like MVB biogenesis, cytokinesis and virus budding. During cytokinesis, ESCRT I complex, once loaded, recruits the ESCRT II complex, which in turn recruits members of ESCRT III (CHMP6 and CHMP2/4) leading to the terminal events of membrane fission.</p><p>CCL2 is a potent β-chemokine induced upon HIV-1 infection of primary human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mengozzi et al., 1999</xref>), as a host innate immune response designed to attract monocytes and T lymphocytes to trigger inflammation against the pathogen. CCL2 mRNA is elevated in both macrophages and PBMCs upon HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mengozzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vázquez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wetzel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woelk et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, plasma levels of CCL2 strongly correlate with plasma viral loads in HIV-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiss et al., 1997</xref>). In a thorough analysis of a large number of host proinflammatory genes to identify markers that correlate with HIV-1 viral loads, <italic>CCL2</italic> upregulation and elevated CCL2 protein levels were found to be specifically associated with viremic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansari et al., 2006</xref>). While these results suggest correlation of CCL2 to viremia, other results indicate a direct effect of CCL2 on viral replication. CCL2 addition enhances HIV-1 replication in cultured CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinter et al., 1998</xref>) and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fantuzzi et al., 2003</xref>), neutralization of CCL2 inhibits virus release and leads to intracellular accumulation of HIV-1 Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fantuzzi et al., 2003</xref>). However, the mechanism by which CCL2 influences HIV-1 replication is unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigated the link between CCL2 and virus production. Furthermore, we compared the effects of CCL2 on clade C HIV-1 (HIV-1C) and HIV-1B side by side, as all the studies outlined above have been limited to HIV-1 clade B (HIV-1B). It is intriguing to note that infection of macrophages with clade C HIV-1 (HIV-1C), unlike that of HIV-1B, is not associated with a robust CCL2 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2008</xref>). However, it was unclear how this lack of CCL2 induction affects HIV-1 C replication. In this report, we show that addition of CCL2 resulted in mobilization of ALIX associated with F-actin to the cytoplasm making it available to bind HIV-1 Gag-p6, which consequently enhanced virion release. Furthermore, we found that immuno-depletion of CCL2 led to a dramatic colocalization of ALIX with F-actin structures, which was associated with decrease of virion release. On the contrary, we found that HIV-1C is refractory to CCL2 levels and that the inability to exploit the increased availability of ALIX is due to a lack of the LY dipeptide in late domain II or LYPX motif, in it's Gag-p6.</p><p>HIV-1C is known to be less fit than HIV-1B or other group M HIV-1 viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariën et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariën et al., 2007</xref>). While the basis for this reduced fitness has been reported to be inefficient virus entry due to its <italic>Env</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ball et al., 2003</xref>), there is increasing evidence that a late event such as virus release may also be inefficient. For example, comparative study of a large number of HIV-1C and HIV-1B isolates has concluded that the absence of LY dipeptide is responsible for the reduced replication fitness of HIV-1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kiguoya et al., 2017</xref>). We report here that variants of HIV-1C that acquire novel late domain II-like, tetrapeptide insertions display ALIX binding to Gag-p6, enhanced virion release, CCL2-responsiveness and improved replication capacity of such viruses. Thus, we demonstrate how HIV-1 can modulate its own replication fitness via its genetic plasticity in maintaining, deleting or reacquiring the second late domain in Gag thus varying their ability to respond to CCL2. Our finding that CCL2 leads to redistribution of ALIX can have wide-ranging relevance to many other viruses and potentially in MVB and exosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCL2 enhances clade B, but not clade C, HIV-1 virus particle release</title><p>It has been previously reported that CCL2 immuno-depletion inhibits HIV-1B virus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fantuzzi et al., 2003</xref>). To examine whether this phenomenon applies to HIV-1C (which does not induce CCL2 upon MDM infection), we tested the effect of CCL2 immuno-depletion on HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1</sub> replication and particle release in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro and compared it to the effect on HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub> replication. Immuno-depletion of CCL2 led to a significant reduction (~10 fold) in the replication of HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), accompanied by a corresponding increase in the intracellular accumulation of HIV-1 Gag precursor (pr55: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, immuno-depletion of CCL2 in HIV-1<sub>IndieC1</sub>-infected MDMs neither inhibited virus replication nor increased intracellular Gag levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Comparison of relative amounts of p24 released into the culture medium as virus particles to intracellular levels of Gag suggested that virion release of HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub>, but not HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1</sub>, is severely reduced upon CCL2 immuno-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, addition of CCL2 to the HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub>-infected macrophage cultures enhanced virus replication, while HIV-1<sub>IndieC</sub>–infected cells were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Depletion or elevation of CCL2 in spent media was verified by measuring CCL2 levels in both macrophage and CEM-CCR5 culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and C</xref>). The CCL2-mediated stimulation of HIV-1 replication (~50% increase) was also observed in CEM-CCR5, a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-derived cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) but the α-CCL2 suppression of virus production was minimal (~25%). Together, our results indicated that particle release of HIV-1B, but not HIV-1C, was affected by modulating CCL2 levels in the medium. However, it appeared that the inhibition of virus replication by immune-depletion of CCL2 in CEM-CCR5 cells was much milder than in macrophages. To understand the basis for the differential suppression by α-CCL2 between macrophages and CD4 T cells, we compared CCL2 protein levels in the spent media of macrophages, CEM-CCR5 cells and HeLa cells, a cell line that is frequently used in studies of HIV-1 late events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the same three cell types, we also measured CCR2 mRNA and performed western blots to detect CCR2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results indicated that robust levels of CCR2 mRNA and protein were detected in all three cell types. CCL2 production in both MDMs and HeLa cells was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and D</xref>), but the levels of CCL2 produced in CEM-CCR5 cells was below the level of detection – and we only detected miniscule amounts upon HIV infection or robustly only in samples where CCL2 was extraneously added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data suggest that the limiting amounts of CCL2 is primarily responsible for the minimal inhibition in virus replication observed upon the addition of α-CCL2 in this CD4 T cell line. Nevertheless, CCL2-mediated enhancement of virus production (conversely, inhibition of virus production by CCL2 depletion) was observed in both macrophages and T cells, indicating that this effect is not limited to macrophages. Importantly, CCR2 is present on both CD4 T cells and macrophages, suggesting that both can respond to the presence of CCL2 by increasing virus replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35546.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differential effects of CCL2 levels in the medium on HIV-1B and HIV-1C replication in MDMs.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) MDMs were infected with 10ng/1×10<sup>6</sup> cells each of either HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub> (panel A) or HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1</sub> (panel B) and the cultures propagated in the presence of CCL2 (0.25 µg/ml), α-CCL2 (2.5 µg/ml) or isotype antibody (2.5 µg/ml).

We considered that while total ALIX levels may remain the same, the accessible protein levels (soluble ALIX) may be affected by CCL2 levels. Therefore, we examined the total, soluble and insoluble fractions of ALIX in untreated, CCL2-treated and α-CCL2-treated HeLa cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, total ALIX levels remained the same with all the treatments, consistent with the qRT-PCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> top panel of immunoblots and the corresponding graph – blue bars - to the right). However, the level of soluble ALIX in untreated or CCL2-treated cells was higher than in α-CCL2-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> – middle panel: 4 hr treatment; compare lanes 1 and 2 to 3, UT and CCL2 to α-CCL2, and the corresponding bar graphs, middle panel).

These results indicated that while total cellular ALIX remained the same under all three conditions (top row, lanes 1 to 4), soluble ALIX was increased by CCL2 (middle row, lane 2).</p><p>We next examined the formation of Gag-p6-ALIX complexes in the presence and absence of CCL2, using recombinant glutathione S- transferase (GST) fusions of Gag-p6 proteins of HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub> and HIV-1C<sub>indiec1</sub> viruses. Lysates from untreated, CCL2- or α-CCL2-treated HeLa cells were incubated with GST, GST-Bp6 or GST-Cp6 proteins respectively, immobilized on glutathione beads and the bound complexes were subjected to immunoblot analysis. There was binding of GST-Bp6 to ALIX under untreated condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 4). GST-Bp6 bound to more ALIX when CCL2 was added to the medium, which was consistent with an increase in soluble ALIX in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 5). However, under conditions where CCL2 was depleted (α-CCL2), no association was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 6). Soluble ALIX was detected in both untreated (lane 4) and CCL2-treated (Lane 5) cell lysates (inputs) but was undetectable in the α-CCL2-treated cell lysates (Lane 6). As expected, ALIX did not bind GST-Cp6 under any condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 7–9) despite the presence of robust levels of ALIX in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, input). As a control, we also tested the association of TSG101 with GagB-p6 and GagC-p6. We found that unlike ALIX, p6-binding to TSG101 was not affected by changing CCL2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Both GagB-p6 and GagC-p6 proteins bound to TSG101 in all cases, suggesting that responsiveness to CCL2 is specifically correlated to ALIX-binding but not TSG101-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results indicate that: (i) intracellular Gag-p6-ALIX binding is dependent on the presence of the LYPX motif in Gag-p6 and that this interaction can be modulated by the presence of CCL2 in the medium of HIV-infected cells; and (ii) HIV-1C Gag-p6 is unable to bind to ALIX irrespective of CCL2 addition or depletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CCL2 mobilizes ALIX from actin cytoskeletal structures</title><p>It is known that CCL2 significantly reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross and Woodroofe, 1999</xref>). ALIX is also intimately involved in actin rearrangement and polymerization in fibroblasts by directly interacting with F-actin through both the Bro1 and the proline-rich domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, ALIX knockdown affects both the cellular levels and distribution of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bongiovanni et al., 2012</xref>). We surmised that the CCL2-dependent increase in soluble ALIX may involve mobilization of ALIX from the F-actin cytoskeleton to the cytosol, rendering it accessible to Gag-p6. To test this hypothesis, we used confocal microscopy to examine ALIX distribution in HeLa cells and macrophages under conditions that modulate CCL2 levels. In HeLa cells, our results indicated that when CCL2 was immunodepleted (α-CCL2 treatment), ALIX was strictly associated with F-actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, ‘α-CCL2’ row - compare ALIX, Actin and Merged panels). In contrast, in CCL2-treated samples (including untreated cells, which contain endogenous CCL2, or cells treated with exogenous CCL2), ALIX was not associated with F-actin structures and was mostly distributed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, ‘CCL2’ row - compare ALIX, Actin and Merged panels). Further magnification of sections of merged panels clearly shows that the colocalization is only seen in α-CCL2-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, ‘Zoom’ column). We also examined ALIX localization in macrophages. Macrophages do not have stress fibers. Instead, actin is organized into other structures. One of the cytoskeletal structures are called podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans and Matsudaira, 2006</xref>) - actin-rich degradative structures found on the ventral surface of adherent cells, and also in surfaces that project into the extracellular matrix. Although the ALIX distribution in untreated and CCL2 treated macrophages appeared more punctate than in HeLa cells, it was diffusely distributed throughout the cell and was not associated with the large punctate podosomes containing F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, ‘Untreated’ and ‘CCL2’ rows – compare ALIX, Actin and Merged panels). In contrast, upon CCL2 depletion, ALIX completely colocalized with F-actin in podosome structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, ‘α-CCL2’ row - compare ALIX, Actin and Merged panels). To further establish the colocalization of F-actin and ALIX, we determined Pearson colocalization coefficients for both HeLa cell and macrophage confocal images, which provides a quantitative measure of the degree of colocalization between two fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We found that the Pearson coefficient is highest when the cells were treated with α-CCL2 antibodies, indicating that in the absence of CCL2, ALIX is associated with actin cytoskeletal structures in the cytoplasmic compartment, while at basal level and increased CCL2 levels, it is maintained in the cytoplasm away from actin cytoskeleton.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35546.027</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CCL2 triggers intracellular redistribution of ALIX in HeLa cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal microscopy to visualize ALIX in HeLa cells. Cells treated with nothing (Untreated), CCL2, α-CCL2 or Isotype antibody for 4 hr were stained for ALIX, F-actin and DAPI to determine the cellular localization of ALIX upon modulating CCL2 levels.

HeLa cells were treated as before (untreated controls, CCL2-, α-CCL2-, and isotype antibody-treated cells). Following Latrunculin A treatment, we prepared detergent insoluble cytoskeletons, which are composed of crosslinked actin filaments, myosin-II and associated actin binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartwig and Shevlin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenberg et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tarone et al., 1984</xref>). While detergent-resistant cytoskeletons contain crosslinked actin filaments, short actin filaments will remain in the supernatant. To evaluate the ALIX-actin interaction, we separated detergent-resistant F-actin cytoskeletons and soluble F-actin by low-speed centrifugation. The soluble fraction, which contains F-actin that is not crosslinked and actin monomers (G-actin), was centrifuged at high speed to pellet the soluble F-actin (labeled ‘Pellet 2’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and G-actin will remain in the supernatant. As expected, our results show that Pellet 2 contains F-actin, which is expected to be uncross-linked F-actin. In addition, we used Latrunculin A to reduce the amount of F-actin. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterson and Mitchison, 2002</xref>), Latrunculin A treatment did not lead to a complete dissolution of all F-actin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, see actin bands in bottom panel – Pellet 2) although some reduction is observed. Interestingly, when the cells were treated with Lantrunculin A, the amount of ALIX found in the soluble and insoluble fractions with all the treatments remained same, consistent with the idea that disruption of actin cytoskeleton by Lantrunculin A allows ALIX to be released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, middle and lower panel, lanes 5–8).

Our results are consistent with reports showing that PYxEi HIV-1C viruses display increased replication rates compared to HIV-1C wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aralaguppe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaturbhuj et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether the LYPX or PYxE insertions specifically increase replication by enhancing release, we examined the relative virus release properties of HIV-1B<sub>ADA</sub>, HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1</sub>, HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1+LY</sub>, HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1+PYKE</sub> and HIV-1C<sub>IndieC1+PYRE</sub> by transfecting each infectious molecular clone into HeLa cells, pelleting the virus in the supernatants through a sucrose cushion and comparing the levels of p24 in the cell lysates and pelleted virus particles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, HIV-1B displayed a higher degree of virus release (greater levels of Gag (p24) in the sucrose cushion pelleted virus preparation than in the cell lysate (pr55)), compared to HIV-1C (lower levels of Gag (p24) in the sucrose cushion pelleted virus preparation and an increased level of Gag (pr55) in the cell lysate). Interestingly, this deficit was corrected with the insertion of LY, PYKE or PYRE into HIV-1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). We conclude that the improved replication competence of HIV-1C PYxE insertion variants is due to improved virion release owing to the acquisition of ALIX-binding capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Improved replication of PYxEi viruses is ALIX-dependent</title><p>To further confirm that the improved replication of PYxEi viruses is indeed mediated by binding of ALIX to p6 and not due to indirect effects, we tested the ability of PYxEi viruses to replicate in the absence of ALIX.

We demonstrate that CCL2 increases the availability of cytosolic ALIX by triggering its dissociation from the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating binding to Gag-p6 and thus enhancing HIV-1 particle release and replication. We also demonstrate that CCL2 regulation of HIV-1 replication is clade-specific and is manifested by genetic differences at the second late motif, LYPX. HIV-1B viruses contain an LYPX motif, in addition to PTAP motif, and their virion release is increased in the presence of CCL2 due to greater access to ALIX. In contrast, due to the absence of LYPX motif, HIV-1C cannot utilize ALIX irrespective of the degree of its availability, thus its replication cannot be further enhanced. Interestingly, despite the lack of LYPX motif, certain HIV-1C isolates (such as those emerging in drug failure cases in India or present in greater than 50% of all Ethiopian isolates tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neogi et al., 2014</xref>]) have acquired PYxE insertions in Gag-p6, which confer ALIX-binding, CCL2-mediated increase in virus release and improved replication fitness. All these data are in support of a role for CCL2 chemokine in facilitating HIV-1 replication by mobilizing ALIX.</p><p>CCL2 is a chemokine elaborated by cells infected by many different pathogens to attract monocytes as an innate immune mechanism. Our results suggest a novel means by which HIV-1 viruses that can bind ALIX can exploit the increased ALIX accessibility, as a result of increased CCL2 in their micro-environment, to gain a competitive edge. Both CCL2 and its receptor, CCR2, are widely expressed in most HIV-susceptible cell types, although CD4 T cells appear to lack expression of CCL2. Nevertheless, the expression of CCR2 on both macrophages and CD4 T cells indicate that in vivo conditions that lead to increased CCL2 production are beneficial for replication of HIV strains harboring a Gag capable of binding ALIX.</p><p>It was surprising to find virus-like particles trapped in intracytoplasmic vacuoles in HeLa cells (in the presence of α-CCL2), rather than at the plasma membrane, as was observed when a dominant negative ALIX form was over-expressed in HIV producer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munshi et al., 2007</xref>). It is already well established that plasma membrane is the primary site of virus assembly and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jouvenet et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, this observation - especially in HeLa cells - is difficult to reconcile with. However, our experiment is different from expressing a dominant negative ALIX (where some endogenous wild type ALIX is still present) in that nearly all ALIX can be completely trapped in actin cytoskeleton when CCL2 is immunodepleted. Therefore, further investigation is required to understand the basis for intravacuolar virus-like particles observed in response to CCL2 immuno-depletion our experiments.</p><p>Our data suggests that the availability of robust levels of ALIX, and in turn a significant level of ALIX-p6 interaction to increase virion budding, is modulated by the levels of CCL2, which is required to mobilize ALIX from F-actin. In fact, it is not unlikely that the low level of HIV-1 production observed in the presence of α-CCL2 is due to the residual levels of CCL2 or a form of ALIX that may still be available. Determining whether CCL2 is obligatory for HIV budding necessitates generating CRISPR knockout cell lines of <italic>CCL2</italic> and/or its receptor, <italic>CCR2</italic>. Other retroviruses, such as Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV), Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) and Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV)) as well as RNA viruses (Sendai virus and Yellow fever virus) and DNA viruses (Vaccinia) also employ a LYPX motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Votteler and Sundquist, 2013</xref>) for budding. Many of these viruses are known to induce CCL2, suggesting that the exploitation of CCL2-induced ALIX for viral replication may be a feature shared across diverse virus orders.</p><p>We find that in all cells employed here except CD4 T cells, the stimulation of virus release by the addition of CCL2 is much smaller than the level of inhibition observed upon CCL2 depletion. We believe that this asymmetry reflects the amount of ALIX that is available in the actin cytoskeletal compartment for release by CCL2 signaling. On the other hand, depletion of CCL2 can direct most of the ALIX to actin cytoskeleton bringing about maximal inhibition of virus production. It is likely that in CD4 T cells, which hardly produce any CCL2, a lack of signaling can result in most of the ALIX being already associated with actin at steady state resulting in a smaller degree of inhibition upon CCL2 depletion.</p><p>We selected CCL2 as our focus, as HIV-1B infection of macrophages induces CCL2 levels and because plasma levels of CCL2 correlate with viremia. HIV-1 may have evolved to benefit from the increasing CCL2 in its micro-environment. Numerous studies have linked CCL2 but not other β-chemokines to increase in virus replication. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that other β-chemokines may increase ALIX mobilization from the cytoskeleton. These are important future avenues of investigation.</p><p>The precise mechanism by which CCL2 signaling leads to the release of ALIX from the cytoskeleton is unknown and needs further investigation. It is known that CCL2 binding to CCR2 modulates a variety of cellular pathways – most of them poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covino et al., 2016</xref>). CCL2 binding of CCR2 signals through Frount, which eventually leads to monocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Terashima et al., 2005</xref>). It remains to be investigated whether Frount plays any role in the effects we report here. Both CCL2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) and ALIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabezas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2012</xref>) are known to be involved in actin reorganization. In addition, ALIX is known to interact with F-actin structures as well as actin-binding proteins – for example, cortactin or α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, ALIX-F-actin interaction may also be modulated by many factors including ALIX-binding proteins (e.g. ALG-2) or post-translational modifications of ALIX, actin or actin-binding proteins. Further investigation is required to delineate the specific pathway that mediates CCL2-mediated ALIX mobilization from actin.</p><p>One intriguing finding from our data is that preventing HIV-1B Gag-p6-ALIX association by blocking access to ALIX (via CCL2 depletion) inhibited virus production from wild type HIV-1B (with an intact PTAP and LYPX domains) to the same degree as HIV-1B<sub>ADA-PTAP</sub> mutant in the absence of any treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare HIV-1B wild type, α-CCL2-treated lane to PTAP-, Untreated lanes). In other words, blocking access to ALIX can bring about as much inhibition of HIV-1B virus production as does mutating PTAP motif. This may be due to the unique role played by ALIX in PTAP-mediated ESCRT III recruitment. Cellular processes that require ESCRT complexes are known to serially recruit ESCRT 0, ESCRT I, ESCRT II and ESCRT III through protein-protein interactions intrinsic to ESCRT complexes (ESCRT 0 recruits ESCRT I, ESCRT I recruits ESCRT II, ESCRT II recruits ESCRT III and ESCRT III recruitment leads to the recruitment of VPS4 AAA ATPase and associated proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCullough et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of HIV-1B budding, although the recruitment of ESCRT I and ESCRT III are accomplished independently via PTAP-TSG101-ESCRT I axis or LYPX-ALIX-ESCRT III axis, respectively, the TSG101-ESCRT complex can recruit ESCRT III and initiate budding without the need for ESCRT II complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langelier et al., 2006</xref>). As HIV-1B employs two parallel means of recruiting ALIX into the virion budding sites (via p6-LYPX or NC-Bro domain), ALIX could serve as a means of bridging ESCRT I and ESCRT III in PTAP-mediated HIV-1 budding. The complete sequestration of ALIX in actin cytoskeleton removes two major ways of recruiting ESCRT III leaving only the minor pathways of either ESCRT II-CHMP6 or Vps28-CHMP6 to recruit ESCRT III complex. A similar mechanism may explain stronger inhibition of HIV-1B virus budding in the presence of dominant negative ALIX protein when compared to CCL2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munshi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The effect of CCL2 immuno-depletion in MDMs on reducing HIV-1B replication has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fantuzzi et al., 2003</xref>). A more recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sabbatucci et al., 2015</xref>) suggested that CCL2 depletion in HIV-infected MDMs leads to impairment of viral DNA accumulation and integration. The mechanism for this effect was proposed to be due to the induction of APOBEC3A suggesting that the CCL2-depletion affects an early event. Our results demonstrate that CCL2-mediated effects are on the late events and that the mere insertion of an LY dipeptide to HIV-1C could confer CCL2-responsiveness and its deletion from HIV-1B could abrogate it. Furthermore, in single-cycle infectivity tests using TZMbl cells, we did not see any effect of CCL2 depletion on the establishment of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we believe that the results we have reported are mainly due to the effect of CCL2 on late event where ALIX redistribution leads to virion release.</p><p>It is intriguing that most clades of HIV-1, with the exception of clade C, display high conservation of a functional Gag-p6 LYPX motif, which facilitates binding to ALIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patil and Bhattacharya, 2012</xref>) and through an undefined determinant, an ability to induce CCL2, which in turn, increases cytoplasmic availability of ALIX for Gag-p6. Clade C viruses, which are known to have the lowest pathogenic fitness in group M HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariën et al., 2007</xref>), exhibit a conserved absence of the LYPX motif and inability to induce robust CCL2. A general reduced replication fitness of HIV-1 may be an evolutionary tool to replicate at low levels, evading or delaying recognition by host immune surveillance, ensuring its survival in the host for a longer time and facilitating transmission to more individuals. The absence of LYPX and the relative inefficiency with which the envelope protein facilitates HIV-1C entry both serve this purpose. Reasons for the success of HIV-1C as the most prevalent clade may be a combination of its well-conserved, reduced low fitness along with an ability to emerge as higher fitness variants under certain circumstances. Our data indeed shows that the PYxE insertions enhance virion release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). PYxE insertions have been reported exclusively in HIV-1C isolates and not in HIV-1B suggesting that the acquisition of PYxEi <italic>via</italic> recombination is facilitated by a selective advantage conferred on a virus displaying sub-optimal budding. It has been suggested that HIV-1C viruses in India show an evolutionary trend toward PTAP-duplications from 1990s to 2015 (~15% to 30%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). Along the same lines, it has been reported that HIV-1C viruses in India, which normally have three NFκB sites in the LTR, evolve into a more fit virus by acquiring a fourth NFκB site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachu et al., 2012</xref>) that allows the virus to replicate better due to an overall increase in basal transcription. In fact, the study reports that there is a tendency for HIV-1C to evolve toward 4 NFκB sites. These three different means of HIV-1C evolution into a more fit virus by acquiring duplicate PTAP motif, NFκB site or PYxE insertions suggest that HIV-1C, due to its low replication fitness, is evolving approaches to achieve greater fitness to survive in a patient.</p><p>ALIX is involved in multiple cellular functions. It binds to the ESCRT III component CHMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin-Serrano et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin-Serrano et al., 2003b</xref>) to facilitate multivesicular body formation; it binds Cep55 to facilitate cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlton et al., 2008</xref>); and it binds to actin and promotes cytoskeletal assembly in fibroblasts and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross and Woodroofe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). Although ALIX association with the cytoskeletal network and its presence in the lamellipodia are well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2006</xref>), its association and dissociation from the actin fibers in response to CCL2 is a novel finding of the current report. This finding is likely to shed novel insights into both mechanisms of HIV-1 virus production and the function of these proteins in basic biological functions such as cytokinesis.

Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in Blocking buffer, washed with 1X TBS-T or PBS-T buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. After the final wash with 1X TBS-T or PBS-T, membranes were developed using chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Pierce ECL from Thermo Scientific) or Odyssey Fc <italic>LI-COR</italic>. Quantitation of the bands was done via FIJI or <italic>LI-COR</italic> image studio software.</p><p>For Gag-p24 immunoblot analysis, membranes were probed with anti-HIV p24 goat (1:5000) (Kind gift of Dr. David Ott, NCI, Frederick) and anti-GAPDH-mouse (Thermo Scientific; 1:10,000) antibodies overnight at 4°C. We employed Donkey α-Goat antibodies labeled with Alexa 800 nm (Life Technologies; 1:10,000) and Goat α-mouse antibodies labeled with Alexa 680 nm (Life Technologies; 1:10,000) as secondary antibodies. Protein bands were quantified Using <italic>LI-COR</italic> (Odyssey-fc).</p><p>For immunoblotting CCR2, we collected and lysed U87-CCR2, primary astrocytes, CEM-CCR5, HeLa cells and macrophages. After quantifying protein concentration with BSA assay (Thermo Scientific), we mixed the lysates with 5X sample buffer, boiled the samples, spin briefly and resolved the samples on 12% SDS PAGE followed by Immunoblotting as described before.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>GST pull-downs</title><p>The GST protein and GST-p6 fusion proteins from HIV1B and HIV-1C were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified from 1 L cultures of BL21DE3-pGEX-6Pi, pGEX-6Pi-HIV-1Bp6, pGEX-6Pi-HIV-1Cp6, pGEX-6Pi-HIV-1Cp6-PYKE and pGEX-6Pi-HIV-1Cp6-PYRE. They were grown to an A<sub>600</sub> of ~0.8 before induction with 1 mM IPTG for 5 hr at 37°C. The bacterial pellet from 1 L of culture was resuspended in 10 mL of Buffer Y (low salt) (50 mM Tris pH8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL, Protease inhibitor tablet (Roche)). The bacterial suspension was subjected to seven freeze-thaw cycles using dry ice/ethanol. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and incubated for 30 min at 4°C before adding sufficient 5M NaCl to increase final NaCl concentration to 500 mM. Lysates were incubated 1 hr at 4°C, then centrifuged at 27,000 xg, 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was bound to G-beads (GE health care) and quantitated on a 12% SDS PAGE gel, with known concentration of BSA as a quantitation reference standard. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and destained. Purified GST, GST-HIV-1Bp6, GST-HIV-1Cp6 and, GST-HIV-1C-PYxE p6 proteins bound to G-beads were stored at 4°C.</p><p>Soluble cell lysate fractions from HeLa cells, prepared as described above, treated with CCL2 (250 ng/mL) or α-CCL2 (1 µg/mL) were prepared and quantitated using Micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). The expression of ALIX and TSG101 were first confirmed by Western blot. Equal inputs of GST-tagged proteins bound to G-beads were incubated for 1 hr at 4°C with normalized amounts HeLa cells lysates expressing ALIX and TSG101 in binding buffer (200 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 50 mM DTT, 1% IGEPAL, 100 mg/mL BSA and protease inhibitors). Prior to incubation, 40 µL of the binding reaction was collected and used for input determination. Following incubation, the beads were washed 5–7 times with 1X wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 25 mM PMSF). Bound proteins and input were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, subjected to either immunoblotting or Coomassie brilliant blue. Western blots were analyzed using anti-ALIX mouse (1:500) (Thermo Scientific) and α-TSG101 mouse (1:500) (GeneTex) antibodies. The relative binding was quantified by densitometry (ImageJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>HeLa and MDM cells were seeded on MatTek plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight. Cells were treated with CCL2 (250 ng/mL), α-CCL2 (2.5 µg/mL), 1X PBS or isotype control antibodies (2.5 µg/ml) for 4 hr. Cells were washed twice with 1X PBS and fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar) for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X solution for 3 min and blocked with 5% BSA at 37°C for 1 hr.

In our data, we have either combined multiple biological replicates (as indicated) to plot the data as a single set along with SEM or depicted representative data from one of the several biological replicates (indicated for each experiment). Technical replicates in our experiments are replicates within one experiment with no biological differences in the replicates. Statistical significance was determined by performing Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and area under the curve.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Duncan Wilson for many useful discussions, Kartik Chandran and Kimberly Merani for reading the manuscript, Eitan Novogrodsky for technical assistance, the Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS Research (ERC-CFAR) (P30 AI051519) for the use of core facilities and Dr. Eliseo Eugenin for the use of confocal microscope at Rutgers University in our initial studies.

Unlike other HIV-1 clades, most subtype C isolates lack a functional ALIX binding site in p6.

Given the quantity of experimental work required for publication, the recommended decision is rejection. However, the authors would be welcome to resubmit a new, improved manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> on this topic if they are able to address the reviewers' concerns (described below).

Most of these experiments are represented as mean +/- SEM (n = 2). Moreover, biological replicates of some of the experiments have apparently been performed only twice (or even once). This issue may underlie the inconsistency of some of the described phenotypes. For example, addition of anti-CCL2 antibodies has a 40-fold effect in Figure 1B, whereas the same treatment has a 2-fold effect in Figure 1E. All of the experiments must be done independently at least three times. Finally, HIV-1 replication in MDM can vary significantly from donor to donor. The authors should state whether the experiments shown were repeated using different donors (and if they not, then this must be done).</p><p>2) Figure 1: The effect of adding extra CCL2 on subtype B HIV-1 is considerably less impressive than the effect of anti-CCL2. Can virus replication in the presence of anti-CCL2 be rescued by addition of exogenous CCL2? This would confirm that the effect of the antibody is due to the neutralization of endogenous CCL2, rather than an off-target effect. In a similar vein, these experiments need to be better controlled. An isotype antibody control should be used in these experiments and specificity should also be shown at the chemokine level (e.g., are similar phenotypes observed when other chemokines are inhibited or added to these cells?).</p><p>3) The author's model indicates that addition of CCL2 should disassociate ALIX from actin but this effect is not observed in Figure 4, thus contradicting some of the main conclusions in the manuscript. These observations are further contradicted by the data in Figure 3B, where addition of anti-CCL2 antibodies does not alter the fraction of soluble ALIX. Moreover, the authors should examine whether the insoluble pellets in Figure 3B actually represent F-actin. For example, does actin in the pellet disappear upon latrunculin treatment? If so, does pelletable ALIX also diminish upon latrunculin treatment under all three conditions (UT, CCL2, and anti-CCL2)? Finally, the observed changes in ALIX localization upon CCL2 depletion are intriguing but require greater mechanistic explanation as meaningful associations between ALIX and the actin cytoskeleton remain to be defined more rigorously, and the mechanism underlying CCL2-dependent release of ALIX from actin also requires greater definition.</p><p>4) The authors have observed CCL2-responsiveness in macrophages, the T cell line SupT1, and in primary CD4 T cells. For example, Figure S3 shows that the replication of a clade B but not a clade C virus in SupT1 cells was inhibited by anti-CCL2. However, RNAseq data indicate that SupT1 cells express minimal amounts of CCL2 (as do other T cell lines). Similarly, RNAseq data indicate that purified primary CD4 T cells often express little or no CCL2, even after infection with HIV-1. The authors should indicate whether and how much CCL2 was expressed in the experiment involving SupT1 cells and primary CD4 T cells. Furthermore, the purity of the primary CD4 T cells should be demonstrated, to rule out the possibility that CCL2 came from contaminating monocytes/macrophages.</p><p>5) Figure S3: the p24 values shown are extremely low (pg rather than ng), indicating negligible virus replication in SupT1 cells, which in turn raises concerns about the relevance of the data. Although SupT1 cells are extremely permissive for X4 viruses, they express hardly any CCR5, and most R5 viruses cannot infect them. Indeed, Dejuco et al. have reported that ADA, one of the viruses used in the present study, does not infect SupT1 cells (J Virol 73, 7842, 1999). Although the authors may have used SupT1/CCR5 cells, this is not indicated anywhere. The Materials and methods merely state that the cells were from the NIH AIDS repository, which are unmodified.</p><p>6) Figure 1C and 6C: The effect of anti-CCL2 (i.e., accumulation of Pr55 and reduction of mature p24) seems more typical of an assembly defect (e.g., membrane binding or multimerization) than of the particle release defect. Have the authors confirmed that cells treated with anti-CCL2 accumulate arrested budding virus particles on the cell surface?</p><p>7) Figure 2B, C, E, 7C, and 8: These panels, which show the levels of released p24, should be accompanied by immunoblotting of cell lysates. This would confirm that Gag expression levels in cells are comparable under the different conditions tested.</p><p>8) The discussion should be strengthened in several respects. A) Considering that the main novelty/significance of this study comes from the finding that CCL2 triggers ALIX dissociation from actin cytoskeleton, additional mechanistic explanation (even if speculative) is desirable. In this regard, the discussion on RhoA is probably irrelevant, since RhoA regulates actin cytoskeleton assembly, whereas CCL2 does not seem to affect actin cytoskeleton formation (based on the amount of actin associated with insoluble pellets (Figure 3) or the abundance of stress fibers (Figure 4)), but rather the release of ALIX from actin. B) The authors state that the finding of CCL2-triggered ALIX redistribution has wide-ranging implications in cell and cancer biology but specific discussion on such implications is not provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35546.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ajasin et al. propose that binding of the host factor ALIX to its &quot;YPXL&quot; binding site on HIV-1 Gag-p6 is functionally modulated by the chemokine CCL2, and that this regulatory axis promotes replication of clade B HIV-1 isolates.

But we understand the reviewers’ concern, which was partly based on the number of replications of some of the experiments. Therefore, to comply with the reviewers’ request, we have mounted a lengthy, major effort to fully address this comment. All experiments in the revised manuscript have been performed at least 3 times. In addition, wherever monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are used, those experiments have now been performed in cells derived from 2-3 different donors. We have indicated the number of times each experiment was replicated in the Figure Legends.</p><p>Variable fold-differences: The reviewer noted the discrepancy in fold differences between previous Figures 2B (40-fold) to 2E (2-fold) (not Figure 1E to Figure 1B as stated in the review). The corresponding figures now are Figure 3B and 3E, with the data in 3E having been generated using a different CD4 T cell line, CEM-CCR5 in response to a separate comment (see below). The reasons for the lower (2-fold) reduction in virus production by CEM-CCR5 cells (compare untreated to anti-CCL2 in Figure 3E) is that CEM-CCR5 cells produce miniscule levels of CCL2 as compared to HeLa cells (see response under point #4 about CCL2 levels). It is true that the HeLa cell virus production data in the previous Figure 2B and 2C (now Figure 3B and 3C) showed ~40-fold difference between untreated and anti-CCL2-treated samples. We have now repeated this experiment three more times and present an average of four experiments – the average fold difference in HeLa cells is now 5-fold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: The effect of adding extra CCL2 on subtype B HIV-1 is considerably less impressive than the effect of anti-CCL2. Can virus replication in the presence of anti-CCL2 be rescued by addition of exogenous CCL2? This would confirm that the effect of the antibody is due to the neutralization of endogenous CCL2, rather than an off-target effect. In a similar vein, these experiments need to be better controlled. An isotype antibody control should be used in these experiments and specificity should also be shown at the chemokine level (e.g., are similar phenotypes observed when other chemokines are inhibited or added to these cells?).</p></disp-quote><p>Differential fold reduction and stimulation by addition of CCL2 versus anti-CCL2 antibodies: We agree that in Figure 1, addition of extra CCL2 has a smaller effect compared to CCL2-depletion. Depletion of CCL2 inhibited virus production ~10-fold in macrophages whereas addition of CCL2 increased it by approximately 50% of untreated control. This asymmetry also applies to the HeLa cell experiments (now Figure 3B) where we observe about 5-fold inhibition of virus production with anti-CCL2, but ~50% increase with CCL2 addition. On the other hand, in T cell lines – as seen in the new Figure 2B or 3E, CCL2 depletion results in a 2-fold inhibition, while the addition of CCL2 still causes only an ~50% increase. It is possible that there is an upper limit on how much CCL2 can increase virus production as is observed in our experiments. This could be due to the limitations in the components involved. For example, the level of ALIX could be constant and limiting. Thus, the added CCL2 will be able to mobilize the population of ALIX molecules present in the cytoskeleton causing a proportional increase in virus release. On the other hand, when CCL2 is depleted, most of the soluble ALIX is directed to cytoskeleton, preventing the availability of ALIX to a greater extent, thus leading to a greater level of inhibition. In addition, there may be a variability in: (i) the levels of endogenous CCL2 and (ii) total levels of ALIX present in different cell types. While the addition of anti-CCL2 is able to redirect most of the soluble ALIX to the cytoskeletal compartment and reduce virus production levels, addition of CCL2 to a cell that already has significant endogenous levels of CCL2 can only redirect cytoskeletally associated ALIX molecules to the cytoplasm. We believe that our results are consistent with our model and we have added this to the Discussion section.</p><p>Rescue by replacing anti-CCL2 with CCL2: As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed an experiment where anti-CCL2 was added to the medium until 9 days post-infection and was replaced with CCL2 for subsequent days to evaluate rescue of virus production in macrophages. Our data indicates that virus release suppression observed during 9 days of replication in MDMs in the presence of anti-CCL2, was rescued continuously up to 24 days by addition of CCL2. This result confirms that the effect of the antibody is due to neutralization of endogenous CCL2 rather than off-target effects of the antibody, and that the effect is reversible.</p><p>Isotype control antibodies: An isotype antibody control was included in Figure 1 in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have included isotype controls in all experiments where needed (Figures 1 to 3, Figure 4B, Figures 5 to 8, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 12—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Chemokine specificity: Our rationale for investigating the role of CCL2 in HIV-1 replication is supported by the literature. Multiple studies have reported the association of CCL2 with viremia in HIV+ individuals. Importantly, Ansari et al. queried over 100 cellular proinflammatory genes and found CCL2 to be the most significantly correlated with plasma viremia (Ansari et al., 2006). Based on the reviewers’ comment, we considered testing multiple chemokines in our assays. But there is a dizzying array of chemokines known. Even limiting to β-chemokines would require testing over two dozen β-chemokines in three different cell types (MDMs, CD4 T cells and HeLa cells). Therefore, while this is a laudable future goal, testing each of the several β-chemokines is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The author's model indicates that addition of CCL2 should disassociate ALIX from actin but this effect is not observed in Figure 4, thus contradicting some of the main conclusions in the manuscript. These observations are further contradicted by the data in Figure 3B, where addition of anti-CCL2 antibodies does not alter the fraction of soluble ALIX. Moreover, the authors should examine whether the insoluble pellets in Figure 3B actually represent F-actin. For example, does actin in the pellet disappear upon latrunculin treatment? If so, does pelletable ALIX also diminish upon latrunculin treatment under all three conditions (UT, CCL2, and anti-CCL2)? Finally, the observed changes in ALIX localization upon CCL2 depletion are intriguing but require greater mechanistic explanation as meaningful associations between ALIX and the actin cytoskeleton remain to be defined more rigorously, and the mechanism underlying CCL2-dependent release of ALIX from actin also requires greater definition.</p></disp-quote><p>Addition of CCL2 must disassociate ALIX from Actin: This is indeed a key element of our model. However, as mentioned above, the change in ALIX distribution from untreated to CCL2-treated condition tends to have an incremental effect on the levels of ALIX in the soluble fraction – which depends on how much ALIX is pre-associated with the actin cytoskeletal compartment in the presence of endogenous CCL2. We do not understand why the reviewer believes that the previous Figure 4 contradicted our model. There is a clear, observable difference in ALIX colocalization in cells treated with anti-CCL2 vs. CCL2 (previously Figure 4, now Figures 5 and 6 for HeLa cells and macrophages respectively). To illustrate this point, we are providing a higher magnification image of a region of interest in the HeLa cell images (Figure 5). One can observe the following in these images. With a-CCL2, ALIX colocalizes with F-actin structures (stress fibers in HeLa cells and podosomes in macrophages), whereas in CCL2-treated HeLa cells or MDMs, ALIX exhibits a more diffuse cytosolic distribution and very little colocalization with F-actin. These observations were also quantitated by calculating the Pearson colocalization coefficient, which provides a quantitative measure of the degree of colocalization between two fluorophores. This data support the conclusion that ALIX localizes to F-actin structures when CCL2 is depleted. Since HeLa cells (and MDMs) secrete CCL2 into the medium, which has autocrine effects on HeLa cells, the differences in ALIX distribution observed in untreated and CCL2-treated cells appears to be minimal. These results are in agreement with the smaller effect of CCL2 addition on virus production (Figure 1 and Figure 2).</p><p>Distribution of ALIX in soluble and insoluble fractions: The reviewer indicates that Figure 3B does not show a reduction in soluble ALIX in anti-CCL2 treated cells. While Western blots are not always quantitative, in the previous Figure 3B, there was indeed an observable reduction in the amount of soluble ALIX between the untreated and anti-CCL2 lanes. This effect was reproducible as shown in the newer replicate of this experiment included in the revised manuscript (now Figure 4B).</p><p>Do the insoluble pellets actually represent F-actin and does ALIX in the cytoskeletal compartment diminish upon actin depolymerization?: For examining the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins, the preparation of detergent insoluble fractions is a well-established approach. This fraction is composed of crosslinked actin filaments, myosin-II and associated actin binding proteins (see Rosenberg et al., 1981; Tarone et al., 1984 and Hartwig and Shevlin, 1986). While detergent-resistant cytoskeletons contain crosslinked actin filaments, short actin filaments will remain in the supernatant. To address this, we modified our protocol to evaluate both detergent-resistant F-actin cytoskeletons and soluble F-actin. Cell lysates were first centrifuged at low speed to separate the detergent-resistant F-actin cytoskeletons and the soluble fraction, which contains F-actin that is not crosslinked into the cytoskeleton. The low speed supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 x g, which will pellet soluble actin filaments (labeled Pellet 2 in Figure 4B); G-actin will remain in the supernatant. As expected, our results show that Pellet 2 contains actin. In addition, we used Latrunculin A to reduce the amount of F-actin. Consistent with previous observations (Peterson and Mitchison, 2002), Latrunculin A treatment did not lead to a complete dissolution of all F-actin structures (Figure 4B). However, Latrunculin A reduced both the amount of Factin and ALIX in the high speed pellet, indicating that actin and the associated ALIX in the cytoskeleton appear in the soluble fraction. These data provide strong support for CCL2-mediated regulation of ALIX’s association with the actin cytoskeleton.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors have observed CCL2-responsiveness in macrophages, the T cell line SupT1, and in primary CD4 T cells. For example, Figure S3 shows that the replication of a clade B but not a clade C virus in SupT1 cells was inhibited by anti-CCL2. However, RNAseq data indicate that SupT1 cells express minimal amounts of CCL2 (as do other T cell lines). Similarly, RNAseq data indicate that purified primary CD4 T cells often express little or no CCL2, even after infection with HIV-1. The authors should indicate whether and how much CCL2 was expressed in the experiment involving SupT1 cells and primary CD4 T cells. Furthermore, the purity of the primary CD4 T cells should be demonstrated, to rule out the possibility that CCL2 came from contaminating monocytes/macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>CCL2-responsiveness in CD4 T cells: In response to the reviewers’ comment about the use of different CD4 T cell lines in different experiments, we have now used a single CD4 T cell line – CEM-CCR5 wherever a CD4 T cell line is used. We performed CCL2 measurements in CEM-CCR5 as requested. In agreement with the RNAseq data cited by the reviewer for SupT1 cells, CD4 T cells (CEM-CCR5) secrete very little CCL2 with or without HIV-1B-infection (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). As we have not used primary CD4 T cells in these experiments, we have not measured CCL2 in primary CD4 T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure S3: the p24 values shown are extremely low (pg rather than ng), indicating negligible virus replication in SupT1 cells, which in turn raises concerns about the relevance of the data. Although SupT1 cells are extremely permissive for X4 viruses, they express hardly any CCR5, and most R5 viruses cannot infect them. Indeed, Dejuco et al. have reported that ADA, one of the viruses used in the present study, does not infect SupT1 cells (J Virol 73, 7842, 1999). Although the authors may have used SupT1/CCR5 cells, this is not indicated anywhere. The Materials and methods merely state that the cells were from the NIH AIDS repository, which are unmodified.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment in Figure S3 using SupT1-CCR5 cells obtained from Dr. James Hoxie (University of Pennsylvania). The reviewer is correct that the virus production was suboptimal, which was due to the low MOI of virus used in the infection. Therefore, we have now reproduced the experiment depicted in Figure S3 using CEM-CCR5 cells (also referred to as CEM NKR-CCR5) and matched the conditions including virus MOI and anti-CCL2 antibody concentration we employed for Macrophage infection – as in the Figure 1A. The new data (Figure 2A and 2B) show a more robust virus production (p24 over 30ng/ml to 50ng/ml range at peak for HIV-1C and HIV-1B respectively) albeit with a reproducibly modest inhibition with anti-CCL2 for the reasons discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1C and 6C: The effect of anti-CCL2 (i.e., accumulation of Pr55 and reduction of mature p24) seems more typical of an assembly defect (e.g., membrane binding or multimerization) than of the particle release defect. Have the authors confirmed that cells treated with anti-CCL2 accumulate arrested budding virus particles on the cell surface?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. Further experimentation to investigate this question has lead us to conclude that the basis for the absence of virus particle release is a combination of defects in trafficking and plasma membrane binding leading to virion particles in cytoplasmic vacuoles rather than a traditional budding defect where the particles remain attached to the plasma membrane.</p><p>In order to address whether particles accumulate near the membrane in the presence of anti-CCL2, we have performed both confocal microscopy and electron microscopy using HeLa cells transfected with HIV- 1B molecular clones. Confocal microscopy combined with p24 signal pixel quantitation from nuclear membrane to plasma membrane of untreated cells typically shows a pattern of higher concentration of Gag at the cell periphery, close to the plasma membrane (Cano and Kalpana, 2011; La Porte and Kalpana, 2016). However, under anti-CCL2 conditions there is a more even distribution of signal density across the cytoplasm suggesting that normal Gag trafficking is disrupted. We have examined 24h samples where we can see virus particles at the cell surface for untreated cells and cells treated with isotype control antibodies. Anti-CCL2-treated samples at 24 h, however, showed very few particles at the cell surface but a considerable number of cells display virus-like or sub-viral-like particles in intracellular vacuoles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2B, C, E, 7C, and 8: These panels, which show the levels of released p24, should be accompanied by immunoblotting of cell lysates. This would confirm that Gag expression levels in cells are comparable under the different conditions tested.</p></disp-quote><p>A majority of the Figures identified by the reviewers involve HIV-1 DNA transfection with the exception of Figure 2E, which was an infection experiment, not transfection. In the case of infection, we have ensured equal input by using equal MOIs. For all transfections, we have ensured that the transfection efficiencies are equivalent via green fluorescence protein detection after transfecting peGFP n1. We have done immunoblotting to show that the Gag levels in cell lysates are equivalent between the various conditions for Figure 2B, 2C and 7C. Figure Supplement 5 includes analysis for Figure 2B and 2C (now Figures 3B, 3C) and Figure Supplement 7 includes the analysis for Figure 7C (now Figure 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The discussion should be strengthened in several respects. A) Considering that the main novelty/significance of this study comes from the finding that CCL2 triggers ALIX dissociation from actin cytoskeleton, additional mechanistic explanation (even if speculative) is desirable. In this regard, the discussion on RhoA is probably irrelevant, since RhoA regulates actin cytoskeleton assembly, whereas CCL2 does not seem to affect actin cytoskeleton formation (based on the amount of actin associated with insoluble pellets (Figure 3) or the abundance of stress fibers (Figure 4)), but rather the release of ALIX from actin. B) The authors state that the finding of CCL2-triggered ALIX redistribution has wide-ranging implications in cell and cancer biology but specific discussion on such implications is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the discussion on RhoA may be less relevant due to the actin phenotype observed. We thank the reviewer as this comment sheds light on the complexity of the various signal transduction pathways involved. There are numerous pathways that regulate actin cytoskeleton assembly/disassembly. Similarly, there are multiple signal transduction pathways downstream of CCL2 – thus making it difficult to speculate. We have included a brief discussion and have expanded our discussion of the overall implications for cell and cancer biology in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
