However, it remains largely unknown which proteins specify and mediate such contacts. Here we describe an assay, MAP-C (Mutation Analysis in Pools by Chromosome conformation capture), that simultaneously characterizes the effects of hundreds of <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>-acting mutations on a chromosomal contact. Using MAP-C, we show that inducible interchromosomal pairing between <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> alleles in saturated cultures of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeast is mediated by three transcription factors, Leu3, Sdd4 (Ypr022c), and Rgt1. The coincident, combined binding of all three factors is strongest at the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> locus and is also specific to saturated conditions. We applied MAP-C to further explore the biochemical mechanism of these contacts, and find they require the structured regulatory domain of Rgt1, but no known interaction partners of Rgt1. Altogether, our results demonstrate MAP-C as a powerful method for dissecting the mechanistic basis of chromosome conformation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42499.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside cells, genetic information is stored within molecules of DNA that are folded into three-dimensional structures known as chromosomes. Each fold in a chromosome forms when two points on a single DNA molecule link together to make a loop. DNA in two different chromosomes can also form links with each other (known as “contacts”). Many cells contain two copies of every chromosome and these copies are often able to make contacts with each other.</p><p>DNA loops and contacts can change in response to the environment and this may help cells switch the right genes on and off at specific times. For example, in budding yeast cells that have used up most of their preferred food source – a sugar called glucose – the two copies of a region of DNA known as the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region stick together. This may help the budding yeast cells switch on genes that are needed to make use of alternative sources of food.</p><p>Cells contain hundreds of proteins called transcription factors that can bind to specific locations on DNA and can also stick to each other. These proteins are thought to be responsible for anchoring bridges between the DNA at most loops and contacts. One way to find out which transcription factors form specific DNA loops and contacts is to generate many different genetic mutations in the DNA and identify precisely which mutations disrupt the links. However, current methods can only test one mutation at a time, so it remains unclear how and why many segments of DNA stick together.</p><p>Now, Kim et al. have developed a new method known as MAP-C to test how hundreds of mutations in budding yeast affect a particular DNA contact, in a single experiment. The MAP-C method was used to test which mutations within either the DNA segment involved in the contact, or in genes encoding transcription factors, prevent copies of the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region from forming contacts. This revealed that three transcription factors – Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 – bridge contacts between the two copies of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic>.</p><p>Mutations that disrupt the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes can cause cancer, developmental disorders and other diseases. The MAP-C method will allow researchers to better understand which transcription factors control how DNA is folded inside the cell, and which mutations change this folding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>saturation mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>chromosome conformation</kwd><kwd>3C</kwd><kwd>homolog pairing</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 DK107979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shendure</surname><given-names>Jay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship DGE-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seungsoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shendure</surname><given-names>Jay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007631</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Fellow (Genetic Networks Program)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunham</surname><given-names>Maitreya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pooled mutational scanning approach for 3D chromosome conformation reveals how multiple transcription factors can jointly specify condition-specific genome conformations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The three-dimensional organization of the genome within the nucleus is structured but dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonev and Cavalli, 2016</xref>). Although many features of this conformation are largely conserved across cell types and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmitt et al., 2016a</xref>), some chromatin loops and contacts form specifically in response to signals such as differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmitt et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stadhouders et al., 2018</xref>), changes in nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brickner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>), heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>), drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Ippolito et al., 2018</xref>), meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Muller et al., 2018</xref>), or circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). This dynamic three-dimensional organization of the genome plays a role in regulating gene expression in diverse organisms. In multicellular organisms, active developmental gene promoters form long-range loops with specific enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>), and this looping is in some cases sufficient for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a well-studied model of genome conformation, genes targeted to nuclear pores are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Taddei et al., 2006</xref>), while those at the nuclear periphery are repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrulis et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) are attractive candidates for orchestrating such dynamic changes in chromatin conformation, given their site-specific DNA binding and changes in abundance or activity in response to differentiation and cellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>). For many conditions, it remains unknown exactly which TFs bind to any given locus. Although binding site motifs are known for many TFs, motif searches poorly predict TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guertin and Lis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jolma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Le et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Slattery et al., 2014</xref>). Even if the set of TFs bound to each locus is known, it is unclear which TFs are capable of forming chromosomal contacts. DNA-bound TFs can also recruit other cofactor proteins that can mediate chromosomal contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Song et al., 2007</xref>), but our understanding of TF-cofactor interactions remains incomplete.</p><p>Among chromosomal contacts and loops, interchromosomal contacts are less well-understood. This is in part due to the relative paucity of interchromosomal contacts in Hi-C and other 3C (chromosome conformation capture) data, which results from their greater contact distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maass et al., 2018</xref>) and chromosomal self-association into territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cremer and Cremer, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, many distinct classes of interchromosomal contacts are known, including clustering of transcriptionally active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mitchell and Fraser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Osborne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schoenfelder et al., 2010</xref>), associations with nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Quinodoz et al., 2018</xref>), interactions among developmental enhancers and promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lomvardas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>), and mitotic homologous chromosome pairing in organisms ranging from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>) to flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henikoff and Dreesen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joyce et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morris et al., 1999</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these contacts remains incomplete.</p><p>Many known mechanisms for establishing 3D chromosome conformation may act on both intrachromosomal loops and interchromosomal contacts. The emerging consensus model for such DNA-DNA interactions involves loop extrusion by cohesin and other Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) factors, which is thought to primarily mediate intrachromosomal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alipour and Marko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rowley and Corces, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>). However, SMC complexes are also capable of mediating interactions between multiple DNA molecules, such as between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). Interchromosomal contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>) and intrachromosomal contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weintraub et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deng et al., 2012</xref>) can also be mediated by dimerization of structured proteins. In addition to these well-defined strong molecular interactions, weak interactions such as those underlying phase separation of nuclear factors such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chong et al., 2018</xref>), coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2018</xref>), RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehning et al., 2018</xref>), and heterochromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Strom et al., 2017</xref>) may play an important role in shaping 3D genome organization. How these and other mechanisms synergize remains an open question.</p><p>Mitotic (or somatic) homologous chromosome pairing is the preferential association of homologous pairs of loci in mitotically dividing cells. Homolog pairing occurs along the length of the genome in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joyce et al., 2016</xref>), but is more subtle in yeast and other organisms, where the association is often transient and/or genomically localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). Fluorescence in situ hybridization screens in flies have nominated various pairing and anti-pairing factors that modulate the strength of homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joyce et al., 2012</xref>), but the precise mechanisms by which these factors regulate pairing are largely unknown. In mammals, X chromosome pairing is mediated by CTCF and Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donohoe et al., 2009</xref>), in conjunction with transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). However, cases of highly localized homolog pairing remain rare. Furthermore, the distinctions between homolog pairing and non-allelic interactions between repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gladyshev and Kleckner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mirkin et al., 2014</xref>) remain unclear.</p><p>We recently identified a novel example of an inducible, localized interchromosomal contact between homologous copies of the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> locus in diploid <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). This interaction occurs in saturated culture conditions, requires the 1 kb intergenic region between the <italic>HAS1</italic> and <italic>TDA1</italic> coding sequences, and is detectable by both Hi-C and microscopy. The condition-specificity and dependence on intergenic sequence led us to hypothesize that one or more TFs might mediate this pairing. Although yeast TF binding is well-characterized for standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>), TF binding has not been systematically measured in saturated culture conditions. Meanwhile, computational predictions of TF binding sites are insufficiently specific: for example, within the 1 kb region required for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing, dozens of TFs have at least one motif match. Furthermore, even if the TFs bound to this region were known, it would remain unclear which subset played a role in mediating inducible interchromosomal pairing.</p><p>Here we describe a method that enables the simultaneous testing of hundreds of <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>-acting mutations for their effects on a chromosomal contact of interest. As a proof of concept, we applied this method, which we call Mutation Analysis in Pools by Chromosome conformation capture (MAP-C), to characterize the molecular components mediating <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing. We first perform saturating mutagenesis of the regulatory region that mediates the interchromosomal pairing (<italic>cis</italic> MAP-C) to identify sequence motifs required for pairing that potentially correspond to TF binding sites. We then test the effects of knocking out over one hundred TFs (<italic>trans</italic> MAP-C), and confirm that three—Leu3, Sdd4 (Ypr022c), and Rgt1—are necessary for inducible interchromosomal pairing. We verify their binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and find that <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> exhibits the strongest coincident, combined binding by all three factors across the genome in a condition-specific manner. We further use <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C to interrogate how interaction partners and domains of Rgt1 regulate pairing. Finally, we make an initial attempt to characterize the functional consequences of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing. Taken together, our results demonstrate how a combination of TFs can mediate inducible interchromosomal pairing. Furthermore, our study shows the utility of a pooled mutant approach to studying both the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> dependencies of chromosome conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A pooled approach to systematically dissect chromosome conformation</title><p>In order to identify and dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying chromosome conformation, experiments involving perturbations (<italic>e.g.</italic> mutations) are needed.

The resulting mutant pool is then integrated into the genome and subjected to the 3C assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>). The region containing the genetic variants is amplified using two different primer pairs: the first (3C library) amplifies a specific ligation product, and the second (genomic library) amplifies regardless of ligation. These amplification products are deeply sequenced to measure the abundance of each variant in the 3C library, which is normalized to its abundance in the genomic library. The relative extent to which sequence variants participate in the chromosomal contact of interest is proportional to their normalized representation in the 3C library.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A cluster of TF motifs is necessary and sufficient for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing</title><p>As a first test of <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C, we sought to systematically dissect the conserved pairing between <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> homologs in diploid <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts grown to saturation. We recently used Hi-C of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> hybrids (&lt;80% nucleotide identity) to discover this homolog pairing interaction, and furthermore identified a 1,038 bp noncoding region that was necessary and sufficient for pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To find a minimal subsequence of the 1,038 bp <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region that is sufficient to pair with other <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> alleles, we replaced the native <italic>S. cerevisiae HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> locus with a library containing each of 861 tiling 178 bp subsequences of the 1,038 bp region (along with a G418 resistance cassette and restriction site), in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> hybrid yeast. We then performed <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C for pairing of the modified locus with the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> copy of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> on a saturated culture of the pool, in two replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to the genomic libraries, the 3C libraries were highly enriched for a narrow region spanning ~ 500 to ~ 700 bp from the <italic>HAS1</italic> coding sequence, with a plateau between ~ 525 to ~ 675 bp, consistent with that ~ 150 bp region being the only subsequence shorter than 178 bp sufficient for pairing (termed the ‘minimal pairing region’ below). To confirm that this pattern of enrichment is specific to <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> homolog pairing rather than underlying all of its chromosomal contacts, we repeated the assay with a pair of primers amplifying a ~ 10 kb intrachromosomal contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In this ‘off-target’ control, coverage from the 3C library matched that of the genomic control, suggesting that most variants are capable of intrachromosomal looping, but only those containing the minimal pairing region are capable of interchromosomal pairing with the other <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> allele.</p><p>Since our initial experiment was performed in the endogenous genomic context, other DNA sequences outside but near the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> locus could be required in addition to the minimal pairing region. We therefore tested whether inserting a 184 bp sequence that included the minimal pairing region into an ectopic location, the gene <italic>FIT1</italic> (<italic>YDR534C</italic>), would induce pairing with the native <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> locus in saturated cultures of haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As a negative control, we inserted an equivalently sized subsequence insufficient for pairing into the same locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Indeed, insertion of the minimal pairing region led to a &gt; 30 fold increase in 3C signal for pairing with <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> as compared to the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to obtain a base-pair resolution map of the DNA sequences necessary for pairing. We used error-prone PCR to generate variants of a 207 bp region (161 bp excluding fixed primer sequences) containing the minimal pairing region, with an average of 1.49 substitutions (range 0–14) per template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We inserted this variant library in place of the native <italic>S. cerevisiae HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> sequence as before, and performed <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C. The ratio of total substitution abundance in the 3C and genomic libraries can be plotted at each mutagenized position. This identified six clusters of two or more adjacent positions showing strong depletion of substitutions in the 3C libraries, indicating that they are required for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We inspected motifs in the region to identify candidate TFs that might mediate the pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Given the abundance of potential matches, we prioritized motifs with high-scoring matches, motifs with conserved positions corresponding to those most important for pairing, and motifs occurring in multiple clusters. The first two clusters together aligned to a Leu3 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the third to several similar motifs, including Sdd4 (Ypr022c) and Mig1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and the last three to Rgt1 motifs in both orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). These motifs, which span 47 bp, include 23 of the 24 positions most depleted for mutations in the 3C libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and all clusters of two or more adjacent such positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). None of these mutations had a strong effect on intrachromosomal looping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and all of the clusters were reproduced using an alternative mutagenesis strategy (programmed 3 bp substitutions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, a fourth Rgt1 motif and a second Sdd4/Mig1 motif mutagenized only in our validation experiment were not required for pairing, suggesting that either not all motifs in this region are bound by the same TFs or not all bound TFs are involved in mediating homolog pairing at this locus.</p><p>Thus, using <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C, we identified a ~ 150 bp subsequence of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> sufficient for pairing, containing five required TF motif occurrences. If these TF motifs are together sufficient for pairing, we would expect that 1) they are only observed in a cluster in the minimal pairing region and not elsewhere in the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic>, and 2) they are present in a cluster in the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> copy of this region, and potentially other <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> as well. Indeed, these motifs are clustered together only in the central region of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic>; remarkably, this pattern holds across all <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Three transcription factors are required for pairing</title><p>Although we identified the TF motifs required for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> homolog pairing at base-pair resolution with <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C, the redundancy among TF motifs made it difficult to definitively identify the TFs involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We then assayed these constructs for interactions with the native <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region, using the existing gene-specific barcodes to measure strain abundances in each library. In this approach, because the pairing sequences are inserted into different genes throughout the genome, the frequency of pairing is confounded by the potential effects of the genomic location of the pairing sequence. Therefore, for each of the 10 TFs we targeted, we included as controls up to six neighboring genes, which should have a similar genomic location effect as the targeted gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We hypothesized that due to the Rabl orientation of yeast chromosomes, in which centromeres are clustered together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duan et al., 2010</xref>), centromere-proximal regions would interact less with <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic>, which is centromere-distal. Indeed, the most centromere-distal gene knockouts interacted ~ 4 fold more with the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> locus than the most centromere-proximal gene knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Of the 7 TF gene knockouts that were measured in our assay (three dropped out during library construction, including <italic>LEU3</italic>), six had no substantial difference in pairing strength compared to their genomic neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, deletion of <italic>RGT1</italic> led to a ~ 20 fold decrease in pairing strength, consistent with Rgt1 binding its cognate motifs in the minimal pairing region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we expanded our <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C screen to include the majority of known nonessential TFs with known binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Boer and Hughes, 2012</xref>). To avoid the confounding effect of genomic location, we inserted a barcoded pairing sequence construct into a fixed locus instead of into the gene knockout locations. We associated each of these barcodes with the cognate knockout by individually transforming each knockout strain with a unique barcode, in a 96-well plate format. We tested a total of 109 TF gene knockouts, as well as 15 nuclear pore complex components, eight fitness neutral negative controls, and a wild-type control, with multiple barcode replicates for controls and expected hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As expected, most barcoded strains were equally abundant in the 3C and genomic libraries, indicating that the corresponding knockout did not impact <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing. However, <italic>LEU3</italic> and <italic>RGT1</italic> knockouts were depleted ~ 4 fold from the 3C libraries, suggesting that they are required for pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, deletion of <italic>MOT3</italic> modestly decreased pairing (~2.5 fold); however, its binding motif is not present in the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region, suggesting an indirect role. Two other knockouts, <italic>VHR1</italic> and <italic>CBF1</italic>, appeared to also decrease pairing, but were at low abundances and might reflect noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the TFs required for pairing in either <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C experiment had a motif matching the sequence CCCCAC (the third cluster of positions required for pairing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, two putative TFs with high scoring motif matches, <italic>YPR022C</italic> (<italic>SDD4</italic>) and <italic>YGR067C</italic>, were excluded in the initial screens due to their lack of annotations. Therefore, we repeated our fixed-locus TF knockout screen with a limited set of genes, including the two putative TFs and additional replicates for the hits <italic>MOT3</italic>, <italic>VHR1</italic>, and <italic>CBF1</italic>. We found that <italic>SDD4</italic> is indeed required for pairing, suggesting that it is the <italic>trans-</italic>acting factor that binds the CCCCAC motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>MOT3</italic> once again exhibited modest depletion, suggesting a minor, perhaps indirect, role in pairing, whereas <italic>VHR1</italic> and <italic>CBF1</italic> displayed no depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The strong concordance between the genomic base-pairs required for pairing (identified by <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C) and the DNA binding motifs of <italic>trans</italic> factors required for pairing (identified by <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C) suggests that Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 bind the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> to mediate pairing. To test this hypothesis, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagged versions of Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>), in haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeast under both saturated and exponential growth conditions. By qPCR using two different primer pairs, all three TFs strongly bound to the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing region in saturated conditions, but near background levels in exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). We then performed ChIP sequencing to determine TF binding genome-wide. Consistent with our quantitative PCR measurements, all three TFs showed robust ChIP-seq peaks at <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> in saturated conditions. In contrast, only Leu3 demonstrated a significant peak in exponential growth, with 20-fold weaker enrichment (2.5-fold vs. 51-fold in saturated conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). For all three TFs, saturated conditions produced ChIP-seq peaks with greater enrichments over the input controls and more robust enrichment of the expected motifs, suggesting generally more extensive DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). These global trends could be a result of technical artifacts as well as biological differences; however, all samples were treated identically using a protocol not optimized for saturated culture conditions, and the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> peak showed particularly strong condition-specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Based on the convergence of <italic>cis</italic> MAP-C, <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C, and ChIP-seq data, we conclude that Leu3, Rgt1, and Sdd4 directly bind to both alleles of the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> minimal pairing region under saturated growth conditions and thereby mediate inducible interchromosomal contacts between them.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Combinatorial transcription factor binding specifies strong pairing</title><p>We next explored whether the combination of Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 binding explains the uniqueness of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing.

Our experiments thus far had not distinguished whether Rgt1’s pairing activity is directly mediated by physical interactions among molecules of Rgt1 or indirectly, through these or other interaction partners. To address this, we performed <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C for individual deletions of these four interacting partners of Rgt1, along with the same positive and negative controls as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, based on the glutamine and asparagine-rich domains present in Sdd4 and Rgt1, we tested deletion of <italic>RNQ1</italic>, a Q/N-rich peptide known to influence the oligomerization of other Q/N-rich proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Derkatch et al., 2004</xref>).

Deletion of <italic>TUP1</italic> or <italic>SSN6</italic> both led to increased pairing, indicating that the recruitment of the Tup1/Ssn6 co-repressor complex inhibits pairing. This is consistent with its known inhibition of Rgt1’s DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roy et al., 2013</xref>), which is presumably required for pairing. Deletion of <italic>MTH1</italic> or <italic>STD1</italic> had a minimal negative effect on pairing. These results suggest that the role of Rgt1 in pairing is not simply to recruit cofactors that mediate pairing; instead, its pairing activity may compete with its transcriptional repression activity.</p><p>We hypothesized that a particular domain of Rgt1, coupled with its DNA-binding activity, might be responsible for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing. To test this idea, we generated a series of 10 amino acid deletions spanning most of the Rgt1 protein (positions 91–1030, excluding several deletions that dropped out during strain construction) and performed <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C to test the pairing function of the Rgt1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Surprisingly, much of the C-terminal half of Rgt1 was required for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing. These ‘pairing domains’ are closely aligned to the regions of Rgt1 predicted to be highly structured, largely through alpha helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The regions of Rgt1 required for pairing also correspond loosely to those required for regulation of activation vs. repression function through allosteric changes in protein conformation in response to glucose-regulated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polish et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To further compare the roles of Rgt1 protein domains and phosphorylation in <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing, we generated deletions of the Rgt1 zinc finger, Q/N-rich, and C-terminal domains, and phosphodepletion mutants S88A and S758A, and performed <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C to test their pairing function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). As expected, deletion of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain or the C-terminal domain led to background pairing levels, equivalent to lacking Rgt1 altogether. Surprisingly, deletion of the Q/N-rich domain led to stronger pairing than the wild-type control (with <italic>RGT1</italic> integrated at the same ectopic location), suggesting that the Q/N-rich domain inhibits pairing. Both the S88A and S758A mutations had a weak decrease in pairing, indicating that although these mutations are capable of disrupting Rgt1 activator function and intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polish et al., 2005</xref>), they do not individually play major roles in regulation of pairing in saturated cultures.</p><p>Together, our results suggest multiple potential modes by which the transcription factor Rgt1 regulates <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing: its own expression level, recruitment of Tup1/Ssn6, and the competing activities of its Q/N-rich and C-terminal regulatory domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Pairing factors do not play major roles in <italic>HAS1</italic> or <italic>TDA1</italic> transcriptional regulation</title><p>We have thus far characterized the molecular mechanism and regulation of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> homologous pairing in saturated cultures.

We then performed RNA-seq in saturated culture conditions. Of note, neither of these mutants is expected to have complete loss of pairing, since the individual binding site or TF mutants disrupt pairing by ~ 4–10 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), as opposed to the ~ 30 fold increase in pairing upon ectopic insertion of the pairing sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); however, if the Leu3 and Rgt1 binding site mutations cause the same effect on <italic>HAS1</italic> or <italic>TDA1</italic> transcription, the orthogonal nature of these perturbations would add confidence that any resulting molecular phenotype is an effect of disrupting pairing.

MAP-C can be used to identify the precise sequences that are necessary for a contact (<italic>cis</italic> MAP-C) as well as the factors that are necessary to mediate the contact (<italic>trans</italic> MAP-C). Here we applied both versions of MAP-C to dissect the mechanism of inducible interchromosomal pairing between <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> alleles in budding yeast. Using a combination of gain-of-function and loss-of-function screens, we demonstrate that a trio of transcription factors—Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1—mediates pairing between clusters of binding sites.</p><p>Our results begin to elucidate the mechanisms of condition-specific interchromosomal contacts and homolog pairing, which have often been elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mirkin et al., 2013</xref>). We have not yet fully defined the biochemical mechanism of pairing—it is possible the TFs interact directly and/or indirectly—but so far, no known interaction partners or cofactors have proven essential for this interaction. Unlike more prevalent nuclear-pore mediated gene relocalization and homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Randise-Hinchliff and Brickner, 2016</xref>), <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing in saturated cultures does not appear to require the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Instead, the Tup1/Ssn6 repressor complex recruited by Rgt1 negatively regulates pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), perhaps by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of Rgt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roy et al., 2013</xref>). Within Rgt1, the zinc finger DNA-binding domain and C-terminal regulatory domain are required for pairing, while the Q/N-rich region, which contains the activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polish et al., 2005</xref>), inhibits pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results point toward specific interactions among structured domains mediating pairing, rather than phase separation by intrinsically disordered regions.</p><p>Intriguingly, Leu3 also contains a regulatory domain whose conformation responds to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sze et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 1997</xref>). We speculate that these regulatory domains, which are capable of intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polish et al., 2005</xref>), may mediate interchromosomal pairing. Furthermore, if these regulatory domains are indeed capable of direct dimerization or oligomerization, they may mediate not only interchromosomal contacts, but also cooperative TF binding at clusters of binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). We note that of Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1, only Leu3 is known to form strong dimers at each of its binding sites. However, even weak homotypic intermolecular interactions could increase the duration of interchromosomal contacts as well as increase local TF concentrations, and thereby increase DNA binding activity. It remains unclear whether heterotypic interactions among Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 occur.</p><p>Another question is whether the contacts are stoichiometric, for example one-to-one, or instead mediated by aggregation of one or more TFs via weak interactions. Notably, we observe homotypic pairing between homologs of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> and <italic>HXT3pr</italic> but not heterotypic pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that Rgt1 does not indiscriminately form contacts between all of its binding sites. However, this is not because the entire homologous context is necessary for pairing, as we found that the pairing sequence from <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> is sufficient to induce ectopic pairing in haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Instead, a possible explanation is that only pairs of loci with a series of motifs in similar orders and orientations form frequent contacts, consistent with a stoichiometric interaction model. This added specificity beyond the presence of TF motifs could explain the lack of pairing between <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> and other sites of Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Despite our detailed molecular characterization of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> homolog pairing, we still do not know its biological function, if any. We hypothesized that it might contribute to transcriptional regulation at either <italic>HAS1</italic> or <italic>TDA1</italic>. In particular, <italic>TDA1</italic> is a kinase that phosphorylates Hxk2, the main hexokinase in yeast, and thereby inhibits its ability to mediate glucose repression together with Mig1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaps et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kettner et al., 2012</xref>) We speculated that pairing might help activate <italic>TDA1</italic>, which is mildly upregulated at the transcriptional level in saturated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). However, we find that Leu3 and Sdd4 play no detectable role in regulating transcript levels of either gene in saturated culture conditions, while Rgt1 mildly represses <italic>TDA1</italic> in <italic>cis</italic> but not in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). There are several possible reasons why we may not have detected a phenotypic effect from disrupting the pairing region or factors: (1) even low levels of pairing (~10–25% based on our MAP-C experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) are sufficient to mediate its biological function; (2) its function is not in saturated culture conditions per se, but affects either exit from or re-entry into those conditions, similar to transcriptional memory at <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brickner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sood et al., 2017</xref>); (3) its function only affects the dynamics of transcription (or other processes) but not steady-state RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang and Bai, 2016</xref>). However, we also acknowledge the possibility that there is no function per se, but that pairing is instead a side-effect of conservation of biochemical features of the pairing TFs. If the same domains are required for both cooperative binding and pairing, then evolutionarily conserved pairing could result from selection on cooperative binding. Interestingly, the TF Hsf1, which forms trimers, and in flies also exhibits cooperativity between trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xiao et al., 1991</xref>), was also recently shown to mediate interchromosomal contacts in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>). More studies of the biochemical basis of cooperative TF binding are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Is <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing unique? Based on Hi-C, we previously found <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> to exhibit the strongest interchromosomal interactions in saturated cultures of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> hybrids, excluding centromeres, telomeres, and the chromosomes carrying the rDNA arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Using ChIP-seq and motif analyses, we found that a requirement for robust adjacent DNA-binding by Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 on both the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic> copies was sufficient to identify <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic>. However, we also expect that the limited resolution of Hi-C and the sequence divergence in interspecific hybrids would both limit our sensitivity for detecting homolog pairing. We hypothesize that more cases of localized pairing exist, as we found with <italic>HXT3pr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). We imagine that other TFs capable of interchromosomal contacts, like Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>), are also capable of mediating homolog pairing, and the condition-specificity of these contacts suggests that other conditions may also exhibit similar contacts but have not yet been explored.</p><p>Although our study was focused on <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing in budding yeast, both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C should be applicable to other loci and organisms. The main constraints in experimental design are that 1) the introduced mutations or associated barcodes must be included in the 3C PCR product, and 2) the region of interest should not be digested by the restriction enzyme. As we have implemented this approach, the region targeted by saturation mutagenesis was limited to &lt; 250 bp to allow for Illumina sequencing, but this could be extended using either barcode association, similar to our <italic>trans</italic> knockout screens, or long-read sequencing methods. Also, we focused on a single pair-wise interaction, but it is also possible to assay a mutant pool for multiple interactions, by using multiple primer pairs. MAP-C should be applicable to intrachromosomal contacts as well as interchromosomal ones, albeit with a potentially higher background of nonspecific contacts. It would be interesting to apply MAP-C to dissect the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulators of enhancer-promoter loops in mammals, and thereby distinguish the contributions of cohesin and CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2012</xref>), general looping factors like YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weintraub et al., 2017</xref>), site-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nolis et al., 2009</xref>), and other cofactors. <italic>Trans</italic> MAP-C could also allow mutational scanning of TFs to clarify the biochemical mechanisms by which these transcription factors mediate chromosomal contacts.</p><p>MAP-C leverages the high throughput of saturation mutagenesis and mutant collections to allow systematic dissection of chromosome conformation. We tested up to ~ 1000 variants at a time, but with larger-scale experiments, it should be possible to test even more variants. A major potential strength of our approach is that unlike cellular high-throughput genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gasperini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shalem et al., 2015</xref>), it resolves the functional consequences of mutations at the allelic level, and thus is not confounded by heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Patwardhan et al., 2009</xref>). As we continue to map chromosome conformation at high resolution across ever-expanding numbers of cell types and conditions, MAP-C will provide a scalable approach to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying specific contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and culture</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are described in the Key Resources Table.

In their previous publication, this group used diverged haploid yeast as a model (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ×<italic>S. uvarum</italic>) and provided a global view of chromosome conformation in hybrid diploid yeasts. They found localized increases in homologous interactions between the HAS1-TAD1 alleles specifically under galactose induction and saturated growth conditions.</p><p>The current study aims to understand the regulatory mechanism underlying homologous pairing between the HAS1-TAD1 locus in diploid yeast. To identify the specific sequence elements that are necessary and sufficient to maintain homolog pairing between the HAS1-TAD1 alleles, the authors developed a method called MAP-C (Mutation Analysis in Pools by Chromosome conformation capture). The cis MAP-C method involves analyzing populations of cells with multiple mutations of specific regions suspected to mediate interchromosomal pairing followed by amplification of 3C products and sequencing. To find the minimal subsequence of the 1,038 bp HAS1pr-TDA1pr region that is essential for the homologous interactions, the authors replaced the native <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> HAS1pr-TDA1pr locus with a library containing each of 861 tiling 178 bp subsequences of the 1,038 bp region. Following identification of the minimal pairing region, they used error-prone PCR to obtain a base-pair resolution map of the DNA sequences necessary for homologous pairing, and identified unique clusters of sequence motifs in the minimal pairing region, which correspond to specific TFs binding motifs. Next, they used trans MAP-C, to test trans knockouts of the TF candidates identified in the cis MAP-C and confirmed that three TFs (Leu3, Sdd4, and RGT1) mediate the interchromosomal pairing. The method variants are interesting and useful, however there are a few points that could be addressed that could potentially make the manuscript more interesting for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Obviously, the homologous pairing between HAS1-TAD1 alleles is a localized event, and the pairing is inducible (growth saturation or galactose induction) and limited into a 1kb intragenic regions on chromosome XIII. However, this study did not attempt to answer key biological questions: what's the biological purpose or meaning of this localized pairing? Why it's inducible? There are no experimental data or discussions in the manuscript. This is an important question that could greatly improve the interest level and relevance of the findings and the manuscript.</p><p>2) In the Introduction, the author described that &quot;a motif match is insufficient to fully predict TF binding&quot;, which is true. Later on, this study identified binding of the three transcription factors binding to the &quot;minimal pairing region&quot; which are necessary and essential for homologous pairing between HAS1-TAD1 alleles. However, most of the Results section and Conclusion were based on motif scanning, motif searching, and mutations in this region. This study missed some very important experiments: ChIP-seq of these three transcription factors to verify the binding of Leu3, Sdd4 and Rgt1 at the minimal pairing region.</p><p>3) Since the homologous pairing between HAS1-TAD1 alleles is significantly higher at growth saturation than at standard growth conditions, and this study also identified that three transcription factors (Leu3, Sdd4 and Rgt1) regulate this homolog pairing. What's the binding level of these three TFs at the minimal pairing region under the two different growth conditions? ChIP-seq of these three transcription factors under the two different growth conditions is very important to verify and solidify the conclusion.</p><p>4) The authors claimed that HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing is regulated by the expression level of TFs, particularly RGT1. In fact, using the mRNA expression level of TFs is not convincing way to convey this idea. Because increasing at mRNA level does not necessarily means increasing TFs' bindings at chromatin, DNA, or a specific loci (in the current study). The best experiment here would again be ChIP-seq of the three TFs to show differential binding.</p><p>5) Last part of the Results section, there is no data to support that the &quot;pairing domains&quot; of Rgt1 needs to be phosphorylated for the purpose of homologous pairing. This is speculation without supporting data. If the authors believe that phosphorylation of the &quot;pairing domains&quot; of Rgt1 is one of the regulatory mechanisms of Rgt1 function, then they need to show that under growth saturation conditions, the &quot;pairing domain&quot; of Rgt1 is indeed phosphorylated.</p><p>6) In the Introduction the authors claim that:</p><p>&quot;Although interchromosomal contacts, such as those between actively transcribed genes or homolog pairing in mitotically dividing yeast, have been observed by microscopy (Burgess et al., 1999; Lim et al., 2018; Maass et al., 2018), many are not detectable using 3C (chromosome conformation capture) technologies. Some have argued that these contacts might be a result of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) artifacts (Lorenz et al., 2003) or the insertion of binding site arrays often used for live-cell imaging (Mirkin et al., 2014). A more detailed understanding of the molecular components of interchromosomal contacts is needed to resolve this ambiguity.&quot;</p><p>Although this passage is written to suggest they are only referring to yeast, the papers cited in fact refer to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse cells. There are in fact many publications that have shown a correspondence between interchromosomal associations between transcribed genes by FISH and by 3C in mammalian cells going back over a decade, and more recently in live yeast cells with 3C technology verification. As always authors like to suggest novelty in order to get published, but there is no need to ignore the work of many other colleagues and many other publications. The author's method alone and its findings are powerful results. The authors should read and cite those original papers instead of making an erroneous claim that will only serve to irritate their colleagues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript, the authors developed a method to study interchromosomal interactions to simultaneously analyze hundreds of cis or trans-acting mutations. This method will advance the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of the chromosomal pairing. The authors identified the minimal sequence that is essential for the homologous pairing at the HAS1pr-TDA1pr locus. The pairing event occurs particularly in the saturated cultures in budding yeast. They introduced a barcode to each gene knockout and tested hundreds of transcription factors knockouts. The authors found that LEU3, SDD4, and RGT1 are required for pairing. Finally, they identified a particular domain of RGT1 that is responsible for the pairing. This study demonstrated that transcription factors play an important role in chromosomal interactions using genetic approaches. In my opinion, this study was well done.</p><p>1) The authors analyze the DNA binding sites for RGT1, LEU3, and SDD4 at the HAS1pr-TDA1pr locus (Figure 1.E-H). However, there is no evidence showing that these transcription factors directly bind to HAS1pr-TDA1pr locus in saturation cultures but not in exponentially growing cultures. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for RGT1 and LEU3 could answer this question.</p><p>2) In Figure 3C legend), there is a typo in the sentence: {greater than or equal to}2 bins from a telomere. What does &quot;bin&quot; mean in the figure legend?</p><p>3) Does the homologous pairing at HAS1pr-TDA1pr regulate nearby gene expression in saturated cultures? The authors could analyze the RNA-seq data to address this question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Kim et al., present the development of MAP-C (Mutation Analysis in Pools by Chromosome conformation capture), a new approach to study the regulation of chromosomal interactions by mutation. Two flavors of the methods allow (i) identifying the local sequence required for interaction by cis MAP-C (ii) testing the requirement of other factors or sequences for interaction by trans MAP-C.

They identify both the precise genomic sequence and the factors required for inter-chromosomal interaction. In the future, this new tool will facilitate the study of pairing, a widely observed but still poorly characterized biological enigma.</p><p>- Subsection “A cluster of TF motifs is necessary and sufficient for <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing” and Figure 1D: The authors claim to identify five clusters, however this choice seems arbitrary with additional depletions of substituted nucleotides (e.g regions upstream of E and between G-H).</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 2C: While the intensity of ratios is clearly less intense in the control than in the 3C library, it shows a similar pattern (compare panel C to panel B).</p><p>- Subsection “Three transcription factors are required for pairing”, second paragraph is difficult to understand. How does the position of deleted regions influence the interactions? This should be improved together with the explanation of trans MAP-C and Figure 2A.</p><p>- The identification of three transcriptional factors (TFs) requird for HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing suggests that transcriptional activity or RNA produced at the locus might play a role in regulating the interaction between the two regions. The authors should characterize the transcriptional status of the locus and its changes in the individual TFs knockouts and upon pairing.</p><p>- Rgt1 domain analysis showed that the C-terminal region, largely structured, is required for pairing. However, there is quite a stretch from this observation to the suggestion that it is regulated by phosphorylation, as previously described (Polish et al., 2005). The authors should test the effect of mutating the regulatory S88 and S758 residues.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A combination of transcription factors mediates inducible interchromosomal contacts&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. We apologize for the additional time it has taken to render this decision. This is due to the fact that we waited for the remaining reviewer to respond. Although we never received their comments, we have decided to proceed on the basis of one review. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by us and also by one of the original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance. Reviewer 2 requests evidence that pairing has been successfully disrupted in order to validate interpretation of the results. Specifically, mutating Rgt1 binding sites results in a TDA1 upregulation but mutating Leu3 binding sites does not (Figure 5). It is important to determine by 3C-qPCR (for example) that pairing is lost in the mutants. The Log23C/genome data shown is not sufficient to make the claim. Reviewer 2 suggested that the authors compare HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing with a non-pairing region or under exponential growth conditions. We believe that this experiment should not take too long to perform and would enable us to move forward with the manuscript, assuming all goes as planned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript includes ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to investigate the mechanism of HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing. The authors show that Leu3, Sdd4, and Rgt1 were more enriched at HAS1pr-TDA1pr locus in saturated culture conditions than in exponential growth condition, suggesting that these transcription factors are directly involved in the pairing. They performed RNA-seq for those TF mutants and TF binding site mutants and found that those mutations have little effects on transcription levels of HAS1 and TDA1 genes, and they haven't found the biological functions of the pairing in their manuscript. Several possible reasons why they have not detected a phenotypic effect from disrupting the pairing region or factors were discussed in the revised version. Although they have mostly addressed the questions I have, there are few concerns about whether they have successfully disrupted the pairing that may lead to a different interpretation of the results.</p><p>The authors found that the mutation of Rgt1 binding sites at the pairing locus results in a mild upregulation of TDA1 expression (Figure 5B), but the mutation of Leu3 binding sites does not affect on gene expression (Figure 5C). The authors claim that the disruption of pairing may not have any effect on transcription (subsection “Pairing factors do not play major roles in <italic>HAS1</italic> or <italic>TDA1</italic> transcriptional regulation”). However, I don't see the measurement of the pairing events (such as 3C-qPCR) for those mutants (Figure 5A). Do these mutants completely disrupt the pairing? They used Log23C/genome to show the decrease of pairing in those mutants, but it doesn't represent the level of pairing remained in those mutants. The authors should compare HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing with a non-pairing region (or in exponential growth condition) as a control to show whether those mutants have entirely abolished the pairing or not.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42499.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p><p>Please focus on several of the key points raised by reviewers:</p><p>1) The identification of 3 TFs for pairing suggests that transcriptional activity or RNA produced at the locus might play a role in the trans interaction.

In addition, we analyzed existing microarray data of the same TF deletions in exponentially growing cells (GSE4654, Hu et al., 2007). As shown in Figure 5, we find that either mutating two Rgt1 binding sites in the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region or deleting the <italic>RGT1</italic> gene result in mild (~1.5-2-fold) upregulation of <italic>TDA1</italic>, consistent with its known role as a repressor in low glucose conditions.

Furthermore, none of the other perturbations had any significant effect on <italic>HAS1</italic> or <italic>TDA1</italic> expression. In the Discussion section, we describe the implications and possible reasons for a lack of a detected function for pairing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the C-terminal region of Rgt1 seems required for pairing, the suggestion that it is regulated by phosphorylation is a stretch.

As shown in Figure 4E and 4F, we do not find strong effects of preventing phosphorylation, only mild decreases in pairing. However, we suspect that Rgt1 would predominantly be in a dephosphorylated state under saturated culture conditions, and thus, our results do not rule out a role for phosphorylation in regulating pairing activity, i.e. preventing pairing in exponential growth conditions. But in light of these results, we have de-emphasized the possible role of phosphorylation in regulating pairing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer 1 would like to see either data or discussion of the biological purpose of localized pairing and why it is inducible.

As described in the revised Discussion section, there are various possible reasons why we have not detected a function: (1) even weak pairing (such as that without all three TFs and their binding sites) may suffice for its function; (2) pairing function may not act during saturated culture conditions, but instead upon exit from or re-entry into those conditions, as in epigenetic transcriptional memory; (3) pairing may regulate transcriptional dynamics rather than steady-state transcript levels. Finally, we speculate regarding the possibility that pairing has no function per se but is instead the result of conservation of homotypic intermolecular interactions among TFs that also mediate cooperative DNA binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) We would require evidence that the factors actually bind the pairing locus.

As shown in Figure 2D and E, all three TFs bind much more strongly in saturated cultures, with only Leu3 showing detectable binding in exponential growth. We further use these data to extend our motif analyses assessing the uniqueness of <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> pairing and whether combinatorial TF binding specifies where homolog pairing occurs in saturated culture conditions (shown in Figure 3). We find that <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> indeed exhibits the strongest coincident binding of all three TFs and conserved motif clusters in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic> genomes.

This study missed some very important experiments: ChIP-seq of these three transcription factors to verify the binding of Leu3, Sdd4 and Rgt1 at the minimal pairing region.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to main points #4 and #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since the homologous pairing between HAS1-TAD1 alleles is significantly higher at growth saturation than at standard growth conditions, and this study also identified that three transcription factors (Leu3, Sdd4 and Rgt1) regulate this homolog pairing. What's the binding level of these three TFs at the minimal pairing region under the two different growth conditions? ChIP-seq of these three transcription factors under the two different growth conditions is very important to verify and solidify the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to main points #4 and #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claimed that HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing is regulated by the expression level of TFs, particularly RGT1. In fact, using the mRNA expression level of TFs is not convincing way to convey this idea. Because increasing at mRNA level does not necessarily means increasing TFs' bindings at chromatin, DNA, or a specific loci (in the current study). The best experiment here would again be ChIP-seq of the three TFs to show differential binding.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to main points #4 and #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Last part of the Results section, there is no data to support that the &quot;pairing domains&quot; of Rgt1 needs to be phosphorylated for the purpose of homologous pairing. This is speculation without supporting data. If the authors believe that phosphorylation of the &quot;pairing domains&quot; of Rgt1 is one of the regulatory mechanisms of Rgt1 function, then they need to show that under growth saturation conditions, the &quot;pairing domain&quot; of Rgt1 is indeed phosphorylated.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to main point #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Introduction the authors claim that:</p><p>&quot;Although interchromosomal contacts, such as those between actively transcribed genes or homolog pairing in mitotically dividing yeast, have been observed by microscopy (Burgess et al., 1999; Lim et al., 2018; Maass et al., 2018), many are not detectable using 3C (chromosome conformation capture) technologies. Some have argued that these contacts might be a result of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) artifacts (Lorenz et al., 2003) or the insertion of binding site arrays often used for live-cell imaging (Mirkin et al., 2014). A more detailed understanding of the molecular components of interchromosomal contacts is needed to resolve this ambiguity.&quot;</p><p>Although this passage is written to suggest they are only referring to yeast, the papers cited in fact refer to Drosophila and mouse cells.

However, there is quite a stretch from this observation to the suggestion that it is regulated by phosphorylation, as previously described (Polish et al., 2005). The authors should test the effect of mutating the regulatory S88 and S758 residues.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to main point #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>[…] The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance. Reviewer 2 requests evidence that pairing has been successfully disrupted in order to validate interpretation of the results. Specifically, mutating Rgt1 binding sites results in a TDA1 upregulation but mutating Leu3 binding sites does not (Figure 5). It is important to determine by 3C-qPCR (for example) that pairing is lost in the mutants. The Log23C/genome data shown is not sufficient to make the claim. Reviewer 2 suggested that the authors compare HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing with a non-pairing region or under exponential growth conditions. We believe that this experiment should not take too long to perform and would enable us to move forward with the manuscript, assuming all goes as planned.</p></disp-quote><p>As we discussed, we introduced highly targeted Leu3 and Rgt1 binding site mutations in a hybrid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> context in an effort to rigorously test for transcriptional effects of pairing, rather than effects in <italic>cis</italic> or other effects in <italic>trans</italic>. We believe that these mutations do not completely disrupt pairing as reviewer #2 suggests, based on our <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> MAP-C experiments in which disrupting a single TF binding site or TF gene results in ~4-10-fold weaker pairing (Figure 1D, Figure 2B,C), compared to the ~30-fold increase in ectopic pairing (Figure 1C) conferred by the entire pairing sequence. Thus, as we have agreed upon, instead of performing the proposed experiment, we have edited the text (in the Results section and the Discussion section) to clarify our expectation that we have not fully disrupted pairing, but rather to ~10-25% of wild-type levels. We understand that reviewer #2 is concerned that this may have prevented us from finding transcriptional effects; however, this is just one of several potential reasons that we did not detect a phenotypic effect of disrupting <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> homolog pairing, as detailed in the Discussion section, and testing these possibilities is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revised manuscript includes ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to investigate the mechanism of HAS1pr-TDA1pr pairing.
