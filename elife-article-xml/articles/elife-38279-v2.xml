How these pathways are integrated in time, and whether cells maintain a memory of their signaling history remains obscure. Here, we dissect the temporal integration of two key pathways, WNT and ACTIVIN, which along with BMP control gastrulation. CRISPR/Cas9-engineered live reporters of SMAD1, 2 and 4 demonstrate that in contrast to the stable signaling by SMAD1, signaling and transcriptional response by SMAD2 is transient, and while necessary for pluripotency, it is insufficient for differentiation. Pre-exposure to WNT, however, endows cells with the competence to respond to graded levels of ACTIVIN, which induces differentiation without changing SMAD2 dynamics. This cellular memory of WNT signaling is necessary for ACTIVIN morphogen activity. A re-evaluation of the evidence gathered over decades in model systems, re-enforces our conclusions and points to an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38279.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryonic stem cells can renew themselves to generate more stem cells, or specialize to become any type of cell found in an adult. They therefore hold great potential for studying how we develop from a single cell into a complex organism made of many different cell types.</p><p>In a key stage of development, individual cells form into organized tissues. The earliest phase of tissue organization involves the formation of three ‘germ layers’. Human embryonic stem cells allow us to recreate this early stage of embryo development in the lab. When grown in confined spaces, the cells organize into clusters that can then develop germ layers. Previous work using these clusters showed that a network of signaling proteins – including one called WNT – trigger human embryonic stem cells to form the initial clusters. Then, another signaling protein called ACTIVIN tells the cells to specialize to form the two inner germ layers. But in experiments that apply only the ACTIVIN signal, the cells instead keep dividing to make more stem cells.</p><p>ACTIVIN can trigger the activity of a protein called SMAD. To visualize how cells respond to ACTIVIN in real time, Yoney et al. used a gene editing technique called CRISPR to add fluorescent tags to SMAD in human embryonic stem cells. The results show that the ACTIVIN response triggers a peak in the amount of SMAD in the cell’s nucleus that then decreases over several hours. This briefly activated several genes that are known to help to form germ layers. However, this gene activity was not maintained for long enough to cause the stem cells to specialize and organize into layers.</p><p>Yoney et al. then repeated the experiments on cells that had previously been exposed to WNT signaling proteins. The germ layer gene activity was maintained in this case, leading to the cells specializing and forming the inner two germ layers. This suggests that the cells somehow remembered the WNT signal, and this memory changed how they responded to ACTIVIN.</p><p>The next step is to understand how cells store the memory of the WNT signal. As well as aiding our understanding of development, it could also help us to understand situations where signaling goes wrong, such as cancer. The technique used here to follow signals in real time could also be used to study other biological signaling processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>mesendoderm differentiation</kwd><kwd>micropatterns</kwd><kwd>SMAD signaling</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>WNT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship DGE132526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoney</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project R01GM101653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siggia</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name><name><surname>Brivanlou</surname><given-names>Ali H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project R01HD080699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siggia</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name><name><surname>Brivanlou</surname><given-names>Ali H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The requirement for WNT signaling in mesendoderm differentiation is temporally separate from that of ACTIVIN signaling and acts to switch the output of ACTIVIN/SMAD2 from pluripotency maintenance to mesendoderm patterning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the early embryo, secreted morphogens regulating a limited number of signaling pathways carry the task of instructing dynamic and coordinated cell differentiation across the developing tissue. In the day 6.5 mouse embryo, a hierarchy of signaling mediated by BMP, WNT, and NODAL carries the positional information in the epiblast leading to axis formation and germ layer specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>). Each of these morphogens induces the expression of the next ligand (BMP signaling induces WNT expression, and WNT signaling induces NODAL expression), and all induce the expression of their own inhibitors. To what extent this signaling cascade is involved in human gastrulation can now be investigated using in vitro models of early human embryos derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).</p><p>We have previously shown that the first step of this signaling hierarchy is conserved in humans and that in response to BMP4, hESCs grown in geometrically confined colonies, self-organize to induce and pattern embryonic and extra-embryonic germ layers. Ectoderm was specified at the center of circular colonies, extra-embryonic tissue at the edge and mesendoderm in between. Molecular signatures of gastrulation, such as the induction of SNAIL and activation of pERK could also be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the conservation of the second step of the signaling hierarchy, BMP4, which signals through SMAD1/5/8, was shown to induce the expression of WNT ligands, which can also induce the emergence of a primitive streak and the self-organization of embryonic germ layers in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>). We, therefore, termed this system a human gastruloid.</p><p>The third pathway, SMAD2/3, which signals on behalf of ACTIVIN and NODAL ligands, has an intriguing role. On the one hand, SMAD2/3 signaling is required for hESC pluripotency maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">James et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vallier et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, the ACTIVIN/NODAL pathway is necessary for fate specification, acting as a morphogen to pattern the blastula of vertebrate embryos from the amphibian to the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDowell and Gurdon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robertson, 2014</xref>). The ACTIVIN/NODAL pathway is also necessary for the self-organization of human gastruloids as inhibition of SMAD2/3 signaling blocks primitive streak formation and mesendoderm induction by BMP4 and eliminates anterior mesendoderm fates induced by WNT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, co-presentation of ACTIVIN with WNT3A to micropatterned hESC colonies leads to the induction of the organizer specific marker GOOSECOID, and a functional human primitive streak, which when grafted into chick embryos induces the formation of a secondary axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite these findings, the mechanism by which SMAD2/3 signaling can specify both hESC pluripotency and differentiation remains perplexing, and a number of key questions remain unanswered. Among them are: how can a single signaling pathway carry these two opposite functions before and after the onset of gastrulation? To what extent do the dynamics of SMAD signaling affect these readouts? Finally, to what extent do cells have a memory of past signaling?</p><p>In this study we aimed to provide highly quantitative answers to these questions by following the dynamics of TGFβ signaling during the self-organization of human gastruloids. Imaging of hESC reporter lines engineered by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tagging of SMAD1, SMAD2, or SMAD4 demonstrated that each branch of the pathway has distinct signaling dynamics. In response to ACTIVIN, SMAD2 displayed a dramatic transient nuclear translocation, which stood in sharp contrast to the stable BMP4-induced SMAD1 response. ACTIVIN stimulation did induce transient mesendodermal gene transcription, which correlated with SMAD2 dynamics. This induction, however, was not sustained and cells reverted back to pluripotency at later times. Interestingly, pre-presentation of WNT3A to the cells, while not changing SMAD2 dynamics or expression of the pluripotency markers, stabilized the subsequent transcriptional response to ACTIVIN to maintain mesendodermal fates. This implies an unexpected ability of human embryonic stem cells to record their signaling history without overt changes in fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gastruloids respond to ACTIVIN stimulation at the colony border</title><p>A functional SMAD2/3 pathway is necessary for both maintenance of pluripotency, as well as differentiation and self-organization of human gastruloids downstream of BMP4 and WNT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of BMP4 induced differentiation, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of SMAD2/3 signaling, SB431542 (SB), eliminated all mesendodermal fates, as indicated by the loss of BRA and SOX17 positive cells, leaving only the putative extra-embryonic and ectoderm fates, marked by CDX2 and SOX2 expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). Presentation of the downstream morphogen WNT3A induced primitive streak formation at the colony border, and addition of SB in this context removed the SOX17 positive mesendodermal population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>). In order to ask whether gastruloid self-organization can be initiated at the ACTIVIN/NODAL point in the signaling hierarchy, we stimulated micropatterned colonies grown in conditioned media with high concentrations of ACTIVIN A (referred to as ACTIVIN throughout this work). In contrast to stimulation with BMP4 and WNT3A, no differentiation was observed after 48 hr with ACTIVIN alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, the lack of differentiation in response to ACTIVIN was not due to a lack of signal sensing, as an increase in nuclear SMAD2/3 was detected by immunofluorescence at the colony border after one hour of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). We conclude that while SMAD2/3 signaling is necessary for mesendoderm induction downstream of BMP4 and WNT3A in human gastruloids, it is not sufficient to induce it.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38279.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ACTIVIN modifies gastruloid differentiation but it cannot induce it.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Micropatterned colonies in conditioned media treated for with BMP4 (50 ng/mL), BMP4 (50 ng/mL) +SB (10 µM), WNT3A (100 ng/mL), or WNT3A (100 ng/mL) +SB (10 µM) for 48 hr.

This contrast in activity of the two branches of the TGFβ pathway prompted us to assess possible differences in their signaling dynamics. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering on RUES2 to fluorescently tag the N-terminus of the endogenous receptor-associated, R-SMAD1, with tagRFP (RUES2-RFP-SMAD1) and R-SMAD2 with mCitrine (RUES2-mCit-SMAD2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, in E7 the exogenous TGFβ levels could be precisely controlled. In response to BMP4, we detected an increase in the SMAD1 nuclear signal that was stable over 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">2</xref>). The SMAD1 response was observed at the colony edge, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence results and our discovery that the TGFβ receptors are localized to the apical surface only at the border of the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). In our previous work we quantified the SMAD1 response detected by immunofluorescence as the number of positive nuclei within the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). Although our reporter line allows us to track the level of nuclear SMAD1 in individual cells, as opposed to a binary on/off quantification, we obtain similar results to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> with a binary analysis of the RFP-SMAD1 reporter line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). In response to ACTIVIN, SMAD2 on the other hand, responded only transiently: a pulse of nuclear translocation over the first 1–2 hr was followed by a gradual decrease over the next 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>). Interestingly, the long-term SMAD2 nuclear level did not return completely to the pre-stimulus level. As in the case of SMAD1, the SMAD2 response was highest at the colony edge, again consistent with the apical localization of the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-cell response dynamics reflect the behavior at the edge of gastruloids</title><p>In order to study signaling dynamics at the single-cell level and to eliminate modifier influences on both SMAD branches coming from neighboring cells within the micropatterned colony, we performed the same experiment on dissociated cells grown under regular culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The SMAD1 response to BMP was stable and the level of nuclear RFP-SMAD1 was dependent on the BMP4 ligand concentration in agreement with previous single-cell immunofluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). The increase in the average nuclear signal as a function of time resulted from nearly all cells responding to the added BMP4, which is evident in the shift in the histogram of RFP-SMAD1 nuclear intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The SMAD2 response to ACTIVIN was again transient with a nuclear signal that remained elevated at longer times as demonstrated by our reporter line and by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of the parental RUES2 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). This is consistent with other data based on immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heemskerk et al., 2017</xref>). Although, the adaptive response is somewhat more pronounced in our experimental setup. As with the SMAD1 response, the average SMAD2 response resulted from nearly all cells responding with similar dynamics, which is evident in the shift up and down in the histogram of SMAD2 nuclear intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The SMAD2 peak response displayed a strong sigmoidal dependence on ACTIVIN concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, the post-stimulation baseline, defined as the average SMAD2 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio at T &gt; 8 hr after ACTIVIN addition, as well as the time scale of the transient response, was not dependent on the ACTIVIN dose above 0.5 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). This transient SMAD2 signaling behavior did not result from depletion of ACTIVIN from the medium, as culture medium recovered from cells that were incubated with ACTIVIN for 12 hr, still induced a SMAD2 response when presented to unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). SMAD4 followed the dynamics of the relevant R-SMADs following presentation of BMP4 or ACTIVIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The stable and adaptive responses of SMAD4 to BMP and ACTIVIN, respectively, is consistent with recent experiments that also utilized this reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nemashkalo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heemskerk et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in response to their activating ligands, the two branches of the TGFβ pathway display distinct dynamics of signal transduction for both the R-SMAD and the co-SMAD. This also demonstrates that modifying signals do not influence the dynamics of the response at the edge of the micropatterned colonies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38279.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BMP and ACTIVIN elicit different single-cell SMAD response dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic outlining the single-cell experimental protocol.

When presented to isolated animal cap explants that normally give rise only to ectoderm, ACTIVIN was sufficient to induce different types of mesendodermal cells based on its concentration, and was thus qualified in principle as a morphogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green and Smith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson and Melton, 1994</xref>). When the ACTIVIN receptors and the SMAD pathways were characterized in 1990 s, it was shown that micro-injection of different amounts of synthetic mRNAs encoding SMAD2 into <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal caps, also recapitulates the mesendodermal-inducing effects of A ACTIVIN morphogen presentation, independently confirming that the activation of different thresholds of the pathway was sufficient for mesoderm induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimizu and Gurdon, 1999</xref>). Inhibition of the pathway by microinjection of a dominant negative type II ACTIVIN receptor into <italic>Xenopus</italic> blastula led to complete loss of mesendodermal derivatives, demonstrating that ACTIVIN/SMAD2 signaling was necessary for mesoderm induction in the amphibian embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Loss-of-function analysis in the mouse later confirmed the frog conclusions about the pathway as SMAD2/3 double knockout mice failed to properly induce mesendoderm and gastrulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>). However another TGFβ ligand, NODAL, rather than ACTIVIN was shown to be the inducer in the mammalian embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conlon et al., 1994</xref>). Elegant genetic experiments also performed in the mouse placed NODAL signaling in a positive feedback loop that drives gastrulation. The loop is initiated when NODAL signaling induces BMP4 expression in the extra-embryonic ectoderm. BMP signaling subsequently induces WNT3 expression, which in turn induces high levels of NODAL in the proximal-posterior part of the embryo, which marks the site of primitive streak initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Using live reporters of SMAD1, SMAD2 and SMAD4, we find that BMP/SMAD1 signaling is stable, ACTIVIN/SMAD2 signaling is transient (or adaptive), and that co-SMAD4 follows the dynamics of the receptor-associated SMADs. In response to ACTIVIN, hESCs transiently induce mesendodermal gene expression, without generating mesendodermal fates, and the cells return to the state of pluripotency. However, the expression of ACTIVIN/NODAL inhibitors remained elevated and plausibly buffer the additional ACTIVIN, as expected from prior theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">François and Siggia, 2008</xref>). Pre-presentation of WNT, however, stabilizes transcription and fate acquisition without modifying SMAD2 dynamics. Thus, a transient signaling response is compatible with a stable change in cell fate, as shown previously in a murine myoblast cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sorre et al., 2014</xref>). Both pluripotency maintenance and mesendodermal fate acquisition are not affected by the loss of SMAD3. Our data provide evidence for a previously undetected level of signal integration that implies the presence of a cellular memory. This memory operates not at the level of the SMAD2 signaling dynamics but by some other means to change the response of the cells to ACTIVIN. It is tempting to speculate that it might be mediated through epigenetic mechanisms, in a manner similar to what has been described in <italic>Xenopus</italic> experiments where β-catenin recruits PrMT2 to induce dorsal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blythe et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The ACTIVIN/SMAD2 pathway has been shown to be necessary for maintenance of pluripotency, but not sufficient to induce mesendoderm in hESCs, except when influenced by modifiers of other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Funa et al., 2015</xref>). Our study shows that mere pre-treatment of hESCs with WNT, endows them with a memory that enables a graded response to subsequently applied ACTIVIN; simultaneous exposure to WNT and ACTIVIN is not required. Furthermore, the WNT treatment alone is not sufficient to elicit a stable fate change since in minimal media, without ACTIVIN, the cells revert to pluripotency. The ability of embryonic cells to record WNT signals may be a broadly conserved and fundamental aspect of animal development, as shown by elegant experiments in <italic>Drosophilia</italic> where the authors demonstrate a morphogen effect for Dpp (a BMP homologue) after cells have lost contact with the source of WNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the context of vertebrate development, our findings force the reevaluation of the traditional literature regarding the sufficiency of the ACTIVIN/SMAD2 pathway for mesendodermal induction and patterning. A review of the evidence in model systems for the ACTIVIN/NODAL mediated morphogen effect reveals that in all the experimental settings, at least some of the cells were either still under the influence, or had been previously exposed to WNT signaling before or during ACTIVIN/NODAL signaling. For example, cells of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap derived from the blastula stage embryo have been under maternal WNT influence as early as the two-cell stage, hours before ACTIVIN is presented to the explants. This influence is the consequence of cortical rotation that occurs after sperm entry, and activates the WNT pathway on the dorsal side of the embryo, as evidenced by the dorsal-specific nuclear localization of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schneider et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larabell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rowning et al., 1997</xref>). It is clear from the asymmetric elongation of the animal cap explants in response to ACTIVIN that the prior WNT exposure sets up a dorsal-ventral pre-pattern that affects the response. It is also clear that the dorsal and ventral regions of the animal cap when separated respond differently to ACTIVIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokol and Melton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolce et al., 1992</xref>). Although some mesoderm is induced in the ventral caps, only cells of the dorsal cap that have seen WNT signals undergo ACTIVIN-mediated induction of GSC + mesendoderm. These experiments demonstrate that both pathways are required for complete mesendodermal patterning without explicitly distinguishing their temporal relationship.</p><p>Our study revises this point of view by bringing a temporal order. We suggest that only cells endowed with a WNT memory can respond to ACTIVIN to specify the full range of mesendodermal fates. Even in the extensively studied <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, it is still debated whether in the late blastula stage marginal zone, prior to the onset of gastrulation, an ACTIVIN/NODAL gradient already defines the medial to lateral mesendodermal fates or whether there is simply a bipartite division into dorsal organizer and ventral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harland and Gerhart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith, 2009</xref>). This debate also translates into whether ACTIVIN/NODAL is sufficient to pre-pattern the mesendoderm or whether complete patterning requires prior WNT exposure present only in the dorsal part of the embryo. Controversies persist, since the embryo is rapidly developing, there are no live reporters of signaling, and fates are often assayed in early gastrulation rather than in the late blastula. In the mouse the earliest manifestation of the streak is the proximal-posterior expression of WNT, which extends distally. By mid-streak stage, NODAL signaling is highest in the Node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tam and Loebel, 2007</xref>). Thus, cells that leave the streak at various proximal-distal positions and NODAL levels, manifestly have been exposed to WNT first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam and Behringer, 1997</xref>). This interpretation, however, does not eliminate the co-requirement for ACTIVIN and WNT, but rather suggests that instructive WNT, required for mesendodermal differentiation, occurs temporally up-stream of ACTIVIN/SMAD2 signaling.</p><p>In conclusion, a cellular memory of WNT signaling, endows embryonic cells, including hESCs, with the competence to maintain ACTIVIN/SMAD2-mediated mesendodermal fate specification and patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, XX)</td><td>RUES2</td><td>US National Institutes of Health, human ESC registry</td><td>human ESC registry no. 0013;

Total cellular RNA for each sample was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and 2 ug of total RNA was used to prepare each individual RNA-seq library. RNA-seq library construction was conducted with the TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 apparatus. Raw reads were mapped to hg19 using STAR aligner, and the gene read counts were normalized using the DESeq2 Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Library preparation, sequencing, and mapping were performed by the New York Genome Center (New York, NY, USA). All raw data files are available from the GEO database (accession number GSE111717).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis</title><p>For images acquired from micropatterned cell culture experiments, stitching and colony detection were carried out as described previously using custom software written in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). For analysis of the SMAD reporter lines on micropatterned colonies a single z-plane through the middle of the colony was analyzed at each time point. Background in each channel was removed by subtracting a minimum intensity image that was generated by taking the minimum value at each pixel over all images in that channel in the same z-plane. Vignetting was corrected by dividing by a flat-field image that was generated by normalizing the intensity of the minimum image to 1. This procedure corrects the intensity drop-off at the border of the images without further altering the average image intensity.</p><p>Nuclei segmentation and signal quantification were performed on the corrected images as follows. The H2B image was thresholded to generate a binary image separating the foreground (nuclei) from the background. The original, corrected H2B image was then filtered with a median and sphere filter with parameters matching the expected size of individual nuclei. Local maxima corresponding to individual nuclei were detected using the MATLAB extended-maxima transform function. Maxima were dilated to increase the likelihood of obtaining a single maximum per nuclei. Maxima falling within the foreground were used as seeds for watershed segmentation, which was also restricted to the foreground and was used to obtain a labeled object corresponding to each nucleus within the image. The segmented objects were further processed to eliminate objects much larger or smaller than the expected size of individual nuclei. The results of the segmentation were used as a mask to obtain the median per cell nuclear intensity in each channel. Images acquired from fixed samples that were stained by immunofluorescence were similarly segmented and analyzed. The DAPI channel was used to perform nuclei segmentation, and the segmented objects were subsequently used to obtain the median per cell signal intensity in each channel.</p><p>For the mCitrine-SMAD2 reporter line an enrichment of the mCitrine signal in the cytoplasm relative to the nucleus prior to ligand presentation could be detected, which decreased concomitantly with an increase in the nuclear signal following ACTIVIN presentation. Therefore, the mCitrine-SMAD2 response was quantified as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, which was used previously as a readout for TGFβ pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warmflash et al., 2012</xref>). In order to estimate the cytoplasmic signal for each cell, a narrow donut surrounding the nuclear mask was formed by dilating the nuclear mask once by an inner radius and a second time by an outer radius and subtracting the first dilated object from the second. The donut, which formed the cytoplasmic mask, was not restricted to the foreground pixels (H2B signal), but it was prevented from overlapping with the masks of neighboring nuclei. The median mCitrine intensity within the nuclear mask was divided by the median intensity within the cytoplasmic mask on a per cell basis. The qualitative behavior of the SMAD2 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic response was not sensitive to the exact size of the inner and outer radius of the donut. Therefore, the values were chosen manually and kept fixed throughout all analyses. For the RFP-SMAD1 reporter line a faint nuclear signal could be detected prior to ligand presentation. However, no cytoplasmic signal could be detected above the background. Therefore, the RFP-SMAD1 response was quantified as the median nuclear signal normalized to the median H2B signal to normalize for cells moving in and out of the z-plane. In order to analyze the SMAD response as a function of radial position within the micropatterned colonies, the cells within a single colony were binned based on the radial position of their center and the average response per cell within each bin was calculated. The radial profile for individual colonies was then averaged over several colonies. Analysis of the SMAD reporter lines in single-cell culture was carried out in a similar manner. The maximum intensity projection image, rather than a single z-plane was analyzed. Since cells remained flat under these conditions it was not necessary to normalize the SMAD1 signal by H2B.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNAseq analysis and clustering</title><p>For each gene, a baseline expression profile, which was calculated using a linear interpolation between the 0, 6 and 12 hr control samples, was subtracted from the expression values of the ACTIVIN-treated samples. The gene list was filtered to contain only those genes that: (1) had at least one time point with an absolute fold-change larger than 2 (up- or down-regulated) compared to 0 hr and (2) had at least one time point with a normalized read count higher than 100. That generated a list of 3529 genes of interest, which was then hierarchically clustered by their z-scored expression values, using Cluster 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Hoon et al., 2004</xref>) with the following options: centered correlation as the similarity metric and average linkage as clustering method.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;WNT signaling memory is required for ACTIVIN to function as a morphogen in human gastruloids&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work described in this manuscript is based on the manipulation of a very useful in vitro human &quot;gastruloid&quot; system that the Brivanlou and Siggis labs have developed. In this case, experiments are directed at clarifying the interactions between WNT and ACTIVIN signaling that serve to regulate the transition between pluripotency and differentiation. The main conclusion is that a relatively brief exposure to a WNT ligand modifies pluripotent cells such that they respond by differentiating when subsequently treated with ACTIVIN under conditions normally insufficient to trigger differentiation. That is, the &quot;memory&quot; of WNT signaling changes the response to ACTIVIN.</p><p>General Assessment:</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly enthusiastic about the quality of the work in the manuscript, as well as its potential for clarifying some aspects of signaling during early development, particularly early human development. The reviewers' comments fall into two general categories. The first requires some additional experiments to clarify some details of the quantification applied to your imaging results and the use of small molecule inhibitors. The second asks for some revisions in the text and, perhaps, some changes in the manner in which certain of your conclusions are stated.</p><p>Required revisions requiring additional work:</p><p>Use of reagents and quantification:</p><p>1) Can the authors clarify the effects of small molecules singly and in combination on the total number of cells to determine if there were any effects related to toxicity?</p><p>2) Figure 2D, G; Figure 3C, E, G: Isn't the relevant metric the number of cells with positive nuclear stain?</p><p>3) Subsection “Single-cell response dynamics reflect the behavior at the edge of gastruloids”: Can the authors clarify how they define SMAD2 baseline and, therefore, how they determine the percent of cells above baseline?</p><p>4) Subsection “WNT memory stabilizes the mesendodermal transcriptional response to ACTIVIN”, first paragraph and Figure 7: What is the evidence that IWP-2 continues to block WNT secretion for 48 hrs?</p><p>Other aspects of data interpretation/metrics:</p><p>1) The conclusion that ACTIVIN alone does not induce mesoderm relies on just three markers (BRA, EOMES and GSC) and the persistence of some markers associated with pluripotency (yet most do not seem very specific to a pluripotent state, they resemble more of an ACTIVIN response). Is there additional evidence for lack of mesoderm induction by ACTIVIN alone (perhaps in the RNA-seq data)? The lack of induction is at odds with the ability of ACTIVIN, NODAL or NODAL/Vg1 alone to induce non-organizer mesoderm in the absence of a β-catenin signal in amphibian (animal cap) and mammalian cells. The authors discuss this important point but is the apparent discrepancy between systems due to the inability to separate endogenous WNT from ACTIVIN/NODAL/Vg signals or possibly an evolutionary difference between mammalian and non-mammalian systems? How similar is mesendoderm induced by WNT+ACTIVIN to &quot;natural&quot; mammalian (mouse) or even nonmammalian mesendoderm? It seems gene expression data associated with Figure 4 could be compared to published datasets or previous characterizations.</p><p>2) Can the authors detail how many biological replicates underpin each major experiment?</p><p>Revisions that do not require additional experiments:</p><p>1) Why was ACTIVIN used as the agent to induce SMAD2 signaling in the experiments? Is not NODAL(s) the more relevant ligand &quot;in vivo&quot;? Certainly real human embryos are off limits to providing a direct answer, but in hESCs are endogenous ACTIVIN or NODAL genes induced by mesendoderm-initiating WNT (or BMP) treatment? ACTIVIN and NODAL ligands are often used interchangeably to affect SMAD2/3 signaling in vertebrate embryonic cells or ESCs, but these different ligands can produce different effects, so a brief rationale for using ACTIVIN and not NODAL would be welcome.</p><p>2) The authors should temper &quot;conclusions&quot; that go beyond the data presented. The authors tend to rule out SMAD3 engagement in the ACTIVIN response perhaps over-weighting the SMAD3 mutant studies. However, is there anything to rule out a simple redundancy between SMAD2/3 where either contributes? Insight from SMAD2 and SMAD2/3 mutant hESCs which are presumably on hand would help to settle this. The authors state &quot;Overall we conclude that cells maintain a memory of WNT exposure which makes them competent to differentiate in response to ACTIVIN (Figure 7E).&quot; this seems quite reasonable. However, the authors go on to write in the last sentence of the Results &quot;The molecular mechanism of this memory occurs through β-catenin-induced transcriptional changes as a modifier of SMAD2 signaling dynamics&quot;. There is nothing to directly back this up: β-catenin was never studied, WNT transcriptional actions were not directly addressed, and the sentence is best deleted and possible mechanisms with supporting evidence left for discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38279.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Required revisions requiring additional work:</p><p>Use of reagents and quantification:</p><p>1) Can the authors clarify the effects of small molecules singly and in combination on the total number of cells to determine if there were any effects related to toxicity?</p></disp-quote><p>No toxicity effect was observed on the total number of cells with any of the small molecules, SB (10 µM), endo-IWR1 (1 µM), or IWP2 (1 µM).

To determine the number of positive nuclei requires a binary threshold, which discards data about the levels of the SMAD response that we can obtain from our live reporters. In all of our datasets, with the exception of SMAD1 on micropatterned colonies, the SMAD response is not binary and single cells respond with dynamics that are similar to the average response. This can be seen as a shift in the distribution (or histogram) of the response across all cells. We should have presented this data in our original manuscript. We have now added it in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. In the experiments in which we followed the SMAD1 response in micropatterned colonies, we were able to determine an on/off threshold. Therefore, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we also quantified the number of SMAD1 positive cells and found results that are qualitatively similar to those presented in Figure 2D in which we present the average nuclear intensity as a function of time and position within the colony. This additional quantification is also now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Single-cell response dynamics reflect the behavior at the edge of gastruloids”: Can the authors clarify how they define SMAD2 baseline and, therefore, how they determine the percent of cells above baseline?</p></disp-quote><p>We should have been more precise in our definition of the baseline. The baseline is defined by the average SMAD2 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio at T &gt; 8 h after ACTIVIN presentation. This definition was previously included in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and it has now been added to the Results subs “Single-cell response dynamics reflect the behavior at the edge of gastruloids”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “WNT memory stabilizes the mesendodermal transcriptional response to ACTIVIN”, first paragraph and Figure 7: What is the evidence that IWP-2 continues to block WNT secretion for 48 hrs?</p></disp-quote><p>The original paper reporting IWP2 (Chen et al., 2009) demonstrated complete inhibition of WNT by 24 hours of compound exposure in mammalian cells. In hESCs specifically (Blauwkamp et al., 2012), presenting IWP-2 and replacing it every 24 hours was also shown to completely inhibit WNT. We also replaced the IWP-2 every 24 hours, following previously published protocols, and this has been clarified in the Results subsection “WNT memory stabilizes the mesendodermal transcriptional response to ACTIVIN”, and in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>In order to verify that the IWP-2 was functioning to block endogenous WNT at 1 µM, we tested it in a side-by-side experiment, in which micropatterned colonies were treated with BMP4 +/- IWP-2 (1 µM). In this context, mesendoderm is dependent on endogenous WNT production and signaling (Martyn et al., 2018). We find that mesendoderm is blocked by 1 µM IWP-2 in BMP4-treated micropatterned colonies. This data is presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other aspects of data interpretation/metrics:</p><p>1) The conclusion that ACTIVIN alone does not induce mesoderm relies on just three markers (BRA, EOMES and GSC) and the persistence of some markers associated with pluripotency (yet most do not seem very specific to a pluripotent state, they resemble more of an ACTIVIN response). Is there additional evidence for lack of mesoderm induction by ACTIVIN alone (perhaps in the RNA-seq data)? The lack of induction is at odds with the ability of ACTIVIN, NODAL or NODAL/Vg1 alone to induce non-organizer mesoderm in the absence of a β-catenin signal in amphibian (animal cap) and mammalian cells. The authors discuss this important point but is the apparent discrepancy between systems due to the inability to separate endogenous WNT from ACTIVIN/NODAL/Vg signals or possibly an evolutionary difference between mammalian and non-mammalian systems? How similar is mesendoderm induced by WNT+ACTIVIN to &quot;natural&quot; mammalian (mouse) or even nonmammalian mesendoderm. It seems gene expression data associated with Figure 4 could be compared to published datasets or previous characterizations.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s advice, to further rule out mesoderm induction in our ACTIVIN only stimulation, we have also verified that canonical mammalian mesodermal markers such as HAND1, EVX1, MESP1, MESP2, MSGN, and TBX6 are not induced (Figure 4—source data 2). We take the oddity of lack of mesoderm induction by ACTIVIN alone in our system wholeheartedly, as we appreciate the importance of evaluating the relevance of our synthetic in vitro platform in modeling “natural” embryos. As the reviewer(s) has noted we address this important point in our Discussion section. We argue that while we cannot eliminate possible evolutionary differences in the fine-tuning of mesendodermal induction, we believe that our findings are in support of the classical experimental embryological discoveries made in the amphibian system. We state that “Although some mesoderm is induced in the ventral animal cap explants of <italic>Xenopus</italic>, only cells of the dorsal caps that have seen Wnt signals undergoes ACTIVIN-mediated induction of GSC+ mesendoderm”. This is in agreement with our “cellular memory” of WNT signaling in our system.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we additionally compared our RNA-seq dataset presented in Figure 4 with the tissue specific RNA-seq datasets of mouse embryos at E7.5 (Lu et al., 2018). This comparison showed that from the 3 groups defined in Figure 4, group 1 (transient induction following ACTIVIN presentation) displays the largest representation of endodermal genes, with 129 genes, out of 2,956 total in group 1, overlapping with the mouse endoderm gene set. This data along with the fact that GSC is induced under the WNT/ACTIVIN condition (RT-PCR and IF) suggests our mesendoderm is of dorso-anterior character. Group 2 (genes that are stably induced following ACTIVIN presentation) showed some enrichment of both endodermal (27) and mesodermal (15) genes, out of 452 total in group 2. Group 3 (genes that are down-regulated following ACTIVIN presentation) matched most closely primitive ectoderm/epiblast (5 genes), out of 121 total in group 3. This information has now been added to Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and the lists of overlapping genes have been added as Figure 4—source data 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors detail how many biological replicates underpin each major experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Two or more biological replicates were performed for each major experiment. This information was added to the figure legends.</p><p>Since the absolute intensity measurements from immunofluorescence can vary between experiments performed on different days, we only directly compared samples processed at the same time and these are presented as the nuclear intensity histograms shown on a single plot. In order to facilitate comparison across biological replicates processed and imaged on different days, we calculated the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the cumulative distribution functions of each condition to a defined reference condition as described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Long-term, elevated SMAD2 baseline maintains pluripotency”. The cumulative distribution function is calculated from the fluorescence intensity histogram. This type of analysis is robust to changes in imaging parameters, as long as the parameters are fixed between different conditions and their corresponding reference condition. Statistical tests were performed on KS distance estimates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions that do not require additional experiments:</p><p>1) Why was ACTIVIN used as the agent to induce SMAD2 signaling in the experiments? Is not NODAL(s) the more relevant ligand &quot;in vivo&quot;? Certainly real human embryos are off limits to providing a direct answer, but in hESCs are endogenous ACTIVIN or NODAL genes induced by mesendoderm-initiating WNT (or BMP) treatment? ACTIVIN and NODAL ligands are often used interchangeably to affect SMAD2/3 signaling in vertebrate embryonic cells or ESCs, but these different ligands can produce different effects, so a brief rationale for using ACTIVIN and not NODAL would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer(s) is correct: the more relevant ligand “in vivo” in the mouse embryo is NODAL. Additionally, we have shown in Etoc et al. (2016) that BMP4 induces NODAL, in Martyn et al. (2018) that WNT induces NODAL, and in our present study that ACTIVIN also induces NODAL in a stable manner. We and others choose to use ACTIVIN rather than NODAL, because although both ligands differentiate hESCs towards the mesendoderm lineage, NODAL requires much higher concentrations to be effective (McLean et al., 2007). Following, the reviewer’s recommendation we have now included this rational in the last paragraph of the Materials and methods subsection “Micropatterned cell culture”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should temper &quot;conclusions&quot; that go beyond the data presented. The authors tend to rule out SMAD3 engagement in the ACTIVIN response perhaps over-weighting the SMAD3 mutant studies. However, is there anything to rule out a simple redundancy between SMAD2/3 where either contributes? Insight from SMAD2 and SMAD2/3 mutant hESCs which are presumably on hand would help to settle this. The authors state &quot;Overall we conclude that cells maintain a memory of WNT exposure which makes them competent to differentiate in response to ACTIVIN (Figure 7E).&quot; this seems quite reasonable. However, the authors go on to write in the last sentence of the Results &quot;The molecular mechanism of this memory occurs through β-catenin-induced transcriptional changes as a modifier of SMAD2 signaling dynamics&quot;. There is nothing to directly back this up: β-catenin was never studied, WNT transcriptional actions were not directly addressed, and the sentence is best deleted and possible mechanisms with supporting evidence left for discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer(s) for pointing out two overreaching statements. First, it is correct that while our RUES2-SMAD3<sup>-/-</sup> mutant does not change the response to ACTIVIN, we cannot rule out possible redundancy between SMAD2 and 3. We have, therefore, included this possibility in our interpretation in the subsection “SMAD3 is dispensable for the response of the adaptive and stable gene classes to ACTIVIN”. Second, while we show that endo-IWR-1, which blocks WNT signaling at the level of β-catenin, does eliminate ACTIVIN-mediated mesendoderm induction, we did not provide <italic>direct</italic> evidence that the molecular mechanism underlying the memory occurs through β-catenin-induced transcriptional changes. Thus, we removed the sentence quoted by the reviewer from the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
