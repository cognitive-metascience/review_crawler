Yet, because forces are invisible, mapping tensile stress patterns in tissues remains a major challenge in all kingdoms. Here we take advantage of the adhesion defects in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant <italic>quasimodo1 (qua1)</italic> to deduce stress patterns in tissues. By reducing the water potential and epidermal tension <italic>in planta</italic>, we rescued the adhesion defects in <italic>qua1</italic>, formally associating gaping and tensile stress patterns in the mutant. Using suboptimal water potential conditions, we revealed the relative contributions of shape- and growth-derived stress in prescribing maximal tension directions in aerial tissues. Consistently, the tension patterns deduced from the gaping patterns in <italic>qua1</italic> matched the pattern of cortical microtubules, which are thought to align with maximal tension, in wild-type organs. Conversely, loss of epidermis continuity in the <italic>qua1</italic> mutant hampered supracellular microtubule alignments, revealing that coordination through tensile stress requires cell-cell adhesion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34460.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The parts of a plant that protrude from the ground are constantly shaken by the wind, applying forces to the plant that it must be able to resist. Indeed, mechanical forces are crucial for the development, growth and life of all organisms and can trigger certain behaviours or the production of particular molecules: for example, forces that bend a plant trigger gene activity that ultimately makes the stem more rigid.</p><p>Mechanical forces can also originate from inside the organism. For example, the epidermal cells that cover the surface of a plant are placed under tension by the cells in the underlying layers of the plant as they grow and expand. The exact pattern of forces in the plant epidermis was not known because they cannot be directly seen, although scientists have tried to map them using theoretical and computational modeling.</p><p>A mutant form of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant is unable to produce some of the molecules that allow epidermal cells to adhere to each other. Verger et al. placed the mutants in different growth conditions that lowered the pressure inside the plant, and consequently reduced the tension on the epidermal cells. This partly restored the ability of epidermal cells to adhere to each other, although gaps remained between cells in regions of the plant that have been predicted to be under high levels of tension. Verger et al. could therefore use the patterns of the gaps to map the forces across the epidermis, opening the path for the study of the role of these forces in plant development.</p><p>Further experiments showed that cell adhesion defects prevent the epidermal cells from coordinating how they respond to mechanical forces. There is therefore a feedback loop in the plant epidermis: cell-cell connections transmit tension across the epidermis, and, in turn, tension is perceived by the cells to alter the strength of those connections.</p><p>The results presented by Verger et al. suggest that plants use tension to monitor the adhesion in the cell layer that forms an interface with the environment. Other organisms may use similar processes; this theory is supported by the fact that sheets of animal cells use proteins that are involved in both cell-cell adhesion and the detection of tension. The next challenge is to analyse how tension in the epidermis affects developmental processes and how a plant responds to its environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanical stress</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>plant organs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-CoG-615739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamant</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 168-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Yuchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2012-StG-307387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boudaoud</surname><given-names>Arezki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tensile stress patterns in tissues are revealed by cell-cell adhesion defects; in turn, cell responses to supracellular tension require cell-cell adhesion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As our understanding of the role of forces in development deepens, assessing accurate stress patterns in tissues has become increasingly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2017</xref>). Stress patterns can be revealed through three approaches: 1- Computational models, for example with spring networks or finite elements, with relevant assumptions on tissue mechanics for animal (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>]) and plant (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozorg et al., 2014</xref>]) systems, 2- Strain measurements following local cuts at the subcellular (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>]) or organ (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumais and Steele, 2000</xref>]) scale, 3- Strain measurement of deformable objects (e.g. FRET-based molecular strain sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freikamp et al., 2017</xref>], oil microdroplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campàs et al., 2014</xref>], elastomeric force sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolfenson et al., 2016</xref>]). Previous work on animal single cells showed that hyperosmotic media can affect membrane tension and thus the molecular effectors of cell migration, like actin filaments, RAC activity or WAVE complex, suggesting that the corresponding mutants could be rescued by a modification of the osmotic conditions of the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batchelder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Houk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asnacios and Hamant, 2012</xref>). Consistently, adding sorbitol in growth media is sufficient to rescue defects in yeast endocytic mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2014</xref>). Here we take inspiration from these single cell studies and apply the same logic at the multicellular scale. Using an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant with severe cell adhesion defects, we partially rescue these defects by modifying the water potential of the growth medium and we deduce the maximal direction of tension in tissues from the gaping pattern following growth, without any external intervention.</p><p>In plants, cell adhesion is achieved through the deposition of a pectin-rich middle lamella between contiguous cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orfila et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daher and Braybrook, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Willats et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chebli and Geitmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jarvis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knox, 1992</xref>). <italic>QUASIMODO1</italic> (<italic>QUA1</italic>) encodes a glycosyltransferase that is required for pectin synthesis and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mouille et al., 2007</xref>). Here we reasoned that the resulting cell-cell gaps may in principle reveal the stress pattern in tissues. Yet, it has not been formally demonstrated that gap opening could be related to tissue tension. Furthermore, the severe defects in the mutant make it hard to deduce a stress pattern in such distorted tissues. We thus developed a protocol amenable to partially rescue the adhesion defect through water potential modulation, allowing us to relate adhesion to tissue tension on the one hand, and deduce a pattern of stress in various plant tissues on the other hand. This mutant also allowed us to investigate how the loss of adhesion affects the propagation of mechanical stress and thus tension-dependent cell-cell coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adhesion defects in <italic>qua1</italic> mutants depend on the water potential of the growth medium</title><p>The <italic>quasimodo1 (qua1)</italic> and <italic>qua2</italic> mutants, respectively mutated in a galacturonosyltransferase and a pectin methyltransferase, are both required for the synthesis of a fraction of the cell wall pectins.

To test whether this phenotype also correlates with the medium water potential, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> grown seedlings to modulate the matrix potential of the growth medium. We also supplemented the medium with NPA, an inhibitor of polar auxin transport and floral organogenesis, to produce naked meristems that are more amenable to visualization and quantification (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sassi et al., 2014</xref>]).

However, when grown on 2.5% agar medium, longitudinal stripes of bright propidium iodide staining were observed in the <italic>qua1-1</italic> mutant stems; such signal could not be detected in the wild type in the same growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Some of these stripes developed further into cracks between adjacent cells later on, confirming that the stripes correspond to slight separations between adjacent cells where propidium iodide can accumulate, due to the opening of the cuticle at cell junctions and likely unpacking of the cell wall polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In order to quantify these orientations more precisely, we used our cell separation image analysis pipeline, this time focusing on the orientation of cell separation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

In hypocotyls, cell separations happened in several orientations, leading to epidermal cell naturally peeling out of the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This pattern is thus not consistent with the pressure vessel model in which stress depends only on shape. To explain this discrepancy, we explore the possible contribution of growth-derived stress: the anisotropic expansion of the inner tissues would pull the load-bearing epidermis longitudinally, thus exerting a longitudinal tensile stress on the epidermis (for predictions of longitudinal stress patterns in growing cylindrical organs, see for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baskin and Jensen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vandiver and Goriely, 2008</xref>]).</p><p>To go beyond this qualitative assessment, we next focused on dark-grown hypocotyls, since they display a well characterized gradient of growth during their elongation, in which cells closest to the root (rootward) have already extensively elongated and are undergoing growth arrest, cells more toward the middle are rapidly elongating, and cells at the top (shootward) and in the apical hook are only starting to elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gendreau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastien et al., 2016</xref>]).

When grown on 1% agar, cell separation patterns were so extensive in dark-grown <italic>qua1-1</italic> hypocotyls that the cell separation patterns could not be quantified properly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). When grown on 2.5% agar, we could identify discrete cell separations happening almost exclusively transversely to the axis of dark-grown <italic>qua1-1</italic> hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Yet, the presence of cells peeling off suggests that longitudinal cell-cell separation also occurs along the longitudinal axis, likely after the initial transverse separations. Interestingly, this is not consistent with the hypothesis that older cell walls separate first, since all epidermal walls in the hypocotyl have the same age after embryogenesis.</p><p>To check whether this pattern depends on mechano-chemical polarities in the anticlinal epidermal cell wall, we next overexpressed <italic>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR 5</italic> (<italic>PMEI5</italic>) in <italic>qua1-1</italic>, reasoning that <italic>PMEI</italic> overexpression should reduce heterogeneity of pectin esterification in the hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peaucelle et al., 2015</xref>).

As also shown before in <italic>PMEI</italic> overexpressor lines, we observed an increased twisting in the <italic>qua1-1 p35S::PMEI5</italic> line. Yet, we could not detect significant differences in the gaping pattern between dark-grown <italic>qua1-1</italic> and <italic>qua1-1 p35S::PMEI5</italic> hypocotyls, further confirming that the gaping pattern primarily results from the tension pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The gaps in dark-grown hypocotyls were too large for our image analysis pipeline to precisely discern cell separation orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We thus manually counted the number of events of cell separations that happened either at the transverse or longitudinal junction between adjacent cells. In thirteen images from individual hypocotyls, we counted on average about 11 events of cell separation per image. In total, we found 135 events in which cells had separated along their shared transverse wall, and nine events in which they had separated along their shared longitudinal wall. However, among these nine events, seven were related to an adjacent event of transverse cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), while only two events were strictly longitudinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

We reasoned that, in light conditions, the reduction of elongation should decrease the extent of gap opening in <italic>qua1-1</italic>, while growth anisotropy would still prescribe longitudinal growth-derived stress. As in dark-grown hypocotyls, when grown on 1% agar, cell separation patterns were so extensive in light-grown <italic>qua1-1</italic> hypocotyls that the cell separation patterns could not be quantified properly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). When grown on 2.5% agar, transverse gaps were detected in light-grown <italic>qua1-1</italic> hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). In contrast to dark-grown hypocotyls, we almost only observed slight cell separations in light-grown hypocotyls, as marked by bright propidium iodide staining, consistent with reduced elongation. Because the gaps were much smaller, we could use our pipeline and measured a mean <italic>θ</italic><sub>G</sub> of 5 ± 30° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 8 samples). A similar response was observed in the <italic>qua1-1 PMEI-OE</italic> line, consistent with the pattern primarily resulting from growth-derived stress, and not from heterogeneities of pectin esterification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our quantifications support the idea that transverse shape-derived tensile stress dominates in the stem apex epidermis, whereas longitudinal growth-derived stress dominates in the elongating hypocotyl epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A mechanical conflict at the petiole-blade junction of the cotyledon</title><p>Next we investigated the gaping pattern in <italic>qua1-1</italic> cotyledons where more complex shape and growth patterns occur. In comparison to stems and hypocotyls, cotyledon growth occurs mainly in 2D and is rather isotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Using our pipeline, we analyzed cell separation orientation, focusing on cotyledons at a very young stage (3-day old) in order to observe very early cell separations before gaps become too large. No preferential gap orientations could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Note that while an apparent bimodal distribution (with more separations happening at a 0° and 90° angle), the population of angles could be considered uniformly distributed, as assessed using the Rao’s spacing test for uniformity (non-parametric test due to the apparent bimodal distribution of the angle population, and adapted for directional data, p-value=0.5, <italic>n</italic> = 12 samples). This contrasts with the stem apex and the light grown hypocotyl cell separations, for which the test revealed a non-uniform distribution (p-value&lt;0.001 for both). To obtain a different indicator of the spread of the population of angles, we also measured the resultant vector length (<italic>R</italic>) calculated on these populations of angles. <italic>R</italic> lies between 0 and 1; the higher it is the more clustered and unidirectional are the data, while a very low value reveals no preferential orientation. <italic>R</italic> reached 0.84 and 0.70 for the stem apex and light-grown hypocotyls respectively, whereas <italic>R</italic> was equal to 0.07 for cotyledons.

The discrepancy in the extent of cell adhesion defects between blade and junction, as revealed by modulating the water potential, suggests that tensile stress is higher at the blade-petiole junction. When measuring the mechanical properties of the petiole-blade junction with AFM, we actually found that this region exhibits increased turgor pressure, apparent stiffness and surface tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, using the plasma-membrane-associated protein BREVIS RADIX LIKE 2 (BRXL2) as a polar marker, the proximal region of leaves was recently shown to exhibit increased mechanical stress-driven planar cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bringmann and Bergmann, 2017</xref>). This suggests that the predicted mechanical conflict in the petiole-blade junction of the cotyledon is also present in leaves. To check this, we analyzed the gaping pattern in the third leaf in <italic>qua1-1</italic> and found a pattern roughly similar to that of cotyledons, with longitudinal cracks at the base of the leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Interestingly, the mean anisotropy of the CMT arrays was slightly increased at the junction, when compared to the blade, consistent with the measured increased tension and mechanical conflict in that region (Mean anisotropy = 0.08 ± 0.04 (blade) vs. 0.11 ± 0.06 (junction); paired comparisons between blade and junction from each sample revealed a significant difference (always higher in junction) (Wilcoxon-test, p-values&lt;0.05) for 10 out of 12 samples in each condition). When grown on 2.5% agar medium, the biases in CMT orientation were weak, but significantly different, between the blade and in the junction (blade: mean <italic>θ</italic><sub>M</sub> = 154 ± 51°, <italic>R</italic> = 0.19, n = 639 cells in 13 cotyledons; junction: mean <italic>θ</italic><sub>M</sub> = 97 ± 45°, <italic>R</italic> = 0.28, n = 425 cells in 13 cotyledons).

In particular, CMTs were shown to be transversely oriented in the inner face of the epidermal cell at most of these stages, promoting the anisotropic expansion of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crowell et al., 2011</xref>), whereas CMTs display a puzzling behavior at the outer epidermal face: they are rotating in the top and middle part, and are longitudinal in the bottom part. Focusing on the bottom part of the hypocotyl, where cell separation was observed in <italic>qua1-1</italic>, we observed that CMTs were highly aligned longitudinally in the wild type, when grown in the same conditions as in <italic>qua1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; seedlings grown on 2.5% agar medium: Mean <italic>θ</italic><sub>M</sub> = 98 ± 6°, Mean anisotropy = 0.47 ± 0.06, <italic>R</italic> = 0.98, <italic>n</italic> = 182 cells in 12 samples), thus following the tensile stress pattern revealed by the cell separations in <italic>qua1-1</italic>.

Consistently, CMTs in light grown-hypocotyl have also been described to harbor a rotating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, when taking into account the anisotropy level of the CMT arrays (to put more weight on CMT orientations when anisotropy is high, as done throughout in this article), we revealed a significant bias towards longitudinal CMT orientations, that is parallel to the tensile stress pattern revealed by the cell separations in <italic>qua1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>, seedling grown on 2.5% agar medium: Mean <italic>θ</italic><sub>M</sub> = 113 ± 30°, Mean anisotropy = 0.25 ± 0.10, <italic>R</italic> = 0.59, <italic>n</italic> = 606 cells in 11 samples). Note that similar trends were observed for seedling grown on 1% and 2.5% agar medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,H</xref>; seedling grown on 1% agar medium: Mean <italic>θ</italic><sub>M</sub> = 109 ± 28°, Mean anisotropy = 0.21 ± 0.08, <italic>R</italic> = 0.6, <italic>n</italic> = 413 cells in seven samples). In comparison to dark-grown hypocotyls, the standard deviation was higher, anisotropy and resultant vector length were lower. Note that anisotropy and resultant vector length are describing different properties: anisotropy relates to CMT arrays in individual cells, while vector length relates to the global behavior of CMT arrays in the cell population. Thus lower anisotropy and vector length in light-grown hypocotyls indicates a global reduction of cellular and supracellular CMT alignment. Altogether, these analyses show CMTs globally follow the stress pattern inferred from the cell separations in <italic>qua1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the relation between mechanical stress and CMT orientation in the hypocotyl, we next analyzed the CMT response to ablation in this tissue. Assuming that the epidermis is under tension, ablations should disrupt pre-established stress pattern and lead to circumferential tensile stress pattern and CMT orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sampathkumar et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, reorientation of CMT arrays was observed in hypocotyls 8 hr after ablation, confirming that CMTs can align along maximal tension in hypocotyls too (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Interestingly, the CMT orientation was however not fully circumferential after ablation. In particular, we sometimes observed radial CMT orientations at the opposite edges along the longitudinal axis of the ablation site, matching the growth-derived longitudinal tensile stress pattern in the hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Conflicts between superposing mechanical stress patterns have been modeled and reported before, notably at the organ-boundary in shoot apical meristems: in that domain, the circumferential CMT orientation after ablation is also mixed, because the boundary is a site of highly anisotropic stresses (see Figure S7 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>]). If such a conflict was not present, one would expect a true circumferential CMT orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, our quantifications of the mixed CMT orientations after ablation implies that such a conflict of stress patterns is prominent in hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), further consolidating the presence of longitudinal tensile stress in the hypocotyl epidermis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34460.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Epidermis continuity is required for tensile stress propagation and supracellular alignment of cortical microtubules.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Surface signal extracted from confocal stacks of representative <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> light-grown hypocotyls.

Note that this discrepancy was also registered when calculating the CMT orientation resultant vector length for each plant individually (allowing us to compare cell populations and test whether the difference is significant): we found a mean resultant vector length for <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> samples of 0.69 ± 0.14 and 0.42 ± 0.23 for <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> and the populations were significantly different (<italic>t</italic>-test p-value=0.012).</p><p>Our analysis quantifying the coordination of CMTs across the whole tissue shows that cells in <italic>qua1-1</italic> hypocotyls are less coordinated across the tissue than in the wild type. The presence of cracks may be the main reason for this response: cracks generate local perturbations in the stress pattern, such that CMTs tend to reorganize around these cracks, as shown for cell ablations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref> and e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>]). In turn, the actual cell-to-cell coordination does not seem to be affected when two neighboring cells are still attached. Consistently, the anisotropy of CMTs in <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> was not decreased compared to the wild type. In many instances the anisotropy of CMT arrays was higher in <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> and CMTs were somehow oriented following the contours of large gaps, thus apparently following a new tension pattern allowed by the continuity of the cells where they are still adhesive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,L–N</xref>). Our analysis thus reveals that local cell separations lead to the loss of the tissue-scale organization of the CMTs that is usually found in the wild-type. Therefore, while these data further support a scenario in which epidermis continuity is required for supracellular CMT behavior, the cell-cell separations are too strong to conclude.</p><p>When grown on 2.5% agar medium, the wild type and <italic>qua1-1</italic> mutant hypocotyls exhibited similar CMT behaviors: we found a mean resultant vector length for <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> (2.5% agar) samples of 0.69 ± 0.15 and 0.65 ± 0.17 for <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> (2.5% agar) (<italic>n</italic> = 606 cells in 11 samples and 865 cells in 15 samples, respectively) and the populations were not significantly different (<italic>t</italic>-test p-value=0.556). This is consistent with the phenotypic rescue of the cracks in these conditions, which likely restores the mechanical continuity of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). To test the contribution of epidermis integrity for supracellular CMT orientation along maximal tensile stress, and building on the observed rescue of CMT behavior on 2.5% agar medium, we next modified the mechanical stress pattern in <italic>qua1-1</italic> artificially, using growth conditions in which cracks are only starting to appear. As already shown, cortical microtubule orientation became mostly circumferential in wild type hypocotyls 8 hr after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Strikingly, this response was dramatically reduced in <italic>qua1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). To quantify this response, we calculated the acute angle between the ablation site and the main orientation of the CMT arrays obtained with the FibrilTool macro, for each cell, at t = 0 hr and t = 8 hr after the ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2K</xref>). We thus obtained angles ranging from 0° to 90° (90° corresponding to circumferential CMT orientations around the ablation site, that is parallel to predicted maximal tension). At t = 0 hr, the <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> line exhibited a mean angle of 47 ± 26° showing an homogeneous distribution and no preferred orientation of the microtubules relative to the ablation site (<italic>n</italic> = 101 cells in 10 samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). At t = 8 hr the mean angle shifted to 58 ± 25°, and the distribution exhibited a strong skewing towards the 80 to 90° angles (<italic>n</italic> = 101 cells in 10 samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), demonstrating a significant reorganization of the CMT arrays around the ablation site (p-value=0.002). The <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> line however, did not show a significant reorganization of its CMT arrays 8 hr after the ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>, Mean angle at t = 0h: 45 ± 26° and t = 8h: 50 ± 26°, <italic>n</italic> = 107 cells in 10 samples; p-value=0.186). Whereas the distribution of angles still showed a relative skewing towards 90°, the skewness was much smaller than in the <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> line: −0.23 in <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> t = 8 hr vs. −0.77 in <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> t = 8 hr (0,08 in <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> t = 0 hr and −0.04 in <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> t = 0 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). In addition a statistical test comparing the skewness of the distribution to a corresponding normal distribution showed that the population of angles are not significantly skewed in <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> t = 0 hr, <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> t = 0 hr and <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> t = 8 hr (p-value=0.858, 0.718 and 0.255 respectively), while <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> t = 8 hr shows a significant skewing (p-value=0.002).</p><p>Overall, these results demonstrate that a discontinuous outer wall hampers the ability of CMTs to align with supracellular maximal tension in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A defining feature of the epidermis in animals is its continuity, which allows a build-up of tension and in turn promotes adhesion and the coordinated behavior of epidermal cells, notably through local cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galletti et al., 2016</xref>). This loop can be referred as the ‘tension-adhesion feedback loop’. The conclusions from the present study support this picture in plants too, notably as tension patterns could be revealed by the early cell-cell adhesion defects in <italic>qua1-1</italic> and as adhesion defects in <italic>qua1-1</italic> hinder the propagation of tensile stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34460.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The tension-adhesion feedback loop in plant epidermis.</title><p>Schematic representation of the relationship between tensile stress and cell to cell adhesion in the epidermis.

Yet, the role of mechanical stress in cell and developmental biology remains a subject of heated debate, notably because forces are invisible and stress patterns can only be predicted. Here we used the simplest possible tool to reveal stress pattern in plants, building on cell adhesion defects and their relation to tension. Our results formally validate several conclusions from previous computational models and stress patterns deduced from ablation experiments. Incidentally, this work also brings further experimental proof of the presence of tissue tension, building on the initial work by Hofmeister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofmeister, 1859</xref>) and Sachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sachs, 1878</xref>). We believe this work can serve as a reference for further studies on cell behavior in the corresponding tissues, notably to relate the behavior of cell effectors to stress patterns. Based on these data, one can also revisit previously published work on microtubule behavior in various organs. For instance, it had been reported that CMTs constantly rotate in young hypocotyl until they reach either their transverse or longitudinal orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). Although this behavior is still an intriguing phenomenon, it could partly be related to the fact that in this tissue, (transverse) shape-derived and (longitudinal) growth-derived stresses are in competition. Slight oscillations in growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastien et al., 2016</xref>) could periodically affect the ratio of shape- and growth-derived stress and thus trigger this rotating behavior of the microtubules. Another exciting avenue for the future is the analysis of the integration between such tensile stress patterns and other cues such as blue light, and its effect through phototropin and katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindeboom et al., 2013</xref>), or hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vineyard et al., 2013</xref>) on microtubule reorientation.</p><p>By definition, mechanical forces can be propagated at the speed of sound, like acoustic waves. This may provide close to instantaneous coordinating cues to tissues, as proposed in the Drosophila wing disc where cell division stops synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shraiman, 2005</xref>). Such a mechanism, in turn requires a tightly maintained and controlled cell-to-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verger et al., 2016</xref>) in order to constantly maintain the mechanical conductivity of the tissue. Yet, the heterogeneous nature of the tissue would add noise to the signal propagation, and so far this question has not been formally addressed in developmental biology. Here we provide evidence that the continuity of the outer cell wall is required for the coordinated response of adjacent cells to mechanical stress. In other words, a cell would experience different tension level and orientation between a situation where it would be separated from its neighbors (typically, cell shape would be sufficient to prescribe a tensile stress pattern, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sampathkumar et al., 2014</xref>]) and a situation where it would still adhere to its neighbors (tensile stress could build up at the outer epidermal wall, to a magnitude higher than cell shape-derived stress, and with a pattern that would depend on tissue shape and differential growth, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louveaux et al., 2016</xref>]). This opens exciting prospect for the future, as cell variability and growth heterogeneity is attracting increasing attention because of its, sometimes counterintuitive, instructive function in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Note that although CMT alignments match maximal tensile stress direction, as predicted from adhesion defects in <italic>qua1</italic>, this does not necessarily mean that microtubule, and cellulose, become aligned to promote cell-cell adhesion. In fact, mutants in microtubule dynamics or cellulose deposition have not been reported to exhibit adhesion defects. It is therefore more likely that other factors, and most likely actin through its impact on pectin delivery to cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathur et al., 2003</xref>), plays a critical role in the tension-induced reinforcement of cell-cell adhesion, in parallel to microtubule-driven cell wall reinforcement.</p><p>Our conclusions also echo the recent analysis of the DEFECTIVE KERNEL 1 (DEK1) protein, which was shown to be required for tensile stress perception <italic>via</italic> its association with a mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tran et al., 2017</xref>).

Input images are 2D Z-projections from confocal Z-stack. The script works by segmenting cell separation based on a threshold detection method of pixels intensity. In the case of clear gaps between the cells (as in cotyledons) the pixel intensity is much lower. The threshold allows a segmentation of theses gaps with low intensity pixels. In the case of bright stripes appearing between the cells (as in stem apices or light-grown hypocotyls), an opposite threshold is used, segmenting only the high intensity pixels zones. Because this threshold may vary from one image to the other, it was manually defined using the ImageJ threshold tool before running the script. Running the script then, labels the different zones, measures their areas, performs a principal component analysis of the label in order to determine their main orientations (principal component, <italic>θ</italic><sub>G</sub>) and assigns an anisotropy and principal angle to each labeled region.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The tension-adhesion nexus in plant epidermis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Probing the role of mechanics in biology is an increasingly popular topic. Here, the authors use a simple but clever method to monitor tension in plants by weakening the connections between plant cell walls. The authors make nice use of the <italic>qua1</italic> mutant, which affects cell adhesion due to defects in the middle lamella, to dissect the connection between cell adhesion, mechanical stress and coupling of stress between cells in a tissue. This system is then followed up by biophysical probes (AFM) and the analysis of MT patterns, as well as imaging and modeling. The ability to deduce stress patterns using this mutant and osmotic manipulations is a significant contribution and the finding that supracellular microtubule alignment is aberrant when cell continuity is disrupted is interesting.</p><p>The three reviewers thought the work was well written and presented and that it would, pending some additional small experiments and rewriting, be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. The major issues to be addressed are listed below and should be explained in a rebuttal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The explanation for &quot;reasoning that PMEI overexpression should induce more homogeneous wall properties in the hypocotyl&quot; need to be explained more clearly and consistently and the overall rationale for this experiment explained. Also, in the conclusion from this experiment, couldn't this negative result just mean the experiment didn't work? Was the change in wall properties measured, or was there some other evidence that <italic>p35S::PME15</italic> was working (some other phenotype that did occur?) The authors should discuss potential caveats of these overexpression experiments such as compensatory changes in wall composition/mechanics. Is <italic>p35S::PMEI5</italic> the same as <italic>PMEI-OE</italic>?</p><p>2) In numerous places, experiments were not done on true qual/control pairs under the same conditions, or in same tissues. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of places where the discrepancies should be addressed.</p><p>a) In the last paragraph of the subsection “A mechanical conflict at the petiole-blade junction of the cotyledon”, the authors mention a study done in leaves that they say is consistent with their results in cotyledons. It seems like a relatively straightforward experiment (given their current resources) to include an image of a leaf from qua-1 2.5% agar grown plants and to track the &quot;cracks&quot; using their pipeline to actually address this issue.</p><p>b) It is possible, perhaps even likely, that cell wall composition/structure is different between the blade and petiole cells. These differences might also contribute to the observed stress gradient at the blade-petiole junction. The authors should perform AFM analyses in this area to determine whether the cell stiffness and tension differ between petiole cells and their neighboring blade cells.</p><p>c) In Figure 2 it is unclear whether wild-type or <italic>qua1</italic> mutants used for AFM analysis – both should be reported.</p><p>d) In Figure 2 different osmotic conditions used between experiment (2.5% agar) and AFM (water) measurements may cause alterations in turgor pressure because cells respond in minutes (Shabala and Lew, 2002). Does water immersion interfere with measurements?</p><p>e) In Figure 2 use of different osmotic stabilizers between experiment (PEG) and AFM (mannitol) is also problematic. It would be more consistent to perform <italic>qua1</italic> experiments in mannitol if the PEG is too viscous for AFM.</p><p>f) In Figure 2 different cell types (cotyledon pavement cell) in AFM versus experimental material (hypocotyl, early cotelydon, petiole/leaf junction).</p><p>g) Stiffness was measured on epidermal cells, not on the connections between cells, which are altered in the <italic>qua1</italic> mutant. Does this reduction in stiffness reflect slower growth caused by growing in hyperosmotic conditions?</p><p>h) Analysis of CMT organization (at the very top of the apex) in a region that does not match the longitudinal cell wall separation (lower down on the shank of the apex) (compare Figure 3C and 3D). Please perform CMT organization in the relevant part of the apex.</p><p>i) Figure 3D compared microtubule organization in wild-type cells expressing GFP-MBD (in 1% agar?) to Figure 3C<italic>qua1</italic> mutants in 2.5% agar. The agar concentration needs to be specified and also must be the same to compare the samples. Please perform your analysis of GFP-MBD in 2.5% agar or, if that was what was done, indicate that in the figure and legend.</p><p>3) More experimental detail should be presented for the following (some overlap with items in #2).</p><p>a) In the fifth paragraph of the subsection “In the wild type, cortical microtubule orientations match tensile stress patterns, as inferred from cell adhesion defects in <italic>qua1</italic>” please briefly describe the ablation in more detail here in the text and also the methods (the only mention is a needle and a citation). How many cells are ablated? Is it a clean break? Is it only the epidermis? Can the tissue be imaged before this ablation, or only after?</p><p>b) Is there a differential response between the mutant and the wild-type in terms of growth of hypocotyl, cotyledon, etc. in 2.5% agar that might differentially impact tension or CMT organization?</p><p>c) The use of propidium iodide to map cell separations is a key tool in this paper and should be better documented/validated. The authors should show higher magnification images of the bright staining (e.g., in Figure 3C, G and K) to convince the reader that this staining corresponds to cell-cell separations. This correspondence would be best demonstrated by showing a time-lapse of these stained regions separating (i.e., showing void between the disconnected cells) over time, thus directly demonstrating that these bright stripes indeed represent cell separations.</p><p>4) An explanation of results in light of previous literature is needed for to following issues:</p><p>a) Alterations to cell wall properties alters CMT organization and that interconnected feedback loops exist between with cell wall defects and CMT organization have been published. How might this alter the interpretation of the results?</p><p>b) The authors need to discuss how the tension-adhesion theory proposed here relates to the finding that only the innermost (most recent) cell wall layer determines the growth axis since adhesion is mediated by the middle lamella which is quite removed from the innermost cellulose layer.</p><p>c) The authors assert that &quot;Here we provide evidence that the continuity of the outer cell wall is required for the coordinated response of adjacent cells to mechanical stress&quot;. How does this coordinated response differ from previously reported ones? Is the point that individual epidermal cells couldn't each respond to mechanical signals from the underlying tissue and create a seemingly coordinated response? I am not sure what a coordinated response would even look like if epidermal cells are missing/not next to each other-can you give an example of any coordinated response that doesn't involve continuity?</p><p>5) Can the authors say something about why the unadhered cells curl (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 1H) and not just grow straight? Presumably these cells are primarily feeling growth-based stress, so why do they curl?</p><p>6) The authors should take some caution about drawing strong conclusions about the competition between shape and growth based stress affecting microtubule rotary behaviors. Additional parameters such as wall heterogeneity could play a role in some cases. For instance, similarly shaped cells might differ in their wall thickness and/or composition depending on where they are in the hypocotyl which might change stresses, no?</p><p>Title: The title should be re-worded to make it more understandable to a wide audience. The word &quot;nexus&quot;, which is used frequently in the text, could be replaced with &quot;link&quot; or &quot;connection&quot; to make this idea more accessible. For example, at the end of the Introduction, it could simply be stated that, &quot;This mutant also allowed us to investigate how the loss of adhesion affects the propagation of mechanical stress and thus tension-dependent cell-cell coordination.&quot;</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A tension-adhesion feedback loop in plant epidermis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, these can be dealt with as text revisions relatively quickly as outlined below:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 notes that the new description of cortical MTs in Figure 3 and Figure 5 and would like clarification about the relationship between their orientation in light of models of tension. The reviewer’s exact comments are below:</p><p>“However, I am puzzled about the relationship between Figure 5 and Figure 3. Are the CMTs different in light-grown hypocotyls (2.5% agar) between wild type and <italic>qua1-1</italic> mutants as expected if tension is disrupted by gaps?</p><p>In Figure 5, the argument is that CMTs are much less disrupted in <italic>qua1-1</italic> mutants in 2.5% agar compared to 1% agar (and that tension is maintained?) and that CMT organization is rescued. The CMT organization does look similar to wild-type light-grown hypocotyls. Was a direct comparison made?</p><p>Also in Figure 5: CMT orientation looked much more consistent in individual cells (and typically oriented in the same direction as neighboring cells) in 1% agar of <italic>qua1</italic> mutants compared to 2.5% agar. Perhaps there was more variability across the whole tissue, but between cells CMT organization looked coordinated. Perhaps this is due to loss of tension from gaps between cells?”</p><p>2) Stating that the <italic>PMEI5</italic> overexpression leads to homogenization of cell wall mechanical and chemical properties (as in the main text and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 legend) is a strong claim that would require more work to support it. The AFM measurements were not conducted over all cell wall surfaces. Also, one cannot exclude the possibility that the <italic>PMEI5 OE</italic> plants may have altered cell wall compositions through cell wall integrity pathways. Instead state that the <italic>OE</italic> plants have reduced heterogeneity of pectin esterification (as they did in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Growth-derived stress dominates in hypocotyls”).</p><p>3) In the legend to Figure 1—figure supplement 5, fix to &quot;closeups of panels B and D&quot; not C. &quot;Panel E also reveals the presence of threads….&quot; not panels E and F.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34460.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The explanation for &quot;reasoning that PMEI overexpression should induce more homogeneous wall properties in the hypocotyl&quot; need to be explained more clearly and consistently and the overall rationale for this experiment explained.

The authors should discuss potential caveats of these overexpression experiments such as compensatory changes in wall composition/mechanics. Is p35S::PMEI5 the same as PMEI-OE?</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>p35S::PMEI5</italic> seedlings indeed exhibit an altered phenotype. The original figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) actually shows twisted hypocotyls. Furthermore, two independent labs have shown how overexpressing PMEI5 affects cell elongation in the hypocotyl (Wolf et al., 2012; Müller et al., 2013) so we are confident this is a positive result. We have clarified these points in this revision to better account for the literature, phenotype and rationale behind this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In numerous places, experiments were not done on true qual/control pairs under the same conditions, or in same tissues. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of places where the discrepancies should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point indeed, and we have included the required controls, as discussed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) In the last paragraph of the subsection “A mechanical conflict at the petiole-blade junction of the cotyledon”, the authors mention a study done in leaves that they say is consistent with their results in cotyledons. It seems like a relatively straightforward experiment (given their current resources) to include an image of a leaf from qua-1 2.5% agar grown plants and to track the &quot;cracks&quot; using their pipeline to actually address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the required experiment and found that the cracks in young leaves either followed the longitudinal axis of the leaf, especially at the leaf base as in cotyledons. However, these longitudinal cracks sometimes extended to a larger portion of the leaf base, consistent with the idea that growth in leaves is more anisotropic than in cotyledons. We also found more randomly oriented cracks, and interestingly enough, radial cracks around trichomes, which fits quite well with the predicted pattern of tensile stress in socket cells (see Hervieux et al., 2017). These new data are now presented in new Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is possible, perhaps even likely, that cell wall composition/structure is different between the blade and petiole cells. These differences might also contribute to the observed stress gradient at the blade-petiole junction. The authors should perform AFM analyses in this area to determine whether the cell stiffness and tension differ between petiole cells and their neighboring blade cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed AFM measurements at the blade-petiole junction and blade region on 2.5% agar (n= 10 cotyledons). Interestingly, the blade-petiole junction exhibited higher turgor, wall elastic modulus and apparent stiffness. Predicted tension was slightly higher at the petiole-blade junction than in the blade. These new results are consistent with the idea that there is a mechanical conflict at the petiole-blade junction. Although these data do not provide directional information, these data are also consistent with our claim that growth-derived tensile stress in higher at the petiole-blade junction. Although we cannot exclude that differences in wall polarities could also contribute to the gaping pattern in that region, our results on the <italic>p35S ::PMEI5</italic> line rather suggest that they would not be the primary cause of the gaps. In fact, cell wall mutants usually do not exhibit gaps. These new data are now included (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and discussed in this revision. Note that CMTs exhibit slightly higher anisotropy at the petiole-blade junction than in the blade, consistent with higher tension in that domain (see new Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In Figure 2 it is unclear whether wild-type or qua1 mutants used for AFM analysis – both should be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>All AFM experiments have been performed on the WT, since we use <italic>qua1</italic> to understand the mechanics of the WT. Yet, an AFM analysis of <italic>qua1</italic> could indeed be interesting, also to provide an exhaustive characterization of our system. We found that <italic>qua1</italic> mutants (on 2.5% agar) exhibit lower turgor, softer walls and lower tension. It seems therefore that the mechanics of <italic>qua1</italic> reaches a scaled down, but similar, mechanical equilibrium as in the WT. Such a response may be consistent with the idea that <italic>qua1</italic> is less able to achieve epidermal continuity, and thus to build up pressure and tension in that layer. These new data are now presented in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In Figure 2 different osmotic conditions used between experiment (2.5% agar) and AFM (water) measurements may cause alterations in turgor pressure because cells respond in minutes (Shabala and Lew, 2002). Does water immersion interfere with measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>In the long term, water immersion would affect the turgor status of the tissue. However, this effect should be small in the short term: single cell in cultures, epidermal peels and root epidermal cells (as in Shabala and Lew, 2002) may indeed respond in minutes to changes in osmotic conditions, but we find this response to occur much more slowly in the shoot. Typically, when Kierskowski et al. (2012, Science) use mannitol (0 to 0.4M) or NaCl (0 to 0.2M) on shoot apical meristem, they wait for 1 to 2 hours before recording an effect. Yet, to check for potential bias, we performed the same AFM measurements on cotyledons first submerged in liquid Arabidopsis medium (same as growth medium, only without agar), then changed to pure water, waited for 5min, and measured again (n= 6 cotyledons, n&gt; 30 cells per condition). Almost all the samples were measured on the same region (same cells) before and after solution change. We found that the solution change did not affect turgor pressure P. In short, it seems that the measurement is sufficiently fast (and the differences in osmolarity, sufficiently small) to avoid major effects of the immersion solution on the measurements. We have included this new control in this revision (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>e) In Figure 2 use of different osmotic stabilizers between experiment (PEG) and AFM (mannitol) is also problematic. It would be more consistent to perform qua1 experiments in mannitol if the PEG is too viscous for AFM.</italic> </p><p>Mannitol can have dramatic effects on plant phenotypes (because mannitol is actively sensed by plants, Trontin et al., 2014 Plant J). This means that we cannot grow plants for a long time on mannitol without inducing many other effects. High molecular weight PEG is actually often preferred over mannitol to change osmotic conditions in the research field of abiotic stresses (e.g. Thoen et al., 2016 New Phytol.). We found that PEG was more suited for our phenotypic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) In Figure 2 different cell types (cotyledon pavement cell) in AFM versus experimental material (hypocotyl, early cotelydon, petiole/leaf junction).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include AFM data for the petiole-blade junction in this revision (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). As there is a shallow gradient of growth along the hypocotyl, we found that results were more reproducible in cotyledons to assess the impact of the growth conditions on tension. Also, the differences in cell wall properties likely are more homogeneous between cotyledon cells than between hypocotyl cells, given the bigger difference in cell size in the hypocotyl than in cotyledons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Stiffness was measured on epidermal cells, not on the connections between cells, which are altered in the qua1 mutant. Does this reduction in stiffness reflect slower growth caused by growing in hyperosmotic conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>qua1</italic>, the anticlinal walls are not accessible to the AFM because the top wall at that site is stretched as cells are separating, and masks the anticlinal wall beneath. In this revision, we include topographic and stiffness maps of WT and <italic>qua1</italic> intercellular junctions, showing the presence of softer wall fragments in <italic>qua1</italic> at the junctions. We also detect holes in these stretched/torn wall fragments, very similar to the ones observed by SEM in Bouton et al., 2002. These new data are now presented in new Figure 1—figure supplement 5. Note that we also measured the stiffness of <italic>qua1</italic> outer walls and found them to be softer, but as turgor pressure is also lower, the equilibrium appears similar to that of the WT, only scaled down (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). More generally, reduction in wall stiffness may not always reflect slower growth: softer walls would exhibit less resistance to turgor pressure, and thus allow faster wall deformation/yielding, and thus faster growth, assuming turgor remains constant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) Analysis of CMT organization (at the very top of the apex) in a region that does not match the longitudinal cell wall separation (lower down on the shank of the apex) (compare Figure 3C and 3D). Please perform CMT organization in the relevant part of the apex.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected, we now show (and measured) CMT organization in the full stem apex in new Figure 3 and new Figure 3—figure supplement 3. The conclusions are unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) Figure 3D compared microtubule organization in wild-type cells expressing GFP-MBD (in 1% agar?) to Figure 3C qua1 mutants in 2.5% agar. The agar concentration needs to be specified and also must be the same to compare the samples. Please perform your analysis of GFP-MBD in 2.5% agar or, if that was what was done, indicate that in the figure and legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We specified the agar concentration throughout and now show the results both in 1% and 2.5% agar concentration (see new Figure 3, new Figure 4 and new Figure 3—figure supplement 3). We observe the same trends in these two conditions, and thus our conclusions are unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More experimental detail should be presented for the following (some overlap with items in #2).</p><p>a) In the fifth paragraph of the subsection “In the wild type, cortical microtubule orientations match tensile stress patterns, as inferred from cell adhesion defects in qua1” please briefly describe the ablation in more detail here in the text and also the methods (the only mention is a needle and a citation). How many cells are ablated? Is it a clean break? Is it only the epidermis? Can the tissue be imaged before this ablation, or only after?</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded our protocol, with more details in this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Is there a differential response between the mutant and the wild-type in terms of growth of hypocotyl, cotyledon, etc. in 2.5% agar that might differentially impact tension or CMT organization?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we did not detect major differences in CMT behavior between 1% and 2.5% agar condition (see new Figure 3, new Figure 4 and new Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Interestingly, we could detect one small difference: we found that NPA-treated seedling exhibited less outgrowth at the stem apex on 2.5% agar than on 1% agar in the <italic>p35S::GFP-MBD</italic> line, which may suggest that decreasing the level of tension on 2.5% agar hinders organogenesis/outgrowth, which would nicely complement the results obtained by Sassi et al., 2014 or Fleming et al., (1997, Science), where outgrowth is promoted by modifying the mechanical properties of the wall.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The use of propidium iodide to map cell separations is a key tool in this paper and should be better documented/validated. The authors should show higher magnification images of the bright staining (e.g., in Figure 3C, G and K) to convince the reader that this staining corresponds to cell-cell separations. This correspondence would be best demonstrated by showing a time-lapse of these stained regions separating (i.e., showing void between the disconnected cells) over time, thus directly demonstrating that these bright stripes indeed represent cell separations.</p></disp-quote><p>To better describe the gaps, we acquired high-magnification images of PI-stained gaps in <italic>qua1</italic> at different stages of “gaping”. Interestingly, we could detect threads, likely from the outer wall being pulled apart, consistent with original SEM observations of <italic>qua1</italic> gaps in Bouton et al., 2002. We also include AFM images (topography and stiffness) of these junctions in this revision (new Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An explanation of results in light of previous literature is needed for to following issues:</p><p>a) Alterations to cell wall properties alters CMT organization and that interconnected feedback loops exist between with cell wall defects and CMT organization have been published. How might this alter the interpretation of the results?</p></disp-quote><p>CMT organization primarily affects cellulose deposition. In particular, the mechanics and adhesion of the middle lamella does not seem to be affected in any microtubule mutant. In other words, when CMT are aligned with tension, they might reinforce the cell, and the indirect effect of cellulose orientation on pectin and adhesion seems rather minor. Instead, cell-cell adhesion defects have been reported in actin mutants (e.g. <italic>arp2,3</italic>, Mathur et al., 2003), consistent with the role of actin in exocytosis and thus pectin delivery. Note also that we do not detect major CMT defects in qua1 mutant when grown on 2.5% agar, meaning that the CMT defects in qua1 on 1% agar is related to loss of adhesion, not the <italic>QUA1</italic> gene. We added this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors need to discuss how the tension-adhesion theory proposed here relates to the finding that only the innermost (most recent) cell wall layer determines the growth axis since adhesion is mediated by the middle lamella which is quite removed from the innermost cellulose layer.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we use CMTs as a proxy for tension patterns in tissues, and of course, tension controls more than only the CMTs. In our tension-adhesion theory, we would rather argue that the machinery that promotes adhesion (e.g. actin) would respond to tension to promote adhesion, as now included in the discussion. CMTs also align with tension, but seem to have little to do with adhesion. Somehow this recalls the observation that auxin transport through PIN1 seem to depend in part on tension, but independently from the CMT response to tension (Heisler et al., 2010 Plos Biol.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors assert that &quot;Here we provide evidence that the continuity of the outer cell wall is required for the coordinated response of adjacent cells to mechanical stress&quot;. How does this coordinated response differ from previously reported ones? Is the point that individual epidermal cells couldn't each respond to mechanical signals from the underlying tissue and create a seemingly coordinated response? I am not sure what a coordinated response would even look like if epidermal cells are missing/not next to each other-can you give an example of any coordinated response that doesn't involve continuity?</p></disp-quote><p>This comes down to stress magnitude. For instance, we (and others) propose that CMT align with maximal tension, whatever the cause is. If cells are separated, the maximum of tensile stress in that cell will be prescribed by pressure stress, i.e. cell shape (typically transverse in an elongated cell). If that same cell is under a thick outer wall where tensions can propagate and if the tissue is folding or if there are high differential growth between adjacent cells, then tension may be much higher than cell shape-derived stress and thus the local maximum of tension may be in a different direction than the one prescribed by cell shape. This is what was proposed for pavement cell shapes (Sampathkumar et al., 2014) and for cell division plane orientation for instance (see Louveaux et al., 2016). Our results in <italic>qua1</italic> formally show that this hypothesis is plausible, as now discussed in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors say something about why the unadhered cells curl (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 1H) and not just grow straight? Presumably these cells are primarily feeling growth-based stress, so why do they curl?</p></disp-quote><p>This comes down to the relaxation of stress when cells are separating. For instance, when dandelion stems are cut lengthwise, they curl up, because the epidermis is under tension and the inner tissues under compression (the contraction of the epidermis, which induces the curling, actually demonstrate that it was under tension in the uncut stem, see Kutschera and Niklas, 2007). Whether tension is caused by growth or shape, after cutting or <italic>qua1</italic>-dependent cell separation, the release of tension would cause a deformation, and curling is consistent with tissue tension. Hofmeister and later Sachs actually introduced the concept of tissue tension, and in their model, such tension was caused by the differential growth between epidermal and inner tissues. Our data, and other models, e.g. by Tobias Baskin or Oliver Jensen, are all consistent with that picture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should take some caution about drawing strong conclusions about the competition between shape and growth based stress affecting microtubule rotary behaviors. Additional parameters such as wall heterogeneity could play a role in some cases. For instance, similarly shaped cells might differ in their wall thickness and/or composition depending on where they are in the hypocotyl which might change stresses, no?</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, especially as the CMT rotary behavior remains quite mysterious. It is also possible that local differences in turgor pressure may play a role in CMT rotations. We have toned down our statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: The title should be re-worded to make it more understandable to a wide audience. The word &quot;nexus&quot;, which is used frequently in the text, could be replaced with &quot;link&quot; or &quot;connection&quot; to make this idea more accessible. For example, at the end of the Introduction, it could simply be stated that, &quot;This mutant also allowed us to investigate how the loss of adhesion affects the propagation of mechanical stress and thus tension-dependent cell-cell coordination.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded the title and replaced nexus by “feedback loop” throughout.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, these can be dealt with as text revisions relatively quickly as outlined below:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 notes that the new description of cortical MTs in Figure 3 and Figure 5 and would like clarification about the relationship between their orientation in light of models of tension. The reviewer’s exact comments are below:</p><p>“However, I am puzzled about the relationship between Figure 5 and Figure 3. Are the CMTs different in light-grown hypocotyls (2.5% agar) between wild type and qua1-1 mutants as expected if tension is disrupted by gaps?</p><p>In Figure 5, the argument is that CMTs are much less disrupted in qua1-1 mutants in 2.5% agar compared to 1% agar (and that tension is maintained?) and that CMT organization is rescued. The CMT organization does look similar to wild-type light-grown hypocotyls. Was a direct comparison made?</p><p>Also in Figure 5: CMT orientation looked much more consistent in individual cells (and typically oriented in the same direction as neighboring cells) in 1% agar of qua1 mutants compared to 2.5% agar. Perhaps there was more variability across the whole tissue, but between cells CMT organization looked coordinated. Perhaps this is due to loss of tension from gaps between cells?”</p></disp-quote><p>CMT organisations in wild-type and <italic>qua1-1</italic> seedlings grown on 2.5% look very similar indeed and we could not detect any significant difference in our analysis. As pointed out by the reviewer, we assume that this is due to the restoration of mechanical continuity of the epidermis. This is now included in the text:</p><p>“When grown on 2.5% agar medium, the wild type and <italic>qua1-1</italic> mutant hypocotyls exhibited similar CMT behaviors: we found a mean resultant vector length for <italic>GFP-MBD</italic> (2.5% agar) samples of 0.69 ± 0.15 and 0.65 ± 0.17 for <italic>qua1-1 GFP-MBD</italic> (2.5% agar) (<italic>n</italic>=606 cells in 11 samples and 865 cells in 15 samples, respectively) and the populations were not significantly different (<italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.556). This is consistent with the phenotypic rescue of the cracks in these conditions, which likely restores the mechanical continuity of the epidermis (Figure 5B, C).”</p><p>We have also clarified that our analysis of CMT coordination accounts for the whole tissue: CMTs look similar in WT and <italic>qua1-1</italic> at the single cell level; only their supracellular coordination is affected by the gaps in <italic>qua1-1</italic> (local disruption of the stress pattern). We have clarified this in the revised text:</p><p>“Whereas CMTs looked normal within individual <italic>qua1-1</italic> cells, they displayed less consistent orientation at the tissue scale in <italic>qua1-1</italic> cells than in the wild type (Figure 3L and 5A). […] In turn, the actual cell-to-cell coordination does not seem to be affected when two neighboring cells are still attached.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Stating that the PMEI5 overexpression leads to homogenization of cell wall mechanical and chemical properties (as in the main text and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 legend) is a strong claim that would require more work to support it. The AFM measurements were not conducted over all cell wall surfaces. Also, one cannot exclude the possibility that the PMEI5 OE plants may have altered cell wall compositions through cell wall integrity pathways. Instead state that the OE plants have reduced heterogeneity of pectin esterification (as they did in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Growth-derived stress dominates in hypocotyls”).</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the predicted impact of <italic>PMEI OE</italic> on wall properties as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the legend to Figure 1—figure supplement 5, fix to &quot;closeups of panels B and D&quot; not C. &quot;Panel E also reveals the presence of threads….&quot; not panels E and F.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting these errors – we have corrected the panel numbers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
