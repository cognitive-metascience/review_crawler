Available studies have been primarily focused on the mechanisms underlying mutant SOD1 cytotoxicity. How cells defend against the cytotoxicity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that misfolding of ALS-linked SOD1 mutants and wild-type (wt) SOD1 exposes a normally buried nuclear export signal (NES)-like sequence. The nuclear export carrier protein CRM1 recognizes this NES-like sequence and exports misfolded SOD1 to the cytoplasm. Antibodies against the NES-like sequence recognize misfolded SOD1, but not native wt SOD1 both in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of the NES consensus sequence relocalizes mutant SOD1 to the nucleus, resulting in higher toxicity in cells, and severer impairments in locomotion, egg-laying, and survival in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Our data suggest that SOD1 mutants are removed from the nucleus by CRM1 as a defense mechanism against proteotoxicity of misfolded SOD1 in the nucleus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23759.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23759.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23759.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that leads to muscle weakness and paralysis. The symptoms become progressively worse over time to the point that patients die because they become unable to breathe. Over 170 different genetic mistakes (or mutations) in a gene that encodes a protein called SOD1 are known to cause ALS. These mutations cause the SOD1 protein to form different shapes that are toxic to nerve cells, leading to the gradual loss of the nerve cells that control movement. SOD1 is normally found in a compartment within nerve cells called the nucleus, which is where most of the cell’s genetic information is stored and managed.</p><p>A nematode worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has often been used as a model to study the role of SOD1 in ALS because its nervous system shares many features in common with ours but is much smaller. Some evidence suggests that cells may be able to defend themselves against the harmful effects of abnormal SOD1 proteins. However, it is not clear how these defences might work.</p><p>Zhong et al. examined variants of SOD1 proteins from human cells grown in a laboratory. The experiments show that some mutant SOD1 proteins fold in such a way that a small section of the protein that is normally buried within the protein’s structure is exposed on the surface. Mutant SOD1 proteins that expose this “peptide” are removed from the nucleus and are linked with faster progression of ALS in patients.</p><p>Further experiments show that another protein called CRM1 can recognise this exposed peptide, leading to the removal of the mutant SOD1 proteins from the nucleus. Zhong et al. found that if mutant SOD1 is not removed from the nucleus of nerve cells, the nematode worms developed ALS symptoms even faster.</p><p>These findings suggest that cells may be able to remove some mutant SOD1 proteins from the nucleus to defend themselves against the proteins’ toxic effects. Future work will reveal whether other cells use this approach to protect themselves against other diseases. The peptide discovered in this work may also have the potential to be used as a marker to predict how individual cases of ALS will progress, or as a target for treatments against the disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23759.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23759.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SOD1</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>ALS</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>nuclear export signal</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1120833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Shengyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AA024245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Shengyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular and genetic approaches reveal that exposure of a normally buried nuclear export signal (NES)-like sequence mediates export of ALS-linked mutant and misfolded wild-type SOD1 to the cytoplasm by CRM1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Most patients die from respiratory failure in 3–5 years after disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajroud-Driss and Siddique, 2015</xref>). About 10% of ALS cases have positive family history and are classified as familial ALS (fALS). The remaining 90% of ALS cases are classified as sporadic ALS (sALS). Mutations in over 40 genes have been associated with fALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajroud-Driss and Siddique, 2015</xref>), including the first identified gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosen et al., 1993</xref>). To date, over 170 mutations involving 88 of the 154 amino acids of SOD1 have been identified in patients diagnosed with ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>) (alsod.iop.kcl.uk). Mutations in SOD1 account for about 20% of familial and 2–7% of sporadic ALS cases (alsod.iop.kcl.uk), which makes SOD1 the second most frequently mutated gene after C9ORF72 in affected Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajroud-Driss and Siddique, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>SOD1 is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed free-radical scavenging enzyme. It catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub>.<sup>−</sup>) into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which in turn is reduced to water and oxygen by catalase. SOD1 is highly abundant, comprising 1–2% of the total soluble protein in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pardo et al., 1995</xref>). Despite its important physiological function, SOD1 knockout mice failed to develop an ALS-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reaume et al., 1996</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates that a toxic gain-of-function in SOD1 mutants is a fundamental mechanism for the pathogenesis of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williamson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rotunno and Bosco, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunton-Stasyshyn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Silverman et al., 2016</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms by which diverse SOD1 mutations all cause ALS remains unclear, many toxic effects caused by SOD1 mutants have been reported, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal transport disruption, prion-like propagation, and non-cell autonomous toxicity of neuroglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>). These toxic effects may contribute to mutant SOD1-induced neuronal degeneration. Aggregation of SOD1 mutants in motor neurons is a common pathological feature. Therefore, coaggregation of an unidentified essential component or components or aberrant catalysis by misfolded mutants may underlie part of the mutant-mediated toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruijn et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Disease pathogenesis and progression is not only determined by the toxic effects of SOD1 mutants but also modulated by intrinsic cellular defenses against the toxic proteins, such as protein quality control. Indeed, it has been reported that removal of SOD1 mutants through degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, or through induction of heat shock proteins reduces their cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ying et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crippa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalmar et al., 2014</xref>). However, available studies have been primarily focused on how mutant SOD1 exerts its toxicity, and much less is known about how cells defend against the toxic effects. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism that reduces mutant SOD1 cytotoxicity through limiting proteotoxicity in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ALS-linked SOD1 mutants are cleared from the nucleus by CRM1</title><p>SOD1 is normally localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crapo et al., 1992</xref>). We found that when GFP-tagged wt-SOD1 (GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup>) and two mutants (GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> and GFP-SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) were expressed in HeLa cells, both mutants showed predominantly cytoplasmic distribution while GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Impairment of the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway with a CRM1 inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB), caused the mutants to accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of CRM1 expression by RNAi or co-expression of a Q69L mutant of Ran GTPase, a dominant-negative inhibitor of CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kehlenbach et al., 1999</xref>), also led to accumulation of the mutants in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

Selective export of mutant but not wt SOD1 suggests that SOD1 does not have a physiological NES. We hypothesized that misfolding of SOD1 mutants reveals a normally buried hydrophobic peptide that contains a NES consensus sequence. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed SOD1 protein sequence and located two potential NES-like sequence-containing peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The peptides were each fused to mCherry and expressed in HeLa cells. Fusion with peptide P1 corresponding to residues 24–55 of SOD1, but not with P2 resulted in the nuclear clearance of mCherry, which could be restored by LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). GST pull-down experiments showed that P1 and the NES from protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>) as a positive control, but not P2, interact with CRM1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Eight hydrophobic residues in P1 are among the candidates for the NES consensus residues, and therefore, each was mutated to Arginine (R) in GFP-SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>. Five of the resulting mutants, including I35R, L38R, L42R, F45R, and V47R, showed even distribution in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, suggesting these five hydrophobic residues are essential for G93A nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These essential residues are in good agreement with the PKI-class NES consensus Φ<sup>0</sup>-X<sub>2</sub>-Φ<sup>1</sup>-X<sub>3</sub>-Φ<sup>2</sup>-X<sub>2–3</sub>-Φ<sup>3</sup>-X-Φ<sup>4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), where Φ<sup>0</sup>-Φ<sup>4</sup> are five key hydrophobic residues spaced by different number of amino acids (denoted as X<sub>n</sub>) that are preferentially charged, polar or small. Importantly, sequence alignment revealed that one of the five essential hydrophobic residues, Leu42 (Φ<sup>2</sup>), is not conserved in orthologs for human SOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Mutation of this residue to Glutamine (Q), as is naturally present in the mouse ortholog, abolished the nuclear export ability of GFP-SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results indicate that P1 is not an evolutionarily conserved physiological NES but may be exposed by misfolding of SOD1 mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The NES-like sequence is normally buried but exposed in SOD1 mutants</title><p>To determine whether the NES-like sequence is normally buried, we analyzed the available structure of wt-SOD1 (PDB: 2c9v). The NES-like consensus sequence (aa35-47) forms part of strand β3, the crossover loop, and strand β4, and is almost completely buried in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In fact, Leu42 is the only one of the five essential hydrophobic residues exposed on the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which may explain why natural substitution of Leu42 by Gln in mouse SOD1 does not affect its structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Next, we assessed the accessibility of the NES-like sequence to CRM1 in SOD1 mutants using pull-down assays with recombinant GST-tagged full-length wt or mutant SOD1. CRM1 was precipitated by all four ALS-linked mutants tested, including Q22L, G85R, G93A, and L144S, but not by wt-SOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Disruption of the NES consensus sequence by creating an L38R mutation in G85R or G93A largely diminished their binding to CRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Lane 7 vs 4, Lane 8 vs 5). Moreover, CRM1-NES-like sequence interaction was dependent on the presence of RanGTP. The interaction was diminished when RanGTP was omitted from the pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a receptor-cargo relationship for CRM1-NES-like sequence of SOD1. The exposure of the NES-like sequence in cells was determined by native immunoprecipitation (IP). To do this, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the NES-like sequence-containing peptide (NLP). Under native condition, anti-NLP efficiently precipitated GFP-SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and six other mutants but not GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> from lysates prepared from HEK293T cells transiently expressing the respective protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). These results indicate that the NES-like sequence of SOD1 is normally buried in the wild-type protein but is exposed in the mutants possibly due to protein misfolding.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23759.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The NES-like sequence is exposed only in SOD1 mutants but not in wt SOD1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural localization of the NES-like peptide in wt SOD1.

We then asked whether exposure of the NES-like sequence is a common feature for ALS-linked SOD1 mutants. We tested 17 representative ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, including those deficient in copper binding (H46R, H48R, and H120L) or zinc binding (H80R and D83G) and one that cannot form disulfide bond (C57R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valentine et al., 2005</xref>). These mutants were tagged with GFP and expressed in HeLa cells. GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> was expressed as a negative control. As described above, exposure of the NES-like sequence can result in predominantly cytoplasmic distribution (nuclear &lt; cytoplasmic: N&lt;C) of some SOD1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we first evaluated the exposure of the NES-like sequence in these GFP-tagged mutants by directly observing GFP localization. We found that cells expressing GFP-tagged SOD1 mutants exhibited either a N&lt;C distribution or a distribution pattern similar to GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> (wt-SOD1-like). While N&lt;C localization was the predominant pattern found in over half of the mutants tested, this localization pattern was found only in a fraction of cells expressing the remaining mutants, including L38R (0%), H46R (3.9%), C57R (62.6%), H80R (53.7%), D90A (59.5%), H120L (55.5%), L126S (66.5%) and L144S (59.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, disruption of the NES-consensus sequence by adding an L38R mutation to eight tested mutants resulted in wt-SOD1-like GFP distribution in all transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then examined the exposure of the NES-like sequence by anti-NLP immunofluorescence. Positive anti-NLP staining was found in 90–100% of cells for all mutants except for L126S (81%) and L144S (77%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the notion that exposure of the NES-like sequence exports misfolded SOD1 to the cytoplasm, anti-NLP immunofluorescence exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic localization, even in cells exhibiting wt-SOD1-like GFP localization, such as those expressing H46R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The L38R mutant that has a disrupted NES-consensus sequence, as an exception, was stained both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that all SOD1 mutants tested expose the NES-like sequence, but the propensities to expose it vary among the mutants. Native IP with anti-NLP antibodies further confirmed that mutants with less N&lt;C GFP distribution (H46R, D90A, L126S and L144S) were also less efficiently precipitated by anti-NLP, compared to mutants showing predominant N&lt;C GFP distribution (A4V, G85R, G93A and G108V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, available reports indicate that ALS patients with H46R, D90A, L126S or L144S mutation have slow disease progression, whereas disease progress faster in patients with A4V, G85R, G93A or G108V mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byström et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that SOD1 mutants can assume more than one conformations in cells, among which their tendencies to expose the NES-like sequence correlate with disease progression.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23759.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The NES-like sequence is exposed in ALS-linked SOD1 mutants and misfolded wt-SOD1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged wt-SOD1 or indicated mutants were stained with α-NLP.

In support for this observation, previous studies have shown that wt-SOD1 can become misfolded under certain stress conditions and the misfolded wt-SOD1 adopts a ‘toxic conformation’ that is similar to ALS-linked SOD1 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rotunno and Bosco, 2013</xref>). We, therefore, further investigated whether the NES-like sequence is exposed in misfolded wt-SOD1. It was reported that zinc binding stabilizes wt-SOD1, whereas chelation of zinc leads SOD1 to adopt a ‘mutant-like conformation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Homma et al., 2013</xref>). We, therefore, treated HeLa cells expressing GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> with the zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) followed by anti-NLP staining. More cells lost nuclear distribution of GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> following TPEN treatment, and these cells were specifically stained by anti-NLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Anti-NLP also stained endogenous SOD1 in TPEN-treated cells, whereas a non-conformation-specific anti-SOD1 antibody (71G8) stained both control and TPEN-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, in TPEN-treated cells, both 71G8 and anti-NLP showed predominantly cytoplasmic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that misfolded endogenous SOD1 is also exported from the nucleus. The specificity of anti-NLP staining of endogenous SOD1 was demonstrated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of SOD1 expression. RNAi dramatically decreased the staining by both 71G8 and anti-NLP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, cells treated with sodium arsenite, an oxidative stress inducer, were also specifically stained by anti-NLP, and the staining was significantly reduced when SOD1 was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Treatment of HeLa cells with dithiothreitol (DTT), a strong reducing agent that may break the disulfide bond in SOD1, also resulted in predominantly cytoplasmic staining of anti-NLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). LMB treatment of DTT-treated cells increased anti-NLP staining in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating that the reduced nuclear staining is due to CRM1-dependent nuclear export of misfolded SOD1. Taken together, these results suggest that certain environmental stresses can induce wt-SOD1 to adopt ‘mutant-like’ conformation with exposed NES-like sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Anti-NLP detects mutant SOD1 in samples from ALS patients</title><p>To determine the clinical relevance of this novel conformation, we performed anti-NLP immunostaining of spinal cord sections from human ALS patients.

When present in the nuclei of neurons, SOD1 mutants are likely to cause proteotoxicity in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shibata and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, nuclear clearance may modulate toxicity of SOD1 mutants through reducing proteotoxicity in the nucleus. To test this possibility, we proposed to restore the nuclear localization of SOD1 mutants by disrupting the NES-like consensus sequence using G85R as an example. As shown earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, Leu42, one of the NES consensus residue in human SOD1, normally exists as Gln (Q) in mouse and is exposed on the SOD1 protein surface. Therefore, a L42Q substitution is expected to disrupt the NES consensus sequence without affecting SOD1 structure. We generated lentiviral plasmids encoding GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup>, GFP-SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>, GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> and GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>, and expressed the variants in NSC34 motor neuron-like cells. As expected, GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup>, GFP-SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>, and GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> were localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> was primarily in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, native IP showed that GFP-SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup> was not recognized by anti-NLP, whereas about same amounts of GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> and GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> were precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), supporting that L42Q mutation has little or no effects on SOD1 folding. The cytotoxic effects of GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, GFP-SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>, and GFP-SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> were examined by a WST-1 assay for cell viability, and GFP-SOD1<sup>wt</sup>-expressing cells were used as a control. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>), proteostress was imposed through inhibition of proteasomal degradation.

SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP was cleared from the nuclei of motor neurons in both L1 and adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). In contrast, SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei in motor neurons in L1 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the nuclear localization of SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP was only observed in a fraction of the neurons and no visible aggregate was observed in the nucleus. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A possible explanation is that cytoplasmic aggregation of the mutant protein prevents its entry into the nucleus. Indeed, we found that in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, like SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP, SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP formed large cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that these new lines expressed similar levels of the SOD1 transgenes as the previously generated SOD1<sup>wt</sup>-YFP and SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP lines, with the exception of the line L42Q-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similar amount of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP and SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP, but not SOD1<sup>wt</sup>-YFP or SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>-YFP were detected in the insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, upper panel, lanes 2, 6–8), indicating the formation of aggregates for the variants in these <italic>C. elegans</italic> lines. To assess the effects of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP and SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP on locomotion, we measured the body bending rates for L4 larvae of all these lines. As controls, the lines expressing SOD1<sup>wt</sup>-YFP and SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>-YFP showed significantly higher bending rates than SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP and SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Importantly, all three SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP lines showed significantly lower bending rates than the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Next, we compared the survival rates of the transgenic lines. SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>-YFP and SOD1<sup>wt</sup>-YFP worms showed similar survival rates, whereas the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP line had significantly decreased survival rate, in agreement with previous reports. Remarkably, about 80% of all worms expressing SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP died by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). A potential cause for the decreased survival of SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP worms was identified, as these animals exhibited an egg-laying defect where eggs hatched inside mothers, a phenotype known as ‘bagging’. About 70% of SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP worms showed the bagging phenotype, with an average of 4.2 eggs hatched per mother. This was significantly worse than observed for SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>-YFP animals, where about 17% of worms showed a bagging phenotype, with an average of 2.4 eggs hatched per mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B,C</xref>). Remarkably, less eggs were laid by SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup>-YFP animals in 48 hr compared to other lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

Therefore, removal of the misfolded SOD1 from the nucleus, mediated by the exposed NES-like sequence and CRM1-dependent nuclear export, is potentially a defense mechanism against the proteotoxic effects of ALS-linked SOD1 mutants in the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that SOD1 misfolding caused by either mutation or chemical insults induces nuclear clearance of SOD1 protein. The underlying mechanism is the exposure of a normally buried NES-like sequence caused by the misfolding event. CRM1 can recognize the NES-like sequence and facilitates export of the misfolded SOD1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Exposure of the NES-like sequence is a common conformational feature for all 17 representative ALS-linked SOD1 mutants tested, and also for misfolded wt-SOD1. Moreover, this conformational feature is also present in spinal cord motor neurons of human ALS patients. Our data also suggest that the exposure of the NES-like sequence is a disease-modifying feature for SOD1 mutants. First, this conformation appears to correlate with ALS disease progression. Several mutants that show lower propensities to acquire the NES-like sequence-exposed conformation, including H46R, D90A, L126S and L144S, have been previously reported to associate with slow progression of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byström et al., 2010</xref>). Second, although the potential toxic effects of this exposed NES-like sequence itself were not evaluated by the present study, data from cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest that nuclear export of misfolded SOD1 decreases the general toxicity of G85R mutant, probably due to diminishing the proteotoxicity in the nucleus. Disruption of the NES-consensus in SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> significantly increases defects in locomotion and egg-laying in <italic>C. elegans</italic> models. It is likely that loss of muscle function as a result of more severe motor neuron degeneration is responsible for these severe phenotypes. Therefore, the ability of neurons to remove misfolded proteins from the nucleus after exposure of the NES-like sequence may play an important role in pathogenesis of SOD1-linked ALS.</p><p>Nuclear export not only decreases the levels of SOD1 mutants in the nucleus, but also increases their levels in the cytoplasm. Loss of nuclear SOD1 may lead to loss of function in the nucleus, but it is unlikely a disease mechanism because SOD1 knockout does not lead to ALS phenotype and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reaume et al., 1996</xref>). To the contrary, knockdown of SOD1 mutants by siRNA are currently being pursued as a therapeutic approach for ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ralph et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Zundert and Brown, 2017</xref>). Nuclear export may facilitate the removal of misfolded SOD1, which would produce beneficial effects. It is known that the nucleus relies on exclusively the proteasomal degradation pathway to remove misfolded and unwanted proteins, whereas the cytoplasm has both proteasomal and lysosome-dependent autophagy pathways. Thus, nuclear export may facilitate mutant SOD1 degradation by autophagy. On the other hand, nuclear export increases the cytoplasmic concentration of the abnormal SOD1, which may promote toxic effects on the functions of cytoplasmic organelles, for example, ER and mitochondria. It is likely that NES-like sequence-mediated changes in subcellular localization of SOD1 mutants would have complex effects on neuronal functions and survival, but collectively, may reduce the toxicity of SOD1 mutants. Future careful interrogation of this complex issue is warranted.</p><p>Our results also indicate that exposure of the NES-like sequence may be a common property of misfolded SOD1. Although we did not test every previously reported ALS-linked SOD1 mutations, those examined span almost the full length of SOD1 and also included almost all representative mutants. Misfolded wt-SOD1 also shares this feature, which supports the controversial proposition that misfolding of wt-SOD1 is involved in pathogenesis of sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rotunno and Bosco, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Zundert and Brown, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grad et al., 2014</xref>). The exposure of NES-like sequence can be specifically detected with anti-NLP antibody, which may become a useful tool for research and diagnosis. Interestingly, several other antibodies that recognize regions covered or partially overlapping with the NES-like sequence have been reported, including D3H5 (epitope: residues 24–55) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rotunno and Bosco, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gros-Louis et al., 2010</xref>), AJ10 (epitope: residues 29–57) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sábado et al., 2013</xref>), and USOD (epitope: residues 42–48) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerman et al., 2010</xref>). All these antibodies were also reported to selectively recognize mutant SOD1 over wt-SOD1, suggesting that the epitopes formed by the NES-like sequence are highly specific for misfolded SOD1. Therefore, the NES-like sequence may serve as a biomarker for the detection of misfolded SOD1 in ALS patients. Moreover, this immunogenic region may be used for immunotherapy for SOD1-linked ALS as was reported for the SOD1 exposed dimer interface (SEDI) peptide, that is specifically exposed in monomeric SOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rakhit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our findings also have far-reaching implications for nuclear protein quality control. Proper maintenance of nuclear protein homeostasis is important for preserving cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shibata and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2014</xref>). Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the nucleus can affect cell function and cause diseases. A number of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with aggregates and inclusions formed by misfolded proteins in the nucleus, such as polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases, polyalanine (polyA) repeat diseases, the RNA-mediated diseases, neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID), multiple system atrophy (MSA), neuroferritinopathy, and inclusion body myopathy with early onset Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woulfe, 2008</xref>). In addition to the known protein quality control mechanisms, such as chaperones and ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shibata and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2014</xref>), our findings suggest that exposure of a normally buried NES-like sequence leading to CRM1-dependent nuclear export of the misfolded SOD1 may represent a novel mechanism for maintaining nuclear proteostasis. Exposure of normally buried hydrophobic regions is a common feature of misfolded proteins. These hydrophobic regions are commonly recognized by chaperones and quality control E3 ubiquitin ligases, to initiate the refolding and ubiquitination of the misfolded proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fredrickson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horwich, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, proteomic analysis has revealed that NES consensus sequences are frequently observed in hydrophobic regions buried inside of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that many misfolded proteins may expose buried hydrophobic regions containing NES consensus sequences, which may result in being exported from the nucleus by CRM1 if not efficiently degraded by the nuclear proteasomes or refolded by chaperones. Nuclear export may be a mechanism responsible for cytosolic mislocalization of many disease-causing mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung and Link, 2011</xref>). Notably, failure in nuclear import is also a cause for mislocalization of some disease proteins. For example, mutations in the NLS of FUS, which also cause ALS, leads to its mislocalization to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dormann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gal et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in another ALS-linked gene, TDP43, also lead to exclusion of TDP43 protein from the nucleus of the neurons and the formation of cytoplasmic TDP43 aggregates, but the underlying mechanism is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2010</xref>). Abnormal nucleocytoplasmic transport may represent a convergent pathogenic pathway for some neurodegenerative diseases. Most recent studies have suggested that the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport is disrupted by the hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) GGGGCC (G4C2) in C9orf72, which causes ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freibaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jovičić et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that the exposure of NES-like sequence in mutant and misfolded SOD1 may also affect the nucleocytoplasmic transport of other cargo, because CRM1-mediated export is saturable and SOD1 is a highly abundant protein in the cell. However, there is an important distinction that nuclear export is deleterious in C9orf72-caused ALS, but it is protective in SOD1-linked ALS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>pAcGFP1-SOD1-WT, -A4V, -G93A were acquired from Addgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stevens et al., 2010</xref>).

Statistical significance was assessed using paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. For all analyses, p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Reported sample sizes indicate the number of biological replicates, with data obtained from individual cells, organisms, or sample wells. All collected data were included in analyses (no outlier removal). For experiments analyzing cytotoxicity, sample units (<italic>n</italic>) are the number of biological replicates. For all other experiments, <italic>n</italic> represents the number of cells or animals used in the analysis for each group. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. However, the sample sizes we used were similar to those reported in previous studies. No samples or animals were excluded from the analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Drs.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

The basis for this altered localization is traced to increased nuclear export due to promiscuous interaction with the export factor Crm1 via a hydrophobic patch in SOD1 that is ordinarily buried in the folded protein. Antibodies against this region preferentially recognize mutant protein (or wild type protein under mis-folding conditions), supporting the idea that a wide range of mutants all partially destabilize SOD1 structure. Reversing mutant mis-localization by appending a NLS increased toxicity of the mutant in a motor neuron-like mammalian cell line and in neurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that misfolded SOD1 is more toxic in the nucleus than in the cytosol. Evidence is offered to suggest altered nucleocytoplasmic transport when mutant SOD1 is retained in the nucleus. The authors suggest that exposure of NES-like regions in misfolded proteins might be a defense mechanism to reduce their toxicity in the nucleus.</p><p>All three referees agreed that the first part of the paper, documenting exposure of a cryptic and buried NES in numerous SOD1 mutants as the basis of altered localization, was thorough, convincing, and represented a new contribution to this field. However, the relevance of this observation for either normal cellular physiology or disease pathogenesis was not sufficiently clear from the experiments thus far, and alternative explanations for the observed changes in toxicity were raised. Furthermore, all the referees felt that the conclusion of altered nucleocytoplasmic transport was premature and insufficiently explored. Finally, one referee felt that the basis of mutant-dependent exposure of the NES remained to be clarified in some greater detail. On the basis of these comments, we recommend the following three areas for improvement.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major conclusion of the study is that nuclear SOD1 is more toxic than cytosolic SOD1, suggesting that nuclear export by the mechanism described here is protective. However, the experiments to demonstrate this are not optimal, and some controls are missing. The authors have enforced wild type-like localization of mutant SOD1 by addition of a NLS. The consequence is that this rather abundant and over-expressed protein is constitutively imported and exported endlessly, thereby imposing a greater burden on the nuclear export machinery than would ordinarily be the case in the absence of a NLS. Thus, the increased toxicity might well be due to this (or to the appended NLS somehow having a toxic effect), and not necessarily to SOD1 localization per se. The more suitable and precise experiment is to determine whether L42Q (which is in fact the normal variant in mouse and not expected to disrupt folding by itself) changes the toxicity of G85R or other SOD1 mutants. By doing this, normal wild type-like localization is restored without adding any extra burden to the cell's trafficking pathways. In both the NLS and L42Q experiments, it is crucial to include wild type SOD1 as a control. This would ensure that any effects on toxicity are mutant-specific. These experiments in cultured mammalian cells are straightforward and the authors have all the tools to do it in a reasonable span of time. The referees and editor acknowledge that the analogous experiments in worms would take longer, but it is sufficiently important to wait for such results even if it exceeds the two-month revision timeline.</p><p>2) The experiment to suggest that nucleocytoplasmic transport is affected by SOD1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) is incomplete and rather preliminary. The observation of steady state differences in polyA FISH signal is insufficient to conclude an effect on transport, since other explanations such as altered mRNA processing or polyadenylation are possible. If the authors wish to make conclusions about transport, then the authors need to measure transport more directly. Furthermore, a key control in any experiments aimed at elucidating toxicity mechanisms would be to ensure that the effect is due to misfolded SOD1, and not just a highly-expressed NES-containing protein. Thus, it seems important to test whether their mCherry-P1 and mCherry-P2 constructs have any effect on mRNA localization (the prediction being that neither would have any effect in the authors' model, but P1 would have an effect in the alternative model above). The referees acknowledge that properly elucidating the effect on nucleocytoplasmic transport as a potential contributor to toxicity would require extensive studies. Thus, if the authors are not prepared to pursue such investigations for this paper, the recommendation is to remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref> and only speculate in the Discussion about toxicity mechanisms.</p><p>3) An important unanswered question is whether the exposure of NES by SOD1 mutations is an intrinsic property of the mutant protein, or is the result of an unfolding activity from the cell. A key experiment that may distinguish between these possibilities is to determine whether recombinant SOD1 purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> has the NES exposed in a mutant-specific manner, or if this is only a feature observed in the cellular context. Such an experiment would provide greater insight into the mechanism of NES exposure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23759.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A major conclusion of the study is that nuclear SOD1 is more toxic than cytosolic SOD1, suggesting that nuclear export by the mechanism described here is protective.

Thanks to the reviewers for suggesting the more suitable and precise experiment, that is, to use the L42Q substitution to restore mutant SOD1 nuclear localization instead of amending a NLS. Using this approach, we have confirmed that, as predicted, L42Q substitution restored SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using an anti-NLP immunoprecipitation approach (under native conditions), we demonstrated that the L42Q substitution does not cause exposure of the NES-like sequence in wild type SOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). L42Q substitution also did not change the amount of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> immunoprecipitated by anti-NLP, suggesting that it does not alter SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also showed that the toxicity of SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup> to NSC34 cells is similar to that of wild type SOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results strongly support that L42Q substitution has minimal effects on SOD1 folding. Therefore, SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> differs from SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> only in its ability to be exported from the nucleus. In sum, these results set the stage for further testing the toxicity of misfolded nuclear SOD1 by comparing SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> (misfolded, exported) versus SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> (misfolded, retained) in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model of ALS.</p><p>We generated several new transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> lines: SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> and the control SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup>. Three independent lines each for SOD1 variant were made, and these animals were compared with SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> and wild type SOD1 lines using several approaches, including subcellular localization, effects on locomotion (body bending), and survival. All of the SOD1 proteins were tagged with YFP for direct observation by fluorescence microscopy. We found that SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup> behaves similarly to wild type SOD1 for all aspects examined, which further confirms the L42Q substitution does not cause misfolding of SOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). As observed in cultured cells, SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> was cleared from the nuclei of motor neurons in both L1 and adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). In contrast, SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei in motor neurons in L1 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the nuclear localization of SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> was only observed in a fraction of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A possible explanation is that cytoplasmic aggregation of the mutant protein prevents its entry into the nucleus. Indeed, we found that in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, like SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> formed large cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Biochemical characterization demonstrated that SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> and SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> lines express the transgene at similar levels and also form similar amount of insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results support that SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> differs from SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> only in its nuclear localization.</p><p>We obtained two lines of evidence suggesting that nuclear localization of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> is toxic to neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. First, three lines of SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> worms all exhibited more severe defects in locomotion compared to SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As controls, three lines of SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup><italic>C. elegans</italic> showed body bending rates similar to their wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Second, there was a strong effect on survival for all three SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> lines, where lifespan decreased compared to the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As controls, all three SOD1<sup>L42Q</sup> lines were found to have similar survival curves as the wild type SOD1 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In search for the potential cause of death, we found that about 70% of SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> animals had egg-laying defects with an average of 4.2 eggs/worm hatched inside mothers, known as “bagging”. The bagging defect for SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> was significantly worse than was found for SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). About 17% of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> animals had an average of 2.4 eggs/worm hatched inside mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It is likely that loss of muscle function caused by severe motor neuron degeneration is responsible for these bagging phenotypes in SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> animals. Future studies are warranted to understand the mechanisms underlying the bagging phenotype observed for SOD1<sup>G85R/L42Q</sup> animals.</p><p>These results confirm that restoring nuclear localization of SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, via an L42Q substitution, can cause additional toxicity, whereas nuclear export of misfolded SOD1 has a protective effect to the cells. Because the potential complex effects associated with the amended NLS, as pointed out by the reviewers, we have removed all data using NLS-tagged SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> in this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The experiment to suggest that nucleocytoplasmic transport is affected by SOD1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) is incomplete and rather preliminary.

As suggested by the editor, we have now added new data showing that the interaction between CRM1 and SOD1 mutants is RanGTP-dependent using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results favor a model in which the exposure of NES by SOD1 mutations is an intrinsic property of the mutant protein.</p></body></sub-article></article>
