The MCM proteins themselves are bilobal with a N-terminal domain (NTD) that acts to stabilize binding to single-strand DNA (ssDNA), a C-terminal domain (CTD) that contains the conserved AAA<sup>+</sup> (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) motor domain that provide energy for translocation and DNA unwinding, and a winged-helix (WH) domain for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trakselis, 2016</xref>). DNA unwinding proceeds by encircling and translocating along the leading strand in the 3’−5’ direction, while sterically excluding the lagging strand template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bochman and Schwacha, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, six homologous proteins comprise the MCM2-7 heterohexameric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). MCM2-7 interacts with Cdc45 and the GINS heterotetramer (Psf1, 2, 3, Sld5) to form the active unwinding CMG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>). GINS binds primarily to the AAA<sup>+</sup> CTD of MCM5 bringing in Cdc45 to interact with and close the interface with MCM2, aligning the motor domains into a proper configuration for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). Archaea have a single MCM protein that is equally homologous to the six eukaryotic MCM2-7 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goswami et al., 2015</xref>), and in contrast to eukaryotes, the archaeal MCM helicase is active on its own in vitro and does not require accessory proteins for robust DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marinsek et al., 2006</xref>). Archaeal MCM forms a homohexameric complex but can also interact with orthologs of Cdc45 (RecJ) and the GINS (GINS23, GINS15) complex to stimulate the helicase activity further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshimochi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lang and Huang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), although Cdc45 (<italic>i.e.</italic> GAN) is not required for viability in the euryarchaea,<italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis,</italic> possibly implicating this protein as a redundant nuclease for Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhart et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Loading of the MCM complexes onto and encircling of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) origins have been a subject of intense experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frigola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>), but the consensus origin loaded double hexamer state places the NTDs together with the CTDs facing outwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). This head-to-head orientation achieved during initiation is also conserved with the analogous Large-T antigen of SV40 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Valle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomez-Lorenzo et al., 2003</xref>). There are still remaining questions as to how the MCM or CMG complex goes from encircling dsDNA to selecting one of the ssDNA strands for translocation. Recent data in the eukaryotic system shows this will involve cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) firing factors, additional components including MCM10, and ATP hydrolysis by MCM subunits to untwist the dsDNA to give two independent CMGs that have encircled opposing strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). Because the CMG complex translocates 3’ to 5’, the selection of one strand over the other will dictate whether the two hexamers dissociate from each other or pass over each other for elongation. These two mechanisms will be distinguished by whether the CTD or the NTD, respectively, are leading the way for unwinding. In yeast, the N-first mechanism of CMG translocation has been confirmed, which involves a physical passing of each helicase to regulate origin firing before establishing the replisome progression complex (RPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>), but this has not been confirmed in other species that contain MCM.</p><p>The binding orientation of the single archaeal MCM hexamer bound on fork DNA has been shown previously to place the CTD near the fork junction, suggesting a C-first mechanism of unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2014</xref>). An X-ray structure of an NTD construct of an archaeal MCM shows ssDNA binding orthogonal to the central channel consistent with either N-first or C-first translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Froelich et al., 2014</xref>). C-first translocation for MCM was analogous to the orientation of the homohexameric <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) DnaB, which although it has opposite unwinding polarity (5’−3’), also places its CTD RecA motor domain near the duplex region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jezewska et al., 1998</xref>). This is now directly challenged by the cryoEM data from higher order eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). The strong homology between the archaeal and eukaryotic DNA replication systems would not suggest significant differences in translocation and unwinding mechanisms of the MCM complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry and Bell, 2006</xref>).</p><p>This report characterizes both the distribution of archaeal MCM binding to the ssDNA regions of fork DNA as well as the translocation orientation of the MCM complex during active unwinding to compare the mechanistic properties between Domains. Many studies have focused on examining the static structural features of helicase binding to DNA or the mechanistic aspects of DNA translocation and unwinding polarity, but few have simultaneously examined both. Using multiple site-specific DNA footprinting techniques, the orientation population distribution of the DNA fork bound <italic>Saccharolobus</italic> (formally <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakai and Kurosawa, 2018</xref>]) <italic>solfataricus</italic> (<italic>Sso</italic>) MCM complex was determined. We show that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM can bind both strands of fork DNA in multiple orientations complicating interpretations, however the NTD adjacent to the duplex region (N@duplex) on a 3’-long arm fork is significantly favored, providing more insight into the productive orientation. Binding to fork DNA is affected by the WH domain at the C-terminus that influences the binding orientation. Deletion of the WH domain results in a loss of orientation specificity on 3’-long arm fork substrates mimicking the initial stages of helicase activation. Single-turnover DNA unwinding experiments reveal the stoichiometry of productively bound <italic>Sso</italic>MCM orientations that are influenced by the WH domain and correlate with an N-first translocation and unwinding mechanism. Finally, presteady-state fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments that directly monitor the translocation and unwinding direction of productive <italic>Sso</italic>MCM complexes confirm an N-first mode of unwinding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The orientation distribution of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM is mapped directly on equal arm fork DNA by localized footprinting</title><p>Previously, our group and others have shown that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM loads onto fork DNA with the CTD towards the duplex (C@duplex) binding orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2014</xref>), however, its active translocation orientation has yet to be determined. This C@duplex binding orientation has been used to speculate that MCM also translocates in a C-first orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Botchan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller and Enemark, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). However, more recent evidence has shown that when assembled within a leading strand holoenzyme complex, yeast MCM2-7 helicase assembles with the NTD leading the way (N-first) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). In order to more specifically quantify the binding orientation distribution of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM on model fork substrates, we utilized two separate and specific DNA cleavage strategies.</p><p>Single free cysteines within the CTD, at either C642 or C682, were utilized by mutating the other to alanine, releasing an inherent disulfide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>). Either cysteine was then labelled independently with the photoactivatable crosslinker, 4-azidophenacyl bromide (APB). APB attachment at C682 (C642A mutant) provided the greatest signal shift in mobility when crosslinked to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). APB crosslinking to DNA bases is generally non-specific after activation by UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pendergrast et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nodelman et al., 2017</xref>), yet we detected significant crosslinking and subsequent ssDNA cleavage even in the absence of direct UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This was dependent on specific attachment of APB to <italic>Sso</italic>MCM (lanes 5 vs. 3 or 4), and it was enhanced after exposure to UV light and alkaline digestion (lanes 9–11). Overall, <italic>Sso</italic>MCM-APB had many cut sites along the length of both ssDNA substrates favoring positioning at the middle of the ssDNA substrate, implicating nonspecific binding orientation at multiple positions.</p><p>To further investigate the orientation of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM on equal arm fork DNA, APB (for crosslinking/digestion) or FeBABE (for a localized hydroxyl radical Fenton footprinting reaction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owens et al., 1998</xref>) were conjugated at C682 using <italic>Sso</italic>MCM(C642A) mutant. Cleavage could be induced specifically with UV light/NaOH (APB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A or D</xref>) or hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic acid (FeBABE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B or E</xref>) on two separate forks labelled with 5’-Cy3 or 3’-Cy5 at the duplex end. In all situations, multiple cleavage sites were detected on the ssDNA region of the labelled strand (indicated by arrows), suggesting different orientation populations and positioning of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM. <italic>Sso</italic>MCM can bind 3’ or 5’ ssDNA arms with similar affinities to fork DNA, however when noncomplementary 3’ and 5’ fork arms are available, there is a preference for binding/encircling the 3’-arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Sso</italic>MCM has a significantly lower binding efficiency (~4 fold less) for duplex DNA over fork substrates measured at the single molecule level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>), essentially eliminating the possibility of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM encircling the duplex region and contributing significantly to cutting the ssDNA arms. Furthermore, anisotropy experiments performed with <italic>Sso</italic>MCM and duplex DNA also show a larger dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) over fork substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM preferentially binds ssDNA arms of the fork DNA. Moreover, stoichiometric (~1:1 MCM6:DNA) concentration ratios were maintained throughout to promote binding to the highest affinity site and limit nonspecific binding to the duplex region. To test this directly, DNaseI footprinting experiments and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) were performed and confirmed complete DNA binding without protection of the duplex region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Previously, we have shown that the 5’-excluded strand is protected from ssDNA nuclease digestion upon <italic>Sso</italic>MCM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 2011</xref>) and that titration of large amounts of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM on fork substrates does not compete off the external excluded strand to favor two hexamers binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carney and Trakselis, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the predominate bound species is a stoichiometric single <italic>Sso</italic>MCM hexamer encircling one ssDNA arm and interacting with the other on the exterior surface, but other minor populations also exist.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46096.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SsoMCM orientation mapping onto equal arm fork DNA substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) APB or (<bold>B</bold>) FeBABE orientation mapping of the 3’- encircled strand labelled at the 5’- duplex end with Cy3 on an equal arm fork DNA substrate with a 20 base duplex (DNA164/165-3).

This length was designed to be long enough to prevent translocation over duplex DNA and short enough to prevent helicase loading onto the 5’-arm. It has been previously shown that archaeal MCM requires &gt; 16 nts for productive binding/unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haugland et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, these orientation mapping experiments were repeated with APB labelled at C682 but limiting the 5’-arm to eight nts to enforce encircling of the 3’-arm.

There is a significant increase and reversed preference for orientating N@duplex for the 3’-long arm fork substrate over the equal arm fork substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that the 5’-long arm either impacts the helicase orientation or that multiple populations of helicases can exist bound on either the 3’- or 5’-arm of the equal arm fork.

The proportion of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM bound in a productive orientation and state can be determined in a single-turnover DNA unwinding experiment.

The proportion of productive translocating <italic>Sso</italic>MCM hexamers will correlate with the total unwound DNA fraction.

Binding assays for archaeal and yeast MCMs on fork or ssDNA show a global orientation preference for the C@duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2014</xref>), however, higher order complexes that include additional yeast replisome components orientate CMG with N@duplex, instead hypothesizing an N-first translocation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). This has also been recently confirmed with a x-ray structure of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM bound to ssDNA in an N-first confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meagher et al., 2019</xref>). The Costa and Diffley laboratories have provided some guidance that synergizes these two seemingly opposing results as intermediates during the loading, activation, and translocation steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>) that we can better explain mechanistically here.</p><p>According to our footprinting assays, there is evidence for placing either CTD or NTD of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM towards the duplex end. Our site specific footprinting experiments show that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM has a 3:1 preference for binding equal arm fork DNA with C@duplex, essentially consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>). When 3’-long arm fork DNA were used instead, there was a total reversal in orientation preference of 1.5:1 for binding N@duplex. Therefore, we suggest that a large proportion of the C@duplex in the equal arm fork DNA must have been contributed by the <italic>Sso</italic>MCM encircling the 5’- strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) but cutting the 3’-strand in proximity. Comparing relative intensities of footprinting for the 5’-strand strand on the equal arm fork substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) to the 5’-long arm substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), there is a higher intensity for equal arm fork DNA confirming that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM loaded on the 3’-encircled strand can cut the excluded strand from flexibility rendered by WH domain.</p><p>According to previous studies, the C-terminal WH domain of MCM is important for loading the helicase at origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samson and Bell, 2016b</xref>), but the overall DNA binding affinity of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM is not impaired with the WH deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Sso</italic>MCM constructs with a deleted WH domain should have no preference for binding DNA in a particular orientation. Footprinting studies with <italic>Sso</italic>MCM-WH show an almost 1:1 nonselection of loading onto equal arm or asymmetric arm fork substrates in either orientation, suggesting that along with the DNA polarity, the WH domain influences the orientation of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM at the loaded state.</p><p>Coupling footprinting fractions with single-turnover unwinding experiments helped determine the orientation fraction of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM involved in active unwinding. The unwinding fraction for equal arm fork DNA substrate is 0.26 and a fractional preference of 0.23 for binding with N@duplex suggesting an N-first translocation orientation. Although <italic>Sso</italic>MCM has a preference for loading on the 3’-arm of a fork substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>), we now show a significant population bound to the 5’-arm, however, <italic>Sso</italic>MCM bound to the 5’-arm is not productive with these substrates. Therefore, a 3’-long arm fork DNA substrate was used to restrict binding/loading onto only the translocating strand. On this substrate, <italic>Sso</italic>MCM has a 0.57 fractional preference for binding with N@duplex and also corresponds with single-turnover unwinding fraction of 0.54 corroborating an N-first unwinding translocation orientation and 3’−5’ polarity.</p><p>This <italic>Sso</italic>MCM loaded state (C@duplex) is analogous to an initial double hexamer converting to encircling one strand and excluded the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Based on the accepted structure of the MCM double hexamer loaded onto dsDNA origins, the NTDs interact in a head-to-head conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2015</xref>). From that state, there are two possible mechanisms for encircling either the 5’−3’ or 3’−5’ strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>); however in each case, the individual hexamers are still initially orientated in a C@duplex orientation, when both DNA strands are present. Once the excluded strand is melted and displaced outside of the central channel, it can engage with the exterior surface of MCM in a steric exclusion and wrapping (SEW) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 2011</xref>). This preloaded and sequestered state is what we have detected in this report using footprinting studies on equal-arm fork DNA (C@duplex). Interestingly, <italic>Sso</italic>MCM may have a higher affinity for bubble substrates over fork or ssDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pucci et al., 2004</xref>), which may be achieved through direct double hexamer interactions and/or alternative binding configurations with the bubble region to promote conformational activation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46096.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>SsoMCM loading at origins.</title><p>Model for loading double hexamer MCM at an origin of replication and the two pathways (i or ii) for encircling the 5’-3’ or 3’-5’ strands placing the CTD at the duplex (C@duplex).

Our presteady-state FRET experiments were performed to directly detect the orientation of the <italic>Sso</italic>MCM hexamer during active translocation and unwinding to be absolutely certain. Using this approach, we could directly monitor the translocation orientation between the NTD of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM and DNA to verify an N-first translocation mechanism.</p><p>Combining the results from footprinting, single-turnover unwinding, and presteady-state FRET studies now all support an N-first translocation/unwinding mechanism for <italic>Sso</italic>MCM. After loading at an origin, our results agree with the second pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, ii) for translocation, where two hexamers that have converted to encircling only one DNA strand have to bypass each other to proceed N- first. Similarly, AAA<sup>+</sup> papillomavirus E1 helicase which also translocates with 3’−5’ polarity employs a strand exclusion mechanism to unwind DNA proceeding N-first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). As suggested previously, this would provide an inherent physical control mechanism for DNA unwinding to regulate precise elongation timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and O'Donnell, 2018</xref>). If pathway i) is incorrectly selected, the N-first 3’−5’ translocation mechanism would inherently block unwinding and render those loaded MCM origins inactive. The consequences of this nonproductive orientation cannot be determined from our current experiments.</p><p>The sole selection and encircling of one strand over the other and the conformational steps necessary within the MCM double hexamer remain to be determined and are actively being pursued by a number of laboratories. Some insight into strand selection has be gleamed from a closer examination of the CMG assembly and activation process in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>), where ATP binding initiates CMG hexamer separation and early origin melting where DNA becomes underwound in preparation for ssDNA selection. Whether archaeal GINS and Cdc45 influences the binding population orientation on model forks remains to be determined, but the translocation orientation of N-first confirmed here will remain unchanged. Based on a cryo-EM structures of the T7 replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2019</xref>) and CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>) that include ssDNA, it is likely that a helical conformation of DNA will contact multiple subunits in the interior of the hexamer to not only engage one DNA strand to encircle but also for translocation. How the other excluded ssDNA strand slides out between subunits is not yet known but may include contributions of Cdc45 and MCM10 in eukaryotes to remodel CMG and engage that excluded strand on the exterior surface for stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petojevic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mayle et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Plasmid construct (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pET30a-SsoMCM (C642A)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeoch et al.

The current work provides an important biochemical study of an archaeal MCM that reinforces recent findings from homologous systems showing that the N-terminal region of the helicase advances into a DNA fork during unwinding. Collectively, these findings help settle the question of MCM orientation on DNA, providing important insights into replisome organization.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Amidst multiple binding orientations on fork DNA, <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> MCM helicase proceeds N-first for unwinding&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eric J Enemark (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The primary basis for this decision is that neither reviewer felt the data convincingly prove or disprove past work from other laboratories that debate the orientation of MCMs at the replication fork. They note that the overall design of the studies are similar to other experiments that use a double-stranded piece of DNA attached to various single-stranded tails, and which then use the position of the double-stranded region as the means to illustrate MCM orientation. They felt that this approach does not take into account the possibility that the double-stranded region itself helps dictate the MCM:DNA orientation, rather than the polarity of an encircled single strand (they note that the cited Li and O'Donnell structure is also based on this design and therefore is subject to the same concerns). Put another way, the sentiment was that the approach is based on a binary premise, namely, that the ring encircles one single-stranded tail, leaving the N-terminal tier or C-terminal tier will be proximal to the duplex, but that the data actually do not exclude scenarios in which the ring can encircle the duplex region of the DNA as well (which MCM rings are known to bind avidly). This uncertainty dampened confidence in the proposed model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The MCM complex of eukaryotes (MCM2-7) and archaea (MCM) is the &quot;engine&quot; that drives DNA translocation at the replication forks of all eukaryotes and archaea. The manuscript by Perera and Trakselis investigates the orientation of the MCM hexamer of the archaeal organism <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso</italic>MCM) in complex with DNA, especially forked DNA. Multiple earlier manuscripts indicated that the MCM complex translocates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with the C-terminal domain leading. More recent reports have indicated a reversed orientation such that the MCM complex translocates DNA with the N-terminal domain leading. The translocation orientation is vitally important because it has profound implications for replication initiation where two hexamers of a double-hexamer separate to independent single hexamers to initiate DNA replication in two bidirectional replication forks. The manuscript therefore addresses an important and timely topic, but a few alternative scenarios to the provided interpretation appear highly plausible, and these would continue to confuse assignment of MCM:DNA orientation.</p><p>The manuscript provides a likely means to reconcile the opposite translocation orientations observed previously: that the MCM ring is able to bind DNA species in multiple fashions, and that some of these might not be appropriate for DNA translocation. The manuscript develops this conceptual point by evaluating two scenarios of proximity of a duplex DNA portion to the N-terminal side or the C-terminal side of the MCM ring. Based on strand polarities, one of these should be appropriate for 3'-5' DNA translocation (the known polarity of the MCM helicase) while the other would not. The opposite orientation of these binding orientations would thus provide a basis to reconcile previous orientation studies that have led to opposite conclusions on translocation orientation.</p><p>However, this treatment does not consider all unproductive species that may have historically confused orientation experiments. In particular, a species where the ring encircles the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) should be considered. This is not anticipated to be a non-productive unwinding complex due to strand polarity but rather because the MCM ring has not adopted the appropriate strand exclusion topology needed for unwinding (See Fu et al., 2011 for demonstration of strand-exclusion during unwinding). Encircling of dsDNA could occur predominantly at the ATPase tier side or at the N-terminal tier side. In general, if the ring exclusively interacts with the duplex region, the overall 2-fold symmetry of duplex DNA predicts that both binding orientations will be degenerate and should therefore be observed in equal proportion. However, tailed or forked substrates (as used in this study) could develop a specific orientation preference if duplex DNA is encircled at one tier while the ssDNA region binds predominantly at the other tier (for example). Both tiers are known to bind to dsDNA and to ssDNA. Along these lines, the relative affinities of the respective tiers for different structural forms of DNA might have species-specific differences and account for previous differences in assigned orientation. Based on this possibility, the midpoint of the labelled strand may not accurately define the orientation of binding.</p><p>To further confuse orientation interpretation, the N-terminal tier of archaeal MCM rings binds single-stranded DNA roughly in the plane of the ring and approximately perpendicular to the channel (Froelich et al., (2014)). Although this binding occurs with a specific polarity, the coplanar MCM:DNA arrangement could be achieved with either 5'- or 3'- extensions to duplex DNA.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Papillomavirus E1 (a close relative of SV40 T-antigen) also forms a dumbbell-shaped double-hexamer with N-terminal sides facing each other. Ultimately, the two hexamers pass over one another in generating two bidirectional replication forks with the N-terminal domains leading in a &quot;strand exclusion&quot; mechanism. The description is essentially identical to &quot;pathway 2&quot; discussed in the present manuscript. Please see Figure S5 of Enemark and Joshua-Tor, (2006) and Figure 7 of Lee et al., 2014. These similarities should be cited. Notably, MCM2-7, MCM, and E1 all belong to the AAA+ family of ATPases and translocate DNA with a 3' to 5' polarity. MCM2-7 and E1 both serve a strand-exclusion helicase function during eukaryotic DNA replication.</p><p>2) Discussion section: The manuscript Froelich et al., (2014) reports the structure of the hexameric MCM N-terminal domain bound to single-stranded DNA. As no double-stranded DNA is present, this structure does not illustrate a preferred side for double-stranded DNA. Within its discussion, Froelich et al., (2014) places the structure in a mechanistic framework of DNA translocation with the C-terminal domain leading. The orientation used for this discussion was exclusively based on orientation determinations published in earlier manuscripts (i.e. McGeoch et al., 2005), which showed an orientation with the C-terminal domain leading. This was the best information available at the time. However, the structure itself is consistent with placing duplex DNA at either side, as illustrated in Figure 7B (middle panel) of Froelich et al., (2014), where double-stranded DNA is depicted &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; the hexameric ring. As such, Froelich et al., (2014) is consistent with both scenarios (placement of the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal domain proximal to double-stranded DNA).</p><p>3) For orientation purposes, the manuscript classifies the 3'-extension of a substrate as the &quot;encircled&quot; strand and a 5'-extension as the &quot;excluded&quot; strand (see manuscript's Figure 1). This is the correct assignment when presuming that the helicase preferentially moves towards the double-stranded region due to its 3'-5' polarity. However, the helicase could encircle a 5'-extension strand and follow its intrinsic 3'-5' polarity by moving away from the double-stranded region. The assignment that a given strand is encircled versus excluded implies that the ring somehow recognizes which end possesses a double-stranded region and that the double-stranded region (rather than strand polarities) dictates orientation. The simplest means for this to occur is if the ring actually encircles and binds the dsDNA portion (see main comments). Importantly, this would not be the productive unwinding species because it does not have a &quot;strand excluded&quot; topology.</p><p>4) The timescales of unwinding (Figure 4) differ dramatically from those of Figure 7. This could suggest that the generation of a species that is in the appropriate form for unwinding (MCM:DNA in the correct polarity/orientation, strand-excluded, and perhaps other attributes) may generally take a very long time to develop. Such a situation would be consistent with the overall notion that the MCM ring can bind DNA in multiple non-productive configurations. If so, the rapidly formed species examined in Figure 7 would likely represent one of the non-productive conformations or even a mixture of these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript aims in addressing the question of the polarity of the MCM helicase from the archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> at the replication fork.

There is very little discussion of why the studies are reaching completely different conclusions. Based on the data and experiments reported I am not convinced the current manuscript conclusions are correct. Some of my comments are listed below.</p><p>The rationale for the study, as outlined in the Introduction, is the eukaryotic CMG EM structure from the Li and O'Donnell laboratories suggesting that the helicase N-terminal domain is pointing toward the fork. However, unlike eukaryotic helicases, most archaeal MCM are active on their own and do not need an assistance of other proteins, such as the CMG complex, for speed and processivity (for example see Schermerhorn et al., 2016).

Why wasn't the CMG complex included in this study? This is especially important as the rationale for the study and to challenge the previous work was the comparison to the eukaryotic CMG complex. The authors state that &quot;strong homology between the archaeal and eukaryotic DNA replication systems would not suggest significant differences in translocation and unwinding mechanisms of the MCM complexes&quot; in the Introduction. Therefore, the CMG complex should be included in the study.</p><p>In subsection “The orientation of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM on asymmetric arm fork DNA by localized footprinting has preference for N@duplex.” it is stated that &quot;it is probable that some proportion of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM is encircling the 5'-arm, complicating our analysis and interpretation. Therefore, these orientation mapping experiments were repeated with APB labelled at C682 but limiting the 5'-arm to 8 bases and forcing encircling of the 3'-arm. It has been previously shown that archaeal MCM requires &gt;15 nucleotides for productive binding/unwinding (Haugland et al., 2006)&quot;. There are several issues with this statement. It was shown with many archaeal species, including <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, that a 5' overhang ssDNA region is not required for helicase activity (for examples see Barry et al., 2007; Chong et al., 2000; Grainge et al., 2003). Why not remove the 5' overhang region altogether? Why leave 8 nucleotides (or 5 nucleotides, in some of the experiments)? If, as stated by the authors, the 5' ssDNA is a problem, it can and should be removed. And, the paper by Haugland et al. describes a unique case among the archaeal species studied. This is the only archaeal MCM that is stimulated by binding to the Cdc6 proteins. The activity of all other archaeal MCMs is inhibited by the Cdc6 proteins. In addition, the study by Haugland et al., did not test a 15 nucleotide ssDNA overhang region as stated in the current manuscript.</p><p>Past studies clearly show that the archaeal MCM from different species can displace streptavidin from biotin during translocation along the DNA (for example see: Shin et al., 2013) including a paper from Dr. Trakselis' group on the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> MCM (Graham et al., 2011). Therefore, it is not clear what the value is of the experiments shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, as the premise of the experiments is the blocking of DNA unwinding by the biotin/streptavidin complex. If the experimental conditions are different than those previously reported (and therefore no displacement can be observed) then, at a minimum, a control experiment with a biotin trap should be performed to demonstrate this. Dr. Trakselis' group is clearly aware that streptavidin is displaced from biotin by the helicase as they performed such an experiment in a previous publication (Graham et al., 2011).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Amidst multiple binding orientations on fork DNA, <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> MCM helicase proceeds N-first for unwinding&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing editor, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission without guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>The reviewers have evaluated the revised manuscript. Both still share a general concern on the use of double-strand-containing substrates in assigning orientation, and the premise that all species examined are in a &quot;strand excluded&quot; topology. The basis for this concern derives from the fact that MCM rings are capable of interacting with DNA in multiple ways. Biologically, the ring initially encircles double-stranded DNA, and ultimately encircles only one single strand of DNA. Biochemical and structural studies show that the N-terminal tier and the C-terminal AAA+ tier are both able to bind double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, which leads to many possible MCM:DNA structural forms when hybrid single/double-stranded DNA substrates are mixed with an MCM ring. Some alternative binding scenarios with fork DNA include:</p><p>1) Species where the ring does not establish a &quot;strand-excluded&quot; topology. Numerous variations are possible-- with the double-stranded DNA portion either at either the N-terminal side, the C-terminal side, or throughout the ring. In the first two cases, it cannot be ruled out that the double-stranded DNA dictates binding orientation rather than encircled strand polarity. The response argues against the presence of these species based on stronger binding to fork substrates versus duplex substrates. This is not an effective argument because the fork substrates could still adopt a topology that is not &quot;strand excluded&quot;-- such as binding of the dsDNA portion at one tier and ssDNA portion(s) at the other(s).</p><p>2) Events where the fork binds with an appropriate &quot;strand excluded&quot; topology, but the ssDNA binds exclusively at the N-terminal tier and not the translocating modules (presumably at the AAA+ tier). The N-terminal tier might have a different binding polarity preference than the AAA+ tier, and such a species would then not have the form used for translocation/unwinding.</p><p>In the response, the authors state, &quot;…it is our position that duplex DNA would also aid in the positioning of the hexamer along the ssDNA substrate.&quot;-- this is the precise concern that the reviewers have when interpreting MCM orientation studies.</p><p>For the translocation orientation experiments (Figure 5 and Figure 6), a species in which the ring encircles the 38 bp duplex region at the right cannot be ruled out. Also, species where the ring encircles both arms of the fork at the left cannot be ruled out. Neither is in the correct topology for translocation.</p><p>An experiment to determine DNA translocation orientation needs to ensure that the orientation is dictated by the polarity of encircled ssDNA in a binding form derived from the translocating modules (presumably in the AAA+ tier), and that the &quot;lagging strand&quot; (if included) is fully excluded from the ring. These concerns could be resolved by using single-strand-only substrates for the FRET experiment in which the experiment also requires ATPase driven translocation. This could probably be achieved by using a &quot;reasonably long&quot; strand. Such a substrate would remove all the potential points of confusion associated with the possibility of dsDNA driving orientation instead of strand polarity. The attached PDF illustrates the basis for the concern and how this might possibly be resolved with reasonably long single-strand-only substrates. Experiments with this substrate (or an alternative experiment capable of resolving the stated issues) would need to be conducted before a recommendation concerning publication could be made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46096.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The primary basis for this decision is that neither reviewer felt the data convincingly prove or disprove past work from other laboratories that debate the orientation of MCMs at the replication fork. They note that the overall design of the studies are similar to other experiments that use a double-stranded piece of DNA attached to various single-stranded tails, and which then use the position of the double-stranded region as the means to illustrate MCM orientation. They felt that this approach does not take into account the possibility that the double-stranded region itself helps dictate the MCM:DNA orientation, rather than the polarity of an encircled single strand (they note that the cited Li and O'Donnell structure is also based on this design and therefore is subject to the same concerns). Put another way, the sentiment was that the approach is based on a binary premise, namely, that the ring encircles one single-stranded tail, leaving the N-terminal tier or C-terminal tier will be proximal to the duplex, but that the data actually do not exclude scenarios in which the ring can encircle the duplex region of the DNA as well (which MCM rings are known to bind avidly). This uncertainty dampened confidence in the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>A few simple additional experiments and some better explanations in the text can answer <underline>all</underline> of the reviewers concerns regarding orientation of the <italic>Sso</italic>MCM hexamer during translocation. We want to stress that there are many examples of MCM hexamers binding to duplex DNA and this is an important step during origin binding, but our present studies address the translocation direction during the elongation phase of DNA replication. Even more, we have identified the WH motif at the C-terminal domain of MCM to be important in orientating the bound MCM complex with C@duplex. This explains C@duplex bound orientations (McGeoch, 2005 and Rothenberg, 2008) from our previous work that has confused the field with regards to perceived translocation orientation. In this manuscript, we have directly reconciled binding orientation with that of translocation orientation on fork substrates by quantifying both.</p><p>We feel that this updated manuscript has better clarity, explanation, and discussion on the importance of the possible binding orientations that lead to one productive translocation orientation along ssDNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The MCM complex of eukaryotes (MCM2-7) and archaea (MCM) is the &quot;engine&quot; that drives DNA translocation at the replication forks of all eukaryotes and archaea. The manuscript by Perera and Trakselis investigates the orientation of the MCM hexamer of the archaeal organism Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoMCM) in complex with DNA, especially forked DNA. Multiple earlier manuscripts indicated that the MCM complex translocates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with the C-terminal domain leading. More recent reports have indicated a reversed orientation such that the MCM complex translocates DNA with the N-terminal domain leading. The translocation orientation is vitally important because it has profound implications for replication initiation where two hexamers of a double-hexamer separate to independent single hexamers to initiate DNA replication in two bidirectional replication forks. The manuscript therefore addresses an important and timely topic, but a few alternative scenarios to the provided interpretation appear highly plausible, and these would continue to confuse assignment of MCM:DNA orientation.</p><p>The manuscript provides a likely means to reconcile the opposite translocation orientations observed previously: that the MCM ring is able to bind DNA species in multiple fashions, and that some of these might not be appropriate for DNA translocation. The manuscript develops this conceptual point by evaluating two scenarios of proximity of a duplex DNA portion to the N-terminal side or the C-terminal side of the MCM ring. Based on strand polarities, one of these should be appropriate for 3'-5' DNA translocation (the known polarity of the MCM helicase) while the other would not. The opposite orientation of these binding orientations would thus provide a basis to reconcile previous orientation studies that have led to opposite conclusions on translocation orientation.</p><p>However, this treatment does not consider all unproductive species that may have historically confused orientation experiments. In particular, a species where the ring encircles the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously, we had directly measured at the single molecule level a preference for binding/encircling the 3’-arm over that of the 5’ arm. (Rothenberg et al., 2007). In that same paper, we also measured a significantly lower <italic>Sso</italic>MCM binding efficiency (~4fold less) for duplex DNA over fork substrates. However, this was not articulated well in the previous manuscript to justify the interpretation of our experiments. It is now (Results section).</p><p>Furthermore, anisotropy experiments performed with <italic>Sso</italic>MCM and duplex DNA also show a higher dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) over fork substrates (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), suggesting that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM preferentially binds ssDNA arms of the fork DNA. Moreover, titration of large amounts of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM on fork substrates does not compete off the external excluded strand to favor two hexamers binding (Graham et al., 2011. For our footprinting experiments, we are careful to be stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric (MCM<sub>6</sub>:DNA) to promote binding to the highest affinity site and limit nonspecific binding. Interestingly, we do measure footprinting into the duplex a few bases (Figure 1 and Figure 2), however there is never any indication of cleavage past that towards the duplex end that would be consistent with specific duplex binding. Therefore, the predominate bound species is a stochiometric single <italic>Sso</italic>MCM hexamer encircling the 3’-arm and interacting with the excluded 5’-arm on the exterior surface, but other minor populations also exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is not anticipated to be a non-productive unwinding complex due to strand polarity but rather because the MCM ring has not adopted the appropriate strand exclusion topology needed for unwinding (See Fu et al., 2011 for demonstration of strand-exclusion during unwinding). Encircling of dsDNA could occur predominantly at the ATPase tier side or at the N-terminal tier side. In general, if the ring exclusively interacts with the duplex region, the overall 2-fold symmetry of duplex DNA predicts that both binding orientations will be degenerate and should therefore be observed in equal proportion.</p></disp-quote><p>Duplex DNA binding of MCM to origin DNA is known to occur prior to the engagement of a single strand for translocation (as illustrated in Figure 7). However, in this manuscript we are not attempting to answer that question. Rather we are restricting our experiments to test the translocation orientation along ssDNA that is competent for DNA unwinding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, tailed or forked substrates (as used in this study) could develop a specific orientation preference if duplex DNA is encircled at one tier while the ssDNA region binds predominantly at the other tier (for example). Both tiers are known to bind to dsDNA and to ssDNA. Along these lines, the relative affinities of the respective tiers for different structural forms of DNA might have species-specific differences and account for previous differences in assigned orientation. Based on this possibility, the midpoint of the labeled strand may not accurately define the orientation of binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The midpoint of the ssDNA tail is selected as a convenient place for assigning MCM orientation in a binary fashion. It may not be perfect, but in our footprinting experiments, there is a void in this region that allows us to be confident of this binary distinction in orientation. We were careful to design the length of the ssDNA to be consistent with the site size on DNA and the lateral length of the central channel from available structures. It is possible that part of the N-terminal tier could be encircling duplex DNA (as in Langston and O’Donnell, 2017) however the rest of the complex will be encircling and translocating on ssDNA. This would require further structural/mechanistic confirmation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To further confuse orientation interpretation, the N-terminal tier of archaeal MCM rings binds single-stranded DNA roughly in the plane of the ring and approximately perpendicular to the channel (Froelich et al., (2014)). Although this binding occurs with a specific polarity, the coplanar MCM:DNA arrangement could be achieved with either 5'- or 3'- extensions to duplex DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect to the reviewer, this structure (Froelich et al., 2014), while informative in identifying a MSSB binding motif, does not attempt to address the orientation question. Rather ssDNA binding is visualized with only 7 nucleotides of a 30 base poly dT substrate with a single N-terminal domain protein from another species. We have included this reference in the Introduction. As the reviewer knows, there are several other DNA binding motifs contained within the full length MCM hexamer that would direct ssDNA longitudinally through the entire central channel. Moreover, it is our position that duplex DNA would also aid in the positioning of the hexamer along the ssDNA substrate. A coplanar MCM:DNA arrangement is not expected to occur with full length protein and is instead a better indication of helical engagement of ssDNA within the central channel either for melting of the duplex or translocation (Abid, Diffley and Costa et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Papillomavirus E1 (a close relative of SV40 T-antigen) also forms a dumbbell-shaped double-hexamer with N-terminal sides facing each other. Ultimately, the two hexamers pass over one another in generating two bidirectional replication forks with the N-terminal domains leading in a &quot;strand exclusion&quot; mechanism. The description is essentially identical to &quot;pathway 2&quot; discussed in the present manuscript. Please see Figure S5 of Enemark and Joshua-Tor, (2006) and Figure 7 of Lee et al., 2014. These similarities should be cited. Notably, MCM2-7, MCM, and E1 all belong to the AAA+ family of ATPases and translocate DNA with a 3' to 5' polarity. MCM2-7 and E1 both serve a strand-exclusion helicase function during eukaryotic DNA replication.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has correctly pointed out the similarities between different organisms that belong to the same AAA+ family of ATPases.

This sentence is not meant to justify or refute the reviewers own work but to attempt to put the available literature in perspective. We appreciate that their structure does not define the orientation directly and is only built on the available data at the time. We have taken out their reference in that sentence and instead moved to the Introduction to describe this interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For orientation purposes, the manuscript classifies the 3'-extension of a substrate as the &quot;encircled&quot; strand and a 5'-extension as the &quot;excluded&quot; strand (see manuscript's Figure 1).

Therefore, asymmetric fork arm substrates with 3’-long arm and a 8 nt short 5’-arm are the best substrate to define the orientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And, the paper by Haugland et al. describes a unique case among the archaeal species studied. This is the only archaeal MCM that is stimulated by binding to the Cdc6 proteins. The activity of all other archaeal MCMs is inhibited by the Cdc6 proteins. In addition, the study by Haugland et al., did not test a 15 nucleotide ssDNA overhang region as stated in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake (15 vs 16 nts) in our previous manuscript. The current manuscript has been corrected “It has been previously shown that archaeal MCM requires &gt;16 nucleotides for productive binding/unwinding.” (subsection “The orientation of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM on asymmetric arm fork DNA by localized footprinting has preference for N@duplex”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Past studies clearly show that the archaeal MCM from different species can displace streptavidin from biotin during translocation along the DNA (for example see: Shin et al., 2013) including a paper from Dr. Trakselis' group on the S. solfataricus MCM (Graham et al., 2011). Therefore, it is not clear what the value is of the experiments shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, as the premise of the experiments is the blocking of DNA unwinding by the biotin/streptavidin complex. If the experimental conditions are different than those previously reported (and therefore no displacement can be observed) then, at a minimum, a control experiment with a biotin trap should be performed to demonstrate this. Dr. Trakselis' group is clearly aware that streptavidin is displaced from biotin by the helicase as they performed such an experiment in a previous publication (Graham et al., 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>Although MCM helicases have been shown to displace streptavidin from biotin on the translocating strand, the rate of this displacement is on the order of hours. Our experimental time courses for these assays are 5 minutes, where no streptavidin displacement was shown previously (Graham et al., 2011). A linear rate of SA displacement was calculated as 0.0067 min<sup>-1</sup>, whereas our measured translocation rate is 0.0015 s-1 or 0.09 min<sup>-1</sup> (~13-14 fold faster translocation than SA displacement in this manuscript).</p><p>Therefore, upon addition of ATP, the MCM helicase will translocate into the duplex region (~9 nts), stall at the streptavidin block, resulting in an increased FRET value only for a fluorescent label on the leading face before displacing SA.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have evaluated the revised manuscript. Both still share a general concern on the use of double-strand-containing substrates in assigning orientation, and the premise that all species examined are in a &quot;strand excluded&quot; topology. The basis for this concern derives from the fact that MCM rings are capable of interacting with DNA in multiple ways. Biologically, the ring initially encircles double-stranded DNA, and ultimately encircles only one single strand of DNA. Biochemical and structural studies show that the N-terminal tier and the C-terminal AAA+ tier are both able to bind double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, which leads to many possible MCM:DNA structural forms when hybrid single/double-stranded DNA substrates are mixed with an MCM ring. Some alternative binding scenarios with fork DNA include:</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to submit a revised manuscript with further supporting data in response to the reviewer comments. We are cognizant to the fact that MCM interacts with DNA in multiple ways; a fact that is recognized by the Title of this manuscript and something we intended to quantify as best we can here. We hope that with the additional requested experiments that were performed, this manuscript is now ready for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Species where the ring does not establish a &quot;strand-excluded&quot; topology. Numerous variations are possible-- with the double-stranded DNA portion either at either the N-terminal side, the C-terminal side, or throughout the ring. In the first two cases, it cannot be ruled out that the double-stranded DNA dictates binding orientation rather than encircled strand polarity. The response argues against the presence of these species based on stronger binding to fork substrates versus duplex substrates. This is not an effective argument because the fork substrates could still adopt a topology that is not &quot;strand excluded&quot;-- such as binding of the dsDNA portion at one tier and ssDNA portion(s) at the other(s).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concern regarding the ability of the two tiers of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM to accommodate both ss and dsDNA. This is the same concern we set out to address at the beginning of this manuscript by carefully maintaining stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric MCM<sub>6</sub>:DNA ratios (~1:1) to promote binding of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM to the highest affinity site, which is the ssDNA region (Rothenberg, 2007 and anisotropy data here, Figure 1—figure supplement 3) and limit non-specific binding to duplex regions (Rothenberg 2007) in our site-specific footprinting experiments. This will prevent <italic>Sso</italic>MCM loading onto both ssDNA arms or duplex regions of a given fork substrate at the same time and instead favor encircling of the ssDNA arms adjacent to the duplex.</p><p>In order to experimentally support the above hypothesis, we performed new DNaseI footprinting coupled with EMSAs on a fluorescently labeled fork DNA substrate (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). DNaseI can cleave both ss and dsDNA, however the specific activity for cleaving dsDNA is 500-fold more efficient than ssDNA. Protection by <italic>Sso</italic>MCM bound to a dsDNA region will prevent its digestion by DNaseI. Our new data shows that at MCM<sub>6</sub>:DNA @1:1 up to 1:1.5 ratios, the duplex region is not protected in the presence of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM. Therefore, <italic>Sso</italic>MCM is not binding the duplex region specifically. EMSAs confirm that at these ratios, there is complete formation of a MCM<sub>6</sub>:DNA complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Events where the fork binds with an appropriate &quot;strand excluded&quot; topology, but the ssDNA binds exclusively at the N-terminal tier and not the translocating modules (presumably at the AAA+ tier). The N-terminal tier might have a different binding polarity preference than the AAA+ tier, and such a species would then not have the form used for translocation/unwinding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already addressed this specific situation using our site-specific footprinting experiments coupled with single-turnover unwinding experiments. In our footprinting studies, we have observed two different populations of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM which we term as C@duplex and N@duplex that load onto ssDNA regions (Figure 1 and Figure 2). This nomenclature actually represents at least 4 possible binding confirmations (encircling either ss arm and in both orientations). Using the fraction from the single-turnover unwinding data (Figure 4), we correlated the footprinting data with the productive orientation populations utilized for unwinding to confirm productive unwinding for N@duplex in a 3’-5’ translocation polarity (already described).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the response, the authors state, &quot;…it is our position that duplex DNA would also aid in the positioning of the hexamer along the ssDNA substrate.&quot;-- this is the precise concern that the reviewers have when interpreting MCM orientation studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement was made in reference specifically for the WH domain influencing the orientation C@duplex or N@duplex (Figure 1 and Figure 2 vs Figure 3) for which we describe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the translocation orientation experiments (Figure 5 and Figure 6), a species in which the ring encircles the 38 bp duplex region at the right cannot be ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, as this is most likely the confirmation that would be expected upon origin binding (Figure 8, top). The substrate used in Figure 5 and Figure 6 does have 38 bp duplex, however, it also includes a FAM label and Biotin. Once streptavidin is bound to this substrate, the available duplex binding region would shrink substantially.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have performed the exact experiments as suggested by the reviewer and incorporated them as Figure 7 in the main text. Of course, we are limited in the duplex length based on the temperature of the activity assays (Tm) but were able to design a 20bp duplex that is stable at the reaction temperature of 57<sup>o</sup>C along with an 80 base ssDNA region that has minimal secondary structure. (See further explanation below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, species where the ring encircles both arms of the fork at the left cannot be ruled out. Neither is in the correct topology for translocation.</p></disp-quote><p>This an interesting yet unconventional idea for which the reviewer may be eluding to a modified steric exclusion (MSE, i.e. O’Donnell) or a side channel extrusion (SCE, i.e. Chen and LargeT) modes. Previously, we had used biotin/ streptavidin on either strand of a fork substrate and verified that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM unwinds via a Steric Exclusion mode (Graham, 2011, Figure 1C and D). Even though the <italic>Sso</italic>MCM central channel can accommodate duplex DNA, if <italic>Sso</italic>MCM was to encircle both noncomplementary arms of the fork, unwinding of dsDNA would not be possible via a steric exclusion mode as determined previously with strand specific streptavidin blocks. Whether <italic>Sso</italic>MCM can encircle both noncomplementary strands as one possible mode of binding cannot be ruled out with our current experiments and would be outside the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An experiment to determine DNA translocation orientation needs to ensure that the orientation is dictated by the polarity of encircled ssDNA in a binding form derived from the translocating modules (presumably in the AAA+ tier), and that the &quot;lagging strand&quot; (if included) is fully excluded from the ring.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, streptavidin blocks confirmed that the lagging strand is fully excluded from the central channel (i.e. Steric exclusion) during unwinding (Graham et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These concerns could be resolved by using single-strand-only substrates for the FRET experiment in which the experiment also requires ATPase driven translocation. This could probably be achieved by using a &quot;reasonably long&quot; strand. Such a substrate would remove all the potential points of confusion associated with the possibility of dsDNA driving orientation instead of strand polarity. The attached PDF illustrates the basis for the concern and how this might possibly be resolved with reasonably long single-strand-only substrates. Experiments with this substrate (or an alternative experiment capable of resolving the stated issues) would need to be conducted before a recommendation concerning publication could be made.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers and to resolve the concerns described above, new presteady-state FRET experiments were conducted with 80 nucleotide long ssDNA with a biotin (+streptavidin) placed at either end acting as a steric block to translocation polarity (new Figure 8). A FAM label on the adjacent duplex end is utilized for detecting FRET from a translocating <italic>Sso</italic>MCM labelled with Cy3 at the N or C-terminal tiers.</p><p>When N-terminally Cy3 labeled <italic>Sso</italic>MCM with 3’-long arm was used, we observed an increase in FRET in the presence of ATP suggesting that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM moves along ssDNA 3’-5’ towards the duplex end, while C-terminally labeled <italic>Sso</italic>MCM does not show an increase in FRET (Figure 8). These results corroborate directly with Figure 7, suggesting a N-first translocation mechanism. Interestingly, a substrate with reverse polarity shows a decrease in FRET only when C-terminally labeled <italic>Sso</italic>MCM is used again suggesting 3’-5’ translocation. These results correlate with a specific translocation orientation polarity preference of the two MCM tiers, where N-tier is facing the 5’-end and C-tier facing the 3’-end. This validates a 3’-5’ translocation polarity for <italic>Sso</italic>MCM, where the N-tier is leading the way.</p><p>These additional experiments do not change our initial interpretation that <italic>Sso</italic>MCM has multiple binding orientations but proceeds N-first, but they help to confirm this conclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
