To address this issue, we exposed mice to a single episode of voluntary exercise, and permanently marked activated mature hippocampal dentate granule cells using conditional Fos-TRAP mice. Exercise-activated neurons (Fos-TRAPed) showed an input-selective increase in dendritic spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents at 3 days post-exercise, indicative of exercise-induced structural plasticity. Laser-capture microdissection and RNASeq of activated neurons revealed that the most highly induced transcript was <italic>Mtss1L</italic>, a little-studied I-BAR domain-containing gene, which we hypothesized could be involved in membrane curvature and dendritic spine formation. shRNA-mediated <italic>Mtss1L</italic> knockdown in vivo prevented the exercise-induced increases in spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our results link short-term effects of exercise to activity-dependent expression of Mtss1L, which we propose as a novel effector of activity-dependent rearrangement of synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>synaptic function</kwd><kwd>I-BAR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS080979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name><name><surname>Westbrook</surname><given-names>Gary L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-18-1-0598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnell</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01-BX002949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnell</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009160</institution-id><institution>Lawrence Ellison Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31-NS098597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hendricks</surname><given-names>Wiiliam D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single episodes of voluntary exercise induced a functional increase in hippocampal synapses mediated by activity-dependent expression of the BAR protein Mtss1L, acting as a novel early effector of synapse formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The beneficial cognitive effects of physical exercise cross the lifespan as well as disease boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mandolesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saraulli et al., 2017</xref>). Exercise alters neural activity in local hippocampal circuits, presumably by enhancing learning and memory through short- and long-term changes in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vivar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Voss et al., 2013</xref>). The dentate gyrus is uniquely important in learning and memory, acting as an input stage for encoding contextual and spatial information from multiple brain regions. This circuit is well suited to its biological function because of its sparse coding design, with only a few dentate granule cells active at any one time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Severa et al., 2017</xref>). These properties also provide an ideal network to investigate how exercise-induced changes in activity-dependent gene expression affect hippocampal structural and synaptic plasticity in vivo.</p><p>Most studies have focused on the cognitive effects of sustained exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Creer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Uda et al., 2006</xref>). However, memory improvements are well documented after acute bouts of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mandolesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Perini et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the response to a single episode of exercise may be better suited to uncover cellular and molecular cascades that form and rearrange synapses, and which evolve over minutes to weeks following exercise. We reasoned that these mechanisms could be unmasked by a single period of voluntary exercise in vivo, followed by functional and molecular analysis of subsequent changes specific to neurons that were activated during the exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>cFos<italic><sup>creERT2</sup></italic> transgenic mice (Fos-TRAP) provide valid proxies of neural activity (<italic>12</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a means to permanently label activated dentate granule cells. During a two-hour exposure to running wheels, mice ran approximately 3 km. We examined activated cells 3 days post-running in Fos-TRAP mice crossed with a TdT reporter line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used Fos immunohistochemistry at 1 hr post-exercise, confirming robust stimulation of neuronal activity in mature granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The increase in Fos expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, matched the increase in TdTomato-positive cells (TdT<sup>+</sup>) measured 3 or 7 day later in Fos-TRAP mice, indicating that activated granule cells were accurately and permanently labeled during the 2 hr time window <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We refer to these cells as ‘exercise-TRAPed’. To investigate whether a single bout of exercise activated a specific subset of granule cells, we exercise TRAPed dentate granule cells (TdT<sup>+</sup>) and compared this population to an ensemble activated by a subsequent re-exposure to exercise either 1 or 4 days later, as measured by Fos immunohistochemistry at 2 hr after the 2nd exercise period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When the two exercise periods were separated by 24 hr, only 13% of exercise TRAPed cells were activated in the 2nd exercise period. There was almost no overlap between the two neuronal ensembles (1%) when the two periods were separated by 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel). Exercise-TRAPed neurons were distributed through the granule cell body layer, without labeling in the subgranular zone. This indicates that our exercise protocol activated stochastic, non-overlapping sets of mature granule cells, consistent with the sparse coding design of this circuit.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45920.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single exposure to running wheel induces transient synaptic plasticity in exercise-TRAPed dentate granule cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing exercise paradigm.

I-BAR protein function at synapses is thought to be mediated by several interaction domains including the N-terminal I-BAR domain and a C-terminal actin-monomer-binding WH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), and may depend on slice variants. For example, the effects of MIM in cerebellar neurons is splice-variant specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sistig et al., 2017</xref>). Mtss1L also has two known splice variants, both of which were targeted in our overexpression and knockdown experiments. It will be interesting to investigate how protein-protein interactions and splice variants of Mtss1L contribute to their role in synaptic remodeling.</p><p>At a circuit level, the laminar-specific increase in synaptic function suggests that acute exercise had a network-specific effect. Entorhinal inputs to the outer molecular layer, the distal dendrites of mature granule cells, have been previously associated with contextual information and particularly the ‘how’ and ‘when’ aspects of encoding memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>). How might these results relate to the beneficial effects of exercise? One possibility consistent with our data is that exercise acts as a preconditioning signal that primes exercise-activated neurons for contextual information incoming during the several days following exercise. This represents a broader time window than is usually associated with short-term plasticity. For example, human studies give support for the idea that exercise within 4 hr of a learning task improved memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Dongen et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to examine if exercise enhances the pattern of granule cell responses to spatial or context-specific tasks. Our identification of Mtss1L as an activity-dependent I-BAR domain protein makes it ideally suited to act as an early mediator of structural plasticity following neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were in compliance with approved IACUC protocols at Oregon Health and Science University. Both female and male mice from a C57BL6/J background were used for experiments, aged 6–8 weeks at the time of surgery. TRAP mice were heterozygous for the <italic>cFos<sup>creERT2</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>); some were also heterozygous for the <italic>B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)/Hze/J(Ai14</italic>;JAX#007908) allele for experiments involving tdTomato labeling. Cryopreserved Mtss1l<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> sperm was obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository (The Knockout Mouse Project, Mouse Biology Program, University of California, Davis, CA) under the identifier CSD79567. The Mtss1l<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> mouse line was re-derived by in vitro fertilization at the OHSU transgenic core. Genotype was confirmed by PCR. <italic>Mtss1L (</italic>recently renamed to <italic>Mtss2,</italic> MTSS I-BAR domain containing 2) deletion in Mtss1L<sup>-/-</sup> KO KOMP mice was confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry in the cerebellum. Cerebellar Purkinje cells, perhaps because of their high basal firing rate, are the only cells in the brain with detectable basal Mtss1L expression. Mtss1L mRNA and protein levels were undetectable in the cerebellum of Mtss1L<sup>-/-</sup> KO KOMP mice. The KOMP allele contains a Neo cassette driven by a mouse phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK), which is bidirectional and may interefere with gene expression. Thus, for the generation of the Mtss1L<sup>+/-</sup> reporter mice, the Neo cassette was removed in a tissue-specific manner by stereotaxically injecting an AAV nuGFP-Cre PGK into the dentate gyrus of Mtss1L<sup>-/-</sup> KO KOMP mice 3 weeks prior to experiments. All mice were housed in plastic cages with disposable bedding on a standard light cycle with food and water available ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotaxic injections</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using an isoflurane delivery system (Veterinary Anesthesia Systems Co.) by spontaneous respiration, and placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame. Skin was cleaned with antiseptic and topical lidocaine was applied before an incision was made. The dentate gyrus was targeted by placing Burr holes at x:±1.1 mm, y: −1.9 mm from bregma. Using a 10 µl Hamilton syringe with a 30 ga needle and the Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelting), 2 µl mixed viral stock (1 µl of each virus) was delivered at 0.25 µl/min at z-depths of 2.5 and 2.3 mm. The syringe was left in place for 1 min after each injection before slow withdrawal. The skin above the injection site was closed using veterinary glue. Animals received post-operative analgesia with topical lidocaine and flavored acetaminophen in the drinking water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>TRAP induction</title><p>Tamoxifen was dissolved at 20 mg/ml in corn oil by sonication at 37°C for 5 min. The dissolved tamoxifen was then stored in aliquots at –20°C for up to several weeks or used immediately. The dissolved solution was injected intraperitoneally at 150 mg/kg. For exercise-TRAP, tamoxifen was administered 23 hr before exposure to the running wheel. Experiments were begun 48 hr after tamoxifen administration to allow for reporter expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Voluntary exercise and fixed wheel protocol</title><p>Both homecage and exercise groups were housed together until 7 days before the experiment, then they were singled housed in an oversized (rat) sedentary cages (43 × 21.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) to allow acclimation in the novel environment before tamoxifen administration. At 23 hr post-tamoxifen injection, a running wheel (free or locked) was introduced in the cage of animals in the exercise group and mice had free access to running or exploring for 2 hr at the beginning of the dark period, after which the running wheel was removed from the cage. Total distance (km) was measured using an odometer. All mouse groups were handled for 5 days before tamoxifen administration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were terminally anesthetized, transcardially perfused with saline and 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and brains were post-fixed overnight. Coronal sections (100 μm) of the hippocampus were collected and permeabilized in 0.4% Triton in PBS (PBST) for 30 min. Sections were then blocked for 30 min with 5% horse serum in PBST and incubated overnight (4°C) with primary antibody in 5% horse serum/PBST. After extensive washing, sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488, 568 or 647 (Molecular Probes), for 2hrs at room temperature. They were then washed in PBST (2 × 10 min) and mounted with Dapi Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). The primary antibodies used were: anti-c- fos (1:500, Santa-Cruz), anti-tdTomato (1:500, Clontech), anti-MAP2 (1:500, Sigma), anti-ABBA/Mtss1L (1:500, Millipore), anti-VGLUT2 (1:500, Synaptic Systems) and anti-beta-galactosidase (1:20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). All antibodies have been well characterized in prior studies in our laboratory, and staining was not observed when the primary antibody was omitted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging and morphological analysis</title><p>For imaging we used an LSM 7 MP laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging; Thornwood, NY). All cell and dendritic spine counting and dendritic arbor tracing were done manually with ImageJ and Imaris (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD). For quantification of immunopositive cells, six hippocampal slices at set intervals from dorsal to ventral were stained per animal; 3–6 animals were analyzed per group. A 49 μm z-stack (consisting of seven optical sections of 7 μm thickness) was obtained from every slice. Positive cells were counted per field from every z-stack, averaged per mouse and the results were pooled to generate group mean values. For analysis of spine density of dentate granule cells, sections were imaged with a 63x objective with 2.5x optical zoom. The span of z-stack was tailored to the thickness of a single segment of dendrite with 0.1 µm distance between planes. Dendritic spines were imaged and analyzed in the middle (MML) and outer molecular (OML) layers of the dentate gyrus. The MML and OML were distinguished based on the pattern of VGluT2 immunofluorescence, which begins at the border between the inner molecular layer and middle molecular layer. MML dendritic segments were therefore imaged at the beginning of the VGluT2 staining nearest the granule cell body layer, whereas OML dendritic segments were imaged at the distal tip of the molecular layer. The same microscope settings (laser intensity and gain) were used for each experimental group analyzed. Slides were coded and imaged by an investigator blinded to experimental condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)</title><p>To obtain nuclei of exercise-TRAPed cells, fresh frozen coronal brain sections (12 µm) were collected by cryostat sectioning on polyethylene napthalate membrane slides. Sections were fixed for 1 min in 75% ethanol, followed by a final wash in 100% ethanol for 1 min. Pools of 150 RFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>-</sup> individual cells were laser captured from the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus of each mouse using a Leica Microsystem LMD system under a HC PL FL L 63/0.60 XT objective and collected in lysis buffer (50 μl RLT buffer, Qiagen). Total RNA from LCM samples was isolated separately from each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA extraction and RNAseq library preparation</title><p>RNA was extracted from laser-captured pooled nuclei using RNeasy mini-elute column with a modified protocol. Briefly, cells were picked from laser capture microscopy onto caps of 0.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, 50 μl RLT buffer was added immediately, and placed on ice. After spinning down the samples, 300 μl RLT was added to each sample, mixed well and vortexed for 30 s. After a brief spin, 2 ng tRNA was added as carrier and 625 µl 100% ETOH was added into each sample and mixed well. After a quick spin, samples were loaded onto RNeasy mini-elute columns, washed, dried and eluted in 10 μl RNAse-free water. 8 μl RNA was used for reverse transcription using Superscribe reverse transcriptase 2 ul, DTT 0.1M 0.5 ul, 5x RT buffer 4 μl at 42°C for 1.5 hr then heat inactivated at 75°C for 20 min (self-developed protocol for RNA extraction, superscribe reverse transcriptase was from Clontech, protocol adopted from manufacturer’s protocol for smarter single-cell RNAseq v4). TSO (<named-content content-type="sequence">AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACrG +GrG</named-content>) was ordered from Exicon. After RNA, PCR was carried out using Seqamp DNA polymerase and amplification PCR primer (<named-content content-type="sequence">AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC</named-content>). Half of amplified cDNA was used for qPCR and the other half made into sequencing libraries using Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina) Quality of cDNA libraries were checked on Bioanalyzer using DNA high sensitivity Chip. 2 nM library dilutions were mixed and denatured, 1.8 pmol mixed library was sequenced on Nextseq500 (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced to a depth of 14–30 million reads. Alignment rate of total reads was above 90% across all samples. Gene level coverage at 1x was ~10000 genes and even among all samples with no 3’ or 5’ end bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNAseq analysis</title><p>After sequencing, sequencing quality was checked by fastqc, raw reads were aligned with STAR 2.5b on Illumina Basespace. Raw reads were then plotted as a violin plot using the R ggplot2 package. Genes with reads lower than 64 in all samples were filtered away and dataframe was replotted to check data distribution. Individual samples that differed significantly in their count distribution due to technical issues were discarded from further analysis. Data dispersion and differential expression analysis was done on filtered reads using DEseq2 unpaired analysis. FDR and &lt;0.15 fold enrichment and &gt; 1.5 fold were considered as enriched genes and were plotted in MA-plot using R script. Genes enriched in TRAPed cells at 3 days post exercise were further analyzed by PantherGO for GO terms enrichment (release 20160321, GO Ontology database released 2016-05-20); protein-protein reactions analyzed by Cytoscape application Biogenet.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Real-time qPCR</title><p>To quantify gene expression levels, amplified cDNA was mixed with the iQ5 SYBR Green PCR master mix (Biorad) and 5 pmol of both forward and reverse primers were used. For qPCR of our miRNA-based shRNA, miRNA was converted to cDNA using the QuantiMiR reverse transcription kit (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, RNA was polyadenylated with ATP by poly(A) polymerase at 37°C for 1 hr and reverse transcribed using 0.5 µg of poly(T) adapter primer. Each miRNA was detected by the mature DNA sequence as the forward primer and a 3′ universal reverse primer provided in the QuantiMir RT kit. Human small nuclear U6 RNA was amplified as an internal control. qPCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All qPCR performed using SYBR Green was conducted at 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The specificity of the reaction was verified by melt curve analysis. Relative expression was calculated using mouse Ubc or 18S as internal controls as specified in the Figure legends.

The tissue was chopped into 1 mm cubes with fine scissors and transferred to a 15-ml tube using a Pasteur pipette. This tube was placed in a water bath at 37°C with the papain solution, separately, and both were allowed to equilibrate at this temperature for 5 min. The tissue was then carefully transferred into the papain solution and placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm at 37°C for 15 min. The tissue was then gently transferred from the papain solution into a 15-ml tube containing 2 ml HBSS. This step was repeated 2X to remove any residual papain.

Five min after dilution of Lipofectamine 2000, the diluted DNA was combined with the diluted lipid. The solutions were gently mixed and then left for 20 min at room temperature to allow the DNA–Lipofectamine 2000 lipoplexes to form. 100 µl of transfection complex was added to each well containing cells and medium, and the cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr after which transfection media was changed.

In summary, 8-week-old male and female mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and injections of 1.2% avertin (Sigma-Aldrich). Mice were perfused with 10 mL of ice-cold cold N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG)-based cutting solution, containing the following (in mM): 93 NMDG, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 24 glucose, 20 HEPES, 5 Na-ascorbate, 5 N-acetyl cysteine, 3 Na-pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, two thiourea, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Transverse 300-µm-thick hippocampal sections were cut in ice-cold NMDG solution on a Leica VT1200S vibratome. Slices recovered in warm (34°C) NMDG solution for 15 min. Slices were transferred to room temperature in standard ACSF and allowed to recover for at least 1 hr prior to recording. Dentate granule cell whole-cell recordings were made with 3–5 MΩ borosilicate glass pipets filled with a Cs<sup>+</sup>-based internal solution containing (in mM): 113 Cs-gluconate, 17.5 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 8 NaCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 0.05 Alexa Fluor 488, pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. Osmolarity was adjusted to 295 mOsm and QX-314-Cl (5 mM; Tocris Bioscience) was included to block unclamped action potentials. The junction potential was 8 mV and left uncorrected. Granule cells were visually identified on an Olympus BX-51WI microscope using infrared differential interference contrast imaging. To ensure relatively equal stimulation intensity between cells during paired simultaneous tdT +and tdT- recordings, neighboring tdT +and tdT- (control) cells were selected. Cells were only considered ‘neighbors’ if they were within roughly ±2 cell bodies distance apart in the x and y planes, and roughly ±1 cell body distance in the z plane. Granule cells were filled with AlexaFluor 488 to ensure dendritic overlap. Bi-polar stimulating electrodes (FHC) were placed in distally in the OML and medially in the MML, to ensure OML and MML-specific stimulation of lateral and medial perforant path, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Electrical stimulation was delivered with a constant current stimulator (Digitimer, Inc); intensity was tittered to produce 50–100 pA EPSCs in tdT- cells. Proximity to the stimulating electrode and recording configuration was randomly assigned. Cells were voltage-clamped to −70 mV and signals were amplified using two AxoClamp 200B amplifiers (Molecular Devices), Bessel filtered at 5 kHz, and captured at 10 kHz with an analog-to-digital converter (National Instruments).

What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic function triggered by the inverse BAR protein, Mtss1L&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present work where Mtss1L is identified as an exercise induced hippocampal gene, then show modulation of Mtss1L levels changes exercise induced spine density. Overall there are few papers on I-BAR genes in the nervous system and even fewer on Mtss1L making this work potentially novel.</p><p>The authors address mechanisms contributing to exercise-induced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus using Fos-TRAP mice to identify exercise-activated dentate granule cells. They show that brief bouts of running result in changes in spine density and synaptic strength, and they perform RNASeq to identify potential molecular mediators. shRNA knock-down of one highly-upregulated gene, Mtss1L, was sufficient to block the exercise-induced change in spines and EPSCs. Thus, they propose Mtss1L is a novel effector of activity-dependent synapse function. Overall the experiments, analysis and interpretations are convincing and the conclusions are interesting.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors don't directly show that Mtss1L expression is activity dependent. Their in vitro data suggest it is BDNF dependent, but do not show changes in firing activity cause Mtss1L expression. It is unclear how closely the synaptic changes are associated with exercise rather than then Fos-expressing status of GCs (which could occur under various conditions and in the homecage). Since the authors strongly focus on exercise and subsequent cognitive benefits in the introduction, it is important to confirm that these are exercise-mediated effects.</p><p>- Figure 2/Figure 6. All of the functional data involves comparison of TRAPed and non-TRAPed (control) GCs in the exercise condition. To confirm that the effects result from exercise, the author should address functional synaptic differences in TRAPed and control GCs in the non-exercise condition. This would address the possibility that TRAPed cells exhibit increased OML synaptic function in the absence of exercise.</p><p>- Figure 4 addresses the expression of Mtss1L in the DG in response to exercise, but the images are not very helpful. Higher magnification images are needed to illustrate the expression pattern. It is also unclear why the authors used the KOMP approach rather than the antibody shown in Figure 5A. Co-labeling of Mtss1L and Fos-TRAP before and after exercise should be obtained to confirm that it is upregulated only in Fos-TRAPed GCs.</p><p>- Results, fifth paragraph: Key reagent validation is necessary. The KOMP Mtss1L<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> allele is reporter tagged allele with conditional potential. LacZ activity with this allele is not Cre dependent. LacZ activity can be eliminated with Flp expression. Treating with Cre will excise the Neo cassette and exons 7 and 8 leaving LacZ expressed and unaffected. Of concern is the lack of characterization of the allele and the apparently unnecessary manipulations on their animals (nuGFP-Cre injection). Additional controls need to be included that are required of those making or using an allele for the first time. The authors should more clearly explain the motivation for nuGFP-CRE line of experiments, as it is not clear in the text.</p><p>- Additionally, several sequencing and array studies suggest Mtss1L expression in neurons is ambiguous, but high in radial glia (Saarikangas et al., 2008), astrocytes (astrocyternaseq.org), oligodendrocyte progenitors (https://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html, described in Zhang et al., 2014, J. Neurosci.). Additional experiments to better characterize Mtss1L staining would be incredibly helpful in resolving this ambiguity.</p><p>- The Mtss1L paralog Mtss1 have multiple splice variants that are biologically important controlling localization in the cell and other functions. Given the similarity one may expect similar for Mtss1L and clearly documenting the spliceform used is essential. Related, Figure 5C and D – the interpretation of these overexpression experiments will depend strongly on the spliceform of Mtss1L used. Saarikangas et al. (2015) demonstrated the Mtss1 IMD domain alone is sufficient to induce extra spines, which is almost completely identical to Mtss1L. However, Mtss1 and Mtss1L have different overexpression phenotypes, suggesting domains outside the N-terminal IMD region are biologically important. Without explaining what form of Mtss1L is being used it's impossible for readers to determine whether these overexpression phenotypes reflect Mtss1L function, or whether a truncated form is mimicking roles established for Mtss1.</p><p>- Figure 6D. The authors show that expressing Mtss1L is sufficient to alter spines in GCs in the absence of exercise, suggesting an important contribution to on-going synaptic plasticity. Thus, it seems counter-intuitive that knockdown of Mtss1L had no effect on EPSCs in the basal condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This should be explained (as it relates to the first point).</p><p>[Editors’ note: formal revisions were requested, following approval of the authors’ plan of action.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic function triggered by the inverse BAR protein, Mtss1L&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paul F Worley (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews and your revision plan with one another. The revision plan is generally acceptable, but there is one additional experiment, listed under essential revisions, below, that will bolster the specific claims made in the Abstract and Introduction. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were not fully satisfied about the revision response to point 2 relating to the relationship between the authors conclusions about Mtss1L-induced synapse/spine plasticity and exercise.</p><p>There is no doubt that Fos+ cells represent an active population of GCs in the DG, sometimes referred to as &quot;engram&quot; cells. The Tonegawa lab has used a similar approach to show that Fos+ GCs have greater evoked EPSCs and spine density compared to Fos- GCs after a 5 min exposure to novel context (see Supplementary Figure 7 of Ryan et al., 2015). The authors should do a similar experiment – repeat the experiment of 2B in mice that have not undergone exercise – to test whether exercise is really required for this main outcome measure. The Ryan et al. data suggests that the synaptic function and spine difference between Fos+ and Fos- cells will exist in the absence of exercise (i.e. exercise is not required). The result of this experiment could differentiate whether Mtss1L is simply an activity-dependent gene downstream of Fos or whether it is specifically related to exercise-induced activity as indicated in the Abstract and Introduction. The outcome of this experiment does not change the mechanistic novelty of the role of Mtss1L in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, but it could affect the conclusions that the authors make about this mechanism in the context of exercise. At the very least, the authors should discuss their results in the context of what has been reported about synapses/spines of Fos+ and Fos- GCs in the absence of exercise, which is very similar to what they are currently ascribing to an effect of exercise.</p><p>It is unclear how closely the synaptic changes are associated with exercise rather than then Fos-expressing status of GCs (which could occur under various conditions and in the homecage).

Our experiments were specifically setup to reveal changes occurring over days, not minutes, that is, the typical time frame of activity-dependent gene expression. Whether Mtss1L is induced by short-term activity is not the point; what’s important is that Mtss1L expression occurs over a period of days. So the BDNF response is on point—activity induces expression of BDNF, which then induces expression of Mtss1L. What’s interesting about our results is the focus on a brief period exercise, which few investigators have examined. The point of the paper is to examine genes that were activated by exercise, not to claim that exercise is the only stimulus that can activate dentate granule cells. We can adjust the text to clarify this issue, but we see no point in additional experiments.</p><p>Additionally, Fos is universally accepted as a measure of neural activity, and we show definitively in Figure 1 that the single bout of exercise causes a 5-fold increase in Fos labeled cells within the tamoxifen-induced time window, and that the expression in homecage is very low given the sparse nature of the dentate gyrus. We confirm in vitro in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 that neurons in the Fos-TRAP mouse are similarly sensitive to depolarization as Fos immunohistochemistry. Thus our view is that this result is clear-cut and shows definitively that our stimulus (exercise) led to the Fos-TRAP labeled cells used for the analysis. We agree that a small fraction of Fos-TRAP labeled could have been activated within the taxomifen time window by a different stimulus, but that would not affect any of our conclusions. The suggestion to measure firing rate of the Fos-TRAP labeled cells is not a feasible experiment in vivo and would only show that Fos is activated by neural activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2/Figure 6.

For the convenience of the reviewer we have included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> with direct comparison of the data. Additionally, we have previously reported that OML and MML perforant path EPSCs in mature granule cells have similar amplitudes (Woods et al., 2018) using both electrical stimulation and pathway-specific Ch2R labeling of LEC and MEC inputs. Thus the appropriate control group that we used is neurons that were not Fos-labeled, but in the same slice, and in the case of the physiology experiments they are induced by the same exact stimulus in pairs of neighboring granule cells. We think this difficult experiment is unequivocal and the best possible control. Comparing between groups of animals, some exercised and some not, is not a good experimental design given the variability between slices in placement of stimulating electrodes, and thus would not be interpretable for the purpose of this manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Spine densities were similar in OML and MML of Fos-TRAPed homecage cells.</title><p>(OML 3 days: 0.94 ± 0.1, MML: 0.99 ± 0.1, n=5).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45920-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4 addresses the expression of Mtss1L in the DG in response to exercise, but the images are not very helpful.

Figure 4 will be replaced, including higher magnification inserts allowing better visualization of the expression pattern in dentate granule cells. Unfortunately, none of the available antibodies against Mtss1L stain with high resolution in tissue and thus we used the galactosidase reporter expression of the KOMP mouse to examine expression in tissue. We acknowledge that this approach does not provide the cell compartment specificity that would be ideal. We are working on a KI reporter mouse but we do not think we should be required to create new antibodies or mice for this novel gene as these experiments extend beyond the scope of the manuscript and are not necessary for any of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Results, fifth paragraph: Key reagent validation is necessary.

The authors should more clearly explain the motivation for nuGFP-CRE line of experiments, as it is not clear in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer that LacZ activity is not Cre-dependent in the Mtss1L<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> allele and we apologize for the misstatement that we will correct. Because the PGK promoter of the Neomycin gene is bidirectional, which may interfere with gene expression, KOMP recommends removing the Neo cassette Therefore, we did this in tissue-specific way using AAV nuGFP-Cre to remove PGK-Neo cassette in a tissue specific manner.

Neurosci.). Additional experiments to better characterize Mtss1L staining would be incredibly helpful in resolving this ambiguity.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results are not ambiguous with respect to expression in dentate granule cells as our experiments are focused on specific populations of activated neurons; and the RNA seq results were validated by PCR and with the in vitro experiments and KOMP beta-galactosidase reporter. We agree that a better antibody would be useful, but this is not possible until we have a KI reporter as antibodies with the necessary sensitivity are not available as shown above. However, the ambiguous results the reviewer/editor mentions can be explained by the activity-dependence of MtsslL and by the lack of cell- and condition-specific conditions in these prior studies. We can discuss this point more fully in the text. Of course, Mtss1L may have a role in other cell types such as glia, but that is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The Mtss1L paralog Mtss1 have multiple splice variants that are biologically important controlling localization in the cell and other functions. Given the similarity one may expect similar for Mtss1L and clearly documenting the spliceform used is essential. Related, Figure 5C and D – the interpretation of these overexpression experiments will depend strongly on the spliceform of Mtss1L used. Saarikangas et al. (2015) demonstrated the Mtss1 IMD domain alone is sufficient to induce extra spines, which is almost completely identical to Mtss1L. However, Mtss1 and Mtss1L have different overexpression phenotypes, suggesting domains outside the N-terminal IMD region are biologically important. Without explaining what form of Mtss1L is being used it's impossible for readers to determine whether these overexpression phenotypes reflect Mtss1L function, or whether a truncated form is mimicking roles established for Mtss1.</p></disp-quote><p>We should emphasize that the editor/reviewer is extrapolating from Mtss1, which is not the gene under study in this manuscript. The construct used for the overexpression studies was a full length Mtss1L</p><p>(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BC060632.1) that includes the two known variants. The second variant differs in the 5' UTR, lacks a portion of the 5' coding region, and uses a downstream start codon compared to variant 1. It encodes isoform 2, which has a shorter N-terminus compared to isoform 1. The points raised about splice variants will be interesting to explore in the future, but we think the experiments are interpretable as presented. We can add to the Discussion that Mtss1 has splice variants and that this issue would be interesting to explore for Mtss1L.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6D. The authors show that expressing Mtss1L is sufficient to alter spines in GCs in the absence of exercise, suggesting an important contribution to on-going synaptic plasticity. Thus, it seems counter-intuitive that knockdown of Mtss1L had no effect on EPSCs in the basal condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This should be explained (as it relates to the first point).</p></disp-quote><p>We view this as the expected limitation of any over-expression experiment, particularly given that Mtss1L is not expressed in dentate granule cells in the basal condition. Thus the result is <italic>not</italic> counter-intuitive. As we show Mtss1L is not expressed at detectable levels in the absence of stimuli increasing neural activity – in our case a single bout of exercise. The value of the over-expression experiments is merely to show that Mtss1L is capable of increasing dendritic spines based on its function as an I-BAR protein. We can add to the text to make this clear.</p><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were not fully satisfied about the revision response to point 2 relating to the relationship between the authors conclusions about Mtss1L-induced synapse/spine plasticity and exercise.</p><p>There is no doubt that Fos+ cells represent an active population of GCs in the DG, sometimes referred to as &quot;engram&quot; cells. The Tonegawa lab has used a similar approach to show that Fos+ GCs have greater evoked EPSCs and spine density compared to Fos- GCs after a 5 min exposure to novel context (see Supplementary Figure 7 of Ryan et al., 2015). The authors should do a similar experiment – repeat the experiment of 2B in mice that have not undergone exercise – to test whether exercise is really required for this main outcome measure. The Ryan et al. data suggests that the synaptic function and spine difference between Fos+ and Fos- cells will exist in the absence of exercise (i.e. exercise is not required). The result of this experiment could differentiate whether Mtss1L is simply an activity-dependent gene downstream of Fos or whether it is specifically related to exercise-induced activity as indicated in the Abstract and Introduction. The outcome of this experiment does not change the mechanistic novelty of the role of Mtss1L in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, but it could affect the conclusions that the authors make about this mechanism in the context of exercise. At the very least, the authors should discuss their results in the context of what has been reported about synapses/spines of Fos+ and Fos- GCs in the absence of exercise, which is very similar to what they are currently ascribing to an effect of exercise.</p><p>It is unclear how closely the synaptic changes are associated with exercise rather than then Fos-expressing status of GCs (which could occur under various conditions and in the homecage). Since the authors strongly focus on exercise and subsequent cognitive benefits in the Introduction, it is important to confirm that these are exercise-mediated effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The point of our experiments was to use exercise as a physiologically relevant stimulus, and the experimental design was developed to allow us to examine the time course of activation of genes following a single bout of exercise. We used this stimulus because exercise is such an important physiological stimulus and relevant to humans. It is important to make clear that we did not suggest that exercise is the only stimulus that would activate granule cells. The editor/reviewer’s comment that “whether Mtss1L is simply an activity-dependent gene downstream of Fos…” understates our results as our experiments identified Mtss1L as an activity-dependent gene and effector of synaptic reorganization. Likewise, as we demonstrated in control experiments, Fos-TRAP was used as a proxy for neuronal activity and does not necessarily imply that Mtss1L activation is molecularly coupled to Fos, although it could be. We make no claims in that regard.</p><p>With regard to the Ryan et al. (2015), the authors did not address the laminar site of spines or EPSCs or attempt to link the stimulus to specific genes. Thus direct comparison is difficult, but we have no doubt that novel experiences will activate dentate granule cells. As a control for our exercise protocol, we have previously tested the effects of introducing a fixed running wheel into the environment for 2 hours – the equivalent of a novel object. Mice explored the wheel but did not run on it. This resulted in a modest increase in Fos-TRAPed cells (ca. 2-fold, vs. 4-fold for exercise) and Mtss1L expression (3-fold compared to 9-fold, by RT-PCR). This increase was above baseline but less than observed with our exercise protocol. This data makes the point that other stimuli can upregulate Mtss1L. We have included this data as a supplementary figure, and now make it clearer in the Discussion that we are not trying to argue (nor did the original version) that exercise is the only stimulus that might activate Mtss1L – in fact we fully expect it is not.</p></body></sub-article></article>
