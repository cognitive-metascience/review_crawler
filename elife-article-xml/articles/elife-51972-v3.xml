(SWR) arise ‘spontaneously’ in CA3 and propagate recent memory traces outward to the neocortex to facilitate memory consolidation there. Using voltage and extracellular glutamate transient recording over widespread regions of mice dorsal neocortex in relation to CA1 multiunit activity (MUA) and SWR, we find that the largest SWR-related modulation occurs in retrosplenial cortex; however, contrary to the unidirectional hypothesis, neocortical activation exhibited a continuum of activation timings relative to SWRs, varying from leading to lagging. Thus, contrary to the model in which SWRs arise ‘spontaneously’ in the hippocampus, neocortical activation often precedes SWRs and may thus constitute a trigger event in which neocortical information seeds associative reactivation of hippocampal ‘indices’. This timing continuum is consistent with a dynamics in which older, more consolidated memories may in fact initiate the hippocampal-neocortical dialog, whereas reactivation of newer memories may be initiated predominantly in the hippocampus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>hippocampal-neocortical interaction</kwd><kwd>memory consolidation</kwd><kwd>sharp-wave ripple</kwd><kwd>wide-field mesoscale optical imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>40352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1631465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNaughton</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000145</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates -

This idea is supported by observations of replay of recently active neural ensemble patterns in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kudrimoti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nádasdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pavlides and Winson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>) and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Euston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffman and McNaughton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qin et al., 1997</xref>), a key role of SWS in enabling structural rearrangements of neocortical synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and effects of interruptions of SWS on memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gais et al., 2007</xref>). More specifically, replay of recent hippocampal patterns has been shown to be concentrated in SWR bursts (transient, 100–250 Hz, local field potential oscillations) and that SWRs significantly predict reactivation of neocortical ensembles during up-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, post-training, closed-loop interruption of SWR has a negative effect on memory for tasks that normally depend on the hippocampus for acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>). Altogether, these works suggest that interactions between neocortex and hippocampus during SWS support memory processes.</p><p>A prevalent model is that SWRs arise ‘spontaneously’ in CA3, which could lead to memory retrieval due to attractor network dynamic, and propagate outward to the neocortex through CA1 to enable memory consolidation there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csicsvari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen and McNaughton, 1996</xref>). Moreover, the hippocampal memory indexing theory (HMIT) and the complementary learning systems theory (CLST) are two other prominent theories pointing to a functional relationship between neocortex and hippocampus for the retrieval of memories and their integration into neocortical connections. According to HMIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNaughton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>), the hippocampus generates an ‘index code’ which is stored within weakly interacting neocortical processing modules at the time of the experience and serves to coordinate retrieval of complete memories either during behavior or sleep. According to the CLST, repetition of this reactivation process is believed to enable a consolidation process whereby the stored information is refined and eventually encoded by intra-neocortical connections in a form that is more categorically structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Winocur and Moscovitch, 2011</xref>) and relatively independent of the hippocampus. The increasing evidence favoring this memory-consolidation-by-replay theory suggests that a more detailed study of the spatiotemporal relationships between SWR and neocortical activation during sleep is of paramount importance.</p><p>Previous studies, using primarily electrophysiological methods, have focused on functional relationships between SWRs and a single or a few discrete neocortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battaglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khodagholy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mölle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Opalka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>). These studies have shown that a given neocortical region can activate and deactivate around SWR times, which reflects the sleep-related neocortical slow oscillation (SO), and that SO can be spatially local or global propagating waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, recently combined fast time-scale electrophysiological techniques with whole brain Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) fMRI imaging provided a snapshot of the cooperative patterns of the large numbers of brain structures involved either leading to or responding to hippocampal SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2015</xref>). Although these studies have improved our understanding of hippocampal-neocortical interactions, their conclusions were limited because: (a) the electrophysiological approaches have been unable to resolve the regional structure and dynamics of HPC-NC interaction across a large neocortical area due to relatively sparse spatial sampling (b) fMRI studies generally rely on an indirect measures of neuronal activity and the nature of the underlying neuronal activity correlate (i.e. synaptic and spiking activity) remain unclear. Given the physiological speed of neuronal communication, the cause-effect relationships are hard to decipher with certainty with the resolution at the scale of seconds of the fMRI method. In the present study we expand upon previous theoretical and experimental studies. We combined wide-field optical imaging of dorsal neocortex of mice, covering most of sensory and motor cortices and some association areas, with concurrent electrophysiological monitoring of hippocampal SWRs and MUA during natural sleep and under urethane anesthesia, which produces a state that is in many respects similar to natural sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthó et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clement et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pagliardini et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>We report both a spatial and temporal continuum in the degree and onset timing of modulation of neocortical activity around SWRs, thereby providing a spatiotemporal map of potential interactions between hippocampus and neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental protocol for investigating dynamics of hippocampal-neocortical interactions during sleep</title><p>Using in vivo wide-field of view mesoscale optical imaging and voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bermudez-Contreras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferezou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kyweriga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shoham et al., 1999</xref>) and genetically encoded sensor of extracellular glutamate (iGluSnFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we imaged neocortical activity dynamics from a large cranial window in the right hemisphere and combined it with electrophysiology in the ipsilateral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>) to capture hippocampal SWRs and MUA. Unlike calcium reporters (e.g., GCaMP6) with slow kinetics, both VSD and iGluSnFR measures electrical activity with relatively high temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the high level of synchrony in neocortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>) and hippocampal SWR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>) across hemispheres, we decided to record unilaterally from neocortex and hippocampus. Imaging unilaterally has the advantage of larger coverage of neocortical regions, particularly more lateral ones like primary auditory cortex. In some of the conducted VSD imaging experiments, a bipolar electrode was utilized to record neocortical LFP. The wide-field optical imaging of membrane potential activity in a given region of interest was correlated with LFP activity recorded from the same neocortical site confirming that the optical voltage signal reflects underlying electrophysiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arieli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We conducted our experiments under both natural sleep and urethane anesthesia. Urethane anesthesia has been reported to model natural sleep; In particular, characteristic electrophysiological signatures of slow-wave sleep (SWS) including up- and down-states, delta waves, spindles, and hippocampal SWR are present under urethane anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthó et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clement et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pagliardini et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wolansky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cii</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). We confirmed that the quantities, reported in the following sections, were not different across urethane anesthesia versus sleep and VSD versus iGluSnFR imaging conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; Figure 2—figure supplement 7). For natural sleep experiments, conducted on iGluSnFR mice under head-restrained condition, we used neck muscle electromyogram (EMG) recordings and hippocampal delta-to-theta band power ratio to score sleep state. Sleep scores were further validated by monitoring pupil diameter from each animal and comparing the distribution of physiological measures in different sleep states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>).

To investigate this temporal relationship further, we focused on RSC as an exemplar region, since it was the most modulated region around SWRs. Investigation on an individual SWR basis showed that the timings of RSC peak activity relative to SWRs forms a continuum spanning from negative (before) to positive (after) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To clarify what properties of SWRs co-vary with the temporal order of RSC activation relative to SWRs, we calculated an Asymmetry Index (AI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>) which is defined as the difference between mean activity in the intervals ± Δt after and before the SWRs center, divided by their sum, such that positive and negative values represent activity tending to follow or to precede the SWR, respectively. AI was used instead of peak time because, AI, which is calculated based on integral of a signal, is less noisy, and hence more reliable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). AIs were calculated for peri-SWR RSC traces, and are referred as RSC AI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). As expected, RSC AI values were strongly correlated with AI values similarly calculated for regions in medial and visual subnetworks (PtA = 0.78 ± 0.03; AC/M2 = 0.78 ± 0.02; V2M = 0.897 ± 0.01; V1 = 0.67 ± 0.02; V2L = 0.68 ± 0.02; Aud = 0.51 ± 0.03; M1 = 0.46 ± 0.04; BC = 0.53 ± 0.02; FLS1 = 0.38 ± 0.03; ULpS1 = 0.23 ± 0.04). We then partitioned the distribution of RSC AI values into lower and higher quartile ranges (QR) according to whether the RSC AI range fell below the first quartile (RSC QR1) or above the third quartile (RSC QR4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, when neocortical activity tended to precede the SWRs there was a buildup of hippocampal MUA preceding the SWRs as well, whereas when the neocortex activation followed the SWRs, the hippocampal MUA likewise followed. In other words, the HPC AI values for SWRs in RSC QR1 were less than those for SWRs in RSC QR4, and the HPC AI values for SWRs in RSC QR1 and RSC QR4 were more negative and positive, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii–v</xref>; n = 14 per group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bv</xref>; one-sided paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test; RSC QR1 versus RSC QR4 p=6.103 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).

However, for shorter intervals (bundled ripples), there was an excess of positive residuals of the fitted exponential curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This suggests that the mechanisms of SWR generation when they occur in close temporal proximity to each other obeys a non-Poisson dynamic, constituting a different random process from that of single/isolated ripple events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The interactions between neocortex and hippocampus play an integral role in memory consolidation during sleep.

(2004)</xref> however, have mentioned a midline bias in the modulation of firing rate of different neocortical regions around SWRs, but they left the detailed analysis of such regional effect for future studies. Here, we expanded upon their finding by utilizing high spatiotemporal resolution wide-field optical imaging of voltage and glutamate activity combined with electrophysiology.</p><p>The only study to our knowledge that has compared the modulation of neocortical regions around SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>) reported a significant up-regulation of Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal in almost the entire neocortex around SWRs in monkeys, whereas we observed a dichotomy among neocortical regions where somatosensory regions did not show a significant modulation compared to medial subnetwork regions. The previous study also reported a down-regulation of mean peri-SWR BOLD signal in primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>), which is in contrast to our results in which V1, along with other visual regions, showed strong activations. These discrepancies could be due to an intrinsic difference between BOLD and optical voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) and iGluSnFR imaging signals. As opposed to optical VSD and iGluSnFR signals, BOLD signal is an indirect, and substantially slower measure of neuronal electrical activity, which sometimes may not faithfully reflect the underlying neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007</xref>). On the other hand, mesoscale optical imaging detects activity predominantly in the superficial ~ 300 microns of neocortex, although this layer does contain dendrites from lower layers. Additionally, this discrepancy could be due to the difference in animal model (macaque vs mouse), although this seems relatively less likely given the increasingly documented connectivity similarities between these species.</p><p>The subnetworks that were accessible to us for imaging are subsets of larger brain-wide networks. In particular, a medial subnetwork, consisting of retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortices, is a subset of the default mode network which is involved in several cognitive processes including memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stafford et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that default mode network is probably one of the most modulated networks of the mouse brain around SWRs. This idea has been supported in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The reported gradation in modulation extent of different neocortical regions begs the question of what is special about visual sensory areas, which were the second most modulated regions around SWRs, compared with somatosensory areas, which were the least modulated regions. The answer to this question could be related to the stronger structural connectivity between retrosplenial and visual areas compared with retrosplenial and somatosensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Groen and Wyss, 2003</xref>). However, it does not completely settle the problem. Assuming that neocortical activation around SWRs has a mnemonic function, one may plausibly expect a stronger activation in neocortical regions that are more involved in daily life information processing. For example, vibrissal sensation is highly active during wakefulness and probably plays an important role in memory processes in the rodent brain. But, why is it the case that barrel cortex is not as active as visual cortices around SWRs? It is an interesting question that can be addressed in a separate study with using appropriate behavioral tasks. For instance, the peri-SWR differential activation of neocortical regions after performing odor-memory and visually-guided spatial memory tasks could be compared.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ripple power is distinctively correlated with peak activity in different neocortical subnetworks</title><p>There was a differential association between peak activity in different neocortical regions/subnetworks and hippocampal ripple power.

Consistent with previous reports, we also found a strong modulation of hippocampal ripple power around the onset of neocortical up-/down-states. Moreover, we extended the previous findings by providing the spatial distribution of correspondence between neocortical up-states and hippocampal ripple power.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neocortex tends to activate sequentially from medial to more lateral regions around SWRs</title><p>There was a medial to lateral temporal gradient of activation of neocortical regions around SWRs on a time scale of about 30 ms. To the best of our knowledge, such mediolateral sequential activation of neocortical regions around SWRs has not been previously reported, probably because older studies used electrophysiological techniques with sparser spatial coverage. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logothetis et al.

Nonetheless, we did observe that visual and auditory sensory cortices were the latest among neocortical regions to activate.</p><p>Two major opposite directions of propagation for neocortical waves of activity during slow-wave sleep (SWS) in mice have been reported, posterior-medial to anterior-lateral and anterior-lateral to posterior-medial directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, retrosplenial cortex has been shown to have the highest probability to be the initial zone of waves with the former direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that SWRs tend to occur during slow waves with the posterior-medial to anterior-lateral direction of propagation. It is probable that the neocortical up-states occurring in the absence of SWRs tend to have the opposite direction of propagation as reported in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massimini et al., 2004</xref><underline>)</underline>, but we did not investigate this idea in the present work.</p><p>In addition, compatible with previous reports, our data show that almost all neocortical regions tend to start activating more or less before the hippocampus generates a SWR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aii</xref>), which suggests a neocortex-to-hippocampus initial direction of information flow around SWRs. It could be interpreted from the viewpoint of hippocampal memory indexing theory in this way: an initial flow of incompletely retrieved memories from neocortex to hippocampus could lead to reactivation of a corresponding memory index code, stored in hippocampus, which in turn may lead to reactivation of global neocortical memory traces. The potential biasing of hippocampal reactivation by neocortical one has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ngo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rothschild, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Ikemoto, 2016</xref>). Therefore, RSC, which is the first among dorsal neocortical regions to activate around SWRs, may mediate this initial information flow, probably through entorhinal cortex, and subsequently bridge the broadcast of hippocampal index code to the rest of the neocortical mantle. In fact, the pattern of structural connectivity of RSC with entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>) supports this idea, where numerous efferents from RSC to entorhinal cortex, the principal input zone to hippocampus, and ample afferents from subicular structure, the main output gate in hippocampus, to RSC have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral and Witter, 1989</xref>).</p><p>The neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop of information flow has been observed around hippocampal SWRs after an extensive training in spatial tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rothschild, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). One way of detecting such a potential loop in our data was to check if the neocortical activations that precede SWRs (RSC QR1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii</xref>) also lead to delayed neocortical activations. We tested this idea and did not observe a delayed neocortical activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, it does not mean the peri-SWR neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop of information flow does not exist. The lack of neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop in our data could be explained by the extent of animal experience prior to data collection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rothschild et al. (2017)</xref> trained rats for at least 12 days in a spatial task, while the mice used in our experiment were naïve. Although unlikely, the lower temporal resolution of glutamate and voltage imaging, compared with that of single-unit activity presented in Rothschild et al. may also explain why we did not observe a neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop in our data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Skewness of peri-SWR hippocampal MUA informs neocortical activation latency relative to SWRs</title><p>Two general patterns of hippocampal MUA around SWRs were observed, a gradual build-up leading to a sharp transient increase at the SWR time and a sharp transient increase at the SWR time followed by a gradual decrease to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii–v</xref>). Interestingly, these two leading and lagging patterns of hippocampal MUA corresponded to two leading and lagging patterns of activity in the neocortex, respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji and Wilson (2007)</xref> reported periods of sustained MUA interleaved by periods of silence in both neocortex and hippocampus during SWS, which could be a reflection of slow oscillations. They called these periods of sustained activity ‘frames’. They found that neocortical and hippocampal frames tend to co-occur and neocortical frames, on average, tend to precede hippocampal ones by ~ 50 ms. They also reported that there is a higher ripple power right after the onset and right before the offset of the hippocampal frames compared to other times. Moreover, ripple power was higher at the end compared to the beginning of hippocampal frames. Taking into account the co-occurrence of neocortical and hippocampal frames, we can infer that ripple power is probably higher at the end compared to the beginning of neocortical frames as well, potentially denoting a higher probability of ripple occurrence at the end of neocortical up-states. This inference is compatible with our results, reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, where we observed an elevation of hippocampal ripple power right before the onset of RSC down-states.</p><p>We speculate that the observed temporal diversity in hippocampal-neocortical interactions around SWRs could reflect the degree of consolidation of a given memory, where neocortex leads hippocampus for well-consolidated memories and lags for newly formed ones. Our prediction is that reactivation of recently formed memory traces tend to happen during SWRs around which neocortex follows hippocampus. Since the timing of neocortical peak activity can be inferred from hippocampal MUA skewness, it is not necessary to directly record neocortical activity to test this hypothesis. Datasets with only hippocampal recordings could be assessed for this purpose.</p><p>We should emphasize that the propagating nature of SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel et al., 2013</xref>) does not influence the results reported in the current study. The majority of SWRs propagate less than 3 mm across the septal-intermediate or intermediate-temporal portion of the rat hippocampus with a minimum speed of 0.33 mm/ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). Considering the lengths of mouse hippocampus septal-intermediate and intermediate-temporal portions (~3.25 mm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milior et al., 2016</xref>), it would take less than 9 ms (equivalent to one cycle of ripples) for SWRs to reach to the electrode tip from their initiation zones. Therefore, changing the location of the electrode tip in the septal-intermediate portion of the hippocampus would have a minimal effect on the results reported in this study. However, our findings could have been different had we recorded from the intermediate-temporal portion of HPC since SWRs in dorsal and ventral portions of the hippocampus often do not co-occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Occurrence of single/isolated versus bundled ripples correlates with whether RSC activation precedes or follows hippocampus</title><p>Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Foster, 2014</xref>), we observed that multiple SWRs could sometimes occur in close proximity as a bundle of ripples. We found that, on average, the neocortical tendency to follow hippocampus is higher around bundled compared to isolated ripples. We also observed that all neocortical subnetworks except the medial one were activated more strongly around bundled compared to isolated ripples.</p><p>It has been reported that reactivation of prolonged sequences of place cells, encoding recently traversed long routes by rats, tends to occur during bundled ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Foster, 2014</xref>). An isolated ripple has a limited duration and therefore its neural content consists of a sequence of limited number of place cells with place fields covering routes with a limited length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, if coordinated interaction between hippocampus and neocortex is essential for memory consolidation, it is expected that neocortex stays active longer during bundled ripples, when the hippocampus is reactivating memories of larger content and/or longer duration. This is what was observed, suggesting bundled ripples tend to occur during longer neocortical up-states when there is a longer temporal window available for a potential hippocampal-neocortical communication. Interestingly, according to our data, the probability of occurrence of a bundled ripple in hippocampus is correlated with the pre-SWR (not peri-SWR) deactivation amplitude in neocortex. This dip could be a signaling mechanism for an upcoming longer communication between the two structures.</p><p>In conclusion, this work sheds light on the dynamics of hippocampal-neocortical interactions around SWRs which are thought to underlie system memory consolidation processes. Our results reveal neocortical hotspots mediating the broadcast of hippocampal representations to the rest of neocortex by identifying retrosplenial cortex as a potential bridge between these two structures. Past the RSC, information flow tends to be carried along a medial-lateral direction, demonstrating the order of recruitment of different neocortical modules, potentially associated with different features of given memory, around SWRs. Lastly, neocortical activation latency around SWRs is informed by hippocampal features including MUA latency as well as the number of ripple events. The observed spectrum of temporal latencies in activation of hippocampus and neocortex around SWRs possibly reflects the direction of communication during hippocampal and neocortical reactivations of recent versus remote memories. We predict that encoding of new hippocampal-dependent memories lead to a transient bias toward hippocampus leading neocortex around post-encoding sleep SWRs and that this bias would last until the load of consolidating new information gradually dissipates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of twelve mice, female and male, were used for the imaging studies.

Then the animals were head-restrained with daily prolongation of head-fixation duration. We started with five minutes on the first day and increased the head-restrained duration by five minutes per day for up to one hour. During head-fixation period, each animal was loosely surrounded by a plastic tube to limit motion and guide relaxation. A day before recording, the animals were moved from their home cage colony room to another room at noontime. We prevented them from falling asleep for around nine hours while they were kept in their own home cage by touching them using a cotton-tip stick whenever they showed signs of falling asleep. In the final hours of sleep restriction, we sometimes gently handled the animals. Then, we transferred the mice to a bigger cage containing new objects, including a running wheel and many pieces of cheerios and a water container. We left the mice in the new cage in the same room overnight. The next day, the mice were transferred to the recording room early in the morning and the recording initiated at around 6:00 AM.

For HPC recordings, we drilled a hole on the right hemisphere skull about 2.6 mm lateral to the midline and tangent to the posterior side of the occipital suture. Then, the tip of the monopolar electrode was gradually lowered through the hole at a 57 degree angle with respect to the vertical axis perpendicular to the surface on which the stereotaxic apparatus was sitting. During lowering, the electrode signal with respect to the reference electrode located on top of the cerebellum, was monitored both visually and audibly. Lowering the electrode was stopped as soon as a dramatic increase in the MUA was heard and observed near the calculated coordinate (angle = 57 degrees, depth = ~1.75 mm) for the pyramidal layer of dorsal CA1. After identifying the optimum location for the electrode tip, we fixated the electrode on the skull using Krazy Glue and dental cement. For the neocortical LFP and MUA recordings, the tip of the electrodes were placed in the superficial layers of neocortical regions (usually motor cortex) at the edge of the cranial window.

The solution was made by dissolving voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) RH-1691 (Optical Imaging, New York, NY) in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)−1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered saline solution (0.5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>). To minimize the movement artifacts due to the respiration, we covered the stained brain with 1.5% agarose made in HEPES-buffered saline and sealed the cranial window with a glass coverslip. VSD imaging of spontaneous activity in the absence of sensory stimuli began ~ 30 min after removing the dye solution and washing the brain until the residual dye solution was completely removed. Using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (1M60 Pantera, Dalsa, Waterloo, ON) and an EPIX E4DB frame grabber with XCAP 3.7 imaging software (EPIX, Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL), we recorded 12-bit images every 10 ms (100 Hz). We used a red LED (Luxeon K2, 627 nm center) and excitation filters of 630 ± 15 nm to excite the VSD. The reflected fluorescent signal from excited dyes was filtered using a 673 to 703 nm bandpass optical filter (Semrock, New York, NY), and was passed through a microscope composed of front-to-front video lenses (8.6 × 8.6 mm field of view, 67 μm per pixel). To reduce the potential artifacts caused by the presence of large neocortical blood vessels, we focused the lens into the neocortex to a depth of ~ 1 mm. Total duration of the VSD excitation in a typical imaging experiment ranged from one to two hours. We also recorded the voltage optical signal from the neocortex in response to different periphery stimulation as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). Sensory stimulation was used to determine the coordinates for the primary sensory areas (HLS1, FLS1, BCS1, V1 and A1), secondary somatosensory areas (HLS2, FLS2 and BCS2). From these primary sensory coordinates, the relative locations of additional associational areas were estimated using stereotaxic coordinates (ptA, RS, M2, V2M (medial secondary visual cortex), V2L (lateral secondary visual cortex), and M1 (primary motor cortex).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Glutamate imaging</title><p>iGluSnFR was excited with light from a blue-light-emitting diode (Luxeon K2, 473 nm, Quadica Developments Inc, Lethbridge, Alberta) delivered through a band-pass filter (Chroma Technology Corp, 467–499 nm). Ambient light resulting from iGluSnFR excitation (473 nm) was ~ 1.5 mW over the 8 × 8 mm area used for imaging. iGluSnFR fluorescence emission was filtered using a 520–580 nm band-pass filter (Semrock, New York, NY). We collected 12-bit images at 100 Hz using CCD camera (1M60 Pantera, Dalsa, Waterloo, ON) and an EPIX E4DB frame grabber with XCAP 3.7 imaging software (EPIX, Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL). To reduce the potential artifacts caused by the presence of large neocortical blood vessels, we focused the lens into the neocortex to a depth of ~ 1 mm. Total duration of the indicator excitation in a typical imaging experiment ranged from two to three hours. At the last day of experiments, we anesthetized mice with 1.5 gr/kg urethane and imaged the neocortex. We also recorded the iGluSnFR signal in response to different periphery stimulation under urethane anesthesia as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). Sensory stimulation were used to functionally map the center of the hind-limb somatosensory, fore-limb somatosensory, auditory, visual, and barrel cortices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioral and pupil recording</title><p>To monitor animal behavior and measure pupil size, we used an IR USB camera (Point Grey Firefly MV USB, FLIR Systems, Inc) with 20 Hertz frame rate. We also used an infrared LED to illuminate the animals’ faces and parts of their body including their head, shoulders, and forelimbs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pupil diameter detection</title><p>We used an intensity-based thresholding custom made algorithm implemented in Bonsai (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bonsai-rx.org//">https://bonsai-rx.org//</ext-link>) to quantify pupil diameter. Briefly, the algorithm detects the pupil by segmenting it with the surrounding areas of the eye and models it as an ellipse. The main diagonal of the ellipse was considered as the pupil diameter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sleep scoring</title><p>Vigilance stages of each animal were classified as awake, NREM, and REM by thresholding EMG and hippocampal theta-to-delta ratio signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niethard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yüzgeç et al., 2018</xref>). Awake periods were identified by visual inspection of animal behavior and EMG signal. NREM sleep was identified as periods with low EMG and theta-to-delta ratio. For head-restrained experiments, we also included a third criteria for detecting NREM sleep periods: lack of facial (around the chin) movement for at least 50 s. REM sleep periods were detected when EMG signals were the lowest, which is due to muscular atonia, and high theta-to-delta ratios. For head-fixed experiments, we also measured pupil size to verify our sleep scoring results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yüzgeç et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>SWRs detection</title><p>We followed the method used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mölle et al. (2006)</xref> for detecting ripples. Briefly, the raw hippocampal LFP was first down-sampled to 2 kHz. Then, it was filtered using a 400-order band-pass FIR filter designed in MATLAB (MathWorks). The filtered signal was rectified and smoothed using a rectangular window with a length of 8 ms, generating the ripple power signal. SWRs were identified when the ripple power signal passed the detection threshold defined by the mean plus a multiple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>: 2 for VSDI and 3 for iGluSnFR imaging; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>: 3 for VSDI and 4 for iGluSnFR imaging) of standard deviation of the ripple power signals. A lower threshold (75% of the detection threshold) was used to identify the onset and offset of each SWR. Detected events were further screened by applying a duration threshold. Events with a duration shorter than the mean duration of all detected events were excluded. The ripple center was defined as the timestamp of the largest trough between the onset and offset times. Moreover, events with centers less than 50 ms apart were concatenated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Splitting SWRs into HPC quartiles</title><p>We defined a quantity, called asymmetry index (AI), to measure the asymmetry or skewness of hippocampal MUA and neocortical voltage and iGluSnFR signals centered on SWR centers timestamps (0 s). AI is defined as (A - B) / (A + B), where A and B are the mean values from −0.2–0 s and 0–0.2 s respectively. AI values range from −1 and 1, where an AI = −1 and AI = 1 denote complete skewness of the signal to left and right relative to the SWR centers, respectively. The distribution of MUA AI values was split into quartiles. The first and fourth quartiles were utilized for further analyses to examine whether SWRs either preceded or followed by MUA, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bundled ripples detection</title><p>Bundled ripples were identified by applying an additional threshold on previously detected SWRs. For each previously detected SWR, the wavelet-based power (using analytic Morlet wavelet) in the ripple-band frequencies (150–250 Hz) was calculated for peri-SWR hippocampal LFP traces. Ripple events were identified as bundled ripples if the following criteria were met: (1) The power signal surpassed an adaptively determined power threshold for at least two successive times; (2) The minimum duration was met for each supra-threshold event; and (3) The temporal distance between two successive supra-threshold peaks was less than 200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Foster, 2014</xref>). The remainder of detected SWRs was considered as single/isolated events. 62 ± 0.03% (mean + SEM; n = 14 mice) of all detected bundled ripples in our data consist of two ripples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>MUA calculation</title><p>MUA signal was calculated from hippocampal and neocortical LFP signals using a similar method reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belitski et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, the LFP signals were filtered above 300 Hz, rectified and smoothed with a rectangular window with the length of ~ 3 ms for the hippocampal and 100 ms for the neocortical signals. The resultant signals are called HPC and RSC MUA, respectively, in this work.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Detection of neocortical up-/down-states</title><p>A thresholding procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battaglia et al., 2004</xref>) similar to what used for the SWRs detection was employed to detect the neocortical up-/down states. Briefly, two thresholds for amplitude and duration were applied on the neocortical MUA signal. The events (1) whose amplitudes were greater (smaller) and (2) whose durations were longer than the corresponding thresholds were considered as up-states (down-states). Different thresholds were used for detection of up- and down-states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Detection of neocortical peak activation measured by optical signal</title><p>A very similar approach to what used for the detection of neocortical up-/down-states was employed to detect neocortical peak activations measured by optical signal. Briefly, the voltage or iGluSnFR ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> captured from each neocortical region was thresholded for both amplitude and duration. The events with amplitudes larger and durations longer than the corresponding thresholds were detected as peak activations in that region. Different thresholds were used for different neocortical regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Preprocessing of voltage and iGluSnFR imaging data</title><p>The optical voltage and glutamate signals were first denoised by applying singular-value decomposition and taking the components with the greatest associated singular values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitra and Pesaran, 1999</xref>). Then, for each pixel in the imaging window, a baseline (F<sub>0</sub>) of the optical voltage and iGluSnFR signals (F) was calculated. Baseline calculation was accomplished using the <italic>locdetrend</italic> function in the Choronux toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org/">http://chronux.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitra and Bokil, 2007</xref>) to fit a piecewise linear curve to the pixel time series using the local regression method. The calculated baseline signal was then subtracted from the raw signal, and the difference signal was divided by the baseline values at each time point (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>). Because most of the optical signal power is concentrated in lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>), a band pass (0.1–6 Hz) FIR filter was applied on the Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> signal. In this paper, optical signals were expressed as a percentage change relative to the baseline optical signal responses (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> × 100%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Optical flow analysis</title><p>To estimate the propagation direction of peri-SWR neocortical activity, we randomly selected around twenty peri-SWR stacks of imaging frames, and averaged them. The averaged stack was used to calculate propagation direction of neocortical waves at the time of SWRs. Propagation direction was calculated using the Horn-Schunck method implemented in Matlab-based Optical-Flow Analysis Toolbox developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afrashteh et al. (2017)</xref>. This toolbox can be used to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of mesoscale brain activity such as propagation direction, location of sources and sinks as well as the trajectories and temporal velocities of flow of activity dynamics. To generate a circular distribution of propagation direction, we repeated the above process for 1000 iterations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>z-scoring peri-SWR neocortical activity</title><p>The inter-SWR intervals were randomly permuted to generate new timestamps. Then, for each random time point, the surrounding imaging frames, capturing one second before to one second after, were temporally aligned. The mean and standard deviation of the corresponding frames were calculated across all the randomly generated time points. In doing so, we generated a mean and a standard deviation stack of frames. We used these two stacks to z-score all the individual peri-SWR stacks of neocortical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>All statistical tests for linear data were performed using MATLAB built-in functions. One-sided paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for linear data.

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatiotemporal patterns of neocortical activity around hippocampal sharp-wave ripples&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper combines wide field optical recording techniques with electrophysiology to study cortico-hippocampal interactions surrounding the hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SWR). The timing of activation and deactivation of cortex appears continuously distributed with a bias for cortical activation before SWR. Within the cortex, activation appears to propagate from medial to lateral/sensory regions. Interestingly, the propensity to have SWRs within a short window (&quot;bundles&quot;) is correlated with the hippocampus activation before cortical activation.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this work uses a novel and potentially powerful experimental approach to address important questions of hippocampal-cortical communication. The manuscript is clearly written and reflects a substantial scientific work. However, the reviewers also raise several substantial concerns about the quantitative statistics used and interpretation of the observed results, which must be addressed. The reviewers also suggest new analyses that will significantly increase the relevance and appeal of the present study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The findings of hippocampal MUA activity before and after SWRs correlating with neocortical activation is very sensitive to the accuracy of SWR detection. If SWR power is elevated before/after a detected SWR but doesn't pass the detection threshold, the observed MUA may simply reflect hippocampal SWR-related firing. In this case cortical activity coordinated in time would be expected. This could influence the results of both Figure 5 and Figure 6. The authors should analyze their data to show that this is not the case or reinterpret the findings.</p><p>2) There are a number of cases where it seems like inappropriate statistical tests were performed in a way that could strongly influence the results. For example, in Figures 2ciii, 2dii, 3cii. It seems like one-sided paired t-tests were conducted between a chosen subset of the groups. This is faulty for a number of independent reasons: pairwise instead of a group test, selective choosing of the groups without a-priori strong reasons to do so, inexplicable use of one-tail test even to make claims explicitly not permitted by the use of one-sided tests (e.g. claiming that &quot;visual (activation is) followed by the medial (activation)&quot; using medial vs visual one-sided test showing no statistical significance), no correction for multiple comparisons, small sample size for a t-test. Repeated-Measures ANOVA or other appropriate tests should be used throughout. Later in the paper the authors switch to non-parametric tests, but it is unclear why.</p><p>3) The idea of a loop-like interaction between neocortex and hippocampus during SWS ripples is not new. For example, it has been similarly expressed by Rothschild et al., 2017 and 2018, and recently summarized by Klinzing et al., 2019. This literature needs to be more elaborately integrated. It would be of great interest here to actually demonstrate this loop in the data (i.e., to see if cortical activation that triggers ripples also triggers delayed cortical activations). Ideally, this analysis should be separate for naturally sleeping animals (which optimally were exposed to a novel environment before imaging) and anesthetized animals.</p><p>4) The authors could greatly enhance the impact of their work by adding an analysis of the neocortical slow oscillation (SO). Ripples are well known to more likely occur in the down-to-up transition of the SO, and the SO down-state is often considered a global frame resetting activity also in hippocampal networks. Indeed, the authors on several occasions discuss the possibility that the decreases and increases in MUA they observe around ripples represent down and up states of the SO. Why don't they add the respective data and analyses?</p><p>5) A key finding in this manuscript is that changes in neocortical activity often precede hippocampal SWRs and the potential interpretation that this may support cortical biasing of hippocampal reactivation. While the data seems to support this proposal, the authors downplay important previous studies that have described such findings (in some cases with neural population data with single-cell resolution) and models. Sirota et al., 2003, reported somatosensory cortical firing preceded SWRs and suggested a cortical influence on hippocampal reactivation; Wang and Ikemoto, 2016, found a similar pattern in ACC; Rothschild et al., 2017, identified a cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of communication around SWRs and proposed a related model (Rothschild, 2018); Recent human studies found a similar pattern of communication (Norman et al., 2019, Viet-Ngo et al., 2019, Helfrich et al., 2019). These previous reports of this phenomenon should be highlighted.</p><p>6) The functional significance of a key result in the paper- the enhanced SWR-related activity in RSC as compared to other cortical regions- is unclear. On the one hand, we know that RSC receives direct input from hippocampus whereas other regions do not. On the other hand, degree of fluorescence does not necessarily tell us much about the functional role of the communication. So what do we learn from this finding beyond a reflection of known anatomy?</p><p>7) Given that the important physiological signatures differ across the groups (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), the reviewers questioned the appropriateness of grouping highly different experimental groups/conditions, such as in VSD/glutamate imaging and natural sleep/anesthesia. Do the authors have more data that can enable them to separately analyze these groups? If not, they must provide appropriate justification for the grouping and demonstrate that the different groups pooled together did not perform differently from each other in specific analyses.</p><p>8) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows recording electrode at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and not unambiguously in CA1 as claimed by the authors. Authors need to show the distribution of all LFP recording electrodes. On a related note, was there any functional mapping performed to demarcate the boundaries between different cortical regions, or are the boundaries based on the atlas?</p><p>9) A number of methodological restrictions need to be clearly discussed. First, wide field imaging did not cover prefrontal cortex. In particular, medial prefrontal cortex is an area most strongly connected to the hippocampus and there are a number of previous studies showing particular temporal &quot;peri-ripple&quot; relationships of activity between mPFC and hippocampus. The retrosplenial cortex being the more important hub for sleep dependent consolidation (than mPFC) very much fits with some of the human fMRI literature (e.g., Darsaud et al., 2011, J Cogn Neurosci), although such conclusions unfortunately cannot be made based on the present data. While cortical activity is assessed over rather large areas, hippocampal ripples are recorded from just one electrode site. Considering the local (and travelling) nature of ripples, the temporal relationship of ripples to neocortical activity might essentially depend on where in the hippocampus they are generated/recorded. A related conceptual issue (to be discussed) is that local memory replay mainly occurs during the ripple, and not before or after.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51972.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The findings of hippocampal MUA activity before and after SWRs correlating with neocortical activation is very sensitive to the accuracy of SWR detection.

However, we argue that it does not influence the results reported in Figures 5 and 6. We have made the following cartoons to explain our arguments. For any detected SWR, one of the following four cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1i-iv</xref> could occur.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51972-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>For SWRs in case iv, the detection accuracy is not relevant since there is no other undetected SWR around them. For cases i-iii, the accuracy of SWR detection could, in theory, influence the results presented in Figures 5 and 6. To illustrate how the accuracy of ripple detection could affect the hippocampal-neocortical temporal relationship, we considered the three following possibilities (a-c) for the timing of neocortical activation relative to the detected/undetected SWRs.</p><p>In (b), detection of the first or second SWR (in temporal order) does not affect the matching between skewness of HPC MUA and RSC signals because (1) If the first SWR was detected, both HPC MUA and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> RSC signals would be skewed to the right. (2) If the second SWR was detected, both HPC MUA and RSC signals would be skewed to the left. Thus, the accuracy of SWR detection does not affect the results for SWRs in cases of i-iii.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51972-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>In (a) and (c), the detection of first or second SWR influences the matching between skewness of HPC MUA and RSC signals. In (a), if the first SWR was detected, HPC MUA and RSC signals would be skewed to the right and left, respectively. However, if the second SWR was detected, both HPC MUA and RSC signals would be skewed to the left. A similar discussion can be made for (c) for which only the detection of the second SWR leads to a mismatch between skewness of HPC MUA and RSC signals.</p><p>Therefore, for only 2 out of 18 scenarios (3 for i-iii; 3 for a-c; and 2 for detection of first or second SWR; 3*3*2 = 18), the accuracy of SWR detection could yield a mismatch between skewness of HPC MUA and RSC signals. These two scenarios (combinations ii-a and iii-c) are least expected to occur. This is because in a bundled ripple the RSC signal peaks between the first and second SWRs (between 0 and 0.2 s; see Materials and methods and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 panel Ci). Therefore the accuracy of SWR detection minimally influences the matching between skewness of HPC MUA and RSC signals.</p><p>To further control for the effect of undetected SWRs in the results shown in Figures 5 and 6, we also reanalyzed our data and made new figures for the relevant panels in Figures 5 and 6. The newly generated figures/panels are labelled similarly to their corresponding figures/panels in the manuscript. Here we focused on isolated/single SWRs (case iv) to reduce the probability of the presence of undetected SWRs, and its possible impact on the temporal order of hippocampal-neocortical interactions. Isolated/single SWRs were detected by applying a second thresholding procedure (Materials and method subsection “Detection of neocortical up-/down-states”) to the already detected SWRs used for Figures 1-6. Hence, the probability of the existence of undetected SWRs around isolated/single SWRs is low. The results of this new analysis match those reported in Figures 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are a number of cases where it seems like inappropriate statistical tests were performed in a way that could strongly influence the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment and we have now applied repeated-measures ANOVA tests wherever was appropriate.

This literature needs to be more elaborately integrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this idea is not new and has been previously proposed by others. The abovementioned literature is now incorporated into the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be of great interest here to actually demonstrate this loop in the data (i.e., to see if cortical activation that triggers ripples also triggers delayed cortical activations). Ideally, this analysis should be separate for naturally sleeping animals (which optimally were exposed to a novel environment before imaging) and anesthetized animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that showing the neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop in our current data would be of great interest. One way of detecting such a potential loop is to check if the neocortical activations that precede SWRs (RSC QR1 in Figure 5Bii) also trigger delayed neocortical activations. To check for the presence of such delayed neocortical activations, we calculated the mean of the peri-SWR RSC activity for SWRs in the RSC QR1 (blue curve shown in Figure 5Bii) for each animal and then averaged the resultant signals across animals. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 3. The averaging was performed separately for data recorded under sleep and urethane anesthesia.</p><p>As is evident from this figure, there is no indication of the existence of a delayed activation and, therefore, possibly no neocortical-hippocampus-neocortical loop. The lack of neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop in our data could be explained by the extent of animal experience prior to data collection. Rothschild et al., 2017, trained rats for at least 12 days in a spatial task, while the mice used in our experiment were naïve. Although unlikely, the lower temporal resolution of glutamate and voltage imaging, compared with that of single-unit activity presented in Rothschild et al., 2017, may also explain why we did not observe a neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical loop in our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors could greatly enhance the impact of their work by adding an analysis of the neocortical slow oscillation (SO).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers thatputting the peri-SWR neocortical activity in the context of neocortical slow oscillations (SOs) can strengthen the connection of our results with those of the numerous research papers focused on studying hippocampal-neocortical interactions. The results presented in Figure 3 possibly reflect the relationship between SWRs and SOs. In Figure 3, the pattern of mean hippocampal ripple power around neocortical peak activations, recorded by optical imaging, is reported. Since there is a noticeable correspondence between neocortical activity measured with LFP and optical imaging (Figure 1Cii), we expect that neocortical activations and deactivations, measured with optical imaging, are likely the reflection of neocortical up- and down-states, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ripples are well known to more likely occur in the down-to-up transition of the SO, and the SO down-state is often considered a global frame resetting activity also in hippocampal networks. Indeed, the authors on several occasions discuss the possibility that the decreases and increases in MUA they observe around ripples represent down and up states of the SO. Why don't they add the respective data and analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>SOs and up-/down-states were originally characterized using neocortical electrophysiological recordings. Thus, we used the electrophysiological signals recorded from the neocortex (RSC) in a number of animals (n = 4) to investigate the relationship between SOs and SWRs. We have now made a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) that shows the fluctuations of hippocampal ripple power around neocortical up/down-states detected using neocortical MUA.</p><p>As expected, the ripple power decreased before and increased after the onset of neocortical up-states. Moreover, the ripple power increased before and decreased after the onset of neocortical down-states. Therefore, the results presented in Figure 3 are reflections of the relationship between SWRs and SOs. We have now added new sentences to the manuscript to state the results presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. These sentences read:</p><p>“Moreover, we investigated the relationship between neocortical slow oscillation and hippocampal SWRs in animals for which neocortical electrophysiological signals were recorded (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We found that hippocampal ripple power is suppressed (elevated) before (after) the onset of neocortical up-states. Similarly, hippocampal ripple power is elevated (suppressed) before (after) the onset of neocortical down-states. Therefore, the results obtained using optical imaging and neocortical electrophysiology were compatible.”</p><p>“Consistent with previous reports, we also found a strong modulation of hippocampal ripple power around the onset of neocortical up-/down-states. Moreover, we extended the previous findings by providing the spatial distribution of correspondence between neocortical up-states and hippocampal ripple power.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A key finding in this manuscript is that changes in neocortical activity often precede hippocampal SWRs and the potential interpretation that this may support cortical biasing of hippocampal reactivation. While the data seems to support this proposal, the authors downplay important previous studies that have described such findings (in some cases with neural population data with single-cell resolution) and models. Sirota et al., 2003, reported somatosensory cortical firing preceded SWRs and suggested a cortical influence on hippocampal reactivation; Wang and Ikemoto, 2016, found a similar pattern in ACC; Rothschild et al., 2017, identified a cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of communication around SWRs and proposed a related model (Rothschild, 2018); Recent human studies found a similar pattern of communication (Norman et al., 2019, Viet-Ngo et al., 2019, Helfrich et al., 2019). These previous reports of this phenomenon should be highlighted.</p></disp-quote><p>The abovementioned studies have been incorporated into the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The functional significance of a key result in the paper- the enhanced SWR-related activity in RSC as compared to other cortical regions- is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that with our experimental design, we cannot determine the functional significance of enhanced SWR-related activity in RSC relative to other neocortical regions. While we think it is an important question for future studies, it is difficult to completely address this issue within the confines of the current manuscript. We are planning to conduct new sets of experiments in which we will examine the sufficiency and/or necessity of this enhanced activity for the consolidation of recently acquired memories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the one hand, we know that RSC receives direct input from hippocampus whereas other regions do not. On the other hand, degree of fluorescence does not necessarily tell us much about the functional role of the communication. So what do we learn from this finding beyond a reflection of known anatomy?</p></disp-quote><p>Although there is a strong relationship between structure and function in the brain, the presence of structural projections between two brain structures cannot fully explain the dynamics of interactions. Here are some examples:</p><p>1) Given that the projections between the hippocampus (HPC) and RSC are mainly unidirectional (from HPC to RSC and not the other way around), one may predict that hippocampal SWRs would activate RSC. Instead, we found that RSC, on average, tends to activate and peak before hippocampal SWRs. Therefore, the RSC activation prior to HPC SWRs cannot easily be explained by the pattern of anatomical connections between the two structures.</p><p>2) In addition to RSC, we found that secondary motor, posterior parietal, visual, and auditory cortices were also modulated around SWRs, each with a distinct time course (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C and Figure 4Aii). This finding cannot necessarily be predicted by anatomy since HPC mainly projects to RSC and not to other neocortical regions.</p><p>3) The midline areas including (not restricted to) RSC tend to activate earlier than more lateral neocortical regions (e.g., somatosensory cortices) around SWRs. Moreover, neocortical activation waves tend to propagate in the mediolateral direction. This also cannot be easily explained based on known structural connectivity between HPC and RSC.</p><p>4) The majority of studies on peri-SWR hippocampal-neocortical interactions in rodents have been focused on recording from the dorsal CA1 field of the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while the primary projections from the HPC to mPFC emanate from the ventral portion of HPC.</p><p>Given the absence of direct structural connections between the dorsal hippocampus and mPFC, one may predict that there would be no functional interactions between the two structures. However, despite the lack of direct structural connections, important discoveries on the functional significance of interactions between dorsal HPC and mPFC in the context of learning and memory have been found.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given that the important physiological signatures differ across the groups (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), the reviewers questioned the appropriateness of grouping highly different experimental groups/conditions, such as in VSD/glutamate imaging and natural sleep/anesthesia. Do the authors have more data that can enable them to separately analyze these groups? If not, they must provide appropriate justification for the grouping and demonstrate that the different groups pooled together did not perform differently from each other in specific analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have enough data to analyze each group separately, nor did we plan to compare these conditions. The main reason for not collecting more data under natural sleep was the low success rate of having animals sleeping under head fixation, especially with a slightly tilted head. Tilting the head was done to include temporal cortices (e.g., the auditory cortex) within our imaging window. Thus, we used a model of sleep (urethane anesthesia) to increase our sample size. We had justified the pooling of sleep with anesthesia data in the first sub-section of the Results section, and in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-D. To further justify the pooling, we compared all the reported measures in this study between VSD and iGluSnFR imaging, as well as between sleep and urethane conditions. We have now made additional supplementary figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-F; Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 2; Figure 5—figure supplement 2; Figure 6—figure supplement 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 7) that include the results of the abovementioned comparisons across all conditions/groups. Aside from a handful of exceptions (see Figure 2—figure supplement 3Eii; Figure 3—figure supplement 1ii; Figure 5—figure supplement 2Bi; Figure 2—figure supplement 7Ai and Cii), the rest of the comparisons did not yield any significant differences between these groups/conditions. We have now added a new sentence to emphasize this point in the manuscript. This sentence reads:</p><p>“We confirmed that the quantities, reported in the following sections, were not different across urethane anesthesia versus sleep and VSD versus iGluSnFR imaging conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 3; Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 2; Figure 5—figure supplement 2; Figure 6—figure supplement 2; Figure 7—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>We would also like to emphasize that we replicated some of the imaging results using multi-site electrophysiological recordings in unrestrained, naturally-sleeping animals (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and 5). These results were already included in our first submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows recording electrode at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and not unambiguously in CA1 as claimed by the authors. Authors need to show the distribution of all LFP recording electrodes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the location of LFP electrode tips in 14 mouse brains in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 panel iv. The electrode insertion procedure and spatial coordinates used to fix the electrodes were the same for all 14 animals. The distribution of these 14 electrode tips is represented in the following figure. The location of tips is categorized into 4 groups, each of which is colored differently. The number of animals in each category is reported on the figure.</p><p>The majority (12 out of 14) of the electrodes were either in the CA1 (green and cyan) or at the border of CA1 and subiculum (red). As ripple events are synchronous between CA1 and ipsilateral subiculum with high probability (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996), no change in our findings is anticipated for animals for which the electrode tips were located at the border of CA1 and subiculum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, was there any functional mapping performed to demarcate the boundaries between different cortical regions, or are the boundaries based on the atlas?</p></disp-quote><p>The centers of sensory regions were found by periphery stimulation, as is explained in the Materials and methodssection. The boundaries of the regions were based on the Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas (Paxinos, G. and Franklin, K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam, Boston, 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) A number of methodological restrictions need to be clearly discussed. First, wide field imaging did not cover prefrontal cortex. In particular, medial prefrontal cortex is an area most strongly connected to the hippocampus and there are a number of previous studies showing particular temporal &quot;peri-ripple&quot; relationships of activity between mPFC and hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers on their note about the absence of mPFC in our imaging window. This is now emphasized in the revised manuscript (subsection “Neocortex tends to activate sequentially from medial to more lateral regions around SWRs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The retrosplenial cortex being the more important hub for sleep dependent consolidation (than mPFC) very much fits with some of the human fMRI literature (e.g., Darsaud et al., 2011, J Cogn Neurosci), although such conclusions unfortunately cannot be made based on the present data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ point that no conclusion about the comparative role of RSC and mPFC in memory consolidation can be made based on our data. Indeed, no comment on this point was made in the manuscript, nor was our goal to make this comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While cortical activity is assessed over rather large areas, hippocampal ripples are recorded from just one electrode site. Considering the local (and travelling) nature of ripples, the temporal relationship of ripples to neocortical activity might essentially depend on where in the hippocampus they are generated/recorded. A related conceptual issue (to be discussed) is that local memory replay mainly occurs during the ripple, and not before or after.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment regarding the temporal relationship between propagating SWRs and neocortical activity. We revised the manuscript and included the following paragraph in the Discussion section.</p><p>“We should emphasize that the propagating nature of SWRs (Patel et al., 2013) does not influence the results reported in the current study. The majority of SWRs propagate less than 3 mm across the septal intermediate or intermediate-temporal portion of the hippocampus with a minimum speed of 0.33 mm/ms (Patel et al., 2013). Considering the lengths of mouse hippocampus septal-intermediate and intermediate temporal portions (~3.25mm)(Milior et al., 2016), it would take less than 9 ms (equivalent to one cycle of ripples) for SWRs to reach to the electrode tip from their initiation zones. Therefore, changing the location of the electrode tip in the septal-intermediate portion of the hippocampus would have a minimal effect on the results reported in this study. However, our findings could have been different had we recorded from the intermediate-temporal portion of HPC since SWRs in dorsal and ventral portions of the hippocampus often do not co-occur (Patel et al., 2013).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
