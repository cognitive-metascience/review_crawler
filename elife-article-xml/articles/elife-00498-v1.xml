In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2Î± kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2Î±. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the âintegrated stress responseâ (ISR). eIF2Î± phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2Î± phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2Î± phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00498.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00498.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00498.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The synthesis of proteins is an essential step in many biological processes, including memory, and drugs that inhibit protein synthesis are known to impair memory in rodents. It is thought that the brain needs these proteins to convert short-term memories into long-term memories through a process known as consolidation.</p><p>A protein called EIF2Î± has a key role in the regulation of protein synthesis, and has also been implicated in memory. EIF2Î± can be activated as a result of being phosphorylated by any of four protein kinases: these are in turn activated by processes that subject cells to stress, such as viral infection, UV light orâin the case of a kinase known as PERKâthe accumulation of unfolded proteins in a cellular organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum. Activation of EIF2Î± downregulates most protein synthesis inside the cell, but upregulates the production of a small number of key regulatory molecules: these changes help cells to cope with whatever stressful event they have just experienced.</p><p>To obtain further insight into the cellular stress response, Sidrauski et al. screened a large library of compounds in search of one that inhibits PERK. They identified a moleculeâknown as ISRIBâwhich acts downstream of all four protein kinases by reversing the effects of EIF2Î± phosphorylation.

This suggests that ISRIB could be used to explore the mechanisms that underlie memory consolidation, and possibly even as a memory enhancer. Moreover, given that many tumor cells exploit the cellular stress response to aid their own growth, ISRIB may have potential as a novel chemotherapeutic agent.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00498.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00498.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>eIF2</kwd><kwd>eIF2B</kwd><kwd>ATF4</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>memory consolidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute Collaborative Innovation Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sidrauski</surname><given-names>Carmela</given-names></name><name><surname>Acosta-Alvear</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name><name><surname>Vedantham</surname><given-names>Punitha</given-names></name><name><surname>Hearn</surname><given-names>Brian R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallagher</surname><given-names>Ciara</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><name><surname>Okreglak</surname><given-names>Voytek</given-names></name><name><surname>Hann</surname><given-names>Byron</given-names></name><name><surname>Arkin</surname><given-names>Michelle R</given-names></name><name><surname>Renslo</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(N.S., MOP-114994)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khoutorsky</surname><given-names>Arkady</given-names></name><name><surname>Gamache</surname><given-names>Karine</given-names></name><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonenberg</surname><given-names>Nahum</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><italic>Cancer</italic> Research Institute<institution-wrap><institution>Irvington Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship of the</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acosta-Alvear</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>QB3-Malaysia Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Kenny K-H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A compound that prevents stressors such as UV light and viral infection from downregulating protein synthesis inside cells improves memory performance in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In metazoa, diverse stress signals converge at a single phosphorylation event at serine 51 of a common effector, the translation initiation factor eIF2Î±. This step is carried out by four eIF2Î± kinases in mammalian cells: PERK, which responds to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GCN2 to amino acid starvation and UV light, PKR to viral infection, and HRI to heme deficiency. This collection of signaling pathways has been termed the âintegrated stress responseâ (ISR), as they converge on the same molecular event. eIF2Î± phosphorylation results in an attenuation of translation with consequences that allow cells to cope with the varied stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wek et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>eIF2 (which is comprised of three subunits, Î±, Î² and Î³) binds GTP and the initiator Met-tRNA to form the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>), which, in turn, associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit forming the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) that scans the 5â²UTR of mRNAs to select the initiating AUG codon. Upon phosphorylation of its Î±-subunit, eIF2 becomes a competitive inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</xref>). The tight and non-productive binding of phosphorylated eIF2 to eIF2B prevents loading of the eIF2 complex with GTP thus blocking ternary complex formation and reducing translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</xref>). Because eIF2B is less abundant than eIF2, phosphorylation of only a small fraction of the total eIF2 has a dramatic impact on eIF2B activity in cells.</p><p>Paradoxically, under conditions of reduced protein synthesis, a small group of mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5â²UTR are translationally up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). These include mammalian ATF4 (a cAMP element binding [CREB] transcription factor) and CHOP (a pro-apoptotic transcription factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palam et al., 2011</xref>). ATF4 regulates the expression of many genes involved in metabolism and nutrient uptake and additional transcription factors, such as CHOP, which is under both translational and transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of eIF2Î± thus leads to preferential translation of key regulatory molecules and directs diverse changes in the transcriptome of cells upon cellular stress.</p><p>One of the eIF2Î± kinases, PERK, lies at the intersection of the ISR and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that maintains homeostasis of protein folding in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pavitt and Ron, 2012</xref>). The UPR is activated by unfolded or misfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen because of an imbalance between protein folding load and protein folding capacity, a condition known as âER stressâ. In mammals, the UPR is comprised of three signaling branches mediated by ER-localized transmembrane sensors, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. These sensor proteins detect the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and transmit the information across the ER membrane, initiating unique signaling pathways that converge in the activation of an extensive transcriptional response, which ultimately results in ER expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>). The lumenal stress-sensing domains of PERK and IRE1 are homologous and likely activated in analogous ways by direct binding to unfolded peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). This binding event leads to oligomerization and <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of their cytosolic kinase domains, and, for PERK, phosphorylation of its only known substrate, eIF2Î±. In this way, PERK activation results in a quick reduction in the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER-lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Upon ER stress, both the transcription factor XBP1s, produced as the consequence of a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction initiated by IRE1, and the transcription factor ATF6, produced by proteolysis and release from the ER membrane, collaborate with ATF4 to induce the vast UPR transcriptional response. Transcriptional targets of the UPR include the ER protein folding machinery, the ER-associated degradation machinery, and many other components functioning in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Although the UPR initially mitigates ER stress and as such confers cytoprotection, persistent and severe ER stress leads to activation of apoptosis that eliminates damaged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>).</p><p>By interrogating a large chemical library for small molecules that block PERK signaling, we identified ISRIB as a potent ISR inhibitor, functioning downstream of all eIF2Î± kinases. ISRIB proves a powerful tool to explore the consequences of acute inhibition of the ISR in cells and animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling</title><p>To identify inhibitors of PERK signaling, we engineered a reporter that allows monitoring of PERK activation in living cells. To this end, we constructed a retroviral vector containing the open-reading frame of firefly luciferase fused to the 5â²UTR of ATF4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which contains two short open-reading frames (uORFs) that control ATF4 translation in a stress-dependent manner. After infection, we established a HEK293T cell line harboring the stably integrated reporter. We used thapsigargin, a potent ER stressor that inhibits the ER calcium pump, to activate PERK and induce eIF2Î± phosphorylation. Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a 4.9-fold induction in luciferase activity in a 384 well format with a Z factor of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This format was used to screen 106,281 compounds covering a wide chemical space. We identified 460 hits (0.43%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which were further validated in an 8-point dose-response assay using the same reporter. We further triaged the compounds by discarding inhibitors that also affected the IRE1 branch of the UPR using a luciferase-based XBP1 splicing reporter. Less than half (187 hits) of our initial hits proved unique to the PERK branch. We next used an orthogonal secondary screen that employed a different reporter (bi-cistronic ATF4-dGFP-IRES-mCherry) stably integrated into a different cell line (U2OS cells). The read-out of this latter screen was microscopy-based, which allowed us to simultaneously assess acute toxicity by cell counting, further reducing the number of viable hits to 77 (data not shown). As a tertiary screen, we tested compounds for their ability to inhibit ER stress-elicited induction of endogenous ATF4 by Western blot analysis. Twenty-eight compounds passed this test and were analyzed further.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00498.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High-throughput cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the ATF4 luciferase reporter used in the primary screen.

To this end, we first probed the phosphorylation status of PERK by Western blotting. PERK phosphorylation is indicative of its activation by autophosphorylation and can be recognized by reduced mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Notably, ISRIB did not inhibit the mobility shift of PERK observed in ER-stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Rather, we observed an exaggerated mobility shift, indicative of increased phosphorylation of PERK upon ER stress, induced by either thapsigargin or tunicamycin (an inhibitor of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation). In each case, in the absence of ISRIB, ATF4 and XBP1s were produced upon ER stress induction. In agreement with the behavior of the reporters described above, ISRIB blocked production of endogenous ATF4, whereas XBP1 mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and XBP1s production persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Upon induction of ER stress by tunicamycin or thapsigargin, phosphorylation of eIF2Î± increased over time, reaching a fourfold and sevenfold increase after 120 min respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, ISRIB did not block eIF2Î± phosphorylation under either of these ER stress-inducing conditions. On the contrary, 120 min after tunicamycin addition, ISRIB further increased the level of eIF2Î± phosphorylation, approaching that obtained with thapsigargin. ISRIB alone had no effect on eIF2Î± phosphorylation.

In agreement with this notion, ISRIB sustained global translation (as monitored by <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation into newly synthesized polypeptides) even in the presence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). After thapsigargin treatment, cells experienced a 40% drop in translation, which was abolished by ISRIB. As predicted by this result, extracts prepared from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) experiencing ER stress showed a pronounced increase in the 80S monosomes at the expense of polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which was reversed (at least partially) by addition of ISRIB. We chose MEFs for this analysis because they show stronger translational inhibition in response to ER stress than HEK293T cells. ISRIB was the only molecule in our collection of 28 hits that reversed translational attenuation upon ER-stress.</p><p>Under normal growth conditions, an abundance of 43S pre-initiation complexes (PICs) leads to mRNAs loaded with a small ribosomal subunit in addition to fully assembled ribosomes. The presence of PICs on an mRNA can be detected as âhalfmerâ peaks on polysome gradients. In the gradients shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, addition of a PIC to disomes and trisomes was well resolved (enlarged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Upon eIF2Î± phosphorylation in ER-stressed cells, the reduction in PIC resulted in disappearance of the halfmer population. As expected, the disappearance of the halfmer peak upon ER-stress was dependent on eIF2Î± phosphorylation as no reduction was observed in MEFs that solely express non-phosphorylatable eIF2Î±(S51A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Importantly, ISRIB partially restored the halfmer population in ER-stressed cells, providing support to the notion that it helps maintain high PIC levels even when eIF2Î± is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These data indicate that ISRIB exerts its function by maintaining elevated ternary complex levels.</p><p>To further ascertain that cells treated with ISRIB are resistant to the effects of eIF2Î± phosphorylation, we transduced an inducible phospho-mimetic allele of eIF2Î± in which serine 51 was changed to an aspartic acid (S51D) into HEK293T cells. Expression of this allele upon doxycycline addition induced translational attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) as seen by an increase in the 80S peak and a decrease in the polysome population. ISRIB rescued translation returning it to the levels observed in non-induced cells. In conclusion, ISRIB restores translation in cells containing either phospho-eIF2Î± or eIF2Î±(S51D), thereby excluding any pleiotropic effects that might have been caused by the reagents used to activate ER stress.</p><p>To rule out that ISRIB exerts non-specific effects on translation independent of eIF2Î± phosphorylation, we tested whether ISRIB reverses a translational block in CAP-mediated initiation. To this end we used Torin-1, an inhibitor of mTOR that blocks phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1, and leads to translational attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). Addition of Torin-1 to MEFs led to an increase in the 80S peak and reduction in the polysome population to a similar extent as shown above in cells treated with ER stressors or expressing eIF2Î±(S51D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In contrast to these treatments, addition of ISRIB did not reverse the effect of Torin-1 on translation. Therefore, the ability of ISRIB to block translational attenuation is specific to eIF2Î± phosphorylation.</p><p>If ISRIB makes cells insensitive to eIF2Î± phosphorylation, it should not matter which kinase phosphorylates eIF2Î±. To test this prediction, we subjected cells to amino acid starvation, which activates the eIF2Î± kinase GCN2 and leads to ATF4 production. In addition, we used a recently identified small molecule activator to induce eIF2Î± phosphorylation by activating HRI, another eIF2Î± kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, ISRIB blocked ATF4 induction after activation of either GCN2 or HRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Under both conditions, PERK was not activated as shown by a lack of mobility shift. These data suggest that ISRIB is a bona fide ISR inhibitor that blocks signaling downstream of all eIF2Î± kinases.</p><p>Both <italic>DDIT3</italic> (the gene encoding CHOP) and <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> (the gene encoding GADD34) are transcriptional targets of ATF4. Thus, blocking ATF4 accumulation with ISRIB should result in a reduction in the transcriptional induction of the mRNAs encoding these targets. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, GADD34 and CHOP mRNAs accumulated in ER-stressed U2OS cells, and ISRIB significantly reduced their induction. In agreement, we observed no CHOP accumulation after induction of ER stress in ISRIB-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Based on these observations, we wondered whether treatment of mice with ISRIB would affect memory. ISRIB showed favorable properties in pharmacokinetic profiling experiments indicating sufficient bioavailability for in vivo studies. ISRIB displayed a half-life in plasma of 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier, quickly equilibrating with the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). After a single intraperitoneal injection, we detected ISRIB in the brain of mice at concentrations several fold higher than its IC<sub>50</sub> (24 hr after injection, the ISRIB concentration in the brain was approximately 60 nM). To explore ISRIB's effects on memory, we injected mice intraperitoneally with ISRIB and tested hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. To this end, we trained mice in a Morris water maze, in which animals learn to associate visual cues with the location of a submerged hidden platform.

ISRIB is the first reported antagonist of the ISR. It acts as a potent and stereospecific inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5 nM in cultured cells, suggesting a specific and tight interaction with its cellular target. By blocking signaling through the PERK branch of the UPR, ISRIB prevents cells from re-establishing ER homeostasis. Unmitigated ER stress synergizes with ISRIB to induce apoptosis. ISRIB shows good pharmacokinetic properties, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and exhibits no overt toxicity in mice, making it suitable for in vivo studies. As such, ISRIB emerges as a powerful tool to explore the roles of the UPR and the ISR in disease models and physiological processes. In particular, we utilized ISRIB to show that overriding the consequences of eIF2Î± phosphorylation enhances memory consolidation in rodents, suggesting an important role of eIF2Î± phosphorylation in modulating higher-order brain function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular action of ISRIB</title><p>The structure of ISRIB provides no insights as to its target in cells. To date, we have synthesized and assayed more than 75 analogs, which demonstrate a tractable structure-activity relationship (to be published elsewhere). The analyses have identified sites on the molecule where affinity tags and/or crosslinking moieties can be added, which promise to aid in target identification. Based on previous insights on how cells can become resistant to eIF2Î± phosphorylation, we consider two likely scenarios by which ISRIB could act:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First, ISRIB could weaken the effects of the non-productive interaction of phospho-eIF2Î± with eIF2B, thereby increasing the available eIF2Î±-GEF activity in the cell, restoring the concentration of ternary complex that can engage in translation initiation. Precedence for this possibility derives from genetic studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where the molecular mechanism of regulation by eIF2Î± phosphorylation was first discovered. As in mammalian cells, amino acid starvation in yeast leads to GCN2 activation and eIF2Î± phosphorylation, resulting in overall translational down-regulation and translational induction of a transcriptional activator, GCN4, mediated by uORFs in the 5â²UTR of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). eIF2B is a conserved protein complex comprised of five different subunits, two of which form the catalytic core, and the remaining three have regulatory roles. Mutations in different eIF2B subunits can elicit a phospho-eIF2Î± resistant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vazquez de Aldana and Hinnebusch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pavitt et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1998</xref>). These mutations have been proposed to act either by weakening the interaction of phospho-eIF2Î± with eIF2B, reducing its ability to outcompete non-phosphorylated eIF2 for binding, or by allowing binding of phospho-eIF2Î± to the mutant eIF2B in a manner that is conducive to nucleotide exchange. ISRIB could be altering the affinity of phospho-eIF2Î± for eIF2B or overcoming the nonproductive interaction that blocks GTP loading, mimicking the effect of these mutations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second, ISRIB could increase the activity of eIF2B, so that the residual amount not engaged with phospho-eIF2Î± is sufficient to sustain normal levels of ternary complex. Precedence for this possibility derives from studies in macrophages, where engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 results in activation of the catalytic activity of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woo et al., 2012</xref>). This activation results from engagement of the TLR-signaling pathway that induces a phosphatase removing a constitutively present inhibitory phosphate from the eIF2B Îµ-subunit (S539). Pathogens utilize this mechanism to circumvent translational attenuation and CHOP production under prolonged stress-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). ISRIB did not reduce phosphorylation of S539 in the eIF2B Îµ-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that it does not utilize this particular regulatory phosphorylation to increase GEF activity. However, ISRIB may modulate other post-translational modifications that impinge on the activity of eIF2B.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ISRIB can influence cell fate</title><p>As a signaling network with interconnected signaling branches, the UPR exhibits both cytoprotective and pro-apoptotic functions. When faced with ER stress, PERK-mediated translational attenuation contributes to adaptation by reducing the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, induction of the transcription regulator ATF4 upregulates many genes that increase the protein folding capacity in the ER. Both of these activities serve to reestablish homeostasis, balancing the protein folding load and protein folding capacity in the ER lumen. This reasoning is supported by the increased sensitivity to ER stress exhibited by MEFs that lack PERK or ATF4, as well as MEFs that carry a non-phosphorylatable knock-in allele of eIF2Î±(S51A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). In agreement, we show that ISRIB decreases the viability of cells that are subjected to ER-stress. In these cells, ISRIB sustains IRE1 and ATF6 activation, indicating that ER stress remains unmitigated in the absence of PERK signaling. As some cancer cells sustain an activated UPR to aid in their survival, ISRIB could provide a new therapeutic approach to cancer chemotherapy. In agreement, a PERK-specific inhibitor demonstrates antitumor activity in a human pancreatic tumor xenograft model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axten et al., 2012</xref>). The deleterious synergistic effect between ER-stress and ISRIB may be generally advantageous to kill cancer cells, especially those derived from secretory lineages that have increased secretory load and increased basal levels of ER stress (including myelomas, and pancreatic and breast cancers).</p><p>Importantly, by acting downstream of eIF2Î± phosphorylation, ISRIB blocks multiple stress effectors (i.e., all eIF2Î± kinases). During tumor growth, hypoxic conditions and a lack of nutrients can activate both PERK and GCN2, and PERK<sup>â/â</sup> or GCN2<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs give rise to significantly smaller tumors in mouse xenograft models than their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2010</xref>). Hence both kinases have pro-survival roles in tumor development. By blocking signaling by both kinases, ISRIB displays unique properties that may be beneficial in reducing cellular fitness of tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ISRIB and brain function</title><p>The importance of eIF2/eIF2B function in the human brain is underscored by familial diseases caused by mutations in these factors. One example is Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM), which has been mapped to mutations in different subunits of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Wang, 2004</xref>). A second example links a familial intellectual disability syndrome to a mutation in the Î³-subunit of eIF2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borck et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of genetic evidence in mice suggest that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of eIF2Î± phosphorylation is a critical hub for the control of synaptic plasticity (as assessed by late long-term potentiation [L-LTP] in brain slices) and memory consolidation (as assessed in behavioral tasks in animals). In particular, the threshold for induction of L-LTP is reduced and memory consolidation is enhanced in mice lacking GCN2 or PKR and in mice heterozygous for non-phosphorylatable eIF2Î±(S51A), which have reduced levels of eIF2Î± phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). As we show here, ISRIB pharmacologically phenocopies these genetic manipulations in behavioral tasks by rendering cells insensitive to eIF2Î± phosphorylation. In agreement, treatment of mice with a PKR inhibitor was reported to enhance memory consolidation, and, conversely, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor that prolongs eIF2Î± phosphorylation, to block L-LTP and memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>eIF2Î± phosphorylation results in a dual effect on gene expression: a global translational diminution and translational upregulation of select mRNA, including ATF4 mRNA. Both may be important to explain the observed effects on L-LTP and memory. It has long been appreciated that new protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation and that ATF4 represses CREB-mediated transcription of âmemory genesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klann and Dever, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>). Indeed, this latter function of ATF4 in memory consolidation is evolutionarily conserved from <italic>Aplysia</italic> to rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartsch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Because a small physiological increase in the level of eIF2Î± phosphorylation that does not significantly alter overall translation is sufficient to induce ATF4, production of this transcription factor can be finely tuned in neuronal cells by perhaps selective activation of different eIF2Î± kinases. The observed effects of ISRIB may therefore result from overcoming effects caused by a relatively small level of regulatory phosphorylation that is distinct from the high level resulting from ER stress-inducing agents. In light of this reasoning, a therapeutic window may exist in which ISRIBâs effects as memory enhancer can be exploited without encountering long-term toxic consequences.</p><p>ISRIB increases memory consolidation, allowing pharmacological enhancement of the brainâs ability to learn. Evolution therefore did not arrive at a maximally optimized process, imposing a brake (via eIF2Î± phosphorylation) on memory consolidation. This mechanism may underscore the importance of filtering memories before committing them to long-term storage. Indeed, eIF2Î± phosphorylation also plays a role in dynamic restructuring of memory, as indicated by studies showing that ablation of PERK in the brain impairs behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trinh et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that ISRIB or compounds with related activities could serve as invaluable tools in deciphering these higher order brain functions and perhaps be beneficial as a therapeutic agent effecting memory improvement in diseases associated with memory impairment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T, TREx293, U2OS, Hela, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained at 37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Tunicamycin was obtained from Calbiochem EMB Bioscience, Billerica, MA.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Our consensus is that the discovery of a small molecule that interposes itself (functionally) between the phosphorylated alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2Î±) and the target of this phosphorylation event, the translational machinery, thereby inhibiting an ancient signaling pathway known as the integrated stress response, is an important discovery. No one has previously reported a functionally similar inhibitorâin fact, until this report, it was unsuspected that this node in the ISR was even susceptible to inhibition.</p><p>The compound is remarkably potent, hitting its unknown target(s) when applied to cells at a submicromolar concentration.</p><p>The functional characterization of the compound is rather thorough and thus its utility as a tool compound is well documentedâthis is important, as many other âfirstsâ of this type report on theoretical tool compounds, but fall short of demonstrating in vivo utility. Thus, there is reason to hope that ISRIB will be applied to much further research and that this paper will serve as a foundation for such studies.</p><p>Lastly, the reviewers were impressed by effects on memory formation, which is enhanced by application of the compound.</p><p>Whereas the functional characterisation of ISRIB is very thorough, it is not matched by a similar level of molecular detail. We do not know if ISRIB directly modulates the interaction of eIF2Î± with eIF2B or the competing interactions with eIF5 or some aspect of eIF2B activityâpossibilities noted by the authors in their Discussion.</p><p>The four reviewers were initially divided on the impact of this deficiency on the suitability of the paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The conclusion of our deliberations is that some simple measuresâthat will provide further clues to the site of the compound's actionâneed to be taken before the paper will be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The effect of ISRIB application on the recovery of a complex between eIF2 and eIF2B could be measured directly in lysates of unstressed and stressed cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Chris Proudâs lab has expressed tagged versions of eIF2B subunits that associate with endogenous eIF2 in transfected HEK293 cells (they co-precipitate eIF2Î± and eIF2Î±-P by pulling-down the tagged eIF2B subunit (see Figure 2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21560189">PMID: 21560189</ext-link>). If a coherent effect is observed (say less eIF2Î±-P associating with tagged eIF2Be in ISRIB-treated stressed cells) the discussion, focusing on that aspect, would be justified. However, if no effect is observed, the alternative discussion (focusing on a possible enhancement of eIF2Bâs enzymatic activity) would be justified.</p><p>2) Similarly, the impact of ISRIB application on those aspects of the phosphorylation status of eIF2B that can be queried by commercially available phospho-specific antibodies should be measured.</p><p>3) In relation to the compoundâs effects on memory, it was deemed important to assess the likelihood that ISRIB affects memory formation by acting on brain cells, as opposed to eliciting these effects by peripheral action. Therefore it would seem important to determine if the compound gets into the CNS, when applied at doses that affect memory. Perhaps it is possible to analyze levels in the CSF of injected animals or address this matter functionally by measuring ISR activity in the CNS of injected animals in a suitable experimental design.</p><p>4) Finally ISRIB treatment was post-training for water maze and cued fear conditioning (in order to focus on effects of ISRIB on memory consolidation), but ISRIB treatment was chronic prior to training for contextual fear conditioning. The authors are asked to address how this affects the conclusions regarding the compounds impact on memory consolidation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00498.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The effect of ISRIB application on the recovery of a complex between eIF2 and eIF2B could be measured directly in lysates of unstressed and stressed cells by co-immunoprecipitation.

However, if no effect is observed, the alternative discussion (focusing on a possible enhancement of eIF2Bâs enzymatic activity) would be justified</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the experiment suggested (Chris Proud kindly provided the plasmids encoding the myc-tagged subunits of eIF2B) and we are able to co- immunoprecipitate eIF2Î± after a Ni-NTA pull-down. However, no differences are observed in the amount associated of either the phospho- or total eIF2Î± in the presence or absence of ISRIB. We have not pursued this effort further because we are overexpressing the GEF significantly, and we believe that the absence of effect of ISRIB on the interaction between eIF2B and eIF2 may not necessarily reflect what happens under physiological expression levels.</p><p>In addition, we have performed sucrose gradients to reveal changes in the interaction of eIF2 and eIF2B following the endogenous complexes (HEK293T cells) with antibodies against eIF2Î± and eIF2BÎµ. We do not observe significant changes in complex formation (eIF2B-eIF2) upon ER-stress and thus we are not able to test the effect of ISRIB on this interaction.</p><p>We are currently developing potent ISRIB analogs that will allow us to cross-link ISRIB to its target. Our strategy is to develop appropriate biochemical assays to unravel the molecular mechanism after identification of its target. Although increasing eIF2B activity or decreasing the interaction of phospho- eIF2Î± with eIF2B are possible modes in which ISRIB could generate a resistant phenotype, there are many other ways in which this molecule could act. For example ISRIB could modulate the interaction between eIF2 and eIF5, which acts as a GAP and GDI. We believe that the unbiased search for ISRIBâs target will be a more linear path to unravel its mechanism of action than ruling in or out individual possibilities.</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, the impact of ISRIB application on those aspects of the phosphorylation status of eIF2B that can be queried by commercially available phospho-specific antibodies should be measured</italic>.</p><p>We queried the phosphorylation status of Serine 539 of the eIF2BÎµ subunit and found no differences in the presence or absence of ISRIB. This site is constitutively phosphorylated by GSK and negative regulates eIF2B activity. In macrophages, dephosphorylation of S539 is induced upon pathogen invasion and TLR engagement, leading to increased eIF2B GEF activity inducing a phospho-eIF2Î± resistant phenotype (Woo et al, Nat. Cell Biol, January 2012). ISRIB does not elicit this phenotype by modulating this phosphorylation site. We added the data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and mentioned this result in the Discussion. To our knowledge no other phospho-specific antibodies are commercially available for eIF2B putative regulatory phosphorylation sites.</p><p><italic>3) In relation to the compoundâs effects on memory, it was deemed important to assess the likelihood that ISRIB affects memory formation by acting on brain cells, as opposed to eliciting these effects by peripheral action. Therefore it would seem important to determine if the compound gets into the CNS, when applied at doses that affect memory. Perhaps it is possible to analyze levels in the CSF of injected animals or address this matter functionally by measuring ISR activity in the CNS of injected animals in a suitable experimental design</italic>.</p><p>We have confirmed the presence of ISRIB in the brain by mass spectrometry. We performed a single intraperitonneal injection at 2.5 mg/kg (the dose used in the context-cued fear conditioning experiment) and detect the appearance of ISRIB in the brain with the same dynamics of accumulation that we observed in plasma. After 24 hr, the time-point at which long-term memory is measured, the concentration of ISRIB in the brain is 30 ng/g of tissue or approximately 60 nM (12-fold higher than its IC<sub>50</sub>). We have included the pharmacokinetic data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p><p>We have not been able to look at ISR activity in the brain in the experimental setup that replicates the behavioral tests. In this scenario, there is no significant result that increases eIF2Î± phosphorylation or ATF4 production. We postulate that memory depends on transient and local changes in eIF2Î± phosphorylation. Looking at the modulation of eIF2Î± phosphorylation in the brain and the effect of ISRIB will have to await the development of more sensitive in vivo tools that report on this molecular event, such as an ATF4-luciferase reporter mouse.</p><p><italic>4) Finally ISRIB treatment was post-training for water maze and cued fear conditioning (in order to focus on effects of ISRIB on memory consolidation), but ISRIB treatment was chronic prior to training for contextual fear conditioning. The authors are asked to address how this affects the conclusions regarding the compounds impact on memory consolidation</italic>.</p><p>The cued fear conditioning experiment was repeated and ISRIB was injected only once after training at a higher concentration (2.5 mg/kg instead of 0.25 mg/kg).</p><p>We observed increased freezing with this new dosing and have changed the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and have updated the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
