metabolize plant defense compounds, but the physiological and ecological consequences are not fully understood. It has rarely been studied whether such metabolism is genuinely beneficial to the insect, and whether there are any effects on higher trophic levels. Here, we manipulated the detoxification of plant defenses in the herbivorous pest diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>) to evaluate changes in fitness, and additionally examined the effects on a predatory lacewing (<italic>Chrysoperla carnea</italic>). Silencing glucosinolate sulfatase genes resulted in the systemic accumulation of toxic isothiocyanates in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, impairing larval development and adult reproduction. The predatory lacewing <italic>C. carnea</italic>, however, efficiently degraded ingested isothiocyanates via a general conjugation pathway, with no negative effects on survival, reproduction, or even prey preference. These results illustrate how plant defenses and their detoxification strongly influence herbivore fitness but might only subtly affect a third trophic level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucosinolate/Isothiocyanate</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>multitrophic</kwd><kwd><italic>Plutella xylostella</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Chrysoperla carnea</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Ruo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Ruo</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Xingcong</given-names></name><name><surname>Reichelt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Gershenzon</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Pandit</surname><given-names>Sagar Subhash</given-names></name><name><surname>Giddings Vassão</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic manipulation demonstrates the costs and benefits of detoxifying glucosinolate plant defenses in a pest insect and its predator.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The chemical defenses of plants constitute a major obstacle to herbivore feeding. Many plant defenses are glycosylated pro-toxins, such as glucosinolates, benzoxazinoids, cyanogenic glucosides, and iridoid glucosides, that are non-toxic by themselves, but liberate toxins after activation by glucosidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>). Glucosinolates are activated specifically by β-thioglucosidases called myrosinases, which are stored separately from their substrates to avoid self-intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bones and Rossiter, 1996</xref>). Activation occurs upon plant damage, for example herbivore feeding, when compartments containing enzymes and the glucosylated pro-toxins are ruptured, leading to mixing of their contents and subsequent hydrolysis. The glucosinolate-derived aglucones are unstable and rearrange to form isothiocyanates and other products such as the generally less toxic nitriles, either spontaneously or by the action of so-called specifier proteins that help guide rearrangement in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and other Brassicaceae plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wittstock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wittstock et al., 2004</xref>). Glucosinolate side-chains can further dictate post-hydrolysis reactivities and occasionally lead to additional intramolecular reactions (e.g. cyclization to form oxazolidine-2-thione derivatives) or rapid loss of the –N=C=S group (e.g. to form the carbinol products of indolic glucosinolates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wittstock et al., 2016</xref>), which alter toxicity. Isothiocyanates, the most typical glucosinolate hydrolysis products, are considered toxic to a variety of herbivorous organisms due to their lipophilic properties that facilitate diffusion through membranes and the electrophilic –N=C=S functional core that reacts with intracellular nucleophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanschen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeschke et al., 2016a</xref>). This liberation of toxic products from glucosinolates constitutes the characteristic ‘mustard oil bomb’ defense system of plants of the family Brassicaceae and related families.</p><p>Some herbivores possess mechanisms to potentially avoid the toxicity of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeschke et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winde and Wittstock, 2011</xref>). For example, <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (the diamondback moth, Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a notorious agricultural pest specializing on plants of the Brassicaceae, produces glucosinolate-specific sulfatases that rapidly desulfate glucosinolates to form desulfo-glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ratzka et al., 2002</xref>), which are no longer substrates for myrosinases and are therefore non-toxic. This process is controlled by a small gene family encoding glucosinolate sulfatases (GSSs) with varying specificity for different types of glucosinolates. GSS1 desulfated all glucosinolates tested in vitro except for 1MOI3M, while GSS3 only metabolized benzenic and indolic glucosinolates and GSS2 accepted only a few very long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidel-Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). GSSs may help to avoid the toxicity of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system, and indeed it was reported that <italic>P. xylostella</italic> contains sufficient GSS (based on an in vitro assay of purified protein) to readily desulfate all ingested glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ratzka et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, when isotopically labeled glucosinolates were administered to <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, over 80% were converted to desulfo-glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeschke et al., 2017</xref>). However, it cannot be automatically assumed that desulfation is an effective detoxification strategy without knowing if it is of net benefit to the performance and fitness of the herbivore, since desulfation may incur unanticipated physiological costs.</p><p><italic>P. xylostella</italic> is currently the most devastating pest of cultivated Brassicaceae crops in the world, causing losses of US$ 4–5 billion per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zalucki et al., 2012</xref>). Its destructiveness can be attributed to its extremely short life cycle (14 days), which allows it to complete more than 20 generations per year, and its rapid development of resistance to pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sarfraz et al., 2005</xref>), making it one of the most difficult agricultural pests to control. ‘Natural enemies’ have therefore been explored as alternative <italic>P. xylostella</italic> control agents, including predators, parasitoids, entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sarfraz et al., 2005</xref>). One natural enemy used in diamondback moth management is the predatory lacewing C<italic>hrysoperla carnea</italic> (the common green lacewing, Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McEwen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reddy et al., 2004</xref>). When <italic>C. carnea</italic> preys on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae feeding on Brassicaceae plants, the lacewing can be expected to encounter plant-derived glucosinolates or their metabolites. However, it is unclear whether such plant defense compounds or derivatives might harm <italic>P. xylostella</italic> predators. Plant chemicals can traverse trophic levels and affect predators, as when they are sequestered by a herbivore for its own defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2002</xref>). The cabbage aphid, <italic>Brevicoryne brassicae</italic>, for example, accumulates high concentrations of glucosinolates from its host plants and uses these compounds in defense against predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kos et al., 2011</xref>). In this work, we therefore attempted to down-regulate <italic>P. xylostella</italic> GSS activity to determine if glucosinolate desulfation fundamentally benefits <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, and also whether or not it has consequences for a higher trophic level.</p><p>We chose plant-mediated RNAi to silence <italic>gss</italic> genes since this method is reported to have high success against lepidopteran targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poreddy et al., 2017</xref>). In leaves of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 accession used here, aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates constitute around 85% and 15% of the total glucosinolate pool, respectively, with 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate (4MSOB) representing over 70% of the aliphatic glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2003</xref>). Using <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants with wild-type glucosinolates and <italic>myb28myb29</italic> mutant plants without aliphatic glucosinolates, both engineered to target <italic>gss</italic> gene expression, we achieved significant silencing of <italic>gss</italic> in <italic>P. xylostella.</italic> We demonstrated that suppression of glucosinolate desulfation increased larval isothiocyanate levels, which had significant negative impacts on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> growth, survival and reproduction, establishing that this detoxification mechanism is beneficial to the herbivore in spite of its observed cost. Although the increased isothiocyanate accumulation in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae impaired the growth of predatory <italic>C. carnea</italic> larvae, <italic>C. carnea</italic> detoxified isothiocyanates via the general mercapturic acid pathway and excreted the metabolites in their larval anal secretion resulting in no net effect on pupal mortality and adult egg-laying capacity. Therefore, our work shows that both the herbivore and its predator detoxify plant defensive chemicals with their own independent mechanisms with resulting benefits to reproductive fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>gss1</italic> is abundantly expressed in the midgut of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae</title><p>To determine the role of glucosinolate sulfatase (GSS) in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> in more detail, we explored the location of <italic>gss</italic> gene expression by qRT-PCR in dissected tissues of fourth-instar larvae.

In several cases, expression of detoxification-related genes and resulting enzyme activities are induced in the herbivore midgut in response to plant defense compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesanya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schweizer et al., 2017</xref>). We show that this scenario also holds true for the diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>), a herbivore specialized on plants of the Brassicaceae that employs a glucosinolate sulfatase (GSS) activity to disarm the glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system of its host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ratzka et al., 2002</xref>). Although GSS had been assumed to be constitutively present in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winde and Wittstock, 2011</xref>), by comparing larvae feeding on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants differing in glucosinolate contents, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidel-Fischer et al., 2019</xref>) have observed the induction of <italic>gss</italic> transcript levels and GSS enzyme activity in the midgut upon dietary glucosinolate ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,G</xref>). The GSS detoxification system of the specialized herbivore <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is therefore also inducible, similarly to the GSS activity previously identified in the generalist-feeding desert locust (<italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falk and Gershenzon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The inducibility of GSS can be seen as a way for the herbivore to minimize the physiological costs of detoxification. By producing this enzyme only when needed and predominantly in the gut epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that are the first cells to take up glucosinolates from the gut, the insect may minimize the resources needed for GSS synthesis and maintenance. However, induced GSS detoxification still imposes costs, as inferred from slower larval development when feeding on glucosinolate-containing wild-type plants relative to aliphatic glucosinolate-depleted mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A trade-off between growth and detoxification capacity has also been noted for other insect herbivores feeding on glucosinolate-containing plants. Several generalist lepidopteran caterpillars resist glucosinolate poisoning by metabolizing isothiocyanates, the chief toxic products of glucosinolate hydrolysis, to their corresponding glutathione (GSH) conjugates. However, the cost of biosynthesizing the GSH necessary for isothiocyanate detoxification leads to delayed larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeschke et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeschke et al., 2017</xref>).

Nevertheless, it has been documented that RNAi is less efficient in lepidopterans than in other insect orders and gives rise to varying effects in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shukla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Terenius et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies on <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> revealed that exogenous dsRNA is not only readily degraded, but also lacks intracellular transport in larvae, reducing the efficiency of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shukla et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, on the other hand, has been successfully silenced by feeding droplets of dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista et al., 2009</xref>) and bacterially produced dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Israni and Rajam, 2017</xref>). However, as a result of the absence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in insects, continuous feeding is required to maintain gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scott et al., 2013</xref>). Plant-mediated dsRNA delivery has been shown to be an effective way to silence target genes in lepidopterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poreddy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), for which dsRNA can be constantly incorporated by dietary ingestion.

This was accompanied by a large increase in isothiocyanates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the typical toxic products arising from hydrolysis of aliphatic glucosinolates. These metabolic changes resulted in a dramatic decline in larval growth (50%) and an increase in pupal mortality (4-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), as well as a decline in both egg laying (over 50%) and in egg hatching (about 30%) in different mating combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). The changes observed in egg laying and hatching indicate a sex-specific effect of ITCs, wherein ITC-exposed females laid fewer eggs, and mating with ITC-exposed males decreased the success of egg hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). Interestingly, egg clutches seem to gather into two separate clusters of high and low hatching success. Hatching success was not linked to the numbers of eggs laid by each female, with low-hatching egg batches distributed among clutches of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). We can also discard effects from parental ages as a source of this distribution, as only newly emerged moths were paired; however, the frequency and duration of copulation were not recorded. Bimodal egg hatching patterns were also observed when larvae fed on infiltrated ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and on <italic>myb28myb29</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) instead of Col-0 EV controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating this effect was consistent among experiments and suggesting it is linked to mating under these conditions. For instance, the isolation of mating pairs into one couple per mating chamber, preventing females from being able to choose among mates, could have led to incompatible matings. It has been documented that repeated mating and multiple partners increase insect egg fertility, with females able to invest less in incompatible males or entirely avoiding them, while incompatible pairings can lead to less viable or unfertilized eggs being laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnqvist and Nilsson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saheb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tregenza and Wedell, 2002</xref>). However, this bimodality and the sex-specific effects of ITCs on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> reproduction deserve further investigation.</p><p>The negative effects of <italic>gss</italic> silencing on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> growth and reproduction were also observed when larvae fed on leaves from glucosinolate-lacking mutant plants that were complemented with natural concentrations of the major isothiocyanate formed by <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results support the involvement of this isothiocyanate in the negative consequences of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> aliphatic glucosinolates on silenced <italic>P. xylostella</italic>. Infiltration of ITCs into detached leaves only approximates the natural larval feeding conditions, and could for example lead to unnatural concentrations of ITC-derived products or alter larval feeding behavior. Nevertheless, the combined amounts of 4MSOB-ITC and its known conjugates in larvae after ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) very closely matched not only the natural concentrations of those compounds but also the total 4MSOB-ITC dose administered to leaves, suggesting that little additional metabolism had taken place. Additionally, the relative differences in larval weights between <italic>gss</italic>-silenced and control larvae feeding on wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves (approximately 40% lower at eight dph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and between larvae fed on 4MSOB-ITC-infiltrated and non-infiltrated leaves (approximately 40–50% lower at eight dph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are also similar, supporting an equivalence of the treatments.</p><p>At the time of its initial discovery in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ratzka et al., 2002</xref>), desulfation of glucosinolates was recognized as a way for insect herbivores to avoid glucosinolate toxicity by preventing myrosinase catalysis of glucosinolate hydrolysis since desulfo-glucosinolates are known not to be substrates for myrosinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matile, 1980</xref>). The original report calculated that the GSS activity in each larva was sufficient to readily desulfate all ingested glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ratzka et al., 2002</xref>), and more recent quantitative isotopic tracer experiments revealed that over 80% of the glucosinolates ingested by <italic>P. xylostella</italic> are indeed desulfated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeschke et al., 2017</xref>). Here we show that desulfation in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is a detoxification reaction that increases performance and reproductive fitness, in spite of the energy investment required. This conclusion is consistent with a recent evolutionary study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidel-Fischer et al., 2019</xref>) demonstrating that the <italic>gss</italic> genes of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> acquired their present function encoding GSSs under positive selection pressure. Thus it seems likely that the glucosinolate desulfation reactions reported in the desert locust <italic>S. gregaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falk and Gershenzon, 2007</xref>), the turnip sawfly <italic>Athalia rosae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Opitz et al., 2011</xref>), the silverleaf whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malka et al., 2016</xref>) and the flea beetle <italic>Psylliodes chrysocephala</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beran et al., 2018</xref>) also function as genuine detoxification measures.</p><p>Nevertheless, the desulfation process may be not equally effective for all types of glucosinolates. The 132 documented natural glucosinolates are classified as aliphatic, indolic and benzenic depending upon their side-chain structures, with further diversification from added double bonds, hydroxyl or carbonyl groups, and sulfur oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agerbirk and Olsen, 2012</xref>). A recent characterization of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> GSS enzymes indicates that the three individual GSS enzymes desulfate specific subsets of glucosinolate substrates, with GSS1 being particularly important for desulfation of aliphatic glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidel-Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, the transcripts of <italic>gss1</italic> are higher than <italic>gss2</italic> and <italic>gss3</italic> in the midgut of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, consistent with aliphatic glucosinolates being the most abundant class in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although inhibition of myrosinase activity was proposed as a way to prevent glucosinolate intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeschke et al., 2016a</xref>), until now there has been no concrete evidence to support it. GSS itself may inhibit myrosinase action not only by diversion of the substrate for hydrolysis, but by the inhibitory effect of the sulfate moiety released from the desulfation process on myrosinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shikita et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Predatory lacewing larvae that metabolize the isothiocyanates in their <italic>gss</italic>-silenced larval prey incur a cost in reduced growth, but avoid long-term effects on fitness</title><p>Certain species of insect herbivores are well known to actively accumulate plant glucosinolates as defenses against their enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Francis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kazana et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winde and Wittstock, 2011</xref>).

Fresh plants were provided every day until larvae reached the fourth-instar stage. Then, fresh larval frass was collected (one separate sample per box) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for further use. Two frass aliquots (approximately 0.5 mg each) were weighed from each frass stock for enzyme assays. One aliquot was heated at 100°C for 30 min as a negative control. Both heat-inactivated and fresh frass sets were spiked with 4MSOB (10 µL of 2.5 mM) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µL methanol. Subsequently, concentrations of 4MSOB, desulfo-4MSOB and 4MSOB-ITC were measured by LC-MS/MS to determine <italic>P. xylostella</italic> GSS and plant myrosinase activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Complementation experiments</title><p>To determine whether formation of 4MSOB-ITC in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> caused the phenotypes attributed to <italic>gss</italic> silencing, complementation experiments were conducted by infiltrating 4MSOB-ITC (BIOZOL Diagnostica Vertrieb, Eching, Germany) into empty vector and <italic>gss1</italic> RNAi infiltrated <italic>myb28myb29</italic> leaves. Natural concentrations of 4MSOB-ITC were employed as would result from hydrolysis of typical <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 foliage: 250 nmol/g fresh weight leaf, as determined by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Each <italic>C. carnea</italic> larva was separately fed on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae from the corresponding groups in a 35 mL vial. Numbers and developmental stages of the prey were chosen according to the predator developmental stage to ensure <italic>C. carnea</italic> always had sufficient food. First- and second-instar <italic>C. carnea</italic> larvae were fed on second- and fourth-instar <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, respectively. When <italic>C. carnea</italic> larvae reached third-instar, guts with gut lumen, hemolymph, Malpighian tubules, anal secretion, and integument and fat bodies were collected, totaling approximately 3 mg, 1 µL, 0.5 mg, 3 µL and 5 mg respectively (fresh weights). Tissues of three larvae were pooled to produce one sample. The anal secretion of <italic>C. carnea</italic> larvae was collected with a 10 µL pipette. Larvae transfer the droplet to the pipette tip as a defense reaction when touched by the tip on the dorsal abdomen. Collected anal secretion was washed into 200 µL extraction solvent (60% methanol, pH 3.0) immediately and kept at −20°C until further analyses. Hemolymph of each larva was collected by a 10 µL pipette through a small wound in the posterior abdominal segment scratched by a 5 mm needle. Tissues were dissected under a dissecting microscope and washed in TE buffer carefully to remove adhered hemolymph. Pupal pellet left in the cocoon was collected after adult emergence (approximately 1 mg from three pupae combined). Meconium (approximately 5 mg from three adults combined) excreted by the adults in the first few hours after emergence was collected together with the adults. All collected larval, pupal and adult tissues and excretions were weighed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80°C until further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Performance of <italic>C. carnea</italic></title><p>To determine the influence of 4MSOB-ITC on <italic>C. carnea</italic>, the performance of this lacewing was assessed when continuously preying on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> fed on empty vector or <italic>gss1</italic> RNAi infiltrated plants from either Col-0 or <italic>myb28myb29</italic> backgrounds.

specific mechanisms-and much less the individual genes-driving these interactions are not well known. One particular candidate for mediating such interactions is a sulfatase gene in a plant herbivore that is believed to provide resistance to plant defenses and possibly impact predators. In this study, the authors utilize cross-species RNA approaches to abolish the sulfatase gene in the herbivore and showed that this alters the herbivores interaction with both the plant and the predator. This provides an avenue to begin mechanistic studies in tritrophic interactions where the system is recalcitrant to transformation or to other genetic interventions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multitrophic metabolism of plant chemical defenses and its effects on herbivore and predator performance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers and editors agreed that the work is a very interesting and explicit test of how individual genes can influence multi-trophic interactions. Below are merely some specific suggestions for clarifications and more appropriate statistics that will help to strengthen the manuscript. They do not require any new experimentation. Please see the specific suggestions in the individual reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors utilize a trans-specific RNA to knockout a key defense mechanism within <italic>P. xylostella</italic> and then investigate how it affects multi-trophic interactions. This provides an interesting mechanistic assessment of multitrophic interactions via a specific enzyme/chemical relationship.</p><p>The authors should probably caveat the idea that the isothiocyanates are generally toxic and how broadly the work can be interpreted. For example, if this work was done in a plant accumulating the 2-hydroxy-but-3-enyl glucosinolate, the main hydrolysis product would actually be goitrin which has the ability to directly influence pupal transitions due to interacting with the juvenile hormone receptor that is a paralogue of the human thyroid receptor targeted by goitrin. Thus, I would encourage the authors to be more explicit about how shifting to different plants with different chemotypes might yield a different answer. Relying on the general isothiocyanates are generic toxins might be an over assumption in this system.</p><p>Infiltrating Arabidopsis with 4MSOB-ITC could be creating new compounds as Arabidopsis has processes to metabolize these compounds. For example, work by the Jeschke and Bednarek groups has shown that Arabidopsis will create raphanusamic acid from a wide range of ITCs. Thus, it is not clear how to truly interpret the subsection “4MSOB-ITC is responsible for the negative effects of gss silencing on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> performance”. This could be due to the 4MSOB-ITC or it could be from activities associated with the further catabolism of this product. While it appears as a nice complementation experiment, the authors should discuss the complexities of its interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Sun et al. performed VIGS transient knockdown of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants, fed different transient mutants to <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> larvae, compared glucosinolate metabolism in larval body across different genotypes, and probed for tritrophic interactions mediated by glucosinolates with <italic>C. carnea</italic> – a predator of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>. Authors found that <italic>P. xylostella</italic> glucosinolate sulfatase significantly reduces the toxic effects of isothiocyanates. Authors also suggest that <italic>C. carnea</italic> is able to withstand the toxic effects of glucosinolate hydrolysis by derivatizing isothiocyanates differently.</p><p>The manuscript is very well-written and experiments beautifully designed and executed. I have no major concerns about the manuscript. Some suggestions noted below:</p><p>– Unlike Figure 2C, D, F, distributions in Figure 2B are bimodal. Is that a statistical fluke? Any thoughts on why that is the case? If that experiment has not been replicated, I would suggest doing that to ensure consistency of results and robustness of the bimodal pattern, which could point to something interesting. This is not an essential experiment for the revision though.</p><p>– In Figure 5B, I'm assuming most Desulfo-4MSOB is from the ingested <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae? If so, that is not clear in the text. Also, given the levels of 4MSOB-ITC-NAC in Figure 5D in anal secretion are only 33-50% of the 4MSOB-ITC levels shown in Figure 5C, does it not mean that <italic>C. carnea</italic> manages 4MSOB-ITC mostly through excretion rather than detoxification? Figure 5—figure supplement 1 also suggests that only ~40% of the 4MSOB-ITC is detoxified to NAC, while the rest is excreted as such and minimally accumulates in the haemolymph.</p><p>– Roughly speaking, what% of the effects (none/some/most) of feeding 4MSOB-ITC to larvae (Figure 4) could be due to lower feeding frequency/changes in feeding behavior e.g. due to the feed becoming distasteful? Any previous experiments or evidence from this paper to argue against it? If not, please note the possibility in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I was excited to read this interesting study examining the physiological and ecological consequences of detoxification of plant defenses in herbivores and their predators. The main finding is that gss-silencing reduced larval development and reproduction of a specialist herbivore. I was particularly interested in the effects of plant defenses cascading up to higher trophic levels. Lacewings fed on both silenced and non-silenced prey, and although there was a slight reduction in larval performance, gss-silencing had no effect on survival or reproduction. The question is novel with important implication to crop protection.</p><p>Overall the paper reads well, however some statistical analyses need clarification. A different statistical approach is recommended to test percentage data. To test differences in choice between different treatment the authors should use a GLM with binomial distribution and logit link function. Also, GLM with logit distribution would be a more robust test for percentages. Why was mortality/survival not analyzed using survival analysis?</p><p>In some experiments, it was unclear whether caterpillars were being fed individually or in groups. It is important to know how many plants and how many caterpillars were used because caterpillar feeding on the same plant are not independent and should not be treated as such in the analyses.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tritrophic metabolism of plant chemical defenses and its effects on herbivore and predator performance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This provides some of the first gene level evidence for the mechanisms controlling multi-trophic interactions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All the reviewers were happy with the revision but in discussions we all agreed that we should go with a revision to provide a chance to clarify some aspects surrounding the multi-modality. We agree that the biomodality is balanced across the groups so not changing the mean relationships. However, nearly ever reviewer and editor has been puzzled by this indicating that every reader will be equally puzzled. Any explicit thoughts that you can provide to explain this biomodality will go a long way to alleviating the reviewers puzzlement. Different mother ages? etc? Further, it would be advised to state that the residuals are normally distributed between the groups in these tests to alleviate statistical concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I would like to thank the reviewers for shifting to two-way ANOVAs but it is not clear how these are being presented in the figures. A two-way ANOVA will provide a significance for the main effects and the interaction while in the figures it still appears to be pairwise t-test results that are being shown.</p><p>I am still concerned by the bimodality in the egg laying/hatching experiment and the correlation analysis further raises this as a concern. In the correlation analysis, it appears that there are really two correlations in the data with one being a low hatching. Is there variation in the age of the mothers such that some are either much younger or older than others that could be linked to this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed all my concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors did a great job addressing all my comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51029.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The authors should probably caveat the idea that the isothiocyanates are generally toxic and how broadly the work can be interpreted.

We now try to be clearer (Introduction, first paragraph) that this general toxicity can be further modulated by the side-chain – and in cases such as the more reactive progoitrin and indolic glucosinolate products, would even result in products lacking a chemically exposed –N=C=S group. Although we focus here strongly on 4MSOB, these side-chain dependencies would be an interesting avenue to follow in more detail in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Infiltrating Arabidopsis with 4MSOB-ITC could be creating new compounds as Arabidopsis has processes to metabolize these compounds.

While ITC catabolites might be formed as a result of our infiltration, we expect their amounts and effects were small, as the amounts of ITC added to the leaves closely matched the amounts we recovered as the free ITC and known GSH-derived products. Unfortunately, our previous attempts at other delivery methods (e.g. coating the surface of leaves with ITC solutions) were not successful (leading to very non-uniform ITC distributions), so infiltration was the best available choice we had for a clean complementation experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The manuscript is very well-written and experiments beautifully designed and executed.

As stated in the reply to reviewer #1, we cannot explain this distribution. This experiment was performed as a single batch and not subdivided into blocks. Although the origin of this distribution is currently unknown, this effect seems to be consistent, as similar distributions were observed when the experiment was performed with infiltrated ITC (Figure 4) and with <italic>myb28myb29</italic> plants (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) instead of Col-0 EV controls. As an attempt to present the data more clearly, we are now also showing the numbers of eggs hatched as a correlation to the numbers of eggs laid (Figure 2G, H; Figure 4G, H; and Figure 2—figure supplement 2I-L) – this way the lower hatching success can also be visualized as a lower slope of the corresponding line, and it is apparent that low-hatching batches were not clustered in particular egg numbers but rather distributed along the x axis. Regarding Figure 2B, measurements of pupal mortality were taken in 3 independent experiment repetitions (see Figure 2—source data 1) with consistent results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 5B, I'm assuming most Desulfo-4MSOB is from the ingested P. xylostella larvae? If so, that is not clear in the text. Also, given the levels of 4MSOB-ITC-NAC in Figure 5D in anal secretion are only 33-50% of the 4MSOB-ITC levels shown in Figure 5C, does it not mean that C. carnea manages 4MSOB-ITC mostly through excretion rather than detoxification? Figure 5—figure supplement 1 also suggests that only ~40% of the 4MSOB-ITC is detoxified to NAC, while the rest is excreted as such and minimally accumulates in the haemolymph.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is our interpretation as well, that both desulfo-4MSOB and 4MSOB-ITC present in <italic>C. carnea</italic> were ingested from <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae. Thanks for pointing out that this was not clear in the text, we now added this information to the subsection “Lacewing larvae predating upon <italic>gss</italic>-silenced <italic>P. xylostella</italic> detoxify and mobilize activated glucosinolate hydrolysis products”.</p><p>The reviewer is correct on the second point – 4MSOB-ITC is more abundant in the anal secretion than its detoxification product 4MSOB-NAC, suggesting that much of the ingested ITC is efficiently transported/excreted. While we do not know the metabolic cost of ITC transport, we have studied the costs of 4MSOB-ITC metabolism (in terms of growth) via the mercapturic acid pathway (Figure 5A) in generalist herbivores, and found that the loss of GSH/Cys contributes greatly to the growth decrease (Jeschkeet al., 2016). Although the doses of 4MSOB-ITC ingested by herbivores and by <italic>C. carnea</italic> feeding on <italic>gss</italic>-silenced <italic>P. xylostella</italic> are different, the fraction of ingested ITC metabolized by <italic>C. carnea</italic> is larger than by the herbivores. In our interpretation, we propose that this metabolic route is also a contributing factor to the reduction in predator growth, and have now briefly mentioned that transport costs might also play a role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Roughly speaking, what% of the effects (none/some/most) of feeding 4MSOB-ITC to larvae (Figure 4) could be due to lower feeding frequency/changes in feeding behavior e.g. due to the feed becoming distasteful? Any previous experiments or evidence from this paper to argue against it? If not, please note the possibility in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>While ITCs are attractive to ovipositing <italic>P. xylostella</italic> moths (Renwicket al., 2006), but lethal to larvae at higher concentrations (Liet al., 2000), to the best of our knowledge there are no reports directly examining ITC effects on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larval feeding preference. Previous research on the roles of the glucosinolate-activating enzymes (myrosinases) on larval preference offers indirect but ambiguous evidence about the influence of ITCs. <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae fed equally well on wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and the <italic>tgg1/tgg2</italic> myrosinase knockout mutant (Badenes-Perezet al., 2013), suggesting that the naturally low amounts of glucosinolate activation and ITC formation do not play a role in preference. On the other hand, <italic>B. juncea</italic> lines with higher myrosinase activities supported lower insect feeding, but surprisingly had no effects on growth rates (Liet al., 2000).</p><p>In our studies, larvae appeared to feed continuously on leaves of all the treatments used throughout the experiment, but this was not measured. The decreases in growth of ITC-fed larvae relative to control-fed larvae were similar in magnitude to the decreases observed when feeding on wild-type versus <italic>myb28myb29 A. thaliana</italic>. Nevertheless, it’s indeed possible that some of the growth effects stem from lower preference/ingestion. We added a brief discussion of that point to the second paragraph of the subsection “Plant-mediated RNAi efficiently silences <italic>P. xylostella gss</italic> with severe physiological and fitness consequences” to reflect that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall the paper reads well, however some statistical analyses need clarification.

The <italic>P. xylostella</italic> egg hatching percentages (Figure 2E, F, Figure 4E, F, and Figure 2—figure supplement 2E-H) were now also analyzed by GLM with binomial distribution and logit link function.

We agree that the biomodality is balanced across the groups so not changing the mean relationships. However, nearly every reviewer and editor has been puzzled by this indicating that every reader will be equally puzzled. Any explicit thoughts that you can provide to explain this biomodality will go a long way to alleviating the reviewers puzzlement. Different mother ages? etc? Further, it would be advised to state that the residuals are normally distributed between the groups in these tests to alleviate statistical concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>As previously stated, unfortunately we cannot clearly explain these results based on our observations, in spite of this distribution being consistent among the different experiments where egg hatching was recorded. Both parents were always newly emerged, so there were no differences in moth ages. Our current hypothesis is that this was an effect from the ‘forced’ monogamy during pairings, which prevents mate choice by the females and can result in incompatible mating pairs and a larger proportion of unfertilized eggs. We have added a few sentences explaining this possibility into the Discussion (subsection “Plant-mediated RNAi efficiently silences <italic>P. xylostella gss</italic> with severe physiological and fitness consequences”, second paragraph).</p><p>We would also like to thank the suggestion to check the normality of the residuals in this experiment. As could perhaps be expected from the bimodal distributions, the residuals of several groups were not normally distributed. To correct this, we have changed the analyses of these data to non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Dunn’s post-hoc tests, instead of GLM. We also added this information in the “Statistical analyses” subsection of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I would like to thank the reviewers for shifting to two-way ANOVAs but it is not clear how these are being presented in the figures. A two-way ANOVA will provide a significance for the main effects and the interaction while in the figures it still appears to be pairwise t-test results that are being shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now changed the notation of statistical differences in these figures, and expanded the test results in the figure legend and source data files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am still concerned by the bimodality in the egg laying/hatching experiment and the correlation analysis further raises this as a concern. In the correlation analysis, it appears that there are really two correlations in the data with one being a low hatching. Is there variation in the age of the mothers such that some are either much younger or older than others that could be linked to this?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the response above, there was not a wide range of parental ages in these experiments, with moths being all newly emerged. While we unfortunately cannot explain this effect based on our results, we have added a short discussion of our current hypothesis for the bimodality of these data (subsection “Plant-mediated RNAi efficiently silences <italic>P. xylostella gss</italic> with severe physiological and fitness consequences”, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
