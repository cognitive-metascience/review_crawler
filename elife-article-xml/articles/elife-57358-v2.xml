encodes the Kv3.3 K<sup>+</sup> channel, cause spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13). SCA13 exists in distinct forms with onset in infancy or adulthood. Using zebrafish, we tested the hypothesis that infant- and adult-onset mutations differentially affect the excitability and viability of Purkinje cells in vivo during cerebellar development. An infant-onset mutation dramatically and transiently increased Purkinje cell excitability, stunted process extension, impaired dendritic branching and synaptogenesis, and caused rapid cell death during cerebellar development. Reducing excitability increased early Purkinje cell survival. In contrast, an adult-onset mutation did not significantly alter basal tonic firing in Purkinje cells, but reduced excitability during evoked high frequency spiking. Purkinje cells expressing the adult-onset mutation matured normally and did not degenerate during cerebellar development. Our results suggest that differential changes in the excitability of cerebellar neurons contribute to the distinct ages of onset and timing of cerebellar degeneration in infant- and adult-onset SCA13.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>spinocerebellar ataxia</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd><kwd>cerebellar development</kwd><kwd>degeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS058500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papazian</surname><given-names>Diane M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002243</institution-id><institution>National Ataxia Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Issa</surname><given-names>Fadi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCLA Stein Oppenheimer Seed Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papazian</surname><given-names>Diane M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCLA Jennifer Buchwald Graduate Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>Jui-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Ulrich</surname><given-names>Brittany N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological analysis and imaging in live zebrafish reveal that infant- and adult-onset SCA13 mutations have distinct effects on the electrical activity, development, and survival of cerebellar Purkinje cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of rare, autosomal dominant diseases characterized by locomotor deficits and cerebellar degeneration, typically with onset in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klockgether et al., 2019</xref>). Spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13) is caused by mutations in the <italic>KCNC3</italic> gene, which encodes the Kv3.3 voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Kaczmarek, 2016</xref>). Unlike most SCAs, SCA13 exists in two forms that differ in the age of onset and associated symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman-Bert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waters et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>). The early-onset form is evident in infancy with motor delay, persistent motor deficits, and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman-Bert et al., 2000</xref>). Severe cerebellar maldevelopment and atrophy have been observed by MR imaging by 10 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the adult-onset form typically emerges in the third or fourth decade of life with progressive ataxia accompanied by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subramony et al., 2013</xref>). The infant- and adult-onset forms of SCA13 are caused by distinct mutations in Kv3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>). The age of onset is strongly correlated with the same mutation in unrelated families, indicating that the two forms of SCA13 do not reflect differences in genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To understand disease mechanisms in SCA13, it is essential to determine how different mutations in the same gene give rise to distinct clinical phenotypes. We have shown that infant- and adult-onset mutations have differential effects on Kv3.3 function that may underlie the two forms of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). An adult-onset mutation, R420H, which changes the third arginine in the S4 transmembrane segment to histidine, does not generate functional channels when expressed alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). Upon co-assembly with wild-type subunits in the tetrameric channel, the mutant subunit suppresses Kv3.3 activity by a dominant negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). Under physiological conditions, the functional properties of the residual current do not differ significantly from wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, several infant-onset mutations, including R423H, which changes the fourth arginine in S4 to histidine, have dominant gain-of-function effects on channel gating, with or without an accompanying dominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>). This is significant because Kv3.3, like other Kv3 family members, has specialized gating properties that shape the functional repertoire of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). Kv3.3 activates in a depolarized voltage range normally attained only during action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). As a result, the channel does not contribute significantly to maintaining the resting potential or modulating excitability near threshold. During an action potential, Kv3.3 channels open with fast kinetics, leading to rapid repolarization, brief spikes, and efficient recovery of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels from inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). Upon repolarization, Kv3.3 channels close quickly, shortening the afterhyperpolarization and facilitating the next action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). These gating properties promote sustained, high frequency firing of action potentials in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Kv3.3 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it contributes to the mechanism of spontaneous pacemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>). Kv3.3 is co-expressed in Purkinje cells with the Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>). During an action potential, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 is subject to open channel block conferred by an auxiliary subunit thought to be Na<sub>v</sub>β4 or FGF14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White et al., 2019</xref>). Rapid repolarization mediated by Kv3.3 relieves open channel block of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, generating a resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> current in the interspike interval that triggers the next action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these channels regulate the spontaneous tonic firing that is characteristic of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The locomotor deficits in SCA13 are primarily cerebellar in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevanin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waters and Pulst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subramony et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klockgether et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore important to determine the effects of disease-causing mutations in cerebellar neurons in vivo. Given the role of Kv3.3 in controlling Purkinje cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McMahon et al., 2004</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that infant- and adult-onset mutations have differential effects on Purkinje cell excitability that are correlated with age-dependent changes in Purkinje cell viability. We focused on the R420H and R423H mutations—an intriguing pair for study because these arginine-to-histidine mutations are separated by only two amino acids in the S4 segment in the voltage sensor domain, but cause the distinct adult- and infant-onset forms of SCA13, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>). These mutations will be referred to as aR3H and iR4H because they change the third and fourth arginine residues in S4 to histidine; ‘a’ and ‘i’ denote their association with the adult- and infant-onset forms of the disease, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>iR4H expression dramatically and transiently increases Purkinje cell excitability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: cartoon of membrane topology of one Kv3.3 subunit shows transmembrane segments S1-S6, re-entrant P loop, and approximate locations of the adult-onset R3H and infant-onset R4H SCA13 mutations in S4. The plus signs in S4 represent the positively charged arginine residues that sense changes in voltage and initiate conformational changes that result in pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>).

In parallel, Purkinje cell maturation and survival were monitored by live confocal imaging during cerebellar development. We report that infant- and adult-onset SCA13 mutations have opposing effects on excitability. iR4H causes transient hyperexcitability. In contrast, aR3H does not affect spontaneous tonic firing under basal conditions, but reduces excitability during evoked, high-frequency firing. We further report that iR4H and aR3H have dramatically different effects on the morphological maturation and survival of Purkinje cells during cerebellar development. The infant-onset mutation stunts process extension, impairs synaptogenesis and dendritic branching, and results in rapid Purkinje cell death. Suppressing hyperexcitability promotes the early survival of iR4H-expressing neurons, suggesting that increased excitability contributes to Purkinje cell degeneration. In contrast, aR3H-expressing Purkinje cells mature normally and survive robustly through cerebellar development. The distinct effects of the iR4H and aR3H mutations on Purkinje cell maturation and survival during cerebellar development in vivo are reminiscent of the age-dependent cerebellar degeneration seen in infant- and adult-onset SCA13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman-Bert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waters and Pulst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subramony et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that the defective maturation and highly penetrant death of iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells in zebrafish during cerebellar development are mechanistically related to the cerebellar maldevelopment, atrophy, and degeneration that occurs during infancy in patients with early-onset SCA13. Our results suggest that hyperexcitability in Purkinje cells may contribute to maldevelopment and atrophy of the cerebellum in infant-onset SCA13.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Infant-onset iR4H mutation transiently increases Purkinje cell excitability during cerebellar development in vivo</title><p>We have previously shown that zebrafish Purkinje cells, which are born on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2009</xref>), become spontaneously active within hours, coinciding with the expression of Kv3.3 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, ion channels that regulate spontaneous pacemaking activity in mammalian Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>).

In parallel, iR4H dramatically reduced branching of the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Previous work in zebrafish indicates that the formation of stable branches in neuronal processes is mechanistically linked to synapse formation in both the pre- and postsynaptic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer and Smith, 2006</xref>).

If the synapse is maintained, the filopodium develops into a stable dendritic branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niell et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, presynaptic development and branching of the terminal axonal arbor are tightly correlated in retinal ganglion cells in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer and Smith, 2006</xref>).

In contrast, the number of synapses in CaP neurons expressing aR3H did not differ significantly from EGFP controls. Furthermore, the axons of iR4H-expressing motor neurons had significantly fewer distal branches than the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), reminiscent of reduced dendritic branching in iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells.

In contrast, the length of distal branches in aR3H-expressing neurons and EGFP controls did not differ significantly. The paucity of distal branches in iR4H-expressing CaP neurons was not due to a failure of axonal outgrowth because the length of the main axon shaft did not differ significantly in motor neurons expressing iR4H, aR3H, or EGFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Given the relationship between synaptogenesis and branching in zebrafish neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer and Smith, 2006</xref>), our results suggest that reductions in presynaptic specializations and distal branching in iR4H-expressing CaP neurons are not independent phenomena. Rather, both effects likely reflect significantly impaired synaptogenesis. Taken together, our results in Purkinje cells and CaP motor neurons indicate that the iR4H mutation disrupts both pre- and post-synaptic development, impairing the formation of stable branches in the axonal and dendritic arbors, respectively.</p><p>Proximal axonal branches, located at or dorsal to the midline, are present in some CaP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,G</xref>).

Interestingly, the effects of the iR4H mutation on proximal and distal branching in CaP axons were similar to those of another infant-onset mutation, F448L (iFL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issa et al., 2012</xref>). iFL-expressing CaP neurons also have fewer distal branches than control cells and extend long, aberrant proximal collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issa et al., 2012</xref>). The iFL mutation causes dominant changes in Kv3.3 gating similar to those of iR4H, but iFL does not have an accompanying dominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that altered gating and resulting changes in excitability underlie the similar effects of these two infant-onset mutations on CaP development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Infant-onset but not adult-onset mutation causes Purkinje cell loss during cerebellar development</title><p>We observed that iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells disappeared during cerebellar development in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Two cells persisted until 7 dpf, one of which was still visible at 8 dpf prior to disappearing. To verify that the loss of iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells corresponded to cell death, acridine orange was added to the aquarium. Acridine orange is a fluorescent molecule that is able to cross the plasma membranes of living and early apoptotic cells. It intercalates into DNA, staining the nucleus green.

Because Kv3.3 regulates spontaneous pacemaking and evoked high frequency firing in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that early- and late-onset SCA13 mutations alter Purkinje cell excitability in distinct ways. In parallel, we investigated whether the mutations differentially affect the maturation and viability of Purkinje cells during cerebellar development in vivo in zebrafish.</p><p>We found that the infant-onset iR4H mutation resulted in transient hyperexcitability that emerged soon after Purkinje cells became spontaneously active. Transient hyperexcitability was temporally correlated with maldevelopment, including stunted process extension, dramatically decreased complexity of the dendritic arbor, and impaired synaptogenesis, followed by highly penetrant, rapid cell death during cerebellar development. Developmental abnormalities and death occurred in well-isolated iR4H-expressing neurons, indicating that cell autonomous mechanisms were responsible. The effects of iR4H on Purkinje cells during development are reminiscent of the maldevelopment and atrophy of the cerebellum during infancy in early-onset SCA13, suggesting that pathogenesis in humans and zebrafish are mechanistically related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>By comparing the functional development of the cerebellum, the period of vulnerability of iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells in zebrafish can be specifically correlated with the early postnatal period in mammals, corresponding to the second and third postnatal weeks in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mariani and Changeux, 1981</xref>). In zebrafish, activity in the cerebellar circuit develops rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>). Spontaneous firing in Purkinje cells emerges at 3 to 4 dpf followed by an increase in firing frequency and regularity by 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>). By 4 dpf, Purkinje cells receive functional input from parallel fibers, and active climbing fiber input begins to be evident. By 5 dpf, climbing fiber innervation is at a maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>). Over the next ~48 hr, weak climbing fiber inputs are winnowed. In mice, the cerebellar circuit becomes functional between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P15. Spontaneous Purkinje cell firing begins to emerge at ~P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry, 2006</xref>). Spike frequency increases until ~P12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry, 2006</xref>). In rats, Purkinje cells are innervated by multiple climbing fibers between P4 and P6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mariani and Changeux, 1981</xref>). Climbing fibers are then winnowed to a single strong input by P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mariani and Changeux, 1981</xref>). Thus, iR4H affects the development and survival of zebrafish Purkinje cells during a time that is equivalent to the early postnatal period in mammals. In humans, cerebellar development continues through the first year of life. Our results are therefore consistent with the timing of cerebellar maldevelopment and atrophy during the first postnatal year in patients with infant-onset SCA13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, Purkinje cells expressing the adult-onset aR3H mutation matured normally and survived robustly during cerebellar development in vivo. These results are consistent with the clinical phenotype of late-onset SCA13, in which progressive locomotor deficits and progressive cerebellar degeneration are not evident until adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subramony et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waters et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with its relative benignity during cerebellar development, the adult-onset aR3H mutation did not alter the basal excitability of Purkinje cells. The effects of aR3H on firing became apparent only after an interval of evoked, high frequency spiking, when a latent reduction in excitability was revealed. A similar, frequency-dependent hypoexcitability has been reported in several types of neurons after pharmacological or genetic reduction of Kv3 channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Issa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erisir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lau et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macica et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Expression of exogenous wild-type Kv3.3 did not significantly alter Purkinje cell maturation, excitability, or viability, indicating that the SCA13 mutations are responsible for the phenotypes that we have observed.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that increasing or decreasing Kv3.3 activity by expressing exogenous wild type or dominant negative aR3H subunits, respectively, does not alter basal excitability in Purkinje cells. Mammalian Purkinje cells express Kv3.3 at high levels; only a fraction of the channels opens during an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martina et al., 2007</xref>). During basal tonic firing, a similar spare capacity in zebrafish Purkinje cells could suffice to buffer the spike frequency against the changes in Kv3 current amplitude that occur in our experiments. We did not determine whether action potential amplitude or duration were altered by the expression of SCA13 mutant subunits or exogenous wild type Kv3.3 because the loose patch recordings were not suitable for detailed analysis of spike waveform.</p><p>In contrast to our results, Namikawa et al. recently reported that Purkinje cells expressing the adult-onset aR3H mutation died starting between 4 and 6 dpf in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namikawa et al., 2019</xref>). Cell death during this early period of cerebellar development is incompatible with the delayed onset of SCA13 in human patients carrying the aR3H mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subramony et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waters et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>). One possibility is that the abnormally early death of aR3H-expressing cells in that study resulted from overexpression of the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namikawa et al., 2019</xref>). Expression was driven by multiple copies of a Purkinje cell-specific enhancer sequence. Strikingly, the onset of death in aR3H-expressing cells depended on expression level, as controlled by the number of copies of the enhancer element. Increasing expression of aR3H significantly accelerated the onset of Purkinje cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namikawa et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we used the native promoter of the <italic>aldoca</italic> gene, which is specifically expressed in zebrafish Purkinje cells starting early in cerebellar development. As discussed below, the differential effects of aR3H and iR4H on Purkinje cell excitability strongly suggest that significant overexpression was not a confounding factor in our experiments. This likely accounts for the differences between our results and those of Namikawa et al., although we cannot rule out other possibilities, such as expression in different subsets of Purkinje cells due to the use of different drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namikawa et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Changes in Purkinje cell excitability are consistent with effects of infant- and adult-onset mutations on Kv3.3 function</title><p>The aR3H and iR4H mutations are separated by just two amino acids in the S4 transmembrane segment in the Kv3.3 voltage sensor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both mutations replace an arginine residue with a histidine. Despite these similarities, aR3H and iR4H are associated with distinct SCA13 clinical phenotypes and have opposite effects on Purkinje cell excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The aR3H and iR4H subunits are non-functional when expressed alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). To alter Purkinje cell excitability, mutant subunits must assemble with endogenous wild-type subunits to form tetrameric channels. We have reported that one aR3H or one iR4H subunit can assemble with three wild-type subunits to form functional, cell surface channels, but additional subunits result in dominant negative suppression of channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). This suppression is likely mediated by intracellular retention of channel complexes that contain multiple mutant subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulteis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallego-Iradi et al., 2014</xref>). The crucial difference between the aR3H and iR4H mutations is evident when one mutant subunit assembles with three wild-type subunits. The aR3H mutation does not affect the steady state or kinetic properties of Kv3.3 channels when measured under physiologic ionic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, aR3H acts as a simple dominant negative subunit. Patients with this mutation are expected to have a reduced amplitude of Kv3 current with normal functional properties. In contrast, incorporation of an iR4H subunit results in dominant gain-of-function alterations in channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). The mutant subunit shifts the voltage dependence of channel opening modestly but significantly in the hyperpolarized direction. In addition, there are small changes in activation and deactivation kinetics when measured under physiologic ionic conditions. Incorporation of multiple iR4H subunits in the tetramer, however, results in dominant negative suppression of current amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). The ratio of iR4H to wild-type subunits in the tetramer therefore determines whether the mutation exerts dominant gain- or loss-of-function effects on Kv3.3. Patients with the iR4H mutation would be expected to have a reduced amplitude of Kv3 current but the gating properties of the residual current would be abnormal.</p><p>The opposite changes in excitability that result from expressing aR3H or iR4H in Purkinje cells are consistent with the distinct effects of these mutations on Kv3.3 function. Reducing Kv3.3 activity, whether by dominant negative suppression, channel blockade, or genetic deletion, results in frequency-dependent hypoexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Issa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erisir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lau et al., 2000</xref>). Although it may seem paradoxical that decreasing K<sup>+</sup> channel activity reduces excitability, this reflects the specialized gating properties of Kv3 channels. Kv3 channels activate in a depolarized voltage range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). They are not involved in maintaining the resting potential or suppressing excitability near threshold. Instead, Kv3 channels open with fast kinetics during action potentials. As a result, the membrane rapidly repolarizes, which effectively removes Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). Reducing Kv3 activity increases the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation during repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). Decreases in excitability are frequency dependent because Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation accumulates more rapidly at higher firing rates.</p><p>In contrast, iR4H increases Purkinje cell excitability. When present in active, cell surface channels, the iR4H subunit shifts the voltage dependence of activation in the hyperpolarized direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). Although again it may seem paradoxical that shifting the voltage dependence of opening in the negative direction increases excitability, it is important to emphasize the relatively small amplitude of the shift. Channels containing iR4H subunits still have a low open probability at the resting potential and at threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, action potential initiation in Purkinje cells would not be significantly impaired. Rather, due to the shift in gating, iR4H-containing channels would open earlier during an action potential leading to more rapid repolarization and briefer spikes. As a result, open channel block and inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels would be reduced, increasing Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter and Bean, 2009</xref>). Due to faster repolarization, open channel block of Na<sup>+</sup> channels would be relieved at an earlier time. The resulting resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> current and the greater availability of Na<sup>+</sup> channels would then trigger the next action potential sooner than normal, increasing the firing frequency. The lack of a complex dendritic arbor in iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells would decrease neuronal capacitance, which may exacerbate increases in excitability caused by altered Kv3.3 gating. Additionally, compensatory changes in the expression of other channels may modulate the firing properties that we have observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The observation that iR4H dramatically increases the excitability of Purkinje cells provides strong evidence that significant overexpression is not a confounding factor in our experiments. If iR4H subunits were present in large excess over endogenous wild-type subunits, most channel tetramers would contain multiple mutant subunits. At that stoichiometry, iR4H would cause dominant negative suppression of channel activity, which would result in frequency-dependent hypoexcitability. With overexpression, active tetramers containing only one mutant subunit would be extremely rare, dramatically reducing the number of cell surface channels with altered gating that mediate hyperexcitability.</p><p>Importantly, several other infant-onset mutations cause similar changes in Kv3.3 gating, shifting the voltage dependence of opening modestly in the hyperpolarized direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to iR4H, these mutant subunits form active channels in the absence of wild-type Kv3.3 and do not mediate dominant negative suppression of current amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minassian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duarri et al., 2015</xref>). These data suggest that altered gating is an essential aspect underlying infant-onset SCA13. This is consistent with the idea that abnormally increased excitability may be an important factor in the etiology of this form of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Different pathogenic mechanisms likely contribute to infant- and adult-onset SCA13</title><p>Our results suggest that different pathogenic mechanisms contribute to cerebellar degeneration in infant- and adult-onset SCA13. We propose that hyperexcitability contributes to maldevelopment and degeneration of the cerebellum in infant-onset SCA13. In our experiments, iR4H-expressing cells became hyperexcitable prior to cell death. Large increases in spike frequency by 4.25 dpf occurred concurrently with significant disruption of Purkinje cell development. Abnormal firing peaked during the 4<sup>th</sup> day post-fertilization, whereas neuronal loss occurred primarily at 5 to 6 dpf, suggesting that increased firing triggered the activation of cell death pathways. Before disappearing, Purkinje cells expressing the infant-onset iR4H mutation stopped firing, which might reflect metabolic failure, increased membrane permeability, and/or the onset of cell death. This late stage decline in excitability did not prevent Purkinje cell loss, suggesting that irreversible activation of cell death pathways had already occurred. Consistent with the proposal that hyperexcitability is mechanistically linked to Purkinje cell loss, suppressing firing with the SK channel activator NS13001 increased the early survival of iR4H-expressing neurons. In contrast, treatment with NS13001 did not restore normal morphological maturation, suggesting that different pathways contribute to aberrant development and cell death.</p><p>Because it regulates multiple signaling pathways, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a plausible intermediate between hyperexcitability and the maldevelopment and death of iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells. High frequency firing is expected to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, which may in turn induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated signaling pathways are essential for normal Purkinje cell development in the early postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruol et al., 2005</xref>). Altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling has been implicated in neuronal cell death in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glaser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernard-Marissal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patron et al., 2018</xref>). Excessive cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be transported into mitochondria, triggering irreversible opening of the mitochondrial transition pore and activating cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bano and Ankarcrona, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeti and Abramov, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Several caveats apply to the NS13001 experiments. It was not possible to determine how effectively external application of NS13001 suppressed hyperexcitability in the cerebellum in vivo, what drug concentration was achieved in the vicinity of Purkinje cells, or how long it took to reach a steady state drug concentration. As a result, the drug may not have been completely effective at decreasing excitability in our experiments. Using higher concentrations of NS13001 was not feasible due to its toxicity and because zebrafish had difficulty swimming and maintaining an upright posture during drug treatment. Our results leave open the possibility that hyperexcitability is not the only mechanism that contributes to the demise of iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells.</p><p>In contrast, frequency-dependent hypoexcitability caused by the aR3H mutation did not disrupt Purkinje cell maturation or survival during cerebellar development. Our results do not address how this mutation leads to cerebellar degeneration during adulthood in SCA13 patients. However, the available evidence indicates that frequency-dependent hypoexcitability may be insufficient to trigger late-onset degeneration of the cerebellum. In mice, combined homozygous knockout of <italic>Kcnc3</italic> and <italic>Kcnc1</italic>, the genes that encode Kv3.3 and Kv3.1, respectively, is functionally reminiscent of the aR3H dominant negative mutation, which suppresses the activity of wild-type Kv3.3 and any other co-expressed Kv3 subunits. Although the double knockout exhibits frequency-dependent hypoexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsukawa et al., 2003</xref>), cerebellar architecture is normal with no evidence of degeneration in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinosa et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In adult-onset SCA13, an alternative possibility is that slow, intracellular accumulation of the mutant aR3H protein eventually results in neuronal loss due to proteotoxicity, a common mechanism of neurodegeneration in late-onset diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurtishi et al., 2019</xref>). The aR3H protein is recognized as abnormal and retained intracellularly in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallego-Iradi et al., 2014</xref>); intracellular retention of co-assembled wild type subunits is a common mechanism for dominant negative suppression of K<sup>+</sup> channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulteis et al., 1998</xref>). A proteotoxic mechanism is consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namikawa et al., 2019</xref>. In their experiments, Purkinje cells overexpressing the adult-onset mutation died abnormally during cerebellar development. Increasing the level of expression of the mutant protein accelerated the onset of cell death, which is characteristic of proteotoxicity. Furthermore, Namikawa et al. observed that overexpression of the wild-type Kv3.3 protein, which is not recognized as abnormal and is therefore less likely to accumulate intracellularly, did not trigger Purkinje cell death during cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namikawa et al., 2019</xref>). In adult-onset SCA13, we suggest that the toxicity of the slowly-accumulated aR3H protein is likely to be more important in triggering cerebellar degeneration than frequency-dependent hypoexcitability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential roles of altered excitability versus the loss of cerebellar neurons in locomotor deficits in SCA13</title><p>Because Kv3.3 is a key regulator of Purkinje cell excitability, it is interesting to consider the relative roles of altered excitability versus loss of cerebellar neurons in the locomotor deficits and other symptoms associated with SCA13. In our experiments, expression of the infant-onset iR4H mutation dramatically altered excitability, which was rapidly followed by Purkinje cell loss. If applicable to human patients, our results would suggest that the early death of cerebellar neurons, potentially triggered by hyperexcitability, is primarily responsible for the motor delay and persistent motor deficits seen in patients with infant-onset SCA13. Expression of the adult-onset aR3H mutation resulted in latent hypoexcitability. A similar reduction in neuronal excitability would be expected in patients throughout life, before the emergence of locomotor symptoms in adulthood. Interestingly, it has been reported that individuals with the aR3H mutation have significant deficits in binaural processing and sound localization before the emergence of motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Middlebrooks et al., 2013</xref>). Kv3.3 is highly expressed in neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body located in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2001</xref>). Neuronal hypoexcitabity or subtle morphological changes associated with the adult-onset aR3H mutation may contribute to the auditory processing deficits seen in otherwise pre-symptomatic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Middlebrooks et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the emergence of progressive locomotor deficits is temporally correlated with progressive cerebellar degeneration, suggesting that in adult-onset SCA13, loss of cerebellar neurons underlies the major motor symptoms.</p><p>In summary, we have identified differential effects of infant- and adult-onset mutations on Purkinje cell excitability, development, and viability in vivo. Our results are consistent with the existence of two distinct forms of SCA13. The specific correlation of the infant-onset mutation with aberrant maturation and rapid death of Purkinje cells during cerebellar development in vivo indicate that zebrafish is an excellent system for investigating mechanisms that may underlie SCA13 in human patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Dario rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>kcnc3a</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>HQ118212.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Dario rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tüpfel long fin nacre</td><td>Herwig Baier laboratory hbaier@neuro.mpg.de</td><td/><td>Unpigmented wild type strain</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Dario rerio</italic>)</td><td>la118Tg:<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>aldoca:gap43-Venus</italic>)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td>Transgenic line</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBluescript Kv3.3a wild type (plasmid)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mock et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBluescript Kv3.3a aR3H (plasmid)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mock et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBluescript Kv3.3a iR4H <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a wild type-2A-mCherry (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials andmethods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a aR3H-2A-mCherry (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a iR4H-2A-mCherry (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-mbEGFP (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a wild type-2A-mbEGFP (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a aR3H-2A-mbEGFP (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a iR4H-2A-mbEGFP (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-aldoca-Kv3.3a iR4H-2A-mbtdTomato (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pTol2-<italic>gata2</italic> min-(<italic>Mnx1</italic> mne)<sub>3</sub>-EGFP (plasmid)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issa et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pTol2-<italic>gata2</italic> min-(<italic>Mnx1</italic> mne)<sub>3</sub>-Kv3.3a aR3H-EGFP fusion (plasmid)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issa et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pTol2-<italic>gata2</italic> min-(<italic>Mnx1</italic> mne)<sub>3</sub>-Kv3.3a iR4H-EGFP fusion (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pminiTol2-<italic>gata2</italic> min-(<italic>Mnx1</italic> mne)<sub>3</sub>-Synaptophysin-mCherry fusion (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, section 2</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>NS13001</td><td>ChemShuttle, <break/>Hayward CA</td><td>Cat. #: 104258</td><td>SK channel agonist</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tricaine-S</td><td>Syndel, Ferndale WT</td><td>MS-222</td><td>Pharmaceutical grade anesthetic</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>(+)-Tubocurarine hydrochloride pentahydrate</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>T2379</td><td>Paralytic drug</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were housed in the UCLA Zebrafish Core Facility at 28°C using a 14 hr/10 hr light/dark cycle.

Purkinje cells were visualized under an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope using a 40×/0.80 water-immersion lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Using a motorized micromanipulator, patch pipettes were advanced toward Purkinje cells from the rostral side at an angle of 30<sup>◦</sup> relative to the horizontal plane. Seal resistances ranged from 20 MΩ to 200 MΩ. Experiments were performed at room temperature with the ambient and microscope lights turned off.

Switching the LED on and off was time-locked with electrophysiological recordings. Purkinje cell activity was recorded for 10 s before and 40 s after the LED was turned off. To avoid over stimulating the visual system, recordings were limited to one or two Purkinje cells per animal. Each Purkinje cell was subjected to 1–4 trials, with an inter-trial interval of at least 2 min. Each 50 s trace was segmented into 500 bins of 100 ms each. The average frequency of firing in each bin was determined and normalized to the average firing frequency calculated over the entire 10 s period before the LED was turned off at time 0 s.

The Kv3.3 channel mutations are closely related, in that each is an R to H mutation in one of the positive charges of the voltage-sensing domain. Here the authors address this problem in zebrafish Purkinje cells, and find striking differences between the two mutants.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Julie A Kauer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, Kv3.3 channels expressing two closely spaced mutations that in humans lead to either infant onset or later adult onset spinocerebellar ataxia were introduced into Purkinje cells of larval zebrafish. The early-onset mutation generated dramatic increases in Purkinje cell firing, disruptions of morphological development, and cell death, consistent with the primarily gain-of-function biophysical phenotype that the authors previously found in vitro. Instead, the late-onset mutation led only to a moderate reduction in excitability, consistent with the loss-of-function in vitro phenotype. The work demonstrates that fairly modest changes in biophysical properties as assayed in vitro can balloon into major alterations of cellular activity, circuit function, and even viability, in a way that is relevant to basic biology as well as disease states. It also reveals that mutations even in well-studied domains of a channel cannot by judged simply as likely to increase or decrease excitability, or promote a specific circuit dysfunction.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic about the manuscript, but felt it would benefit from a more thorough discussion of limitations/likely interpretations. The authors were very frank about drawing our attention to the problematic parts, where everything isn't perfectly neat in design or outcomes (e.g., fish dying in the rescue drug). But they should go a step further and call out the limitations, as well as what we can learn despite the limitations, with justification. For example, in the rescue experiments, the authors should be explicit about what the discovery is here. It isn't that firing is slowed; it is that viability is increased, providing a possible mechanistic link between the elevated firing and cell death.

CaPs and Purkinje cells could use different mechanisms for presynaptic development.

Is this a summed number of spikes per 100 ms bin over many trials (how many?) converted to a rate? Is the plotted data in 3C the illustration for a single cell or is that an average?

Many studies have documented secondary changes (often but not always compensatory) when one channel is disrupted. Specifically in Purkinje cells, changes in sodium channel current led to changes in potassium currents (Khaliq, Gouwens, and Raman, 2003). This idea seems important to acknowledge, since not all the changes in excitability necessarily stem exclusively from the altered Kv3.3 properties, and certainly other molecular changes must take place to account for the morphological changes and cell death.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57358.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic about the manuscript, but felt it would benefit from a more thorough discussion of limitations/likely interpretations. The authors were very frank about drawing our attention to the problematic parts, where everything isn't perfectly neat in design or outcomes (e.g., fish dying in the rescue drug). But they should go a step further and call out the limitations, as well as what we can learn despite the limitations, with justification. For example, in the rescue experiments, the authors should be explicit about what the discovery is here. It isn't that firing is slowed; it is that viability is increased, providing a possible mechanistic link between the elevated firing and cell death. It also helps separate the pathways that leads to morphological changes (unaffected by the drug) from those that lead to death (affected by the drug). This needs to be spelled out clearly and logically, and what conclusions can reasonably be drawn in their opinions.</p></disp-quote><p>We made several revisions in the Discussion, under the heading “Different pathogenic mechanisms likely contribute to infant- and adult-onset SCA13”, to address this point.</p><p>1) In the first paragraph in this section, we added a sentence to more completely describe the timeline of events in our experiments: “Large increases in spike frequency by 4.25 dpf occurred concurrently with significant disruption of Purkinje cell development.”</p><p>2) Later in that same paragraph, we clarify what has been learned: “Consistent with the proposal that hyperexcitability is mechanistically linked to Purkinje cell loss, suppressing firing with the SK channel activator NS13001 increased the early survival of iR4H-expressing neurons. In contrast, treatment with NS13001 did not restore normal morphological maturation, suggesting that different pathways contribute to aberrant development and cell death.”</p><p>3) The second paragraph has been revised to clarify that changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling could activate different pathways that affect Purkinje cell development and viability: “Because it regulates multiple signaling pathways, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a plausible intermediate between hyperexcitability and the maldevelopment and death of iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells. High frequency firing is expected to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, which in turn may induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores...”</p><p>4) The third paragraph flags caveats that apply to the rescue experiments, starting: “Several caveats apply to the NS13001 experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Subsection “Infant-onset iR4H mutation transiently increases Purkinje cell excitability during cerebellar development in vivo”, second paragraph, last 2 sentences: Figure 1—figure supplement 1 presents data for the iR4H variant only.

[…] Accordingly, these mutant subunits would have to co-assemble with endogenous, wild-type Kv3 subunits to affect Purkinje cell excitability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this regard, the data of Figure 2—figure supplement 3 are of interest.

If the same is true in zebrafish Purkinje cells, it may provide a plausible explanation for our results. To address this point, we added a new paragraph to the Discussion under the heading “Infant- and adult-onset SCA13 mutations have opposite effects on excitability and differentially affect Purkinje cell maturation and survival during cerebellar development in vivo”: “Taken together, our results indicate that increasing or decreasing Kv3.3 activity by expressing exogenous wild type or dominant negative aR3H subunits, respectively, does not alter basal excitability in Purkinje cells. […] During basal tonic firing, a similar spare capacity in zebrafish Purkinje cells could suffice to buffer the spike frequency against the changes in Kv3 current amplitude that occur in our experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the control data of Figure 2—figure supplement 3 the same as the control 5.25 dpf data of Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is stated in the legend to part B of Figure 2—figure supplement 3: “Control data obtained at 5.25 dpf are the same as shown in Figure 1C and are repeated here for comparison to exoWT.” We added the following sentence to the legend for part C of Figure 2—figure supplement 3: “Control data obtained at 5.25 dpf are the same as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and are repeated here for comparison to exoWT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6: It is hard to know how relevant the effects of transgenic expression of kv3.3a mutants on presynaptic development of CaP neurons informs about potential effects on cerebellar Purkinje cells.

To address the reviewers’ concern, we have highlighted two results that likely contribute to the lack of complex spiking in iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells. First, (in response to a comment below), we included the fraction of control and iR4H-expressing cells that exhibit complex spiking at different times post-fertilization (subsection “Infant-onset iR4H mutation transiently increases Purkinje cell excitability during cerebellar development in vivo”). Most control cells do not show complex spiking until 5.25 dpf, by which time the vast majority of iR4H-expressing cells are electrically inexcitable, which likely precludes complex spiking. Under the heading “Infant-onset iR4H mutation transiently increases Purkinje cell excitability during cerebellar development in vivo”, we added the following sentence: “No complex spiking was observed at 5.25 dpf, in accord with the observation that most iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells were electrically silent by that time.” Second, under the heading “Infantonset iR4H mutation disrupts Purkinje cell development”, the lack of dendritic spines in iR4H-expressing cells is described. We added a new sentence indicating that the lack of postsynaptic development may disrupt complex spiking: “The relative lack of dendritic spines may contribute to impaired complex spiking in iR4H-expressing Purkinje cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3C, please explain how the firing frequency and fold-change were calculated.

[…] The fold-change in frequency from all trials was then averaged and plotted versus time.” In addition, the legend to Figure 3C has been revised to make it clearer that the data from all the cells in each group have been averaged. Gray shading has been included in the panel to illustrate the SEM, providing an indication of the spread of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) An apparently unconsidered point in the Discussion is whether all the changes in excitability and sequelae are directly due to the changes in potassium channel function.
