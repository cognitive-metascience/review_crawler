Recent evidence suggests that cocaine stimulates synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in midbrain, increasing dopamine neuron activity via disinhibition. Although a mechanism for cocaine-stimulated 2-AG synthesis is known, our understanding of 2-AG release is limited. In NG108 cells and mouse midbrain tissue, we find that 2-AG is localized in non-synaptic extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are secreted in the presence of cocaine via interaction with the chaperone protein sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R). The release of EVs occurs when cocaine causes dissociation of the Sig-1R from ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF6), a G-protein regulating EV trafficking, leading to activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Blockade of Sig-1R function, or inhibition of ARF6 or MLCK also prevented cocaine-induced EV release and cocaine-stimulated 2-AG-modulation of inhibitory synapses in DA neurons. Our results implicate the Sig-1R-ARF6 complex in control of EV release and demonstrate that cocaine-mediated 2-AG release can occur via EVs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47209.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cannabis plant contains hundreds of different chemicals, including more than sixty types of cannabinoids. By binding to specific sites on brain cells, cannabinoids change how cells communicate with one another. This in turn triggers widespread alterations in brain activity, which can affect mood, appetite, coordination and perception.</p><p>But not all cannabinoids come from plants. The brain also produces its own versions, known as endocannabinoids (or eCBs for short). These bind to the same sites on brain cells as the plant-derived chemicals. Changes in endocannabinoid activity have been implicated in various brain disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and stress disorders. They may also have a role in drug addiction. Exposing rats to cocaine causes endocannabinoid levels to increase in areas of the brain that process pleasurable sensations. This suggests that the release of endocannabinoids may contribute to cocaine addiction. But how cocaine triggers this release has been unclear.</p><p>By studying brain tissues and cells kept alive in petri dishes, Nakamura, Dryanovski et al. show that cocaine drives cells to release endocannabinoids via a process called extracellular vesicle release. In essence, cocaine causes cells to make endocannabinoids that are then enclosed inside membrane-bound packages. These packages – or extracellular vesicles – can then fuse with the cell’s outer membrane. Multiple proteins must interact with each other for cells to assemble and release extracellular vesicles. Nakamura, Dryanovski et al. show that disrupting these interactions prevents vesicles from forming, and also prevents cocaine from triggering endocannabinoid release. Blocking extracellular vesicle release prevents cocaine from altering communication between brain cells.</p><p>Cocaine thus drives endocannabinoid release in the brain’s pleasure centers via the assembly of extracellular vesicles. Using other drugs to manipulate the protein interactions that underlie vesicle assembly could provide a new way to counter cocaine addiction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ADP-ribosylation factor 6</kwd><kwd>cannabinoid</kwd><kwd>dopamine neuron</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>guanine nucleotide exchange factor</kwd><kwd>microvesicle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADA000487-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lupica</surname><given-names>Carl R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADA000206-33</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Tsung-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Yoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-synaptic extracellular vesicles may be involved in the release of endogenous cannabinoids in the central nervous system thereby representing a novel mechanism to mediate their effects on synaptic transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) is a small protein that resides at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrion interface (mitochondrion-associated ER membrane; MAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mori et al., 2013</xref>), where it constrains type-3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R3) to facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling from ER to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the Sig-1R binds a wide range of molecules, including psychotropic drugs and psychostimulants, such as cocaine and methamphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Largent et al., 1987</xref>), and can translocate to other cellular regions to associate with organelles, proteins, plasma membranes, and the nuclear envelope to control trafficking of other molecules, such as ion channels and receptors in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yasui and Su, 2016</xref>). These diverse signaling roles for the Sig-1R highlight a widespread influence on cellular function that is incompletely understood.</p><p>Substantial data suggest that the Sig-1R is also a target of the abused psychostimulant cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharkey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashi and Su, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kourrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). In the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), cocaine decreases the excitability of GABAergic medium spiny neurons by strengthening an association between the Sig-1R and Kv1.2 potassium channels, contributing to behavioral sensitization to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kourrich et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the Sig-1R is also involved in cocaine reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Romieu et al., 2002</xref>). Given the diverse demonstrated roles for the Sig-1R in cellular signaling, its regulation by cocaine has the potential to affect many unknown cellular properties.</p><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a diverse group of membranous entities of endosomal origin that are secreted from a broad range of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). The EV classification broadly includes exosomes and microvesicles that range in size from 30 to 150 nm, and 100–1000 nm, respectively. Exosomes are formed by invagination of the endosomal membrane to form multivesicular bodies that are released into the extracellular space via budding of the cellular membrane, whereas microvesicles are formed by budding of plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Radhakrishna et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang-Doran et al., 2017</xref>). It is increasingly apparent that EV formation occurs through highly regulated cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abels and Breakefield, 2016</xref>), that permit their participation in intercellular communication via delivery of cargos of RNAs, microRNAs, proteins, and bioactive lipids such as prostaglandins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang-Doran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">EL Andaloussi et al., 2013</xref>). This implicates EVs in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. EV motility can be controlled by signaling molecules such as the guanine-nucleotide binding protein, ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abels and Breakefield, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). As a small GTPase, ARF6 exists in GTP- or GDP-bound forms (ARF6-GTP or ARF6-GDP), and stimulation of ARF6 by neurotransmitters or growth factors recruits guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to convert ARF6-GDP to the active ARF6-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">EL Andaloussi et al., 2013</xref>). Although ARF6 itself has GTPase activity, ARF6-GTP requires GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to hydrolyze to its inactive ARF6-GDP form. ARF6-GTP influences a wide variety of cellular events including endocytosis, actin cytoskeleton reorganization and phosphoinositide metabolism in many types of cells. Importantly, ARF6-GTP is involved in EV release from plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Than et al., 2017</xref>), and exosome budding into multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghossoub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imjeti et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, GEFs and GAPs regulate ARF6 activity to then modulate EV secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). Also, since ARF6 is a GTPase, it is noteworthy that another GTPase, Rac-GTPase, forms a complex with the Sig-1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Natsvlishvili et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the possibility that the Sig-1R may interact with other molecules of this class. Collectively, these points of regulation position EVs and ARF6 as important participants in diverse physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Endocannabinoids (eCB) are lipid signaling molecules that activate CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Of these, CB1Rs are expressed at high levels on neuronal axon terminals where they inhibit fast neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Misner and Sullivan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffman and Lupica, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katona et al., 1999</xref>). The eCBs are typically synthesized in postsynaptic structures, such as dendrites, to then retrogradely activate CB1Rs on axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson and Nicoll, 2001</xref>). Moreover, eCBs are not released via canonical mechanisms of calcium-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis, but rather through poorly understood processes. Recent evidence gathered using cell cultures suggests that the eCB <italic>N</italic>-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA, anandamide) is found in EVs, suggesting a possible mechanism to release these messengers and permit retrograde eCB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabrielli et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabrielli et al., 2015b</xref>). Another eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is released from neurons in an activity-dependent fashion, or via neurotransmitter stimulation of phospholipase-regulating G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alger and Kim, 2011</xref>). Recent evidence shows that inhibition of catecholamine uptake by cocaine leads to activation of GPCRs that stimulate 2-AG synthesis in the rodent ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, as VTA GABAergic axons express CB1Rs, the cocaine-stimulated increase in 2-AG inhibits GABA release via these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Riegel and Lupica, 2004</xref>), and this can be used as a sensitive measure of eCB function. Although measurements like these are used to detect eCBs throughout the CNS, the mechanisms through which these lipids cross the extracellular space to bind to presynaptic CB1Rs remain poorly understood.</p><p>Given that cocaine stimulates 2-AG synthesis, can act as a Sig-1R agonist, and that the Sig-1R interacts with Rac-GTPase, we hypothesize that it may also control other GTPases such as ARF6, a known EV release modulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghossoub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Natsvlishvili et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>), and this might regulate 2-AG release. Through convergent experiments we demonstrate that Sig-1Rs can control EV release via interaction with ARF-6, and that cocaine stimulates this process. Moreover, the cocaine-evoked 2-AG release required intact Sig-1Rs, ARF-6, and cytoskeletal function, implicating EVs as a mechanism for 2-AG release in the VTA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cocaine activation of Sig-1Rs stimulates EV release from NG-108 cells</title><p>To investigate whether Sig-1Rs are involved in EV function, we first conducted studies in NG-108 cells to permit manipulation of signaling pathways. The integrin β1 (Iβ1; CD29) protein mediates transcellular interaction of EVs with target membranes, and is a useful marker of EVs isolated through differential sequential sucrose-gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">EL Andaloussi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imjeti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benmoussa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Momen-Heravi et al., 2013</xref>). We prepared membrane fractions enriched in EVs in effluent from NG-108 cells and measured Iβ1 using western blots. Cocaine (10 µM) caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the accumulation of Iβ1 in isolated fractions from these NG-108 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that cocaine increased EV release. Because our previous studies show that cocaine interacts with Sig-1Rs, we next investigated their involvement in cocaine-stimulated EV release. We found that the Sig-1R agonists PRE-084, or fluvoxamine, both increased the Iβ1-marker of EV release from NG-108 cells in the absence of cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and that pretreatment with either of the Sig-1R antagonists, BD1063 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or NE100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), prevented the effect of cocaine. We also found that the knock-down of Sig-1Rs with siRNA alone significantly increased Iβ1 and abolished the stimulatory effect of cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and that overexpression of Halo-tagged Sig-1Rs decreased EV release from NG-108 cells, but also blocked the effect of cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data support a mechanism in which Sig-1Rs tonically inhibit EV release, and this inhibition is relieved in the presence of cocaine. Having established that Sig-1Rs are involved in the stimulatory effect of cocaine on EV release in NG-108 cells, we next investigated the role of additional other signaling molecules known to also regulate EV secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imjeti et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47209.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cocaine stimulates EV release via Sig-1R and ARF6 signaling in NG108 Cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of cocaine (10 µM) on integrin β1 (Iβ1) concentration in EV-rich fractions of NG-108 cells at several time points.

We found that an injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the co-immunoprecipitation of ARF6 and Sig1R in the mouse midbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and this was prevented by a preceding subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of the Sig-1R antagonist, BD1063 (10 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests that the cocaine facilitates activation of the Sig-1R, and this triggers Sig-1R dissociation from ARF6. Next, we determined whether in vivo cocaine treatment altered the intracellular localization of ARF6, using the MAM fractionation assay. We found that, unlike that observed in the P3 fraction where ARF6 levels remained unchanged, 10 min after cocaine injection the level of MAM-associated ARF6 was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, Sig-1R levels were not significantly altered in either the P3 or the MAM fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

To determine whether 2-AG is found in EV fractions from mouse midbrain, we used Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS).

These G<sub>q11</sub>-coupled GPCRs activate phospholipase-Cβ (PLCβ) to form diacylglycerol (DAG) from membrane phospholipids. DAG is then converted to 2-AG via the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGLα) and then packaged into EVs. Cocaine also activates the Sig-1R, causing dissociation of a Sig-1R-ARF6-GDP complex at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mouse VTA DA neurons. This free ARF6 is activated by a SecinH3-sensitive GEF, and then translocated to the plasma membrane where it interacts with myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK then interacts with cytoskeletal elements to evoke fusion of the 2-AG containing-EVs with the plasma membrane and permit 2-AG release into extracellular space. This 2-AG then activates CB1Rs located on GABA axon terminals to inhibit GABA release onto postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors leading to 2-AG-mediated disinhibition of DA neurons.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47209-fig8-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Together these data demonstrate that EV release is controlled by the Sig-1R, ARF6, and MLCK, and that cocaine’s interaction with the Sig-1R can recruit this signaling cascade.

Additionally, cocaine’s actions at Sig1-Rs alters its ability to influence voltage-gated potassium channel function, and this can reduce its behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kourrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Romieu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lever et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritz et al., 2011</xref>). The present data demonstrate that the Sig-1R also regulates EV secretion in cultured cells and in the mouse midbrain, and that cocaine modulates this process through interaction with the Sig-1R. We also show that the interactions among Sig1-Rs, cocaine, and EVs can regulate synaptic transmission in the brain via the control of 2-AG release and its inhibition of GABAergic input to DA neurons in the mouse VTA. Therefore, our study identifies novel mechanisms for Sig-1R control of EV function and implicates EVs in eCB release in the CNS.</p><p>EVs are increasingly recognized as a highly regulated mechanism to permit exchange of signaling molecules, such as lipids, nucleic acids, organelles, and proteins, among cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). As such, regulatory control points for EV formation, budding, translocation, and cargo release have been delineated in many cell types during normal cellular function, and in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang-Doran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">EL Andaloussi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that cocaine treatment of NG108 cells, or of mouse midbrain after in vivo injection, stimulates EV release, and that this is mimicked by agonists of Sig-1Rs, and prevented by antagonists or genetic elimination of these receptors. Moreover, using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we provide evidence for an association between ARF6, an established regulator of EV secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>), and the Sig-1R in TH-positive VTA neurons, and find that blockade of ARF6 activation prevents cocaine-induced EV release in both NG-108 cells and midbrain. We also report that in vivo cocaine causes the ARF6/Sig1R complex to dissociate, and this is prevented by Sig-1R antagonism. These data suggest that Sig-1Rs bind ARF6 proteins to hold them in an inactive GDP-bound form, and that cocaine facilitates the dissociation of these proteins to permit conversion of ARF-GDP to the active ARF6-GTP. Our data also suggest that this interaction between ARF6 and Sig-1Rs occurs at the MAM, and that cocaine enables translocation of ARF6-GTP to the plasma membrane. This mechanism is notable because ARF6 is implicated in EV secretion via regulation of cytoskeletal actin function in a wide range of mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>), and this is supported by our observation that inhibition of MLCK also prevents the cocaine-induced increase in EV levels in mouse midbrain.</p><p>Previous work shows that anandamide is found in EV-containing membrane fractions of rodent microglia cultures, and that these fractions exhibit cannabinoid agonist properties when applied to hippocampal brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabrielli et al., 2015a</xref>). Here, we show using FTMS that 2-AG is found in acute mouse midbrain preparations that are enriched in tEVs, and that 2-AG levels are significantly increased in midbrain homogenates after in vivo exposure to cocaine. In contrast, although 2-AG could be measured in tEV fractions using FTMS in mouse midbrain, and tEV markers were significantly increased after in vivo cocaine treatment, the increase in 2-AG levels produced by cocaine in the tEV preparation did not reach statistical significance despite a clear trend. As these preparations are technically demanding and yield small amounts of material, it is possible that the between-groups ex vivo design and variability among samples in both saline control and cocaine injected mice contributed to this outcome. Alternatively, it is possible that cocaine causes an increase in 2-AG-containing EV release, but that the amount of 2-AG per vesicle does not change, and this increase in vesicle release could be sufficient to locally activate CB1Rs on GABAergic axon terminals.</p><p>The observation that cocaine increased midbrain levels of 2-AG provides biochemical support for our finding of cocaine-increased 2-AG function in mouse (this study) and rat VTA DA neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, we demonstrate that cocaine stimulates a 2-AG-dependent inhibition of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic responses that is absent in mice lacking the CB1R, or the 2-AG biosynthetic enzyme, DGLα, in DA neurons. Based upon present data and our published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), we propose that 2-AG synthesis is stimulated when cocaine blocks norepinephrine uptake in the VTA, resulting in activation of G-protein-α<sub>q</sub>-coupled α<sub>1</sub>Rs, which, together with G<sub>q</sub>-coupled mGluRIs stimulated by endogenous glutamate, activate phospholipases and liberate 2-AG from precursor membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alger and Kim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haj-Dahmane and Shen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mátyás et al., 2008</xref>). Although this model of 2-AG synthesis is supported by our studies, the mechanism of 2-AG is release is unknown. Here, using this 2-AG-sensitive synaptic response, we find that the same manipulations that blocked EV release in NG-108 cells and midbrain EV assays also reduced or eliminated cocaine-stimulated 2-AG effects on synaptic transmission in the mouse VTA. These manipulations include the disruption of Sig-1R signaling, the inhibition of ARF6 function, and the inhibition of MLCK. Moreover, we also found that the IPSC inhibition produced by a synthetic CB1R agonist was not altered by antagonism or genetic deletion of Sig-1Rs, suggesting that Sig-1Rs regulate 2-AG signaling but not CB1R function.</p><p>The involvement of Sig-1Rs in the GPCR-dependent 2-AG release was supported by experiments showing that co-activation of mGluRIs and α<sub>1</sub>Rs by DHPG+PE could increase the release of this eCB, and that this was significantly reduced in Sig-1R KO mice. Moreover, another form of tonic 2-AG release that occurs under basal conditions in the absence of GPCR stimulation was unaltered in Sig-1R KO mice. Therefore, the data suggest that Sig-1Rs and EVs mediate only GPCR-dependent 2-AG release, and not that generated by other cellular pathways.</p><p>Based on our biochemical and electrophysiological data, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which cocaine initiates 2-AG synthesis via inhibition of the NET, leading to activation of α<sub>1</sub>Rs coupled to G<sub>q</sub> proteins controlling phospholipases and the liberation of the 2-AG precursor DAG. DAG is then converted to 2-AG via DGLα and then packaged in EVs through an unknown process. 2-AG release from EVs is triggered when cocaine binds to Sig-1Rs to liberate ARF6-GDP and permit its conversion to the active ARF6-GTP, which can then act at MLCK to initiate EV fusion with the cellular membrane and release of 2-AG. Although these mechanisms are supported by the present data, our finding that the inhibition of IPSCs by 2-AG release by DHPG+PE is absent cells from Sig-1R KO mice suggests that cocaine binding to the Sig-1R is not necessary to initiate EV release. However, fundamental differences in the characteristics of the inhibition produced by these methods were noted. Thus, the kinetics of the 2-AG-mediated inhibition of GABA release caused by cocaine differ from DHPG+PE in that the effect onset and the peak response to cocaine occurred more rapidly than that seen with DHPG+PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, the cocaine effect reached a maximum within approximately the first 5 min after application, and this early phase was completely blocked when Sig-1R, ARF6 or MLCK function was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), whereas the smaller late phase of inhibition was resistant to these manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite this, data showing that both the early and late phases of cocaine inhibition are prevented by AM251 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and absent in mice lacking the CB1R or DGLα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>), indicate that both inhibitory phases depend upon 2-AG and CB1Rs. In contrast to the effect of cocaine, DHPG+PE does not produce a robust early phase of IPSC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the delayed inhibition produced by the agonists is smaller, but not absent in Sig-1R KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These differences suggest that although cocaine and DHPG+PE initiate 2-AG-dependent inhibition of synaptic GABA release, they may involve distinct upstream mechanisms that converge on Sig-1Rs and their control of EV release. Thus, the faster time-course of the cocaine effect may result from its direct binding to Sig-1Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharkey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hiranita et al., 2011</xref>) to more rapidly stimulate EV release, resulting in their depletion during the late phase. In contrast, the slower and more sustained effect of DHPG+PE on 2-AG release may reflect coupling of EV release to a signaling pathway that relies upon intracellular release of an endogenous Sig-1R agonist. In support of this, several putative endogenous Sig-1R agonists have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monnet and Maurice, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramachandran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontanilla et al., 2009</xref>), and a more recent study shows that agonists of G<sub>q</sub>-coupled receptors that stimulate phospholipases can increase intracellular levels of choline, which then acts as an agonist at Sig-1Rs to enhance their calcium signaling properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brailoiu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the distinct phases of 2-AG-dependent inhibition are related the ability of the cocaine to act as a direct agonist at Sig-1Rs, compared to potential indirect effects of DHPG+PE that may be mediated by an intracellular signaling molecule having agonist properties at sig-1Rs. Future experiments will test this hypothesis.</p><p>Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) can bind and transport lipid molecules within and between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaczocha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ertunc et al., 2015</xref>). One of these, adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein 4 (aP2), is secreted from adipocytes via EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ertunc et al., 2015</xref>), and several FABPs are found in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Owada et al., 1996</xref>). Recent studies show that one of these proteins, FABP5, has high affinity for 2-AG, and its inhibition or genetic deletion impairs 2-AG-mediated signaling and plasticity at glutamate synapses in the dorsal raphe nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haj-Dahmane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Owada et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaczocha et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these results, and our present observation that FABP5 is co-localized with the EV markers Iβ1 and flotillin-1 in EV fractions from the mouse midbrain, it is possible that 2-AG release may occur via binding to FABPs that are transported to the extracellular space via EVs, and therefore subject to mechanisms regulating EV secretion, such as Sig-1Rs, ARF6, and MLCK. Future studies will more closely examine this possibility to more completely understand the mechanisms of EV-dependent eCB release in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent <break/>type</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Mouse: <italic>M. musculus</italic> (C57BL/6J)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J; wildtype, WT</td><td valign="top">Charles River Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Strain Code: 027</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mouse: <italic>M. musculus</italic> (C57BL/6J)</td><td valign="top"><italic>sigma1r</italic>; Sigma1 receptor: Sig-1R; Sig-1R KO, knockout</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518894112">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518894112</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mouse: <italic>M. musculus</italic> (C57BL/6J)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Dagla fl/fl x Slc6a3-Cre +/-;</italic> floxed DGL-α x DATCre heterozygote; DGL-α x DATCre; DGL-α KO, knockout</td><td valign="top"><italic>Dagla fl/fl</italic>, a gift from Sachin Patel; <italic>Dagla fl/fl x Slc6a3-Cre + /</italic>- breeders a gift from Daniel P.

Briefly, following dissection, midbrain slices from two wildtype male C57BL/6J mice were chopped and then incubated in 1.5 ml of 0.125% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 37°C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for a graphic summary of Ev isolation procedures). To stop the digestion, 4.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added and the temperature maintained at 4°C throughout subsequent steps. The tissue was then gently disrupted by multiple passes through a 200 µL pipette tip, followed by a series of differential centrifugations at 300 x g for 10 min, 2000 x g for 10 min, and 7500 x g for 30 min. The pellets resulting from these spins, containing cells, membranes, and cellular debris, respectively, were then discarded. For EV purification, the 7500 x g supernatant was syringe filtered at 1.0 μm (Whatman Puradisc Syringe Filters, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Cat. #6780–2510) and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 70 min to obtain a pellet containing EVs. The 100,000 x g pellet was washed with PBS and spun again at 100,000 x g for 60 min to obtain a total EV (tEV) pellet. For EV purification, the tEV sample was resuspended in 0.5 mL of 0.95 M sucrose in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) before addition to a sucrose-step gradient column. The column consisted of 6 × 0.5 mL fraction running from the bottom 2.0 M, 1.65 M, 1.3 M, 0.95M, 0.6 M, to 0.25 M at the top. Similarly, sucrose step gradients were centrifuged for 16 hr at 200,000 x g, after which the six fractions were collected. EVs settled typically at 0.95 M sucrose. The original six 0.5 mL fractions were collected and resuspended in 6 mL of ice-cold PBS, followed by a 100,000 x g centrifugation for 70 min at 4°C. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in 30 μL of filtrated-PBS when EVs were used for cell assays or 15 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X and protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) when EVs were intended for western blots. For western blotting, EV lysates in lysis buffer were quantified for protein content with a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We also prepared brain lysate sample (BL) in lysate buffer using the midbrain tissues from the 300 x g pellets obtained in the courses of the EV isolations, which were used as positive controls for the western blots and to normalize tEVs sample amount between each treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Drug treatment regimen</title><p>Drugs were injected i.p. at a volume of 5 ml/kg.

When compared to several commercially available products, the affinity-purified antibody from this antiserum, is very specific for the sigma-1 receptor in the mouse dorsal root ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mavlyutov et al., 2016</xref>). We established the following procedures to allow for the best specific detection of the Sig-1R in mouse brain slices, using the antiserum from Dr. Ruoho. Deeply anesthetized animals were transcardially perfused with filtered 0.1 M Phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in 0.1 M PB. After perfusion, whole brains were isolated and post-fixed in the same fixatives overnight at 4°C with rotation. Subsequently, they were dehydrated with 20% sucrose in 0.1 M PB (w/v) and then 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB (w/v) at 4°C with rotation. The brain samples were then embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) on dry ice and stored in −80°C. Thirty-µm sections were cut on a cryostat and mounted on Tissue Path Superfrost Plus Gold Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientific, Hamilton, NH) dried overnight. Sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, w/v) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X100 (v/v) for 1 hr at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with the sigma-1 receptor anti-sera diluted at 1:1000 in the blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Following 10 min PBS washing for three times, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor (488 for green/568 or 594 or 546 for Red)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 5% BSA in PBS for 90 min at room temperature.

The extraction results in an upper aqueous phase and a lower organic phase (containing 2-AG and the internal standard, HEA 17:1 ethanolamide). The lower phase (organic phase) was evaporated to dryness using nitrogen, re-suspended in 500 µL of chloroform and fractionated. The procedure used for fractionation was similar to one developed previously for eCBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmid et al., 2000</xref>). The fractionation was performed with Discovery SPE-Si tubes 1 mL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The samples were loaded on the columns in 500 µL chloroform and then washed with 3 mL of chloroform. Next, the 2-AG was eluted with 3 mL of chloroform/methanol (98/2%). Finally, the elute was evaporated to dryness using nitrogen and re-suspended in 100 µL of acetonitrile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Samples were diluted 1:1 (v/v) in 400 µm silver acetate in acetonitrile prior to mass analysis. A previous study has demonstrated the advantages to adding silver cations into the sample mixture for detecting 2-AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kingsley and Marnett, 2003</xref>). Samples were analyzed on an Oribtrap Velos (Thermo Fisher) in positive ion mode with a static nanospray source with 4 µm spray tips and a capillary temperature of 200°C. The Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) mode with a mass resolution of 100K was employed for all samples. The mass error for 2-AG assignment was ±3 ppm and MS/MS analyses were also conducted to confirm the identification of 2-AG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>In vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Twelve-week-old WT C57BL6, <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup> (</italic>CB1R knockout), or <italic>Sigmar1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> Sig-1R KO mice were decapitated, and their brains rapidly removed and transferred to an oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ice-cold solution containing (in mM) 93 N-Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 25 Glucose, 3 Sodium pyruvate, 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 Ascorbic acid. Horizontal slices (220 µm) containing the VTA were sectioned using a Leica VT1200S vibratome (Leica Biosystems) and transferred to a holding chamber at room temperature (RT) filled with oxygenated solution containing (in mM) 109 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 35 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 11 Glucose, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 Ascorbic acid. After incubation for at least 1 hr in the holding chamber at RT, slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with oxygenated aCSF containing (in mM) 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 Glucose, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, maintained at 35–36°C using an inline solution heater (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Cells were visualized with an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI) equipped with infrared interference-contrast optics. Recorded neurons identified in the lateral VTA, medial to the terminal nucleus of the accessory optic track (MT) and anterior to the third cranial nerve. Dopamine neurons were identified in the lateral VTA using electrophysiological criteria in cell-attached mode. Only cell demonstrating regular pacemaker firing (&gt;3 Hz) and action potential widths &gt; 2.5 ms were chosen for further recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ungless and Grace, 2012</xref>). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from DA neurons were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Recording pipettes (3.5–5 MΩ) were pulled with a P-97 horizontal micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 140 K-gluconate, 2 NaCl, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 Tris-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 0.1 EGTA (pH 7.2, 290 mOSM). DNQX (20 µM), DL-AP5 (40 µM), picrotoxin (100 µM) and strychnine (1 µM) were present in the aCSF to block AMPA, NMDA, GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors, respectively. Electrophysiological identification of DA neurons was performed in cell-attached mode to select only cells exhibiting pacemaker firing and action potential widths &lt; GABA<sub>B</sub> IPSCs were evoked using electrical stimulation with bipolar tungsten stimulating electrodes with tip separation of 300–400 µm. A train of 6 stimuli of 100µs duration were delivered at 50 Hz every 30 s. Stimulation protocols were generated, and signals acquired using the electrophysiology software WinLTP. Control GABA<sub>B</sub> currents were recorded for 10 min before the appropriate drug was applied for an additional 30 min. Data was analyzed using WinWCP software (Courtesy of Dr. John Dempster, Strathclyde University, Glasgow, UK). Figures were generated, and statistics analyzed using GraphPad Prism6 (v6.07; LaJolla, CA). Data are presented as the change in percent from control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantification, statistical analysis and reporting</title><p>The experiments were designed using estimates of effect size and standard error derived from prior experience and pilot experiments. These values were then used in power analysis calculations using the program G-Power (version 3.1.9.4, University of Dusseldorf, Germany) to determine sample sizes. Means ± s.e.m. are used throughout to report measures of centricity and dispersion. A spreadsheet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) describing means, significance levels and 95% confidence intervals for each experiment is included with this report. Statistical tests were determined by the number of groups and treatments to be compared. An omnibus test was used when necessary statistical assumptions could be met. Thus, in experiments where repeated measures could be obtained from the same subjects, samples, or cells (e.g. time course data), a repeated-measures ANOVA was used. When repeated measures were not performed, and group size was &gt;2, a one-way ANOVA was used. Post-hoc analyses (Tukey’s, Dunnett’s, or Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests) were determined by the type of omnibus test, as well as the nature of the multiple comparisons (pairwise rows and columns, comparison to control columns, main effects versus interactions). When only two groups of data were compared, a Student’s t-test was used. In all cases, a two-tailed p value of 0.05 was considered the minimum for significance. Actual p values are reported for all omnibus tests, unless p&lt;0.0001, and the statistical information is reported in the figure captions. In immunoprecipitation experiments, co-localization was determined from observed association on Western blots, and therefore, statistical tests were not used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, and National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ken Mackie (Reviewer #1); Christopher Ford (Reviewer #2); Nephi Stella (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the hypothesis that cocaine stimulates 2-AG secretion through its interactions with the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) leading to release of EVs (enriched) in 2-AG, which then engage CB1 receptors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The revised version of this study must fully address the main concerns of reviewer #1. I want to emphasize that this is indispensable and understand that additional experiments may need to be carried on. Thus, experimental evidence showing that EVs are secreted by cocaine stimulated NG108-15 and that the cocaine stimulated 2-AG increase is specific for EVs and not general for all midbrain membranes must be provided (see verbatims of the reviewer's comments below). The editors and reviewers during their discussion were in full agreement on these essential revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this interesting and provocative study, Nakamura and colleagues examine the hypothesis that cocaine stimulates 2-AG secretion through its interactions with the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) leading to release of EVs (enriched) in 2-AG, which then engage CB1 receptors.</p><p>1) Central to their hypothesis is that cocaine causes release of EVs containing 2-AG. To demonstrate release, it is necessary to isolate them from the media of the NG108-15 cells (as was done in the Gabrielli study). From a careful reading of the Materials and methods, it does not seem that this was done. Rather, NG108-15 cells were washed, scraped, homogenized and membranes with EV markers enriched. Thus, what is established by the NG108-15 studies is that the various signature of EVs are enriched within NG108-15 cells by cocaine, but not that the EVs are secreted.</p><p>2) Indirect support for 2-AG being secreted by EVs is that 2-AG concentration, when normalized to membrane protein content, is increased in EVs compared to 2-AG present in total midbrain membranes. It is preferable to normalize lipids to total lipid content or mole% of lipids in the preparation to control for different protein content in EVs vs. total membrane. In support of the central hypothesis, it is important to demonstrate that the increase in 2-AG following cocaine is specific for EVs and not generally for all midbrain membranes.</p><p>3) Figure 5 (in combination from earlier work by this group) nicely shows that GABA IPSC inhibition likely results from 2-AG produced by DA neuronal DAGL-α. Is the rather large increase in midbrain 2-AG all due to increase in 2-AG from DA neurons? This should be evaluated by measuring 2-AG in midbrain in the DAGL-α conditional KOs after cocaine treatment.</p><p>4) That inhibition or genetic deletion of Sig-1R slows, but does not block cocaine inhibition of IPSCs is quite interesting. The authors establish that CB1 responses are not altered by Sig-1R manipulations, but do Sig-1R manipulations affect IPSC inhibition when 2-AG is synthesized by other routes? For example, will the combination of DHPG/phenylephrine still produce 2-AG to reduce IPSCs after inhibition of Sig-1Rs? Establishing whether Sig-1Rs are needed for all synaptic release of 2-AG would greatly increase the impact of the findings. Similarly, does this synapse show DSI? If so, will manipulations of Sig-1R prevent DSI? (The phenomenon shown here is reminiscent of inhibition of DSI, but not LTD.)</p><p>5) While the authors interpret the inhibition of the rapid, but not the delayed, phase of cocaine IPSC inhibition as potential support for a &quot;readily releasable pool&quot; of 2-AG, an alternative interpretation is that manipulating Sig-1R affects DAGL localization to the synapse. This should be examined in the Sig-1R KO.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript by Nakamura et al., the authors examine a novel pathway by which cocaine regulates the release of 2-AG. Over a series of experiments, the authors outline a pathway by which cocaine activates the Sig-1R, which releases a tonic inhibition on ARF6. This small G-protein when in the GTP bound state activates MLCK which in turn increases non-synaptic extracellular vesicle release. In the first part of the manuscript the authors utilize NG-108 cells as well as midbrain homogenates to elucidate this pathway. They find that cocaine can increase markers of EVs suggesting that cocaine increases EV release in a Sig-1R dependent manner. Utilizing Western blots, co-IPs and immunostaining they then go on to show that in the midbrain cocaine decreases the association of Sig1R and ARF6 and that the GEF inhibitor SH3 inhibits cocaine-induced EV release. Finally to examine the functional consequence of cocaine on EV release they utilize slice electrophysiology. The authors find that the mechanism by which cocaine leads to the increase in 2AG release (as measured by presynaptic inhibition of GABAB IPSCs) may partially involve this pathway as the effects were blocked by sigma-1 receptor antagonists as well as ARF6 and MLCK blockers.</p><p>The experiments are thorough, have been done well and interpreted appropriately. Furthermore, the combination of approaches come together nicely to clearly define this new mechanism by which cocaine may regulate endocannabinoid signaling. Based on volume of work presented I have no further suggestions for other experiments as the results and conclusions are clear. A potential caveat is that the ARF6 and MLCK blockers could have additional effects, not dependent on EV release, which could also be driving 2AG release. However further confirming this pathway and true EV release would likely involve a significant amount of further work, beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>A minor point, however is that in many of the figures, summary data are only presented for some experiments. It is unclear at least from the results and figure legends if the other experiments are an n = 1 or if they are only representative blots from experiments that have been replicated several times. A second point is that in Figure 4D, the authors show that cocaine increases GTP-bound ARF6 in the midbrain. Presumably this relies on a specific antibody that only recognizes GTP-ARF6 however it was not clear that this antibody can distinguish between GDP and GTP bound forms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study demonstrates the involvement of a novel cellular compartment (non-synaptic extracellular vesicle (EVs) and its intracellular machinery (Sig-1R &gt; ARF6) in 2-AG-mediated activation of CB1R.

The technical approaches are sound, the manuscript clearly written, and conclusions and interpretations based on convincing results. I believe that this study will have an important impact on the field of cannabinoid research and neuroscience in general, and provide an important foundation for future studies.</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there a few remaining issues that we would like addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: We expect to handle the revised manuscript at the editorial level.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were generally satisfied with the revisions of your manuscript and agreed that it provides a significant conceptual advance in understanding the mechanisms by which cocaine regulates 2AG release via the sigma-1 receptor. The authors clarified that EVs were purified from NG108-15 culture medium. They were also able to demonstrate the requirement of Sig-1R in phenylephrine/DHPG 2-AG-mediated IPSC inhibition, while there appears to be no role for Sig-1R in &quot;basal&quot; 2-AG-mediated CB1 activation. However the reviewers had a few additional comments that should be addressed in a final revision.</p><p>1) The authors were not able to demonstrate an increase in midbrain EV 2-AG levels following cocaine administration (possibly due to the sensitivity of their 2-AG measurement technique coupled with the small number of EVs that can be purified from midbrain), which undermines a major premise of the study-cocaine stimulates release of 2-AG enriched EVs to inhibit IPSCs. This limitation needs to be appropriately integrated into their Results and Discussion. Perhaps an alternative explanation that should be considered is that there is not more 2-AG per EV, but there are more EVs produced, following cocaine or phenylephrine/DHPG and this is sufficient to activate CB1 to inhibit GABA release.</p><p>2) Emphasis in the Discussion. a) There needs to be a significant shift in the emphasis of the paper's Discussion. Because Sig-1R is required for phenylephrine/DHPG 2-AG-mediated IPSC inhibition (Figure 7), the emphasis of cocaine binding to Sig-1R as a causal mechanism in mid-brain eCB IPSC inhibition appears misplaced. If anything, in the cocaine treated slices, Sig-1R is only necessary for the short term (&lt;20 minutes) cocaine/eCB-mediated depression of IPSCs (Figure 6D) as IPSC inhibition by cocaine seems similar in the wildtype and Sig-1R KOs by 30 minutes (Figure 6D). In contrast (Figure 7B), for phenylephrine/DHPG 2-AG-mediated IPSC inhibition, Sig-1R KO reduces IPSC inhibition over the entire 30 minutes of drug application. An alternative to the mechanism proposed in the Discussion (cocaine binds to the Sig-1R…, and Figure 8—figure supplement 1) is that cocaine increases NE, activating α<sub>1</sub>Rs, which then require Sig-1R, ARF6, etc., to release EVs (or stimulate DAGLA activity). The experimental data in midbrain slices that cocaine needs to bind to sig1-Rs for IPSC inhibition does not seem conclusive, only that Sig-1R and ARF6 are required at some point in the pathway.</p><p>b) Similarly, the difference in the role of Sig-1R, ARF6, MLCK between cocaine and phenylephrine/DHPG inhibition of IPSCs needs to be briefly discussed. As mentioned in the Discussion, these proteins seem to play a role in early IPSC inhibition by cocaine, but not late inhibition. On the other hand, at least Sig-1Rs are required for both early and late IPSC inhibition by phenylephrine/DHPG. Can the authors integrate these findings into their model?</p><p>3) Figure 5C: The WB results showing FLOT-1 in EV has a &quot;dark dot&quot; in its lane which limits the interpretation of the result. The authors should provide another representative result.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47209.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Central to their hypothesis is that cocaine causes release of EVs containing 2-AG.

We neglected to state in the original Materials and methods that we followed the protocol published in the Gabrielli et al. paper, with only a few modifications. Thus, we collected HBSS from the cultures after treatment with cocaine (and other manipulations) and then subjected this effluent to EV isolation procedures (sequential centrifugation and sucrose gradients to yield fr3). Therefore, the EV markers were isolated from fractions collected from the cells after stimulation, and not from homogenized cells. We now include a more complete description of these methods in the manuscript (subsection “Midbrain”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Indirect support for 2-AG being secreted by EVs is that 2-AG concentration, when normalized to membrane protein content, is increased in EVs compared to 2-AG present in total midbrain membranes. It is preferable to normalize lipids to total lipid content or mole% of lipids in the preparation to control for different protein content in EVs vs. total membrane. In support of the central hypothesis, it is important to demonstrate that the increase in 2-AG following cocaine is specific for EVs and not generally for all midbrain membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>Total lipids were not measured in the mass spectrometry assay as we only measured 2-AG and our internal standard. This is because it is not possible to measure total lipid content using MS. It is possible to record a larger m/z range which permits detection of a broader range of lipid species, but this would still only be a small fraction of the total lipid content. Also, it is worth noting here that the methods in the Gabrielli et al. paper indicate that anandamide levels were also normalized to total protein content.</p><p>We also agree that measuring cocaine-induced changes in 2-AG in EV fractions using FTMS would provide specific and direct evidence of our hypothesis. However, after conducting this experiment several times we have encountered several limitations. First and foremost, the amount of EV material obtained in fr3 from ventral midbrain and available for analysis using FTMS is extremely small, necessitating the pooling of fr3 samples from several mice. To achieve this, we must first kill the mice 15 min after injection of saline or cocaine (3 mice per sample), then rapidly dissect the ventral midbrain from each mouse and pool samples across mice to quickly perform centrifugation and sucrose gradient procedures. We have now performed these experiments on three separate occasions in three different cohorts of mice (n = 30 mice), and we observe a high degree of variability in both baseline levels of 2-AG using FTMS, and in the level of the cocaine-induced increase in 2-AG levels. In general, there is a trend toward increased 2-AG in fr3 in the cocaine-injected mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but this does not reach statistical significance because of the high degree of variability across cohorts. It is likely that some of this variability results from the difficulty of the dissection procedure (identifying and dissecting only ventral midbrain from a whole a mouse brain) and to other factors that we have not yet identified. Therefore, at present we are confident that we can identify 2-AG in the EV-containing fr3 from mouse midbrain, but we do not have the statistical power to demonstrate a significant increase in 2-AG content of these fractions after cocaine stimulation. We defer to the discretion of the reviewer and the editors as to whether these data should be included in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47209-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5 (in combination from earlier work by this group) nicely shows that GABA IPSC inhibition likely results from 2-AG produced by DA neuronal DAGL-α. Is the rather large increase in midbrain 2-AG all due to increase in 2-AG from DA neurons? This should be evaluated by measuring 2-AG in midbrain in the DAGL-α conditional KOs after cocaine treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>A previous study, that we now cite in the manuscript, used in-situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to localize DGLα in most neurons in the VTA, including DA and non-DA neurons (Mátyás et al., 2008, Identification of the sites of 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis and action imply retrograde endocannabinoid signaling at both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area. Neuropharmacology, 54:95-107). Therefore, it is likely that 2-AG is synthesized in several cell types in the VTA. However, we reason that because we measure the inhibition of IPSCs in only identified DA neurons, 2-AG release from these other sources may not be detected at synapses onto these cells because of the limited spatial range over which 2-AG can act before its uptake or metabolism occurs. Alternatively, it is possible that the non-DA neurons that express DGLα do not release 2-AG when exposed to cocaine because they lack α<sub>1</sub>-noradrenergic receptors, or some other necessary component.</p><p>Although these are undoubtedly interesting issues, the observation that the 2-AG effect on synaptic transmission is absent in the DGLα KOs, as well as in the brain slices treated with the DGLα inhibitor tetrahydrolipostatin (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), strongly suggest that the endocannabinoid involved in the inhibition is 2-AG. Since the identification of the endocannabinoid was the primary goal of these experiments, we feel that this has been achieved. Moreover, these transgenic mice are not yet freely available, and were included in this study under a material transfer agreement restricting their use to only DA neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) That inhibition or genetic deletion of Sig-1R slows, but does not block cocaine inhibition of IPSCs is quite interesting. The authors establish that CB1 responses are not altered by Sig-1R manipulations, but do Sig-1R manipulations affect IPSC inhibition when 2-AG is synthesized by other routes? For example, will the combination of DHPG/phenylephrine still produce 2-AG to reduce IPSCs after inhibition of Sig-1Rs? Establishing whether Sig-1Rs are needed for all synaptic release of 2-AG would greatly increase the impact of the findings. Similarly, does this synapse show DSI? If so, will manipulations of Sig-1R prevent DSI? (The phenomenon shown here is reminiscent of inhibition of DSI, but not LTD.)</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent suggestions, and we have conducted additional experiments to address some of these issues. First, as indicated by the reviewer, our prior work in rat VTA shows that the increase in 2-AG function produced by cocaine could be replicated by combined application of DHPG and phenylephrine (PE) to activate type-I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRI) and α<sub>1</sub>-noradrenergic receptors, respectively. Therefore, if this effect can be replicated in mice, we would predict that this effect of DHPG+PE should, like that of cocaine, be inhibited when Sig-1R function is impaired or absent, and this would provide a strong case that Sig-1Rs and the EV signaling cascade is important for GPCR-dependent 2-AG release in the VTA. In these new experiments we found that the inhibition of IPSCs produced by DHPG+PE was very similar to that produced by cocaine alone, and that the effect of DHPG+PE was significantly reduced in DA neurons from Sig-1R knockout mice. Moreover, the effects of DHPG+PE were blocked in mouse DA neurons, as reported in rats. Therefore, this supports the involvement of Sig-1Rs in GPCR-dependent 2-AG release. We have now included these data in a new figure (Figure 7A-C) and discuss them in the paper (subsection “Sig-1R antagonism prevents cocaine-stimulated 2-AG function in VTA DA neurons” and Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p>Regarding the second part of the reviewer’s question, we have only established that DSI occurs at GABA inputs to VTA DA neurons in THCre mutant rats, using cre-driven channel rhodopsin to initiate DSI in the DA neuron (see Wenzel et al., Curr Biol., 28:1392-1404, 2018). However, we have not performed these experiments in mice because of limitations in obtaining THCre mice. However, we have also reported that tonic inhibition of IPSCs by 2-AG is observed in both rat and muse DA neurons, and this is uncovered when CB1Rs are blocked by AM251, or when DGLα is blocked by THL (Riegel and Lupica, 2004; Wang et al., 2015). Although we have not verified that this source of 2-AG is 100% independent of GPCR stimulation, it is present under baseline conditions in the absence of cocaine, or other exogenously applied GPCR agonists. Therefore, in new experiments we measured this tonic 2-AG response in the mouse VTA and observed the expected robust increase in IPSCs during AM251 application. Importantly, this level of tonic 2-AG inhibition did not differ between wildtype and Sig-1R knockout mice. This, together with the DHPG+PE data, suggests that Sig-1Rs and EVs are primarily involved in promoting 2-AG release derived from GPCR stimulation-dependent synthesis. We have compiled these data obtained with the Sig-1R KO and WT mice and have added them to a new Figure 7D-E, describe them the Results section, and expanded the Discussion a bit to deal with the distinction in Sig-1R modulation of GPCR-dependent 2-AG function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While the authors interpret the inhibition of the rapid, but not the delayed, phase of cocaine IPSC inhibition as potential support for a &quot;readily releasable pool&quot; of 2-AG, an alternative interpretation is that manipulating Sig-1R affects DAGL localization to the synapse. This should be examined in the Sig-1R KO.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this is an interesting possibility, it would probably best be addressed using electron microscopy to examine the localization of DGLα in the VTA of Sig-1R KO mice. Alternatively, evidence that DGLα function is intact in the Sig-1R KOs would suggest that the enzyme is not altered in these mutant mice. Prior work from our lab shows that 2-AG is tonically present at GABAergic synapses on DA neurons in the rat VTA, and its influence on IPSCS can be observed when CB1Rs are antagonized by AM215, resulting in an increase in the IPSC response (Riegel and Lupica, 2004; Wang et al., 2015, cited in the manuscript). If this tonic 2-AG release was not altered in the Sig-1R KO mouse VTA, then this would provide support for intact DGLα function. Therefore, we have performed additional experiments comparing the effect of AM251 on IPSCs in wildtype and Sig-1R KO mouse VTA and find no difference. Therefore, it appears that functionally, with respect to tonic 2-AG, there is no change in DGLα function in the mutant mice. <italic>We have added an additional figure (Figure 7) to the manuscript showing the impaired DHPG+PE-induced 2-AG effect (comment #4), and intact tonic 2-AG function in the Sig-1R KO mice. We have also added this information to the Results and Discussion sections.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The experiments are thorough, have been done well and interpreted appropriately.

However further confirming this pathway and true EV release would likely involve a significant amount of further work, beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>A minor point, however is that in many of the figures, summary data are only presented for some experiments. It is unclear at least from the results and figure legends if the other experiments are an n = 1 or if they are only representative blots from experiments that have been replicated several times.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is included in the metadata file that has been revised to add newly-included experiments. We have also now added this information to the relevant figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second point is that in Figure 4D, the authors show that cocaine increases GTP-bound ARF6 in the midbrain. Presumably this relies on a specific antibody that only recognizes GTP-ARF6 however it was not clear that this antibody can distinguish between GDP and GTP bound forms.</p></disp-quote><p>The product description for the antibody (New East Biosciences, Malvern, PA, catalog number 26918) indicates that it can distinguish ARF6-GTP from ARF6-GDP. However, as we are unable to use this antibody for quantitative Western blot analyses of ARF6-GTP, and we have confirmed co-localization of ARF6 with TH and the Sig-1R in the mouse midbrain in Figure 3, we have elected to remove this image (Figure 4D) and descriptions of measurement of ARF6-GTP from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B. The authors should provide the fold change in expression of Sig-1R to help the reader better understand the impact of this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this information is important to include, and we have added it to the Figure 1—figure supplement 1A caption. The siRNA significantly reduced Sig-1R expression by approximately 50% (49 ± 12% of control, p &lt; 0.0001, unpaired t-test). However, a description of the overexpression of the Halo-tagged Sig-1R in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B is somewhat meaningless because this receptor is not natively expressed (see “Halo-”, 3rd row Western blot Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Therefore, the x-fold change will be deceptively high and is not reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2—figure supplement 1: Mention in the text the time between stimulation with cocaine and EV harvesting to help the reader understand this result.</p></disp-quote><p>These times vary according to the experiment and are always mentioned in the figure legends and text describing these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3A and 3C: the magnified images are not convincing and should be improved.

This limitation needs to be appropriately integrated into their Results and Discussion. Perhaps an alternative explanation that should be considered is that there is not more 2-AG per EV, but there are more EVs produced, following cocaine or phenylephrine/DHPG and this is sufficient to activate CB1 to inhibit GABA release.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Results section to include these data and have added them to a revised Figure 5 (Figure 5C). In addition, we now consider this information in the Discussion and have added the alternative explanation provided by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Emphasis in the Discussion. a) There needs to be a significant shift in the emphasis of the paper's Discussion. Because Sig-1R is required for phenylephrine/DHPG 2-AG-mediated IPSC inhibition (Figure 7), the emphasis of cocaine binding to Sig-1R as a causal mechanism in mid-brain eCB IPSC inhibition appears misplaced. If anything, in the cocaine treated slices, Sig-1R is only necessary for the short term (&lt;20 minutes) cocaine/eCB-mediated depression of IPSCs (Figure 6D) as IPSC inhibition by cocaine seems similar in the wildtype and Sig-1R KOs by 30 minutes (Figure 6D). In contrast (Figure 7B), for phenylephrine/DHPG 2-AG-mediated IPSC inhibition, Sig-1R KO reduces IPSC inhibition over the entire 30 minutes of drug application. An alternative to the mechanism proposed in the Discussion (cocaine binds to the Sig-1R…, and Figure 8—figure supplement 1) is that cocaine increases NE, activating α<sub>1</sub>Rs, which then require Sig-1R, ARF6, etc., to release EVs (or stimulate DAGLA activity). The experimental data in midbrain slices that cocaine needs to bind to sig1-Rs for IPSC inhibition does not seem conclusive, only that Sig-1R and ARF6 are required at some point in the pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>In re-considering these data, we noted differences between the inhibition of IPSCs produced by DHPG+PE and cocaine that we feel might explain this and we have included this in the manuscript in the form of new information in the Results and Discussion, and a new Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Specifically, we noted that the kinetics of the response to DHPG+PE differed from that of cocaine, and we reason that the faster onset and offset of the cocaine effect could reflect direct activation of Sig-1Rs that initiates rapid EV release and depletions. On the other hand, we suggest that the slower kinetics of the DHPG+PE effect could reflect delayed recruitment of EVs by an intracellular messenger release by GPCR activation, and we cite a recent study showing that choline can act as a Sig-1R agonist to perhaps fulfill this role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Similarly, the difference in the role of Sig-1R, ARF6, MLCK between cocaine and phenylephrine/DHPG inhibition of IPSCs needs to be briefly discussed. As mentioned in the Discussion, these proteins seem to play a role in early IPSC inhibition by cocaine, but not late inhibition. On the other hand, at least Sig-1Rs are required for both early and late IPSC inhibition by phenylephrine/DHPG. Can the authors integrate these findings into their model?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to part “a” above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5C: The WB results showing FLOT-1 in EV has a &quot;dark dot&quot; in its lane which limits the interpretation of the result. The authors should provide another representative result.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been remedied by providing another WB from another similar experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
