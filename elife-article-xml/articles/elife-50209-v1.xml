cellular transformation, during which round spermatids elongate into chromatin-condensed spermatozoa. The signaling pathways that coordinate this process are not well understood, and we demonstrate here that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 4 (HIPK4) is essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility in mice. HIPK4 is predominantly expressed in round and early elongating spermatids, and <italic>Hipk4</italic> knockout males are sterile, exhibiting phenotypes consistent with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. <italic>Hipk4</italic> mutant sperm have reduced oocyte binding and are incompetent for in vitro fertilization, but they can still produce viable offspring via intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Optical and electron microscopy of HIPK4-null male germ cells reveals defects in the filamentous actin (F-actin)-scaffolded acroplaxome during spermatid elongation and abnormal head morphologies in mature spermatozoa. We further observe that HIPK4 overexpression induces branched F-actin structures in cultured fibroblasts and that HIPK4 deficiency alters the subcellular distribution of an F-actin capping protein in the testis, supporting a role for this kinase in cytoskeleton remodeling. Our findings establish HIPK4 as an essential regulator of sperm head shaping and potential target for male contraception.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spermiogenesis</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>HIPK4</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>125153-PF-13-377-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crapster</surname><given-names>J Aaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Male Contraception Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crapster</surname><given-names>J.

This dramatic morphological transformation is mediated by a series of cytological processes that are unique to the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kierszenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Donnell, 2014</xref>). In round spermatids, Golgi-derived vesicles give rise to the acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berruti and Paiardi, 2011</xref>), a cap-like structure that is anchored to the anterior nuclear membrane by a filamentous actin (F-actin)- and keratin 5-containing plate called the acroplaxome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kierszenbaum et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kierszenbaum et al., 2004</xref>). Neighboring Sertoli cells form an apical specialization that circumscribes each spermatid head, and F-actin hoops within these anchoring junctions apply external forces to the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex and underlying spermatid nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). The posterior nuclear pole in spermatids is simultaneously girdled by a transient microtubule- and F-actin-scaffolded structure called the manchette, which extends from the basal body of the developing flagellum and is separated from the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex by a narrow groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kierszenbaum and Tres, 2004</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehti and Sironen, 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Key steps of spermiogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of murine male germ cells transitioning from round spermatids to elongated spermatozoa.

The spermatid nucleus becomes highly compact as chromatin condenses into a quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rathke et al., 2014</xref>), and the germ cell expels its cytoplasmic contents through residual bodies and actin-scaffolded tubulobulbar complexes that contact neighboring Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sprando and Russell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Upadhyay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>). The acrosomeâacroplaxome complex and manchette concurrently mediate protein transport from the Golgi to the developing flagellum, delivering cargoes required for flagellum assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kierszenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kierszenbaum et al., 2004</xref>). In mature sperm, the acrosome then promotes sperm-egg fusion through the exocytotic release of digestive enzymes and the display of oocyte-binding receptors that are localized to the inner acrosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stival et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to these detailed cytological descriptions, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that coordinate spermiogenesis is still nascent. Initial insights into this process have been provided by mouse mutants with spermatogenic and male fertility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Boer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan, 2009</xref>). For example, pro-acrosomal vesicles fail to fuse in mice that lack the nucleoporin-like protein HRB/AGFG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang-Decker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kierszenbaum et al., 2004</xref>), nuclear membrane protein DPY19L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pierre et al., 2012</xref>), certain Golgi-associated proteins [GOPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yao et al., 2002</xref>), PICK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>), and GM130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2018</xref>), or acrosomal factors [SPACA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujihara et al., 2012</xref>) and SPATA16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujihara et al., 2017</xref>). These mutants consequently produce acrosome-less sperm with rounded headsâdefects that are characteristic of globozoospermia. Acrosome biogenesis also requires the matrix component ACRBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanemori et al., 2016</xref>) and the coiled coil protein CCDC62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pasek et al., 2016</xref>), and loss of either acrosomal protein can cause phenotypes resembling oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT), a fertility disorder characterized by low sperm concentrations and spermatozoa with abnormal shapes and reduced motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">TÃ¼ttelmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Murine models have similarly revealed proteins that are required for manchette and flagellum assembly, including the RIMBP3-HOOK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), LRGUK1-HOOK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), MEIG1-PACRG-SPAG16L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2015</xref>), and FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nozawa et al., 2014</xref>). Manchette shaping and degradation are also essential for sperm development, as demonstrated by the OAT-like phenotypes of mice expressing a loss-of-function variant of the microtubule-severing protein Katanin p80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Donnell et al., 2012</xref>). As spermiogenesis proceeds, membranous and cytoskeletal structures are dynamically coupled by distinct LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complexes. These include LINC components that reside in the outer acrosomal membrane (SUN1 and nesprin3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GÃ¶b et al., 2010</xref>) or posterior nuclear envelope (SUN3, SUN4, SUN5, and nesprin1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GÃ¶b et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pasch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, loss of SUN4 function in mice causes manchette disorganization, sperm head defects, and male sterility.</p><p>Factors that specifically contribute to acroplaxome function have been more difficult to identify and study. Actin-binding proteins such as myosins Va and VI, profilins III and IV, and cortactin localize to the acroplaxome and have been implicated in its regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behnen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kierszenbaum et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kierszenbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kierszenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zakrzewski et al., 2017</xref>); however, their wide-spread expression in somatic tissues has hindered functional studies. One notable exception is the actin-capping protein, CAPZA3, a spermatid-specific factor that associates with CAPZB3 and binds to the barbed ends of F-actin. <italic>Capza3</italic> mutant male mice are sterile and have OAT-like defects, indicating that F-actin dynamics within the acroplaxome play an important role in spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geyer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Upstream signaling proteins that control cytoskeletal dynamics are likely to be critical drivers of spermatid differentiation. For instance, PLCÎ³â1 phosphorylation is dysregulated in the germ cells of KIT<sup>D814Y</sup> mutant mice, leading to mislocalized manchettes and deformed spermatid heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schnabel et al., 2005</xref>). Phosphoproteomic analyses indicate that several kinase-dependent pathways are active throughout sperm development, but the roles of specific kinases in spermiogenesis are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castillo et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we describe an essential function for homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 4 (HIPK4) in murine spermiogenesis and fertility. This dual-specificity kinase is predominantly expressed in the testis, where it is restricted to round and early elongating spermatids. Male <italic>Hipk4</italic> knockout mice are sterile and exhibit spermatogenic defects characteristic of OAT. Sperm produced by these mutant mice are also incompetent for oocyte binding and in vitro fertilization, and they exhibit head defects associated with dysregulation of the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex. Consistent with these observations, HIPK4 overexpression in cultured somatic cells remodels the F-actin cytoskeleton and alters the phosphorylation state of multiple actin-interacting proteins. In the testis, HIPK4 co-fractionates with F-actin and HIPK4 deficiency alters cytoskeletal interactions with an F-actin capping protein. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that HIPK4 regulates the actin cytoskeleton, acrosomeâacroplaxome dynamics, spermatid head shaping, and ultimately, sperm function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIPK4 is expressed in differentiating spermatids</title><p>Gene expression data available through the Genotype Tissue Expression Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gtexportal.org">https://www.gtexportal.org</ext-link>) and the Mammalian Reproductive Genetics Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mrgd.org">http://mrgd.org</ext-link>) indicate that HIPK4 is largely expressed in the testis, with lower levels detected in the brain.

Changes in the glycoproteins, phospholipids, and cholesterol residing in the sperm plasma membrane, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and increases in intracellular pH correlate with the activation of soluble adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-haila and Tulsiani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin and Kan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Rand, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stival et al., 2016</xref>). Downstream protein tyrosine phosphorylation signaling events are initiated, and sperm switch from progressive motility to a âhyperactivatedâ swimming motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naz and Rajesh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sepideh et al., 2009</xref>). Capacitated sperm also become competent for the acrosome reaction, during which the outer acrosomal membrane fuses with the overlying plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirohashi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kierszenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stival et al., 2016</xref>). This process causes the release of digestive enzymes stored within the acrosome, and it exposes oocyte-binding receptors that are displayed on the inner acrosomal membrane, which spreads down over the equatorial region of the sperm head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sebkova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sosnik et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these steps ultimately promote sperm-oocyte engagement, fusion, and fertilization.</p><p>To determine whether HIPK4 is required for sperm capacitation, we isolated motile sperm from the caudal epididymides of wild-type, <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>+/â</sup>, and <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice and incubated them in capacitation medium containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>, bicarbonate, and bovine serum albumin.

Sperm were then fixed, quickly permeabilized, and labeled with fluorescein-conjugated peanut agglutinin (FITC-PNA), which binds to the outer acrosome membrane and is lost upon exocytosis. After 1.5 hr of capacitation, 86% of wild-type sperm retained fully intact acrosomes, whereas only 63% of mutant sperm had acrosomal FITC-PNA staining (due to either their severe head malformations or spontaneous acrosome exocytosis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). As expected, A23187 treatment decreased the percentage of FITC-PNA-positive cells in both wild-type and <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> samples, although mutant sperm responded less efficiently to this treatment (74% and 29% reductions in FITC-PNA-positive cells, respectively).</p><p>Finally, we examined specific acrosomal proteins during A23187-induced exocytosis: ZP3R, IZUMO1, and SPACA1. ZP3R (also known as sp56) is a zona pellucida-binding protein that appears on the sperm surface after capacitation, and it is released when the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). IZUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sebkova et al., 2014</xref>) and SPACA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujihara et al., 2012</xref>) are membrane proteins required for head shaping and oocyte fusion that localize to distinct acrosomal regions. IZUMO1 spreads from the anterior acrosomal cap to the equatorial segment during the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sebkova et al., 2014</xref>), and SPACA1 remains localized to the equatorial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujihara et al., 2012</xref>). As assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, all three acrosomal factors exhibited HIPK4-independent behaviors in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

It was previously reported that HIPK4 deficiency in mice can alter sperm morphology and number. Our studies reveal both the cell biological basis and the reproductive consequences of these spermatogenic phenotypes. Our findings establish HIPK4 as an important regulator of the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex during spermiogenesis. <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> spermatids form abnormal anterior head structures as their acrosomes become uncoupled from the underlying F-actin- and keratin 5-scaffolded acroplaxome. This is most evident by the grossly enlarged groove belt in elongating <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> spermatids (steps 9â12). The resulting spermatozoa have misshapen heads, and a large fraction exhibit slightly irregular tail morphologies. <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> males have lower concentrations of epididymal sperm, likely due to increased apoptosis after spermiation, and these cells have lower motility than their wild-type counterparts. Together, these spermatogenic defects closely mirror those observed in men with severe OAT syndrome, and similar to these clinical cases, HIPK4-deficient male mice are sterile.</p><p>We postulate that the abnormal head structures of HIPK4-deficient sperm are a primary cause of sterility. Sperm produced by heterozygous <italic>Hipk4</italic> mutant males have lower than normal epididymal concentrations of sperm and reduced total motility, but the fertility of these animals is comparable to that of wild-type mice. Only homozygous <italic>Hipk4</italic> mutant germ cells exhibit head defects that become increasingly overt during spermiogenesis. Consistent with diminished head functions, <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm are incompetent for IVF and have reduced binding and penetration of COCs. This diminished fertility could reflect structural defects that physically abrogate sperm-egg interactions and/or concomitant perturbations that disrupt molecular processes within the head. The hydrodynamically inefficient heads of <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm could account for their greater motility deficits, which would be expected to affect the fertility within the female reproductive tract. While it is possible that HIPK4 contributes to the formation or function of components required for normal tail motion, thus far, our studies have not revealed flagellar defects in mutant germ cells.</p><p>Our findings indicate that the head defects of <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm stem from an essential role for HIPK4 in acroplaxome function during spermatid differentiation. Both optical and electron microscopy reveal defects in this matrix upon HIPK4 loss. Although the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex appears to initially form correctly, expanding synchronously with the nuclear lamina during early steps of spermiogenesis (steps 4â7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>), by step 5, round spermatids isolated from <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> testes can display fragmented acrosomes that are not fully tethered to the acroplaxome. Analogous defects are evident in testis sections after spermatid elongation begins (step 8), during which Sertoli cells apply external forces to shape the spermatid head. At step 8 and beyond, the acroplaxome and nuclear lamina remain synchronous, and both structures are still juxtaposed with the perinuclear ring of the manchette. In contrast, the acrosome fails to expand posteriorly to a comparable extent at these later steps. We interpret these findings as evidence that nuclear lamina expansion proceeds normally in <italic>Hipk4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> spermatids, and uncoupling of acrosome and acroplaxome dynamics is the primary defect.</p><p>Our investigations also reveal potential mechanisms by which HIPK4 could regulate the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex. HIPK1-3 can directly phosphorylate homeodomain transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rinaldo et al., 2008</xref>), and the structurally related dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1a (DYRK1A) targets various transcriptional activators and repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiÂ Vona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Litovchick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woods et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). Although it has been reported that HIPK4 can phosphorylate p53 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2010</xref>), it is unlikely that HIPK4 acts primarily through transcriptional control. In contrast to other HIPK family members, HIPK4 lacks the homeobox-interacting domain and a nuclear localization sequence, and accordingly, it localizes to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van der Laden et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, our genome-wide microarray analyses reveal that loss of HIPK4 function does not lead to major transcriptional changes within the testis. These observations suggest that HIPK4 may regulate the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex through more direct biochemical mechanisms.</p><p>Our cell biological studies strongly implicate HIPK4 in F-actin remodeling. HIPK4 expression in cultured somatic cells promotes the formation of branched F-actin structures and alters the phosphorylation state of multiple actin-crosslinking proteins. HIPK4 could similarly modulate F-actin networks within the acroplaxome. Consistent with this model, HIPK4 deficiency disrupts the levels of F-actin and actin-capping proteins CAPZA3 and CAPZB3 localized to the acroplaxome marginal ring and perforatorium in elongating spermatids, likely due to cytoskeletal dysregulation at earlier steps. In addition, HIPK4 co-precipitates with F-actin in testis lysates, and loss of HIPK4 expression increases the association of F-actin with CAPZA2, but not CAPZA3 in these tissue isolates. Identifying HIPK4 substrates in round spermatids will be an important next step toward understanding how this kinase regulates actin dynamics in germ cells. We also note that transcripts encoding actin-related proteins are among the few genes that are expressed in a HIPK4-dependent manner within the testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). For example, cytoskeletal components <italic>Actr6</italic> and <italic>Capza2</italic> were downregulated in <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> testis tissues, and upregulated genes included actin-membrane crosslinkers (<italic>Tln2</italic>, <italic>Flnb</italic>, and <italic>Ank2</italic>), actin-based motors (<italic>Myo5b</italic> and <italic>Myo10</italic>), and components of the acrosome matrix (<italic>Zp3r</italic> and <italic>Zan</italic>). We speculate that these transcriptional changes reflect a cellular response to cytoskeletal defects caused by HIPK4 deficiency.</p><p>Based on these findings and our model of HIPK4 function, we hypothesize that that HIPK4 regulates acroplaxome stability and dynamics to ensure that this cytoskeletal plate can distribute external forces applied by Sertoli cells. Acroplaxome abnormalities in <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> germ cells likely emerge at the round spermatid stage and become manifest when mechanical forces are applied (e.g., Sertoli cell forces or testis dissociation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In particular, HIPK4 appears to promote adhesion between the acroplaxome and the overlying acrosome, as well as the formation of critical head structures such as the perforatorium and proacrosomal sheath. Loss of HIPK4 therefore leads to severe anterior malformations that preclude oocyte binding and fertilization. These head defects likely interfere with other aspects of sperm development and function, including the expulsion of excess cytoplasm, spermiation, acrosome exocytosis, and motility. In aggregate, these structural and functional deficits account for the complete sterility of HIPK4-deficient male mice. How HIPK4 regulates acrosomeâacroplaxome synchrony is yet to be determined. Loss of HIPK4 did not alter the localization of several known LINC components of the acrosome and nuclear lamina. However, we note the presence of electron dense regions within acroplaxome that appear to abut the acrosome and nuclear lamina in a HIPK4-dependent manner, raising the possibility that these structures help stabilize the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex.</p><p>HIPK4 joins the small list of protein kinases that are enriched or exclusively expressed in haploid male germ cells and required for spermatogenesis. For example, the kinases CSNK2A2, SSTK, and CAMKIV function in the spermatid nucleus and promote the histone-to-protamine transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escalier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spiridonov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). TSSK1 and 2 are testis-specific kinases that regulate the chromatoid body, centrioles, and the developing sperm flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kueng et al. (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), and TSSK4 and TSSK5 localize to the flagellum and enable sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Few kinases have been implicated in spermatid head shaping, and interestingly, several are truncated forms of tyrosine protein kinases. For example, TR-KIT, a splice variant of c-KIT is expressed during spermiogenesis and thought to phosphorylate PLCÎ³1. Ectopic expression of a constitutively active TR-KIT mutant causes manchette dysregulation. TR-KIT is also present in sperm, and serves to activate oocytes during fertilization by promoting the completion of meiosis II and formation of the pronucleus. A truncated, testis-specific version of FER, FERT, is localized to the acroplaxome and phosphorylates cortactin, regulating actin polymerization/degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keshet et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kierszenbaum et al., 2008</xref>). However, male mice lacking FERT are still fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craig et al., 2001</xref>), perhaps due to redundancy between kinase substrates. To the best of our knowledge, HIPK4 is the first kinase known to be essential for acrosomeâacroplaxome function and male fertility.</p><p>Given the druggable nature of kinases, HIPK4 is also a new potential target for male contraception. Small-molecule HIPK4-specific antagonists would be predicted to recapitulate the male sterility caused by disrupting the <italic>Hipk4</italic> gene in mice. Such treatments would reduce male fertility without interfering with the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, damaging somatic cells of the testis, or introducing genetic abnormalities to offspring if fertilization is achieved. Since HIPK4 expression is restricted to later steps of sperm development, HIPK4 inhibitors also would induce sterility more quickly than drugs that perturb earlier steps in spermatogenesis. Contraceptive reversibility would be equally rapid. Moreover, HIPK4 antagonists could have minimal non-reproductive effects, as <italic>Hipk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice appear to have otherwise normal physiology. Further investigations of HIPK4 therefore could not only elucidate the mechanisms that drive spermatid differentiation but also address a longstanding unmet need in reproductive medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key Resource Table (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> â Key Resources Table).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal studies were conducted in compliance with the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under Protocol 29999.

After three 10 min washes with PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/mL PVA at room temperature, the cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (1:400 dilution in blocking buffer) along with FITC-PNA (1:1,000), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phalloidin (1:400), and/or fluorescently labeled anti-EB3 (1:200) for colocalization) for 30â45 min, washed once, incubated with PBS/PVA buffer containing Hoechst 33342 dye for 10 min at room temperature, washed once more, and mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield Vibrance medium.</p><p>All fluorescence imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 700 or 800 confocal microscope equipped with a 63x oil-immersion objective. ImageJ software (NIH) was used to create maximum-intensity Z-stack projections, and Photoshop CS6 (Adobe) was used to crop images and adjust fluorescence intensity levels.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by R21 HD78385 (JKC), a Male Contraceptive Initiative Research Grant (JKC), and postdoctoral fellowships from the American Cancer Society (JAC) and the Male Contraceptive Initiative (JAC).

kinase HIPK4 in spermatogenesis, and by extension male fertility. HIPK4 is required for the function of the acroplaxome, a poorly understood structure that sits at the interface between the sperm nucleus and the acrosome. This role is almost certainly achieved through the phosphorylation of key target proteins and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HIPK4 is essential for murine spermiogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Moira K O'Bryan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Oko (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Within the publication the authors define homeodomain interacting protein kinase 4 (HIPK4) as a kinase with an essential role male fertility. <italic>Hipk4</italic> knockout males exhibit phenotypes consistent with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia in humans, and the sperm have reduced oocyte binding capacity in IVF, but produce viable offspring on ICSI. Based on ultrastructural and immunofluorescent analyses of spermiogenesis, showing drastic changes in head shape after step 8 in KO spermatids, combined with HIPK4 over-expression studies in cultured fibroblasts, where remodelling of the F-actin cytoskeleton occurs, the investigators conclude that the abnormal head shape phenotype was the likely cause of infertility, and that it was likely due to defects arising in the filamentous actin scaffolding in the acroplaxome during spermatid elongation. The paper is well written and the insights of value to the field. While extremely promising, the current data is not proof of the hypothesis that HIPK4 is a functionally relevant regulator of F-actin within the acroplaxome. Additional studies are required to achieve proof.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A detailed analysis of F-actin localization across the steps of spermiogenesis (both before and after step 8) is required. Notably, there is no direct proof of F-actin instability (or a phenotype) in the acroplaxome, or in the cytoplasm of spermatids, from steps 1 to 8, the time period corresponding to the expression of <italic>Hipk4</italic> mRNA. It was only after HIPK4 expression, during spermatid elongation and nuclear condensation that an overt phenotype became apparent. While it is possible the absence of phenotype is the result of a dependence on external (Sertoli) cell forces, no evidence, or discussion, is included in the manuscript. As such, we request a detailed analysis of F-actin across the relevant steps of spermiogenesis (ideally using both phalloidin and antibody methods). Localisation at an ultrastructural level would be best, however, we appreciate this is entirely dependent on the affinity of the antibody â please include a comment on this in the response to reviewers.</p><p>2) We also request an analysis/proof of the interaction between HIPK4 and actin within the acroplaxome. This could be achieved using a proximity ligation methods.

In addition to the fluorescently labeled phalloidin used for our previous studies, we have identified a commercially available anti-ÃÂ²-actin antibody that is an effective reagent for imaging the actin cytoskeleton in isolated spermatids. As suggested by the reviewers, we have employed these probes to analyze actin structures across the multiple steps of spermiogenesis, and our results are shown in Figure 7A (anti-ÃÂ²-actin antibody) and Figure 7Ã¢â¬âfigure supplement 1 (Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phalloidin). While phalloidin staining of isolated round spermatids was difficult to detect, possibly due to technical issues, we were able to achieve robust ÃÂ²-actin immunostaining at each step of spermatid differentiation. Using the anti-ÃÂ²-actin antibody, we can now observe actin defects in isolated <italic>Hipk4<sup>Ã¢â¬â/Ã¢â¬â</sup></italic> spermatids occur at steps when HIPK4 would normally be expressed. Beginning at steps 5/6, approximately half of the isolated mutant spermatids had fragmented acrosomes, which were frequently uncoupled from the actin cytoskeleton. In comparison, all isolated wild-type round spermatids had intact acrosomes that remained closely associated with the underlying actin-scaffolded acroplaxome. We note that these cytoskeletal phenotypes become manifest earlier than those observed by transmission electron microscopy of testis sections, and we interpret this difference as further evidence for their dependence on external forces. Such forces are normally exerted by Sertoli cells during spermatid elongation, and it is likely that the process used to isolate round spermatids from dissociated testes applies similar forces to the acrosomeâacroplaxome complex.</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for suggesting that we conduct ultrastructural studies of actin dynamics during spermiogenesis. While we have now found that confocal microscopy is sufficient to confirm HIPK4-dependent actin functions in found spermatids, we consulted with Prof. Pablo Visconti, who has recently used 3D-STORM to image F-actin in mature sperm (Gervasi, et al. J. Cell Sci. 2018, 131, jcs215897. doi:10.1242/jcs.215897). Dr. Visconti advised us against applying 3D-STORM to differentiating spermatids, as the experiments would be technically demanding and likely require several months to a year to complete. He instead suggested that we obtain super-resolution images of wild-type and <italic>Hipk4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> spermatids by structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Unfortunately, those studies did not yield additional insights into how HIPK4 regulates the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>., and we have not pursued them further.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Two-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (SIM) of wild-type and <italic>Hipk4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> spermatids.</title><p>Spermatids were isolated from the testes of wild-type and <italic>Hipk4<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mice, fixed, and then stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ÃÂ²-actin antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Acrosomal structures in the germ cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated peanut agglutinin (AF647-PNA).

We recommend using the knockout mouse as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate whether HIPK4 can interact with the actin cytoskeleton of spermatids, we isolated F-actin from whole testis lysates by ultracentrifugation. Strikingly, we observed that HIPK4 predominantly co-precipitates with the F-actin-containing pellet; only a small fraction of HIPK4 remains in the soluble fraction (which also contains G-actin). In addition, we found that loss of HIPK4 function specifically increases the amount of CAPZA2, an actin capping protein, that co-precipitates with F-actin. Together, these results suggest that HIPK4 exists primarily in complex with the actin cytoskeleton and/or actin-binding proteins. They also provide further evidence that HIPK4 regulates the actin cytoskeleton in spermatids.</p><p><bold>I</bold>t is important to note that our mechanistic hypothesis does not require direct interactions between HIPK4 and the actin cytoskeleton within the acroplaxome. Our immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HIPK4 protein is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of step 4-8 spermatids (the acrosomal staining in elongated spermatids is non-specific). We also determined that HIPK4 overexpression in NIH-3T3 cells alters the phosphorylation state of several proteins that can interact with the actin cytoskeleton but not that of actin subunits themselves. Based on these findings, we favor a model in which HIPK4 directly phosphorylates one or more regulatory proteins that control actin dynamics.</p><p>While we appreciate the reviewers' suggestion of proximity ligation assays, their propensity to yield false-positives is a complicating factor (bioRxiv 2018; doi: 10.1101/411355), especially since the direct substrate(s) of HIPK4 (and therefore appropriate specificity controls) remain unknown. We share the reviewers' interest in understanding how HIPK4 regulates actin within the acroplaxome, and this is the focus of our future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
