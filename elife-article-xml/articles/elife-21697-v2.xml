Conversely, deregulation of Dnmt3b is thought to generally promote tumorigenesis. However, the role of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in many types of cancer remains undefined. Here, we show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are dispensable for homeostasis of the murine epidermis. However, loss of Dnmt3a-but not Dnmt3b-increases the number of carcinogen-induced squamous tumors, without affecting tumor progression. Only upon combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, squamous carcinomas become more aggressive and metastatic. Mechanistically, Dnmt3a promotes the expression of epidermal differentiation genes by interacting with their enhancers and inhibits the expression of lipid metabolism genes, including PPAR-γ, by directly methylating their promoters. Importantly, inhibition of PPAR-γ partially prevents the increase in tumorigenesis upon deletion of Dnmt3a. Altogether, we demonstrate that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b protect the epidermis from tumorigenesis and that squamous carcinomas are sensitive to inhibition of PPAR-γ.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of the cells in our body contain the same DNA. However, our bodies are made of many different types of cell, such as nerve cells or skin cells, which perform very different jobs. In each cell type only certain sets of genes encoded by the DNA are active. Proteins known as epigenetic regulators are responsible for producing the different patterns of gene activity. If epigenetic regulators are switched on or off at the wrong time, they can contribute to ageing and diseases such as cancer.</p><p>Enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases are one group of epigenetic regulators. DNA methyltransferases control the activity of genes by adding small chemical groups known as methyl groups to the DNA. Two of these enzymes – known as Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b – are important during development to help cells mature and specialize into different types. Mice that lack both of these enzymes either die as embryos or just after birth. Furthermore, these enzymes are mutated or less active in some skin cancers and various other human cancers.</p><p>Here, Rinaldi et al. investigated the role these enzymes play in adult mice. The experiments show that under ordinary laboratory conditions, mutant mice that lacked Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were as healthy as normal mice. However, when the mice were exposed to chemicals that promote tumor growth, which mimics skin exposure to UV light, the mutant mice developed many more skin tumors than the normal mice. Furthermore, the tumors in the mutant mice were more likely to form secondary tumors in the lung. Rinaldi et al. found that Dnmt3a reduced the production of a protein called PPAR-γ, which helps to break down some types of fat molecules. Treating the mutant mice with a drug that inhibits PPAR-γ activity slowed the growth of the tumors.</p><p>Overall, these experiments show a new way in which DNA methyltransferases act in adult animals. Future research will investigate whether drugs that inhibit the breakdown of fats could help to treat cancers in which the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b proteins are mutated or less active.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>squamous cell carcinomas</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>promoters</kwd><kwd>PPARg</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Grant, BFU2013-47990-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name><name><surname>Avgustinova</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>Debayan</given-names></name><name><surname>Solanas</surname><given-names>Guiomar</given-names></name><name><surname>Benitah</surname><given-names>Salvador Aznar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STEMCLOCK (309502)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name><name><surname>Avgustinova</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Solanas</surname><given-names>Guiomar</given-names></name><name><surname>Benitah</surname><given-names>Salvador Aznar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006373</institution-id><institution>Fundación Botín</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name><name><surname>Avgustinova</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>Debayan</given-names></name><name><surname>Solanas</surname><given-names>Guiomar</given-names></name><name><surname>Benitah</surname><given-names>Salvador Aznar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are dispensable for epidermal homeostasis but act as potent tumor suppressors regarding skin squamous tumorigenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates several aspects of gene expression, such as long-term gene silencing, transcriptional elongation, and maintenance of genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avgustinova and Benitah, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rinaldi and Benitah, 2015</xref>). It is found throughout the vertebrate genome and is deposited by DNA methyltransferases on the fifth position of cytosine (5-mC), predominantly at CpG dinucleotides. The role of DNA methylation in establishing different cell fates during embryogenesis is fairly well understood. However, if and how DNA methylation is necessary to stably maintain the identity of adult stem cells, and how this process is disrupted during oncogenic transformation, is under intense investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen and Laird, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Three DNA methyltransferases are encoded in the vertebrate genome. Dnmt1 is predominantly associated with the maintenance of DNA methylation following cell division due to its high affinity for hemimethylated DNA. Consequently, depletion of Dnmt1 leads to a significant reduction of the global levels of 5-mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lei et al., 1996</xref>). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are de novo DNA methyltransferases that establish genome-wide DNA methylation during mammalian embryogenesis and adult stem cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). In mouse embryonic stem cells, the combined loss of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b leads to the progressive loss of DNA methylation, suggesting that these enzymes are additionally involved in maintaining 5-mC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Since Dnmt3a-null mice die perinatally, and ablation of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b results in embryonic lethality, conditional deletion mouse models have been necessary to study their functions in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking Dnmt3a cannot differentiate correctly upon serial transplantation, and end up developing a range of severe myeloid and lymphoid malignancies in aged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Challen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, HSCs-depleted of Dnmt3b show no phenotypical differences with respect to wild-type controls, whereas combined ablation of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in HSCs result in an enhanced block of hematopoietic differentiation as compared to Dnmt3a loss alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the observed phenotype seems specific to stem cells, as the fully differentiated cardiac myocytes carrying a combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are indistinguishable from wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nührenberg et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, to HSCs, purified murine neural stem cells (SCs) lacking Dnmt3a do not show problems with self-renewal but fail to differentiate properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, Dnmt3a acts as a potent tumor suppressor in lung tumorigenesis, to promote adenoma progression but not initiation, downstream of oncogenic K-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). This is in contrast with the pro-tumorigenic activity of Dnmt3b, which at least in the murine intestinal epithelium cooperates with the loss of APC to drive adenoma initiation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2006</xref>)</p><p>Recently, progress has been made in identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b by studying their genome-wide localization. For instance, Dnmt3b associates with and methylates the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes in murine embryonic SCs and human embryonic carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morselli et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, it has been proposed that gene body methylation is responsible of most of the transcriptional changes underlying the ability of Dnmt3a to promote neural SCs differentiation, and in protecting the lung epithelium from tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We have recently reported that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are required for the self-renewal of human keratinocyte progenitors, whereas Dnmt3a is also required for their proper differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>). Mechanistically, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b bind to and promote the activity of enhancers in both human epidermal progenitors and differentiated keratinocytes (although Dnmt3a having a stronger affinity for enhancers in differentiated keratinocytes). Interestingly, both proteins preferentially associate to super-enhancers rather than typical enhancers. Nonetheless, they differ in their mechanism of action, since Dnmt3a (together with Tet2) is essential to maintain high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) at the center of its target enhancers, while Dnmt3b promotes 5-mC along the body of the enhancer. These regulatory regions dictate the transcription of essential genes necessary for epidermal stem cell identity and maintenance, such as <italic>FOS, ITGA6, TP63,</italic> and <italic>KRT5</italic>. Similar to its role in mouse ES cells, Dnmt3b also binds to and methylates the gene bodies of these genes to reinforce their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>). Dnmt3a also associates to the enhancers regulating the expression of genes such as IVL, LOR, FLG2, and KRT1 which drive the differentiation of SCs into mature keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, DNA methylation at active enhancers has also been recently reported in normal and cancer-derived human colon, mammary and prostate epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlet et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, to date, no in vivo studies have investigated the roles of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in adult epidermal function and malignant transformation. Using mouse models carrying an epidermis-specific ablation of either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, or both, we demonstrate that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are dispensable for skin homeostasis. However, Dnmt3a has a critical role in suppressing carcinogen-induced squamous tumor initiation, but not progression, while both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b concertedly prevent tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epidermal deletion of Dnmt3a does not affect steady-state tissue homeostasis but significantly promotes carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis</title><p>We first studied the pattern of expression of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b during epidermal development, and in adulthood. At E14.5, Dnmt3a was expressed in the entire Keratin-14+ compartment comprising the basal layer of the embryonic epidermis and the hair placodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At P0, all Keratin-14+ basal cells were positive for Dnmt3a with the exception of the highly proliferative hair follicle bulb cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). By the time animals reached adulthood, Dnmt3a levels remained high in the hair follicle bulge where most hair follicle stem cells reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solanas and Benitah, 2013</xref>), and decreased in the interfollicular epidermis, although some basal IFE cells expressed high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). On the other hand, we were not capable of detecting Dnmt3b by immunofluorescence staining in sections of developing or adult mouse epidermis (not shown), suggesting that Dnmt3b is expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challen et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, RNA-seq data confirmed that Dnmt3a was enriched almost fivefold as compared to Dnmt3b in adult basal IFE keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, Dnmt1, the main DNA methyltransferase, was the most abundant DNA methyltransferase, both in interfollicular epidermis and in hair follicle bulge cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight to the roles of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in epidermal tissue function, we generated epidermis-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice by crossing animals containing the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> or <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> gene flanked by loxP sites with animals carrying the <italic>Keratin14-CRE-ROSA26</italic>-YFP-cassette (hereafter referred to as Dnmt3a/3b-cKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, neither Dnmt3a- nor Dnmt3b-cKO displayed noteworthy epidermal phenotypical differences as compared to their wild-type littermates at different postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Likewise, despite its strong expression in hair follicle stem cells, the loss of Dnmt3a did not result in evident changes in hair follicle cycling and pelage growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>Deregulation of DNA methylation can alter gene expression, leading to tumor suppressor silencing or oncogene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witte et al., 2014</xref>), and mutation/deregulation of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b has been observed in several tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leppert and Matarazzo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, Dnmt3a has attracted much attention, as it is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), especially in acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ley et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, a loss-of-function mutation of Dnmt3a is one of the earliest mutations that occurs in human acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shlush et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, these mutations are functional since knock-in mice that model it develop a range of severe myeloid and lymphoid malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Challen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, HSCs harboring inactivating mutations of Dnmt3a are clonally selected in ageing humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shlush et al., 2014</xref>). However, much less is known about how deregulation of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b affect tumorigenesis in epithelial tissues.</p><p>To elucidate the roles of Dnmt3a and Dnm3b in skin tumorigenesis, we first generated tumors from the epidermis using the chemically induced carcinogenesis protocol based on DMBA/TPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ewing et al., 1988</xref>). The first epidermal squamous malignancies appeared significantly sooner in Dnmt3a-cKO than in their wild-type littermates, after only 2 months from the first DMBA treatment, indicating that Dnmt3a acts as a barrier against tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Dnmt3a-cKO animals also showed a significant increase in tumor burden, with an average of 17 tumors per animal compared to three tumors per wild-type animal after 6 months of initiating the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dnmt3a loss shortens the onset of carcinogen-induced skin neoplasia, and increases tumor burden.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative pictures of wild-type and Dnmt3a-cKO animals after 5 months of treatment with DMBA/TPA.

Strikingly, although DcKO animals had a severe depletion of DNA methylation in their epidermises, they formed a morphologically normal skin with all its appendages and did not develop any epidermal abnormality even up to 70 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). This strongly suggests that de novo DNA methylation is dispensable for the long-term homeostasis of undamaged epidermis. However, when subjected to tumorigenesis, DcKO animals displayed a significantly shortened latency and significant higher tumor burden than wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–F</xref>). Although these differences were similar to the ones observed in single Dnmt3a-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>), DcKO mice formed aggressive squamous cell carcinomas at a higher frequency as compared to the single cKOs of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, metastatic nodules in the lungs were observed in 30% of DcKO animals, but in none of the wild-type, Dnmt3a-cKO, or Dnmt3b-cKO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Recent reports show that epidermal squamous cell carcinomas that harbor cells undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transitions are more metastatic than those that remain predominantly epithelial in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Latil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva-Diz et al. 2016</xref>). Interestingly, DcKO tumors contained large areas with spindle-shaped cells that expressed lower levels of the epithelial markers E-Cadherin and Keratin14, compared to the wild type and to Dnmt3a-cKO tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). These cells also expressed the mesenchymal marker Vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>). Importantly, these cells that had undergone a mesenchymal transition were still YFP+, thus deriving from the K14+ origin of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are dispensable for epidermal homeostasis, and that Dnmt3a, but not Dnmt3b, suppresses skin squamous tumor initiation. However, both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b repress the malignant transformation of epidermal cells into aggressive squamous cell carcinomas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Deletion of Dnmt3a results in increased tumor transcriptome heterogeneity and upregulation of genes related to lipid metabolism</title><p>We next wanted to characterize the molecular mechanisms that might underlie the tumor-suppressive function of Dnmt3a in the epidermis.

In contrast, the transcriptomes of Dnmt3a-cKO tumors were substantially more heterogeneous, suggesting that the loss of Dnmt3a could result in the deregulation of numerous different pathways in cancer cells, or that in the context of Dnmt3a loss, different cell of origins (i.e. basal IFE cells, hair follicle stem cells, or Lrig+ stem cells) might be more prone to generate more transcriptionally divergent tumors. Nevertheless, 391 genes were consistently differentially expressed between wild-type and Dnmt3a-cKO tumors, of which 114 were downregulated and 277 were upregulated in the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The downregulated genes were mainly associated with apoptosis, suggesting that loss of Dnmt3a promotes cell survival and protects against programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); consequently, TUNEL and active Caspase3 staining confirmed that Dnmt3a-cKO tumors had fewer apoptotic cells as compared to wild-type tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—figure supplement 2—Source data 1</xref>). Dnmt3a-cKO tumors also expressed higher levels of several genes involved in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, proliferation was only significantly increased in pre-cancerous DMBA/TPA-treated Dnmt3a-cKO epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>), while no differences in proliferation were evident between the homeostatic epidermis and tumors of wild-type and Dnmt3a-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that the loss of Dnmt3a endows pre-cancerous mutant basal cells with a survival and proliferative advantage, which could account for the increased number of tumors these mice develop. However, once tumors are formed, they progress with the same kinetics as wild-type tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—figure supplement 4—Source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 277 genes that were upregulated in Dnmt3a-cKO basal tumor cells highlighted two principal pathways that were over-represented in all eight Dnmt3a-cKO tumors: Wnt signaling (including ligands and receptors), and more predominantly, lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, recent reports have associated an increase in lipid metabolism with increased tumorigenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as colorectal, liver, oral, and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camarda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corbet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pascual et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo and Puigserver, 2016</xref>). A number of genes associated with fatty acid and lipid metabolism were upregulated in Dnmt3a-cKO tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among these, the most upregulated ones encoded the key pro-adipogenic transcription factors PPAR-α and PPAR-γ, which promote adipocyte differentiation and the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, and which are not expressed in homeostatic epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fajas et al., 2001</xref>). The role of these transcription factors in cancer is still poorly understood, although they tend to be upregulated in many types of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fajas et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, PPAR-γ was upregulated at the RNA and protein levels in all the Dnmt3a-cKO sequenced tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of PPAR-γ has been extensively reported to be under epigenetic control by repressive mechanisms such as H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To further dissect the early molecular changes that might result in the tumor-suppressing role of Dnmt3a in the epidermis, we did a short (6-week long) DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then FACS-isolated Itga6<sup>bright</sup>CD34<sup>neg</sup> cells, consisting mostly of epidermal basal cells (IFE), and hair follicle stem cells (Bulge; Itga6<sup>bright</sup>CD34<sup>pos</sup>) from pre-cancerous back skin of wild-type or Dnmt3a-cKO animals for RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Interestingly, we did not observe a diminished expression of genes regulating apoptosis, as we did in tumor cells. Hence, these results suggest that most of the transcriptome changes observed in tumors upon deletion of Dnmt3a occur early, and that the transition from the pre-cancerous epithelium to tumor growth occurs subsequently by bypassing apoptosis.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dnmt3a binds a subset of enhancers in tumor cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a short treatment of DMBA/TPA in wild-type and Dnmt3a-cKO animals.

To study which targets are regulated directly by Dnmt3a during transformation of murine epidermis, we performed ChIP-Seq for Dnmt3a in DMBA/TPA-treated pre-cancerous back skin epidermises from wild-type or Dnmt3a-cKO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also compared the ChIP-seq data obtained with MeDIP-seq and hMeDIP-seq performed on FACS-sorted tumor cells.

Of the bound regions in the wild-type epidermis, more than 20% corresponded to intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). ChIP-Seq for H3K27ac using the same samples allowed us to identify 3097 intergenic regions enriched for H3K27ac that corresponded to active enhancers, 10% of which were bound by Dnmt3a in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Importantly, loss of Dnmt3a significantly reduced their DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Intriguingly, a significant reduction in DNA methylation also occurred in enhancers not bound by Dnmt3a, albeit to a statistically significantly lesser extent than those directly targeted by Dnmt3a in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Upon deletion of Dnmt3a, DNA hydroxymethylation was also significantly reduced in its target enhancers, and to a lesser extent in non-Dnmt3a-bound enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, the ratio of 5-hmC levels at enhancers bound by Dnmt3a between wild-type and Dnmt3a-cKO epidermal cells is significantly higher as compared to the ratio of 5-hmC levels between the enhancers that are not normally bound by Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicates that the presence of Dnmt3a correlates with significantly higher 5-hmC levels, likely because Dnmt3a provides 5-mC as a substrate for generating 5-hmC, as we have previously shown in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Depletion of Dnmt3a leads to loss of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation around its target enhancers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative methylation score (CpG count) measured around 363 enhancers bound by Dnmt3a (–5 kb, +5 kb) from independent biological replicates of FACS sorted tumor cells from wild type (n = 2) and Dnmt3a-cKO (n = 2) (p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>).

Recent works have shown that the absence of Dnmt3a or Tet2 in hematopoietic stem cells predisposes to leukemia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>), but that restoring the expression of Dnmt3a after the leukemia had developed did not revert the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). That said, the role of Dnmt3a in tumorigenesis is tissue specific, since in the lung it does not affect tumor initiation but rather tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in the work of Gao et al., most of the changes in gene expression in Dnmt3a-depleted cells were attributed to alterations in gene body methylation, rather than at promoters. Conversely, in our model, we see significant changes at regulatory elements (i.e. promoters and enhancers) that lead to changes in gene expression in Dnmt3a-depleted epidermal tumors.</p><p>Our results, together with accumulating evidence from other groups, demonstrates a clear relationship between the levels of Dnmt3a–Tet–5-hmC and tumorigenesis: the inactivation of this axis in adult stem cells predisposes them to tumor initiation. Interestingly, a global reduction of 5-hmC is a hallmark of several cancer types, including squamous cell carcinoma, and is often correlated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ficz and Gribben, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that Dnmt3a drives the DNA-methylation, and subsequent hydroxymethylation, of a subset of enhancers that regulate the expression of genes involved differentiation. Conversely, Dnmt3a binds to, and DNA methylates, the promoters of cell proliferation and lipid metabolism genes to repress their expression. Interestingly, however, deletion of Dnmt3a does not result in changes in the specification of the different keratinocyte lineages in the skin (epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands), nor their homeostasis in adulthood. What is more, even the combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, albeit significantly reducing overall DNA methylation levels, did not result in any skin phenotype even in aged mice. On the other hand, we have recently shown that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are necessary for the self-renewal and differentiation of primary human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>). This apparent contradiction in the phenotypes observed might be due to the fact that our work with human keratinocytes relied on culturing the cells, which was recently shown in murine skin keratinocytes to induce a wound healing damaged-like reversible state that affects their epigenome and transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in vivo deletion of Dnmt3a might not be sufficient to alter the homeostasis of undamaged skin, but renders the epidermis more susceptible to situations of damage. Accordingly, the epidermis of Dnmt3a-cKO mice responded to the treatment of DMBA/TPA in a much more pronounced manner. This effect might not be specific to Dnmt3a. For instance, Dnmt1 is the DNA methyltransferase most highly expressed in epidermal cells and is responsible for about 70% of DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 1992</xref>). Its depletion causes a strong loss of self-renewal of primary human basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sen et al., 2010</xref>). However, its loss in murine epidermis leads to a mild increase in proliferation, and to a partial alopecia, only in very aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, these results also suggest that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b exert different functions in epidermal homeostasis, although future work will be required to study these putative differences in depth.</p><p>Notwithstanding the differences between in vivo and ex vivo studies, our results show that the genomic localization of Dnmt3a is very similar between intact murine keratinocytes and cultured human keratinocytes. Besides its localization at active enhancers of genes involved in epidermal differentiation, Dnmt3a also bound to, and methylated, promoters of genes that regulate cell proliferation and lipid metabolism to repress their expression. Among these genes, were the master regulators of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis PPAR-α and PPAR-γ. Interestingly, a number of recent studies have highlighted the importance of a persistent lipid metabolism in promoting tumor transformation, and tumor metastasis in colorectal, liver, breast and oral squamous carcinomas, as well as for enhancing chemoresistance of leukemia stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pascual et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). The upregulation of these transcription factors upon deregulation of Dnmt3a might predispose the epidermis to develop more tumors, suggesting that an intriguing mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and the epigenetic regulation of tissue homeostasis through DNA methylation, might exist. A recent large clinical association study has already pointed to this by establishing a correlation between the expression of obesity-related genes and changes in the content of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wahl et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, our results show that PPAR-γ is partially responsible for promoting tumorigenesis in Dnmt3a-deficient epidermis, which considering that human skin tumors express lower levels of Dnmt3a, might provide us with a new therapeutic antitumor avenue against squamous cell carcinomas.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical skin carcinogenesis</title><p>The work with mice was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation (CEEA) of the Scientific Park of Barcelona (PCB), and the Government of Catalunya.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dnmt3a associates with promoters and enhancers to protect epidermal stem cells from cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that understanding the role of Dnmt3a/b in skin carcinogenesis is an interesting and unresolved question. In particular, the authors convincingly and thoroughly show that loss of Dnmt3a in keratinocytes promotes increased tumorigenesis after DMBA treatment, which is intriguing. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq data reveal genes altered by Dnmt3a.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers all raised concerns regarding the functional link between Dnmt and gene regulation in tumorigenesis. While the authors link the function to the suppression of PPAR and a lipid-type program, there are no functional data in the manuscript in support of this claim and, as mentioned below, this might be linked to a sebaceous tumor phenotype. Functional analysis of Dnmt targets is needed to extend this manuscript to more fully understand how Dnmt impacts tumor progression.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, they authors show that hairs regrow faster after DMBA treatment in Dnmt3a cKO mice. The authors suggested that &quot;Dnmt3a might act as a break to maintain hair follicles in a dormant state&quot;. This potentially interesting phenotype has not been studied in detail and this information as it is might be a bit distracting.</p><p>3) It is clear that DNA methylation can affect non-transcriptional mechanisms such as genome stability and DNA repair mechanisms, and there are no studies presented to assess non-transcriptional effects of DNA methylation on tumorigenesis. Have the authors looked at mutation frequency and/or genomic stability in these tumors?</p><p>4) The authors argue that Dnmt3a selectively affects tumor initiation rather than tumor progression. These claims are questionable. Tumor initiation, which is difficult to study, refers to the first oncogenic conversion of a normal cell. In this study, the authors make these claims based on the macroscopic detection of tumors which could entirely depend on an effect on tumor progression. DMBA causes h-ras mutations and such tumors are highly sensitive to the presence of h-ras, indicating that this is the key initiation mechanism in the DMBA/TPA model. Did the authors observe an increase in h-ras mutations after DMBA application? Did the authors observe a difference in the repair of such mutations? Are skin tumors caused by activated k-ras also affected by Dnmt3a or is the effect specific to DMBA-induced tumors? In any case, to claim an effect on tumor initiation in epidermal stem cells, the authors would need to study earlier steps in tumorigenesis.</p><p>5) In the studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) where the authors isolated alpha6-high cells from WT and Dnmt3a-/- tumors for gene expression studies, it would be important to include images of the histology of each tumor as supplemental information. How did they ensure that all tumors were of the same type? Also, since the Dnmt3a tumors progress much faster, how can the authors rule out that the differences relate to different stages of tumorigenesis rather than different genotypes?</p><p>6) The findings of increased PPAR-γ and linked genes suggest the possibility that the authors may be detecting differentiation along the sebaceous lineage in these tumors. This is actually supported by the data indicating that a higher proportion of such tumors are found in the Dnmt3a ko mice. Again, having overview images of each of the tumors with staining for sebaceous markers would be helpful to rule this possibility out.</p><p>7) The characterization of apoptosis and link to Dnmt3a should be improved. Does Dnmt3a act after DNA damage and increase the number of cells undergoing apoptosis following DMBA? The authors should check for active caspase 3 after DMBA and show more convincing Tunel staining. The Tunel staining data (now as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) should be quantified with statistics, and also it would be important to make sure that the same types of tumors are compared across genotypes.</p><p>8) The initiation of hair wave domains after hair removal in second anagen is highly variable and 6 mice (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is probably not sufficient to conclude that there is a difference between genotypes. Perhaps smaller domains were initiated and missed. When did the WT mice exhibit anagen patches? Plotting the time of first anagen patch might be more convincing (also this is not a major point in the paper).</p><p>9) The differences in gene expression reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> may be significant because of the high number of genes included in the comparison, but these differences are very small and not likely to be biologically important. Also, the differences in DNA methylation reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> are very small.</p><p>10) In the title and throughout the manuscript the authors refer to the study of epidermal stem cells. Cultured human keratinocytes under low calcium conditions cannot be accurately referred to as &quot;stem cells&quot;. Furthermore, the stem cells within epidermal tumors would need to be studied in more detail to substantiate the claim that epidermal stem cells are particularly affected by Dnmt function. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> alpha6+/CD34 is used as marker of interfollicular epithelial cells, which likely includes non-stem hair follicle keratinocytes.</p><p>11) The characterization of epidermal differentiation should be performed more carefully. Are the suprabasal epidermal layers normal in these mouse mutants? If deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b singly or in combination has little effect on epidermal differentiation during development, and epidermal homeostasis, indicating that these enzymes are dispensable for adult epidermal stem cell function, this finding would be an important one to emphasize in the manuscript. The findings in the current study are much more plausible and in line with previous studies suggesting that reversible DNA methylation does not seem to have a prominent role in gene regulation in normal tissues (it has clear roles in irreversible silencing such as imprinting, X-inactivation, transposon silencing, irreversible promoter silencing, but a role in re gene regulation has been difficult to demonstrate outside cell culture; see for example Bestor et al., PNAS 2015). There is very little data supporting the idea that methylation and demethylation are important regulators of cellular differentiation during embryonic development; the current manuscript is consistent with this view and contradicts the authors' recently published study. The authors need to discuss the divergence in their two studies more clearly and mention this key finding in the Abstract.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The reviewers all raised concerns regarding the functional link between Dnmt and gene regulation in tumorigenesis. While the authors link the function to the suppression of PPAR and a lipid-type program, there are no functional data in the manuscript in support of this claim and, as mentioned below, this might be linked to a sebaceous tumor phenotype. Functional analysis of Dnmt targets is needed to extend this manuscript to more fully understand how Dnmt impacts tumor progression.</italic> </p><p>We agree that providing functional analysis of Dnmt3a targets, in particular PPARg, would improve the mechanistic insight of our manuscript.</p><p>First, we would like to point out that we believe that the upregulation of lipid metabolism genes we observed is not a consequence of the higher incidence of sebaceous tumors in Dnmt3a-cKO mice. Although Dnmt3a-cKO mice develop more sebaceous adenomas than wild type mice, we made sure that this type of tumor was not used for any of the mechanistic studies included in our work. We apologize for not making this clear in the first version of our manuscript. To highlight this, we now have included a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) containing the histology of each tumor used of the RNA-sequencing studies, which was performed by our mouse pathologist to make sure that none was scored as a sebaceous adenoma. We have also performed immunostaining to detect the expression of ADFP to show that none of the tumors studied expressed this sebaceous marker (also included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we now include as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, the immunostaining to detect the expression of PPARg in each sample, showing that Dnmt3-cKO tumors (scored as squamous cell carcinomas, and not sebaceous adenomas) show high expression of PPARg. Furthermore, the RNA-seq data obtained from the short-term treatment with DMBA-TPA shows that basal IFE cells in Dnmt3a-cKO mice already start to express high levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism (including PPARg, as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) without any sebocyte differentiation.</p><p>Regarding the mechanistic studies: since we do not have PPARg conditional knockout mice available in our lab, we decided to use a well-characterized inhibitor of PPARg to address this issue. We repeated the DMBA-TPA chemical carcinogenesis protocol in wild type and Dnmt3a-cKO mice, and divided the mice into two cohorts, one treated with the PPARg inhibitor, and the other one with the vehicle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, inhibition of PPARg significantly delayed the time of tumor appearance, and reduced the number of tumors, in Dnmt3a-cKO mice. Interestingly, the size of the tumors was not affected by inhibition of PPARg, suggesting that this TF is necessary for the early onset of tumorigenesis, but not for the growth of tumors once they are formed. These results therefore suggest that inhibition of PPARg could be considered as a new possible therapy for skin squamous cell carcinomas.</p><p>We would like to thank you for making this interesting suggestion, which we believe has significantly enhanced the quality of our work.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, they authors show that hairs regrow faster after DMBA treatment in Dnmt3a cKO mice. The authors suggested that &quot;Dnmt3a might act as a break to maintain hair follicles in a dormant state&quot;. This potentially interesting phenotype has not been studied in detail and this information as it is might be a bit distracting.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this observation could distract the readers from the primary message of our work, which is to describe the role of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in skin tumorigenesis. We have therefore decided to remove panel A from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and to study this interesting phenotype in more detail in the future.</p><p><italic>3) It is clear that DNA methylation can affect non-transcriptional mechanisms such as genome stability and DNA repair mechanisms, and there are no studies presented to assess non-transcriptional effects of DNA methylation on tumorigenesis. Have the authors looked at mutation frequency and/or genomic stability in these tumors?</italic> </p><p>We believe this is a very interesting question. There are several publications suggesting that the epigenetic landscape of chromatin can have a major influence in the mutational load of tumors (for instance, Schuster-Böckler B and Lehner B. Chromatin organization is a major influence on regional mutation rates in human cancer cells. Nature 2012). However, these studies are correlative and do not provide any functional data. In this sense, before we reply directly to the issue raised above, we would like to point out that we have been developing for the last 4 years a large project designed to specifically determine whether the chromatin landscape (i.e. presence or absence of different chromatin modifications, and whether the chromatin is more accessible or closed) affects the mutational frequency and types of mutations in tumors. We have performed whole exome sequencing, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq of several chromatin marks in different mouse models in which we have deleted a specific epigenetic regulator, to precisely determine whether altering different chromatin marks has any effect over the regional mutation rates, types of mutations, and number and type of driver mutations, in DMBA/TPA-induced cutaneous carcinoma. This ongoing project has resulted in a vast amount of results, with really interesting but also quite complex conclusions. We therefore believe this analysis is beyond the scope of this current study, as it constitutes a story by itself. Because of the complexity of the analyses and results, adding just some of the data to this manuscript would not be sufficient to explain if and how epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, shape the mutational landscape of tumors.</p><p>However, we include as figures for the reviewers some results we have obtained regarding the potential role of genomic instability or mutational changes in the phenotype of Dnmt3a-cKO mice:</p><p>We have studied whether deletion of Dnmt3a results in increased genomic instability by looking at the DNA content in precancerous epidermis. To do so, we treated for six weeks three wild type and three Dnmt3a-cKO mice with DMBA/TPA. We then analyzed by FACS the DNA content in proliferative (Edu+) and non-proliferative (Edu-) Itga6brightCD34pos and Itga6brightCD34neg cells. Notably, we did not observe any significant change in the DNA content between Dnmt3a-cKO and wild type cells, suggesting that aneuploidy, or other signs of genomic instability, do not occur upon deletion of Dnmt3a in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response images 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">2</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.033</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.034</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>We also confirmed that the expression and localization of γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA double- strand breaks and general genomic damage, were the same in wild type and Dnmt3a-cKO tumors.</p><p>We took advantage of the high quality of our RNA-sequencing to start to understand if loss of Dnmt3a alters the mutational landscape in skin tumors. We obtained between 70-110 million reads per tumor; moreover, the reads were 125 nucleotides long, 2.5X more than the conventional 50 nucleotides; and also the sequencing was pair-ended. Importantly, we calculated that each nucleotide was covered in an average depth of 150-250x in each tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.035</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.035">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.035</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p>These technical details gave us the possibility to analyze our samples using the GATK software (developed at the Broad Institute), which allows detecting variants, such as SNPs and other kinds of mutations using RNA-seq samples (Graw et al., 2015). As mentioned above, we are aware that whole exome/genome sequencing is the gold standard method to study mutations, but previous works have demonstrated that good quality and deep RNA- sequencing data can also be used with some confidence to identify exome variants (Piskol et al., 2013; Graw et al., 2015). Applying this method, we observed that Dnmt3a-cKO tumors showed a slight increase in the total number of mutations; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref>)<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.036</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p>We next tried to determine whether there were any differences in the types of mutations among the four bases, between wild type and Dnmt3-cKO tumors. As expected from previous works studying DMBA/TPA-induced tumors, the highest rate of mutations occurred on Thymine (Nassar et al., 2015). Interestingly, this analysis revealed that Dnmt3a-cKO tumors harbored a higher percentage of Cytosine to Thymine mutations compared to wild type tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 5</xref>)<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.037</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p>Although we do not know at the moment whether this change has any influence on the differences in the timing and number of tumors that Dnmt3a-cKO mice develop, we believe there might be a mechanistic explanation for it. Cytosine is one of the most-unstable bases, as it often spontaneously deaminates into Uracil (Gallinari et al., 1996). 5-methylcytosine also undergoes deamination, even more often than the native form, but instead it naturally mutates into Thymine instead of Uracil. In mammals Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) is the enzyme primarily responsible for repairing the spontaneous deamination of 5-MethylCytosine, as part of the Base Excision Repair (BER) mechanism. TDG recognizes the 5mC&gt;T mutation, excises the damaged base, and subsequently initiates the process to restore the native Cytosine (Jacobs et al., 2012). Interestingly, TDG interacts with many factors such as CBP/p300, ERα, but most importantly, with Dnmt3a (Li et al., 2006). In fact, the interaction with Dnmt3a positively regulates the glycosylase activity of TDG. Recent works have underscored the strong relationship between the DNA methylation machinery and the enzymatic activity of TDG (Cortellino et al., 2012; Dalton et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2013; Muller et al., 2014). Thus, altogether we believe that the depletion of Dnmt3a leads to an impairment of the activity of TDG glycosylase, resulting in the defective repair of 5mC&gt;T mutations.</p><p>Although exome sequencing of Dnmt3a-cKO HSCs and leukemias has been published, the raw data is not available (or we have not been able to find it). Thus, unfortunately, we have not been able to compare our data with theirs to determine whether this difference in C-T mutations is generally associated to the loss of Dnmt3a (Mayle et al., 2015; Celik et al., 2015). In any case, and to conclude, we therefore believe that loss of Dnmt3a does affect the mutational landscape of DMBA/TPA-driven tumors. However, studying if and how these differences impact tumorigenesis is turning out to be very complex and is part of a large separate study in our lab (as mentioned above); hence, we believe that addressing this issue is beyond the scope of this current study.</p><p>4) The authors argue that Dnmt3a selectively affects tumor initiation rather than tumor progression. These claims are questionable. Tumor initiation, which is difficult to study, refers to the first oncogenic conversion of a normal cell. In this study, the authors make these claims based on the macroscopic detection of tumors which could entirely depend on an effect on tumor progression. DMBA causes h-ras mutations and such tumors are highly sensitive to the presence of h-ras, indicating that this is the key initiation mechanism in the DMBA/TPA model. Did the authors observe an increase in h-ras mutations after DMBA application? Did the authors observe a difference in the repair of such mutations?</p><p>These are very interesting questions and issues. Regarding the concept of tumor initiation versus tumor progression, we referred to differences in tumor initiation as the difference in the number of tumors that grow (or initiate) in Dnmt3a-cKO mice compared to wild type mice. On the other hand, we used the term progression to describe the transition from a benign lesion to a carcinoma. We believe these definitions are commonly accepted in the cancer field. According to these definitions, although Dnmt3a-cKO mice develop/initiate more tumors, they show the same proportion of benign and malignant lesions. Hence, loss of Dnmt3a does not favor this malignant conversion (progression) of squamous neoplasias.</p><p>However, as the reviewers point out, Dnmt3a-cKO mice might develop (or initiate) more tumors due to an increase in the percentage of cells mutated in Ras. In order to determine this, we would need to perform whole-exome sequencing of sorted epithelial tumor cells from a reasonably large cohort of wild type and KO tumors (for our other ongoing studies on the influence of chromatin on mutations we are sequencing at least 20 tumors per genotype). However, using the RNA-seq data included in the manuscript, and applying the GATK software described above, we could analyze mutations in HRAS and NRAS genes. As expected, we found mutations in HRAS and NRAS in wild type and Dnmt3a-cKO tumor cells. However, and being aware that the number of samples sequenced precludes reaching definitive conclusions, the percentage of mutations in H-RAS and N-RAS was not increased upon loss of Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 6</xref>). In addition, the sites of mutations were the same between wild type and KO tumors in HRAS (T &gt; A mutation), and NRAS (A &gt;G mutations). Importantly, the HRAS mutations spotted by our analysis in Dnmt3a-cKO mice are precisely the same T&gt;A mutation resulting in the activating Q61L transition, shown in two recent articles from the Blanpain and Balmain laboratories (Nassar et al., 2015 and McCreery et al., 2015).<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.038</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.038">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.038</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that Dnmt3a-cKO tumors do not contain more, or different, mutations in H-RAS and N-RAS. We therefore think it is unlikely that the shortened latency of tumor appearance, and increased tumor burden of Dnmt3a-cKO mice is due to differences in the mutations in these RAS genes</p><p>Are skin tumors caused by activated k-ras also affected by Dnmt3a or is the effect specific to DMBA-induced tumors?</p><p>In this manuscript we have only characterized the importance of Dnmt3a in carcinogen (i.e. DMBA)-induced tumors. We believe that addressing whether loss of Dnmt3a differently affects H-Ras- or K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis is very interesting, but beyond the scope of this study. In any case, previous work by the group of Rudolf Jaenisch showed that the deletion of Dnmt3a promotes lung tumor progression using a K-RAS mouse model, suggesting that Dnmt3a acts as a tumor suppressor regardless of which Ras gene is mutated</p><p><italic>In any case, to claim an effect on tumor initiation in epidermal stem cells, the authors would need to study earlier steps in tumorigenesis.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we think that our results are compatible with the conclusion that Dnmt3a-cKO mice initiate more tumors earlier than wild type mice. We believe this accurately describes the phenotype. Hence, we are not sure why this conclusion is not considered valid. We are however open to discussing any suggestion to perhaps more accurately describe our results.</p><p>Regarding tumor initiation, we believe we have in fact tried to provide some insights into the early steps of tumorigenesis with the short-term treatments of DMBA/TPA (showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have shown that the loss of Dnmt3a increases cell proliferation and the expression of lipid metabolism genes early after treatment with DMBA/TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we also show that, once formed, Dnmt3a- cKO tumors do not show increased cell proliferation compared to wild type tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, a very similar conclusion has been reached by another work recently published by the laboratory of Margaret Goodell (Yang et al., 2016), where the authors state: “The inability to slow the leukemia by re-expression of DNMT3A suggests that DNMT3A loss is important for leukemia initiation but less so for maintenance”.</p><p>5) In the studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) where the authors isolated alpha6-high cells from WT and Dnmt3a-/- tumors for gene expression studies, it would be important to include images of the histology of each tumor as supplemental information. How did they ensure that all tumors were of the same type? Also, since the Dnmt3a tumors progress much faster, how can the authors rule out that the differences relate to different stages of tumorigenesis rather than different genotypes?</p><p>We have now included the histology for each tumor analyzed for gene expression as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. It is important to note that our mouse pathologist (Neus Prats, who is an author in the manuscript) performed the histological characterization of each tumor in a blind manner. In addition, we have now included the measurements of the time difference between tumor appearance and tumor collection for each mouse, showing the Dnmt3a-cKO tumors, although appearing before, do not progress faster than wild type tumors (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The animals were sacrificed for humane reasons when the biggest tumor reached 1.5cm (as described into the methods section), but the average time between tumor appearance and this endpoint was the same between wild type and Dnmt3a-cKO tumors.</p><p>6) The findings of increased PPAR-γ and linked genes suggest the possibility that the authors may be detecting differentiation along the sebaceous lineage in these tumors. This is actually supported by the data indicating that a higher proportion of such tumors are found in the Dnmt3a ko mice. Again, having overview images of each of the tumors with staining for sebaceous markers would be helpful to rule this possibility out.</p><p>We agree this was an important issue that we should have clarified better in our first version of the manuscript. First, our mouse pathologist did not score any of the tumors used for RNA- seq (or any subsequent analysis) as a sebaceous adenoma. We have also now included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, the results of the immunofluorescence staining for the sebaceous gland marker Adipophilin (ADFP), for each of the sequenced tumors. We did not observe any protein expression of ADFP in any of the 12 tumors sent for sequencing. Accordingly, ADFP was not differentially expressed at the mRNA level in Dnmt3a-cKO tumors compared to wild type lesions based on our RNA-seq analysis. As a positive control, we stained for ADFP in a sebaceous adenoma, which was not sent for sequencing. We would also like to note that sebaceous adenomas are generally small and quite different macroscopically from squamous cell carcinomas, so we could easily discriminate them when collecting the tumors for FACS sorting and subsequent analyses.</p><p>At last, we have also included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> the expression analysis of PPAR-γ by immunofluorescence in all the 12 sequenced tumors that our pathologist scored as squamous cell carcinomas. We observed that PPAR-γ is consistently higher in all the 8 Dnmt3a KO tumors compared to the 4 wild type tumors, both at the RNA level (measured by RNA-seq) and also at the protein level. In addition, PPAR-γ is increased, upon Dnmt3a deletion, in the interfollicular epidermis after the short term DMBA/TPA treatment previous to any tumor formation, suggesting that the PPAR-γ is an early event not associated to a general sebocyte differentiation.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe we now provide new conclusive data indicating that deletion of Dnmt3a results in a stronger expression of lipid metabolism genes prior to tumor initiation, that persists in squamous cell carcinomas.</p><p>7) The characterization of apoptosis and link to Dnmt3a should be improved. Does Dnmt3a act after DNA damage and increase the number of cells undergoing apoptosis following DMBA? The authors should check for active caspase 3 after DMBA and show more convincing Tunel staining. The Tunel staining data (now as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) should be quantified with statistics, and also it would be important to make sure that the same types of tumors are compared across genotypes.</p><p>To properly quantify the changes in apoptosis in the Dnmt3a-cKO mice, we have stained and quantified, in all the sequenced tumors, for TUNEL and active Caspase-3. The results show a statistically significant decrease of apoptosis in Dnmt3a-cKO tumors compared to wild type lesions. These results are now included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) The initiation of hair wave domains after hair removal in second anagen is highly variable and 6 mice (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is probably not sufficient to conclude that there is a difference between genotypes. Perhaps smaller domains were initiated and missed. When did the WT mice exhibit anagen patches? Plotting the time of first anagen patch might be more convincing (also this is not a major point in the paper).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that is not a major point of our work, and that perhaps we need to study this phenotype in more detail and with more mice. Therefore, we have decided to remove these results from the manuscript.</p><p>9) The differences in gene expression reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> may be significant because of the high number of genes included in the comparison, but these differences are very small and not likely to be biologically important. Also, the differences in DNA methylation reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> are very small.</p><p>We respectfully disagree that the differences we show might not be biologically relevant. The changes in gene expression that occur upon deletion of Dnmt3a do in fact have a strong biological consequence regarding the timing and number of tumors that mice develop upon DMBA/TPA treatment. However, we would like to point out that the main reason we performed these analyses was to determine whether binding of Dnmt3a to promoters affected in any way the expression of the bound genes. In order to better show this, we have divided the Dnmt3a-target genes (as determined by our ChIP-seq data) based on binding strength; that is, we have separated them into the top 10%, 20%, 50% genes whose promoters are most strongly bound by Dnmt3a. Interestingly, the top 10-20% genes most strongly bound by Dnmt3a showed a stronger upregulation in their mRNA expression upon deletion of Dnmt3a compared to the top 50% of genes bound by Dnmt3a, or to all bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 7</xref>). We believe these results therefore indicate that binding of Dnmt3a to promoters, correlates mostly with a downregulation of the expression of those target genes. Upon deletion of Dnmt3a, the average expression of those genes increases.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.039</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.039</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>We also believe that the new data we have added showing that inhibition of PPAR-γ partially prevents the positive effects of the deletion of Dnmt3a over tumorigenesis in fact indicates that the differences in gene expression that we have observed are biologically relevant.</p><p>10) In the title and throughout the manuscript the authors refer to the study of epidermal stem cells. Cultured human keratinocytes under low calcium conditions cannot be accurately referred to as &quot;stem cells&quot;. Furthermore, the stem cells within epidermal tumors would need to be studied in more detail to substantiate the claim that epidermal stem cells are particularly affected by Dnmt function. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> alpha6+/CD34 is used as marker of interfollicular epithelial cells, which likely includes non-stem hair follicle keratinocytes.</p><p>We initially described the phenotype as a stem cell based one because of previous works by the groups of Cedric Blanpain (Lgr5-Cre, <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre, K14-Cre), Roel Nusse (Axin-Cre), Elaine Fuchs (Lgr5-Cre, K14-Cre) and Valentina Greco (Keratin15-Cre, Lgr5-Cre), that strongly suggest that squamous tumors arise from different stem cells within the keratinocyte compartment of the skin. However, it is also true that the definition of mouse IFE stem cells is still under debate within the stem cell field. In addition, extensive work by the group of Fiona Watt has shown that squamous tumors can also arise from involucrin positive IFE cells, which are not stem cells. We therefore agree that using our current mouse models we have no way of discriminating between these possibilities (i.e. stem cell, progenitor cell, or differentiated cell origin). Hence, we have changed the title to the following one that we think more accurately describes our findings: ¨Loss of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b does not affect epidermal homeostasis but promotes squamous transformation through PPAR-γ¨</p><p>11) The characterization of epidermal differentiation should be performed more carefully. Are the suprabasal epidermal layers normal in these mouse mutants? If deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b singly or in combination has little effect on epidermal differentiation during development, and epidermal homeostasis, indicating that these enzymes are dispensable for adult epidermal stem cell function, this finding would be an important one to emphasize in the manuscript. The findings in the current study are much more plausible and in line with previous studies suggesting that reversible DNA methylation does not seem to have a prominent role in gene regulation in normal tissues (it has clear roles in irreversible silencing such as imprinting, X-inactivation, transposon silencing, irreversible promoter silencing, but a role in re gene regulation has been difficult to demonstrate outside cell culture; see for example Bestor et al., PNAS 2015). There is very little data supporting the idea that methylation and demethylation are important regulators of cellular differentiation during embryonic development; the current manuscript is consistent with this view and contradicts the authors' recently published study. The authors need to discuss the divergence in their two studies more clearly and mention this key finding in the Abstract.</p><p>We agree that this is an important point. We have now added the following in the Discussion section: “Our results indicate that Dnmt3a drives the DNA-methylation, and subsequent hydroxymethylation, of a subset of enhancers that regulate the expression of genes involved differentiation. […] Notwithstanding the differences between in vivo and ex vivo studies, our results show that the genomic localization of Dnmt3a is very similar between intact murine keratinocytes and cultured human keratinocytes.”</p><p>In order to verify this, we have performed a comparative clonogenic assay of cells isolated from the bulge and the IFE of wild type and Dnmt3a-cKO mice. As it can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 8</xref>, Dnmt3a-cKO keratinocytes (irrespective of whether they come from the bulge or the basal IFE) show a significantly impaired clonogenic potential, just as we had previously reported in Rinaldi et al., for Dnmt3a-depleted primary human keratinocytes. Hence we believe that deletion of Dnmt3a renders primary basal keratinocytes more sensitive to situations of stress.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21697.040</object-id><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21697.040">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21697.040</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21697-resp-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>However, we would like to point out that previous work from the laboratory of Margaret Goodell has shown that deletion of Dnmt3a does result in changes in gene expression in adult murine hematopoietic cells. It is true that these differences result in mild differentiation phenotypes (that are mostly apparent when HSCs are serially transplanted into irradiated mice). But it is equally true that these mice end up developing leukemia, which is a clear alteration of tissue homeostasis (a phenotype that is exacerbated upon the combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b). Hence, we think that the statement: “…that reversible DNA methylation does not seem to have a prominent role in gene regulation in normal tissues (it has clear roles in irreversible silencing such as imprinting, X-inactivation, transposon silencing, irreversible promoter silencing, but a role in re gene regulation has been difficult to demonstrate outside cell culture”; is perhaps too strong, and that more in depth studies are needed to determine the exact role of these proteins, and importantly of DNA methylation, in the differentiation of different tissues. For instance we do not know if Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b compensate each other upon conditional deletion in tissues during embryonic development. Would their inducible deletion during adulthood result in the same phenotype? Perhaps the recently identified Dnmt3c, although specific to germ cells, could also compensate for the combined loss of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in somatic tissues. In addition, our results suggest that Dnmt1 is capable by itself to maintain some degree of DNA methylation in the long term in the absence of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. In fact, our manuscript contains some evidence supporting this last point. With our K14-Cre line, we have deleted Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the embryonic epidermis approximately at E13.5. However, when we looked at DNA methylation in old mice (over 70 weeks of age) with the combined deletion of Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b, we could still see some residual methylation present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Hence, we would like to avoid concluding that DNA methylation/demethylation is completely dispensable for epidermal homeostasis, since with our KO models we have not completely eliminated DNA methylation from the epidermis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
