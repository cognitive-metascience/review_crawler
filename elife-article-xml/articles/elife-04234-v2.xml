Autotransporters are single polypeptides that consist of two domains, an N-terminal domain (‘passenger domain’) that is exposed on the cell surface and that often mediates a virulence function, and a C-terminal domain (‘β domain’) that resides in the outer membrane (OM). Following their translocation across the OM, many passenger domains are released from the cell surface by a proteolytic cleavage. Passenger domains vary widely in sequence and size (∼20–400 kD), but almost always form an unusual repetitive structure known as a β helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Junker et al., 2006</xref>). β domains are typically ∼30 kD in size and, like the vast majority of bacterial integral OM proteins, fold into a β barrel structure. While the sequences of β domains are also very heterogeneous, the structures of all of the β domains that have been solved to date are nearly superimposable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oomen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Berg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>). After autotransporters are translocated across the inner membrane (IM) through the Sec complex they interact with molecular chaperones that presumably maintain them in an assembly-competent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruiz-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently the β domain is targeted to the Bam complex, an essential heterooligomer consisting of an integral OM protein (BamA) and four lipoproteins (BamBCDE) that catalyzes the membrane insertion of β barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Voulhoux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>). X-ray crystallographic analysis suggests that the BamA β barrel domain is unstable and may open laterally to allow the escape of client proteins into the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2014</xref>).</p><p>Although it has been shown that the passenger domain is translocated across the OM in a C-to-N-terminal fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Junker et al., 2009</xref>), the mechanism of translocation is poorly understood. Based on the observation that deletion of the β domain abolishes passenger domain translocation, it was originally proposed that the β domain serves as the transport channel for the passenger domain (whence the name ‘autotransporter’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pohlner et al., 1987</xref>). At first glance, this hypothesis seems to be supported by crystallographic studies showing that upon completion of translocation the two domains are connected by an α-helical linker that is embedded inside the β domain pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oomen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Berg, 2010</xref>). The same studies, however, revealed that the β domain pore is only ∼10 Å in diameter. Because the directionality of translocation presumably requires the formation of a C-terminal hairpin followed by the sliding of medial and N-terminal segments past a static strand, both strands of the hairpin would have to be in a fully extended conformation to fit inside the pore. On the contrary, available evidence indicates that the polypeptide that resides inside the β domain forms an α helix prior to the completion of translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ieva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, small folded polypeptides have been shown to be secreted efficiently by the autotransporter pathway and a subset of naturally occurring passenger domains undergo disulfide bonding in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skillman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jong et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, BamA has been shown to interact with the passenger domain during the translocation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</xref>). While the β domain does appear to play a role in translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saurí et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>), these and other results strongly suggest that autotransporter assembly is more complex than originally envisioned. In one scenario, the Bam complex might facilitate the membrane insertion of the β domain and the translocation of the passenger domain in a concerted reaction, but it is also possible that other factors are also required to transport the passenger domain across the OM.</p><p>The energy source for passenger domain translocation has also remained poorly understood. Although most protein translocation reactions require external energy in the form of ATP or a membrane potential, the periplasm is devoid of ATP and there is no membrane potential across the bacterial OM. It is conceivable that an IM protein that derives energy from the hydrolysis of cytoplasmic ATP or from the electrochemical gradient across the IM interacts with the passenger domain and drives translocation, but such a protein has never been identified. To explain the energetics of secretion, it has been proposed that the sequential folding of segments of the β helix in the extracellular space drives translocation and prevents retrograde movement into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klauser et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Junker et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this vectorial folding model, mutations that impair the folding of C-terminal segments of two different passenger domains significantly reduce the efficiency of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Renn et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations that perturb the folding of medial and N-terminal segments of the passenger domain, however, produce only a modest translocation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang’ethe and Bernstein, 2013b</xref>). Furthermore, the intrinsically disordered receptor domain (RD) of the <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> RTX toxin has been shown to be secreted efficiently by the autotransporter pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang’ethe and Bernstein, 2013a</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of a large number of acidic residues is critical for the secretion of the RD. This observation, together with the finding that naturally occurring passenger domains are predominantly acidic, suggests that charge interactions may play a significant role in driving the translocation reaction.</p><p>To gain further insight into both the mechanism and energetics of passenger domain translocation, we sought to reconstitute autotransporter assembly in vitro using purified components. In our experiments, we used the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 autotransporter EspP, as a model protein. Following the completion of translocation, the passenger domain of EspP and other members of the SPATE (<underline>serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae</underline>) family is released in an unusual intrabarrel cleavage reaction that requires accurate folding of the β domain and precise positioning of the passenger domain-β domain junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dautin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnard et al., 2012</xref>). Although it was previously shown that the insertion of small <italic>E. coli</italic> β barrel proteins such as OmpT and OmpA into proteoliposomes can be catalyzed by the purified Bam complex and the periplasmic chaperone SurA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagan and Kahne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>), we did not observe assembly of EspP using the same methodology. Using an alternative expression and purification strategy, however, we obtained an apparently more active form of the Bam complex that, together with SurA, was both necessary and sufficient to promote the membrane integration of the EspP β domain and the translocation and cleavage of the EspP passenger domain. Remarkably, passenger domain translocation did not require the input of any additional energy. In addition to defining the minimal set of factors required for autotransporter assembly, our work provides a valuable resource for future studies on the function of the Bam complex and its role in the biogenesis of the broader class of OM proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Bam complex and SurA are necessary and sufficient to promote the assembly of an EspP derivative that contains a minimal passenger domain fragment</title><p>It has long been known that large N-terminal segments of autotransporter passenger domains can be deleted without affecting the integration of the β domain into the OM or the secretion of the remaining passenger domain fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dautin and Bernstein, 2007</xref>). The native EspP passenger domain is 968 residues in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but a derivative that contains only 26 residues of the ∼28 residue C-terminal segment that reside inside the β domain in an α-helical conformation (EspPΔ5) is assembled as efficiently as the wild-type protein in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>). The modification or deletion of residues in the α-helical segment, however, can profoundly perturb the folding and integration of the β domain into the OM and/or the proteolytic release of the passenger domain, which requires precise alignment of the cleavage junction with key catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dautin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ieva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnard et al., 2012</xref>). Because EspPΔ5 and other derivatives that expose no more than a short segment on the cell surface are structurally similar to generic β barrel proteins such as OmpT, it might be expected that they would have similar assembly requirements. Indeed any autotransporter-specific assembly factors might only be required once the passenger domain reaches a threshold size. Based on this reasoning, we first analyzed the assembly of an EspP derivative designated EspP(46+β) that consists of EspPΔ5 plus 20 N-terminal residues derived from the cloning vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We expected that the accurate assembly of EspP(46+β) would result in the proteolytic release of the 46 residue passenger domain and the accumulation of a folded ∼30 kD β domain that, as previously shown, is resistant to SDS denaturation unless heated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skillman et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04234.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain structure of EspP and model for passenger domain translocation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EspP consists of a signal peptide (SP; residues 1–55), an extracellular (‘passenger’) domain (residues 56–1023) and a β barrel (‘β’) domain (residues 1024–1300) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunder et al., 1997</xref>). While most of the passenger domain forms a long β helix, the N-terminus (residues 56–313) forms a discrete globular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khan et al., 2011</xref>).

Prior to the release of the passenger domain in an intrabarrel cleavage reaction, ∼28 residues of the 46 residue passenger domain are embedded inside the β domain pore. (<bold>C</bold>) Available evidence indicates that the EspP passenger domain is secreted in a hairpin conformation while distinct regions of the β domain interact with BamA, BamB and BamD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>).

In any case, the finding that proteolytic maturation and the release of the β domain from the Bam complex both require the completion of translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>) strongly suggests that the active site cannot form during the passage of the passenger domain across the OM.

In this assay, <italic>E. coli</italic> BamAB and BamCDE are first expressed and isolated independently. The two subcomplexes are then mixed together to form a holocomplex and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. In the presence of the proteoliposomes and a molar excess of SurA, denatured OmpT folds into a stable structure that is enzymatically active and resistant to SDS denaturation. We attempted to express and purify the Bam complex exactly as described, but for reasons that are unclear we did not observe efficient formation of the Bam holocomplex unless we purified BamAB through an additional step. Nevertheless, we ultimately obtained a single peak on a gel filtration column that was highly enriched in the reconstructed complex, which we designated Bam(AB)(CDE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). After the peak fractions were pooled, most of the Bam holocomplex could be reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Remarkably, the intensity of the fluorescent signal in the fluorogenic peptide cleavage assay indicated that OmpT folded much more efficiently in the presence of BamABCDE than Bam(AB)(CDE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, compare green and purple curves). These results suggested that the activity of the Bam complex is optimized when all of the subunits are expressed together.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that BamABCDE also stimulated the assembly of EspP(46+β). The urea-denatured EspP derivative was incubated at 30°C with proteoliposomes containing the Bam complex and SurA, and samples were removed at various time points. Folding of the protein and subsequent proteolytic maturation were monitored by Western blot using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum and a fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody. A rapidly migrating (∼27 kD) band that corresponds to the folded form of the free EspP β domain appeared within 5 min and was more prominent at later time points when the samples were not heated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When the samples were heated, a much more intense ∼30 kD band that corresponds to the unfolded β domain was observed. This marked difference in intensity has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>) and presumably results from the occlusion of the C-terminal epitope in the folded form of the β domain. No proteolytic processing was observed if either SurA or BamABCDE was omitted from the reaction or if BamAB or BamCDE subomplexes were used in place of the holocomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Single plasmids were also used to produce Bam complexes that lack either BamB or BamC, but curiously only ∼50–70% of the purified partial complexes could be reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). BamABDE and BamACDE both promoted the assembly EspP(46+β), but less effectively than BamABCDE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, the addition of purified Skp to reactions containing BamABCDE and SurA inhibited EspP(46+β) assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and ATP (0.1 mM) blocked assembly altogether (data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04234.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BamABCDE and SurA catalyze the assembly of EspP(46+β).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Urea-denatured EspP(46+β) was incubated with SurA and proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE.

This derivative, which is designated EspP*(46+β), contains a mutation at the cleavage site that abolishes proteolysis but does not affect folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skillman et al., 2005</xref>). A polypeptide that migrated slower than the folded β domain (∼30 kDa vs ∼27 kDa) and that corresponds to the folded form of EspP*(46+β) was observed when the samples were not heated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, this band disappeared when the samples were heated because in the absence of cleavage the denatured form of EspP*(46+β) co-migrates with the unassembled protein.</p><p>Quantitation of the relative fluorescent signal produced by the denatured form of the EspP β domain and unprocessed EspP(46+β) on Western blots indicated that ∼10–20% of the protein was typically assembled under our experimental conditions. The efficiency of assembly did not appear to be limited by the concentration of either reconstituted BamABCDE or SurA. A moderate increase in efficiency was observed when the BamABCDE concentration was increased from 0.05 μM to 0.2 μM (the concentration used in the experiments described here), but no increase was observed at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Interestingly, if we added fresh substrate 5ʹ after the start of the incubation, the total yield of assembled EspP(46+β) increased in proportion to the amount of added substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This observation is consistent with other evidence that the Bam complex can catalyze multiple rounds of assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagan and Kahne, 2011</xref>). In light of our results, it is likely that the efficiency of EspP(46+β) assembly was limited by the inherent ability of the denatured protein to remain assembly competent after dilution out of 8 M urea.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Bam complex and SurA catalyze the assembly of larger EspP derivatives</title><p>We next wished to determine whether the factors that promote the assembly of the EspP β domain can also promote the translocation of substantial passenger domain fragments. To this end, we expressed and purified EspP derivatives that contain progressively longer portions of the native passenger domain plus 20 N-terminal residues derived from the cloning vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because proteolytic maturation of EspP is absolutely dependent on the completion of passenger domain translocation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>), we initially assessed translocation by monitoring the appearance of the cleaved β domain. Indeed available evidence strongly suggests that the completion of β domain assembly (and the assembly of the active site) is a late event in autotransporter biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>), possibly because the β domain forms at least part of the passenger domain transport channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As Western blot analysis using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum indicated, EspP derivatives that have passenger domains ranging in size from 72–734 residues were all processed with approximately the same efficiency as EspP(46+β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The largest derivative lacks the N-terminal globular segment of the EspP passenger domain, but contains the entire β helical segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results not only suggest that BamABCDE and SurA are sufficient to promote passenger domain translocation, but also suggest that the passenger domain does not readily adopt a translocation-incompetent conformation that independently limits the efficiency of autotransporter assembly.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04234.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>BamABCDE and SurA catalyze the assembly of longer EspP derivatives.</title><p>The indicated urea-denatured EspP derivative was incubated with SurA and proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE.

Initially we found that after incubating EspP(96+β) with proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE and SurA for 30 min, the cleaved β domain was both subject to heat denaturation in SDS and resistant to proteinase K (PK) digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This result provided direct evidence that the β domain was not only properly folded, but also inserted into the proteoliposomes. Subsequently we examined the assembly of EspP*(96+β), a non-cleavable version of EspP(96+β), under the same conditions. In the absence of PK, a band that migrates slower than the folded β domain (∼35 kDa vs ∼27 kDa) and that corresponds to the folded form of the full-length protein was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The finding that the ∼35 kDa polypeptide was resistant to PK digestion unless detergent was added showed that the passenger domain was translocated into the lumen of the proteoliposomes. We also performed an initial analysis of the assembly of EspP(HA-251+β), a derivative that contains 251 residues of the EspP passenger domain plus an N-terminal HA tag (14 additional residues). After we incubated the protein with proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE and SurA we detected the β domain and the cleaved passenger domain on Western blots probed with anti-EspP C-terminal and anti-HA antisera, respectively, and both fragments were resistant to PK digestion unless detergent was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because the epitope tag is the last segment of the protein that traverses the membrane, these results confirm that the translocation reaction went to completion.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04234.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>EspP derivatives are correctly assembled into proteoliposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Urea-denatured EspP(96+β) was incubated with SurA and proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE.

We used 0.2 μM substrate in these experiments because we found that doubling the EspP concentration moderately increased the efficiency of assembly. As suggested by a study on OmpT, the enhancement of assembly might be a fortuitous effect of increasing the concentration of urea, which presumably helps to maintain the folding-competence of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagan and Kahne, 2011</xref>).

Furthermore, given that autotransporter assembly is inherently more complicated than the assembly of generic β barrel proteins, it is conceivable that the Bam complex exists in a distinctive oligomeric state during its interaction with autotransporters. To determine whether a single copy of the Bam complex can mediate the assembly of EspP derivatives, we reconstituted BamABCDE into ∼10–12 nm nanodiscs using conditions that facilitate the incorporation of a single copy of the ABC transporter MalFGK<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2012</xref>). The nanodiscs eluted at about the same position on gel filtration columns as BamABCDE monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Analysis of the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE suggested that the scaffold protein MSP1D1 was present in excess over the Bam complex proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Because nanodiscs are stabilized by two copies of the scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denisov et al., 2004</xref>), however, this observation is consistent with the prediction that they contained a single copy of the Bam complex. In addition, the nanodiscs produced a single band on Blue Native PAGE that migrated only slightly slower than a BamABCDE monomer (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum revealed that both EspP(46+β) and EspP(HA-251+β) were assembled into nanodiscs about as efficiently as they were assembled into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Although the non-vesicular nature of nanodiscs precluded assessment of passenger domain translocation using a PK-sensitivity assay, we found that the ∼30 kDa passenger domain of EspP(HA-251+β) accumulated in parallel with the cleaved β domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). These results not only provide evidence that a Bam complex monomer is sufficient to catalyze autotransporter assembly, but also show that the curvature of the proteoliposome membrane is not itself required for the assembly process.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04234.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>BamABCDE and SurA catalyze the assembly of EspP derivatives into nanodiscs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chromatograms of nanodiscs and BamABCDE in DDM on Superdex 75 gel filtration column.

Initially we showed that the Bam complex reconstituted into proteoliposomes and SurA and both necessary and sufficient to catalyze the folding and proteolytic processing of a simplified version of EspP that consists of the β domain plus a short passenger domain fragment that protrudes only slightly from the β domain pore. This derivative is similar to generic β barrel proteins such as OmpT that reside almost entirely in the OM, except that it contains an internal α-helical segment. In subsequent experiments we found that the same two factors are sufficient to catalyze the translocation of passenger domain fragments associated with much larger EspP derivatives. Interestingly, the efficiency and kinetics of assembly was largely independent of the length of the derivative. While this observation does not exclude the possibility that there are other factors that stimulate passenger domain secretion in vivo, it does suggest that they would either play a limited role in the translocation reaction per se or serve to prevent misfolding in the crowded periplasmic space. Finally, experiments using nanodiscs provided evidence that EspP assembly is catalyzed by a single copy of the Bam complex. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which the passenger domain is secreted through a channel consisting of the open β domain and/or the BamA β barrel in an open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Our work demonstrates that passenger domain secretion does not require either an input of exogenous energy or the presence of IM proteins that transduce energy from the cytoplasm or the membrane potential. The results are surprising because ATP hydrolysis is required to drive protein translocation through the Sec complex in an analogous reconstituted assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>) and because other types of protein translocation reactions appear to require a significant energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alder and Theg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi and Theg, 2013</xref>). The high energy cost may result in part from a tendency of proteins to slide backwards at specific stages of the translocation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schiebel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). In the autotransporter pathway, the folding of the passenger domain in the extracellular space has been shown to play a role in driving translocation in vivo, and folding may also promote translocation in the in vitro assay. Available evidence, however, neither supports the notion that stepwise folding alone drives translocation nor explains the efficient secretion of the intrinsically disordered RD domain or polypeptides that fold in the periplasm. As previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang’ethe and Bernstein, 2013a</xref>), electrostatic or other types of interactions between passenger domains and the Bam complex or membrane lipids may facilitate translocation. Like the FimD protein that secretes type I pilus subunits, the Bam complex might also guide passenger domains along a low-energy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geibel et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the Bam complex might catalyze at least the initial stages of translocation and the assembly of the β domain in a concerted fashion. Indeed a model in which a polypeptide segment is pushed across the membrane during the membrane integration of the β domain might explain the efficient secretion of ∼100 residue fragments that are too short to fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skillman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova, et al., 2013</xref>). While the coupling of translocation to β domain assembly might also explain the assembly of a folding-deficient mutant such as EspP(HA-714+β)586TEV in vitro, the observation that stalled translocation reactions can be restarted in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</xref>; JHP and HDB, unpublished results) strongly suggests that energy can be harnessed after the insertion of the β domain is largely complete.</p><p>Our results also indicate that the assembly of the β domain is the rate-limiting step in autotransporter biogenesis. Pulse-chase labeling and photocrosslinking experiments have previously provided evidence that β domain assembly is slower than passenger domain translocation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>), but the interpretation of these experiments is complicated by the fact that the synthesis of the 1300 residue EspP protein is itself rather slow (∼45 s). The use of fully synthesized EspP derivatives in the in vitro assay has enabled us to circumvent this problem and assess the contribution of the translocation step to the overall reaction kinetics more effectively. It is noteworthy that the ability of the β domain to remain assembly-competent also appeared to limit the efficiency of the assembly reaction. This observation corroborates the conclusion that even long passenger domain segments fold slowly and consequently resist aggregation, at least in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Junker et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, given that the β domain clearly interacts with Skp in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>), it is striking that the presence of the chaperone inhibited assembly in vitro. Presumably we could not recapitulate the productive interaction between Skp and the β domain that occurs in vivo, or a factor that is required to release Skp from client proteins was not present (or was present but not fully functional) in our assay.</p><p>Finally, the strategy that we have described to purify the Bam complex may facilitate future studies on the assembly of both autotransporters and many other OM proteins. It is striking that, at least in our hands, BamABCDE was more active than Bam(AB)(CDE). While this disparity may simply be due to technical issues, our results also raise the possibility that the structure of the Bam complex assembled in vivo differs from that of the Bam complex reconstructed from BamAB and BamCDE subcomplexes in vitro. Indeed it is conceivable that while a stable heterooligomer can be formed from the two subcomplexes, the Bam complex is actually assembled by a different pathway inside living cells. In this regard it should be noted that in preliminary experiments we obtained evidence that the Bam complex remains intact in vivo and does not undergo a dynamic cycle in which BamAB and BamCDE subcomplexes rapidly dissocate and reassociate (JHP and HDB, unpublished results).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Previously described plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>) that encode the BamAB and BamCD subcomplexes, His-tagged BamE, SurA and the His-tagged OmpT G236K/K237G mutant (pSK38, pSK46, pBamE-His, pSK257 and pCH28) were reconstructed.

The advance in this paper lies partially in its technical aspects and partially in the conceptual insights. The technical advance relates to the optimization of highly functional Bam complex purification and reconstitution, while the conceptual advances relate to defining the minimal factors for autotransporter assembly and resolving key issues such as lack of an energy requirement. There is little to criticize about the experiments shown in this study, and the technical advance should now make it possible to perform detailed mechanistic analysis, for example by applying biophysical assays for different steps and interactions in the pathway. The insights into autotransporter assembly appear to largely support contemporary models based on earlier in vivo and structural work.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Is it worth including BamC and BamD in the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>?</p><p>2) In the longest two constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the folded beta domain band is apparently confounded by a co-migrating background band, but only in the zero timepoint.

Do the authors know if these are N- or C-terminal truncations? How then do the authors know that the beta domain is arising only from the full length product?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the passenger band in the HA blot seems to appear slightly before the beta domain. It may be worth plotting both on the same graph and explaining this apparent discrepancy with the model of passenger cleavage only occurring after beta domain assembly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Autotransporters are outer membrane proteins composed of a beta-barrel domain that anchors them to the outer membrane and a passenger domain that is translocated into the environment. This architecture led to models postulating that the beta-barrel domain was the translocator for the passenger domain and that the folding of the passenger domain drove translocation. The dependence of autotransporter biogenesis on the Bam (beta-barrel assembly machine) complex shifted the field of autotransporter biogenesis away from these models. Recently, the Bernstein lab has proposed a model stating that the beta-barrel domain is inserted in the outer membrane by the Bam complex and that the translocation of the passenger domain involves Bam and an intermediate in the folding of the beta-barrel domain. Furthermore, they have also proposed that the energy driving translocation is provided in part by the folding of the passenger domains and uncharacterized interactions involving acidic residues in the passenger domain. Much of this model is based on cross-linking experiments, which can be hard to interpret. In addition, it was not clear if other factors assist in this process. Here, using an in vitro reconstitution system, the Bernstein lab shows that the chaperone SurA and the Bam complex are required and sufficient for the assembly of the EspP autotransporter into proteoliposomes and nanodiscs. This is a major accomplishment and a significant contribution to the field that can be used to study the mechanistic details of autotransporter biogenesis. Indeed, the authors perform kinetic measurements and conclude that the assembly of the beta-barrel domain is the rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of this autotransporter. These findings are consistent with their aforementioned model of translocation of the passenger domain occurring during the assembly of the beta-domain.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, the data are of the very high quality, and the work constitutes solid step forward in autotransporter biogenesis research. Well done.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The only minor issue I have with this work refers to the fact that the authors highlight the development of a novel method to purify a highly active form of the Bam complex (e.g., in the Abstract). Their new method is based on the co-expression and co-purification of all 5 components of the Bam complex, as opposed to the separate expression of two sub-complexes of two and three Bam members that are later assembled together. It is clear that in their hands their new method yields a more active Bam complex. I assume this is a reproducible finding across different preparations, but I am not sure if this is a lab-specific phenomenon or not. I agree with the two possible explanations (technical issue vs biological significant) given in the last paragraph of the Discussion, although I recommend the authors remove the last sentence as it is based on being unable to detect something. Their comparison of the two methods should remain in the manuscript but I suggest that the authors tone down the development of a novel method (for example, remove the last sentence of the Abstract).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Roman-Hernandez, Peterson &amp; Bernstein describes experiments that show that the Bam complex plus SurA are sufficient for assembly of a model autotransporter protein (EspP) into (outer) membranes. The authors describe a method for producing a purified Bam complex that has increased function over Bam complexes produced using previous purification/reconstitution methods. They use this Bam complex with purified SurA to demonstrate that these proteins are sufficient for assembly of EspP proteins into proteoliposomes and PK-digestion experiments provide evidence that the passenger domains are translocated across the membranes. The results demonstrate that no external energy is needed for the assembly/translocation process. The results are supported by experiments using nanodiscs and the nanodisc experiments provide compelling evidence that a single copy of the Bam complex is sufficient to translocate EspP. The manuscript is extremely well written and easy to follow, which is especially commendable given the complexity of the experiments and the data. The experimental design is appropriate for the questions being addressed, appropriate controls were included, and conclusions drawn were justified by the data. The results represent a large step forward in understanding how proteins of the autotransporter family are inserted into the outer membrane in their proper orientation and in membrane protein biogenesis in general. The results, and the approaches used in this manuscript, will be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p>Specific criticism:</p><p>1) The Results described in the section “…the introduction of a short linker into EspP…” are somewhat unsatisfying. Up to this point in the manuscript, the data suggest that the in vitro system reflects what happens in vivo. However, here, two proteins that show altered or impaired translocation in vivo are able to be assembled/translocated in vitro almost as efficiently as 'wild-type' proteins. Do these results mean that the in vitro system does not accurately reflect what is happening in vivo? The authors touch on this point only briefly in their discussion – I think this point should be expanded a bit.</p><p>Minor criticisms:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors discuss autotransporter proteins as if they were all virulence factors. Although most that have been studied do play roles in pathogenesis, analyses have been skewed by the fact that most bacteria in which AT proteins have been studied are pathogens. It is highly likely that many, if not most, AT proteins perform other functions (and hence the authors' work is more broadly relevant than suggested by the Introduction).</p><p>2) The authors should add a reference to the new paper by Noinaj et al in Structure.

We found that only one EspP derivative that was assembled in the in vitro assay shows impaired translocation in vivo [EspP(HA-714+β)TEV586]. The second protein that the reviewer alludes to (the RD-EspP chimera) is assembled efficiently in vivo. We have now revised the text to clarify this point. Although we discuss the behavior of EspP(HA-714+β)TEV586 in the in vitro assay, we really do not know why the linker insertion exerts a stronger effect on the assembly of this EspP derivative in vivo. Of course our assay, like any in vitro assay, may not perfectly replicate all aspects of a biological process. As we note, our results suggest that a factor (or perhaps an activity of SurA or the Bam complex) that promotes the dissociation of EspP from the molecular chaperone Skp in vivo may be missing from the current assay system.</p><p><italic>Minor criticisms:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the Introduction, the authors discuss autotransporter proteins as if they were all virulence factors.
