However, other animals and competing plants can intercept HIPVs for their own use, and it remains unclear whether HIPVs serve as an indirect defense by increasing fitness for the emitting plant. In a 2-year field study, HIPV-emitting <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants produced twice as many buds and flowers as HIPV-silenced plants, but only when native <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predators reduced herbivore loads (by 50%) on HIPV-emitters.

A better understanding of the different mechanisms used by wild plants to deter herbivores will help to increase crop production without harming the environment.</p><p>Plants use both direct and indirect methods to fend off herbivores. Direct defense methods include the production of chemicals that are toxic to herbivores or give them indigestion, and the growth of sticky prickles and spines that can injure or kill the herbivore. Indirect defense methods, on the other hand, generally rely on the plant attracting organisms that are either predators or parasites of the herbivore.</p><p>Plants produce odors known as herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that are thought to offer indirect defense against herbivores by betraying their location to predators and parasites. However, HIPVs also influence other members of the ecological community, sometimes in ways that are detrimental to plants. Moreover, despite 30 years of research, no study has demonstrated that HIPVs increase the fitness of a plant, so it is unclear what they have evolved to do.</p><p>Now, a 2-year field study by Schuman <italic>et al.</italic> has shown plants that emit green leaf volatiles (which are a type of HIPV) produce twice as many buds and flowers—a measure of fitness—as plants that have been genetically engineered not to emit green leaf volatiles. This study was conducted with <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, which is a wild tobacco plant that is often targeted by <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, a type of moth that is also known as the tobacco hornworm. Green leaf volatiles only increased plants' fitness when various species of <italic>Geocoris</italic>—a bug that preys on <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>—reduced the number of herbivores by a factor of two. This is the first evidence that HIPVs offer indirect defense against herbivores.</p><p>Schuman <italic>et al.</italic> also studied the effects of molecules called protease inhibitors that are thought to function as direct defenses by making it difficult for herbivores to digest plants. They found that the ability to produce protease inhibitors did not increase the fitness of plants under herbivore attack; however, tobacco hornworms that had been fed plants containing protease inhibitors were found to be more sluggish in response to attack, which suggests that protease inhibitors can enhance the indirect defenses of plants. The results suggest that employing both direct and indirect defenses—such as a combination of biological pesticides and genetic engineering to produce both HIPVs and protease inhibitors—is the best approach for defending agricultural plants against pests.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00007.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00007.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Nicotiana attenuata</kwd><kwd>herbivory-induced plant volatile</kwd><kwd>plant-predator interaction</kwd><kwd>green leaf volatile</kwd><kwd>trypsin protease inhibitor</kwd><kwd>indirect defense</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><name><surname>Barthel</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A 2-year field study has demonstrated that volatile compounds produced by plants when they are attacked by herbivores act as defenses by attracting predators to the herbivores and increasing the reproduction of the plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant indirect defenses are traits that disable or remove herbivores by manipulating tri-trophic interactions to the advantage of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Price et al., 1980</xref>). They attract and inform the third trophic level, predators or parasitoids, resulting in increased attacks on herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turlings and Wäckers, 2004</xref>). Indirect defenses are widespread and include domatia, extrafloral nectar, and food bodies which provide shelter and nutrition for predators and parasitoids, as well as herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which convey information about feeding herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heil, 2008</xref>). Field studies with the native tobacco <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, a desert annual, and with maize have shown that HIPVs can reduce herbivore loads by 24% to more than 90%, by increasing both predation and parasitization of herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>) and deterring herbivore oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>If HIPVs really function as defenses, they should increase Darwinian fitness, defined as successful reproduction, for plants under herbivore attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karban and Baldwin, 1997</xref>). But because HIPVs can be perceived by many other members of the ecological community—from herbivores, pollinators, predators and parasitoids to competing or parasitic plants—it is not clear whether HIPVs increase plant fitness in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dicke and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kessler and Heil, 2011</xref>). The field studies described above have either spanned too short a time to reveal Darwinian fitness benefits, or have not reported fitness data at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). Two laboratory studies showed that parasitization of herbivores can increase plant reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Loon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoballah and Turlings, 2001</xref>), but the parasitization in these studies was not mediated by HIPVs. Hence three decades after their description, it remains unclear whether HIPVs are really indirect defenses.</p><p>Long-term field studies comparing HIPV-emitting vs -deficient plants are required in order to demonstrate a defensive function for HIPVs. Experimental additions of pure volatiles or mixes to plants growing in nature has worked well to test short-term effects of specific compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>), but only endogenously produced HIPV emissions can ensure specific, lasting and consistent differences under field conditions. Most evidence for the utility of HIPVs comes from studies in which predators and parasitoids learn to associate HIPVs with prey; naïve predators and parasitoids are just as likely to respond to HIPVs as not to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Hare, 2009</xref>). Thus the inducibility of HIPV emission, which ensures association with herbivore feeding, is likely essential for HIPV function, but it is difficult to engineer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kos et al., 2009</xref>). Engineered constitutive HIPV emissions have been used, either on predators and parasitoids trained to associate target volatiles with prey in short-term laboratory experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kappers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnee et al., 2006</xref>), or in set-ups in which target volatiles are always associated with prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>). When plants are engineered constitutively to emit HIPVs, they no longer provide accurate information about the location of feeding herbivores, and predators will not associate these signals with prey in nature. Genetically silencing the biosynthesis of HIPVs, however, permits naturally inducible wild-type (WT) plants to serve as HIPV emitters, for comparison with transformed lines lacking specific volatile components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skibbe et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, field experiments that manipulate the production of HIPVs which not only attract the third trophic level, but also influence the second trophic level (e.g., as feeding stimulants and host location cues), require additional experimental manipulations to preserve the plant-herbivore part of the tritrophic interaction.</p><p>When HIPVs do attract the third trophic level, how can herbivores adapt? Many herbivores can outgrow their vulnerability to predators and parasitoids, but plant direct defenses can slow herbivore growth and prolong vulnerability as postulated by the slow growth-high mortality hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benrey and Denno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaplan and Thaler, 2011</xref>). The solanaceous specialists <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> and <italic>M. quinquemaculata</italic> (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) are resistant to the potent alkaloid toxin nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wink and Theile, 2002</xref>), but sensitive to the nutritional value of plant tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zavala and Baldwin, 2004</xref>). Non-toxic protease inhibitor (PI) proteins, which inhibit protein digestion and thus decrease the availability of organic nitrogen in the form of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zavala et al., 2008</xref>), are widespread in flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>), and trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs) slow the growth of <italic>M. sexta</italic> on <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zavala et al., 2008</xref>). However, herbivores can overcome PIs by producing insensitive or desensitized proteases, inactivating or degrading PIs, eating more plant tissue, and eating more nutritious young tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer and Bergelson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zavala et al., 2008</xref>). In the latter two cases, PIs could reduce plant fitness. Although TPI-producing <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants produce more seeds than TPI-deficient plants when attacked by <italic>M. sexta</italic> under controlled glasshouse conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zavala and Baldwin, 2004</xref>), whether TPIs function as a direct defense in nature is unknown.</p><p>We tested the hypotheses that HIPVs and TPIs defend plants in nature by increasing herbivore predation and thereby plant Darwinian fitness. To do so, we monitored the performance, predation and mortality of <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. (<italic>M. sexta</italic> and <italic>M. quinquemaculata</italic>) on wild-type <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants and RNAi transformed lines silenced for the production either of a specific group of HIPVs, or of TPIs, and compared the resulting plant reproductive output in terms of bud and flower production (we are not permitted to allow transgenic plants to disperse ripe seed). Because <italic>N. attenuata</italic> is an annual, opportunistic out-crosser, seeds are produced within one growing season, mostly from fertilization via self-pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sime and Baldwin, 2003</xref>), and we can relate bud and flower production to lifetime seed production, which is commonly accepted as a measure of Darwinian fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Loon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoballah and Turlings, 2001</xref>).We hypothesized that HIPVs would increase plant reproduction by increasing predation of herbivores, and that TPIs alone would not increase reproduction under herbivore attack, but would either increase predation or increase herbivores' susceptibility to predators. We then assembled a toolbox of wild-type and transgenic lines chosen to test these hypotheses.</p><p>We chose a genotype of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> native to the Great Basin Desert of southwestern Utah. In many years, <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. larvae cause the most defoliation of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>) and thus the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> 'UT' genotype is likely adapted to defend against <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. Eggs and young larvae of <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. are predated by <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. (big-eyed bugs) which occur naturally in the Utah habitat and are attracted to components of <italic>N. attenuata</italic>'s HIPV bouquet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skibbe et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, Utah <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predators are attracted to the sesquiterpene (<italic>E</italic>)-α-bergamotene as well as green leaf volatiles (fatty acid-derived C<sub>6</sub> aldehydes, alcohols and esters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuman et al., 2009</xref>). Green leaf volatiles, or GLVs, can be silenced via a single upstream 13-lipoxygenase, Na<italic>LOX2</italic>, which specifically supplies lipid hydroperoxides for their production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allmann et al., 2010</xref>). Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage, the oral secretions (OS) of <italic>M. sexta</italic> convert 3-(<italic>Z</italic>)-GLVs to the 2-(<italic>E</italic>)-structures, resulting in greater <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predation than the damage-induced (<italic>Z</italic>):(<italic>E</italic>) ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). GLVs are released immediately upon damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>) and may therefore be a 'first line of defense'.</p><p>Like GLVs, many other HIPVs are also released after mechanical damage, but change in amount or ratio upon herbivory, and thus GLVs mirror the functional complexity of the total HIPV blend. Furthermore, GLVs prime or directly regulate responses in neighboring plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paschold et al., 2006</xref>), attract herbivores as well as predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>), and are important cues for pollinating and ovipositing moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Moraes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fraser et al., 2003</xref>), thus performing several roles which may harm or benefit plant fitness in addition to their role in attracting predators. Perhaps most significantly, GLVs also stimulate <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. feeding, and silencing plant GLV production results in reduced herbivore damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halitschke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meldau et al., 2009</xref>). All these qualities made the manipulation of GLV emissions an ideal means to test rigorously the fitness consequences of HIPV emissions and to evaluate whether these emissions can truly be considered defensive.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GLV and TPI production are reduced or eliminated in transformed lines</title><p>We chose a line of ir<italic>PI</italic> plants with no detectable TPI activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007</xref>), and a line of ir<italic>LOX2</italic> plants with GLV emissions &lt;20% of WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allmann et al., 2010</xref>); non-target defense metabolites are not affected in either line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>), including emission of (<italic>E</italic>)-α-bergamotene measured in a glasshouse characterization of all lines prior to field release (see 'Non-target metabolites are not affected in ir<italic>LOX2</italic>, hemi-ir<italic>LOX2</italic> or ir<italic>PI</italic> plants').

For egg predation assays, a wild <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. larva was enclosed on a nearby leaf to ensure continual GLV emission: a clip cage was closed around the larva to make it inaccessible to <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predators. Predation was monitored mornings and evenings. Larvae were considered to be predated when either the larva was missing over multiple days, but clear <italic>Manduca</italic> spp. feeding damage was present, or when the predated larval carcass was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Mortality was defined as the total number of missing larvae. Eggs were considered predated when the eggshell was empty but intact except for a small hole which characterizes the typical damage caused by <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. feeding; eggs occasionally collapse during <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predation, but collapsed eggs were not counted unless the eggs were mostly or fully empty and with a visible hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>GLV supplementation</title><p>During infestation M2, GLVs were added back to ir<italic>LOX2</italic> and hemi-ir<italic>LOX2</italic> headspaces by placing a cotton swab adjacent to the <italic>M. sexta</italic>-infested leaf and adding ca. 20 µL of lanolin paste, measured with a seed spoon, containing a mix of pure GLVs representative of the <italic>M. sexta</italic>-fed headspace and dissolved in hexane (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>) to the cotton swab. Cotton swabs bearing ca. 20 µL of lanolin paste with hexane as a control were placed next to <italic>M. sexta</italic>-infested leaves of WT and ir<italic>PI</italic> plants. Lanolin pastes were regularly refreshed by adding 20 µL in the early afternoon and in the morning. Placing GLVs next to, rather than on the leaf ensured that the supplemented headspace would not be altered by plant metabolism, and that we could terminate the supplementation by removing the cotton swabs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title><italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. counts</title><p>Field plots were monitored daily for <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. presence during the experiments in 2010 and 2011; both <italic>G. pallens</italic> and <italic>G. punctipes</italic> were present in 2011, but most individuals observed on and around plants were <italic>G. pallens</italic>. Soon after the first <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. sightings in May 2011 (before the first infestation, M2), <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. populations in the immediate vicinity of experimental plants were monitored every 2–3 days by counting individuals. Counts were conducted during the main period of <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. activity in the early afternoon, by at least two observers in parallel, in order to complete the count around all <italic>Manduca</italic> spp.-infested and control plants within 20–30 min. Each observer proceeded by looking at a focal plant and its immediate vicinity for 15 s and then quickly inspecting the rosette leaves; all <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. adults and nymphs seen on, under, or within 5 cm around the rosette of the plant during this time were counted. Observers moved in synchrony with each other from one end of the field plot to the other, in this way counting predators around plants which had not yet been disturbed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Plant growth and reproduction</title><p>Plant size (rosette diameter, stem length and branching) was monitored at the end of infestation M1 in 2010 and from the beginning of infestation M2 in 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>): rosette diameter was measured as the maximum diameter found by gently laying a ruler over the rosette; stem length was measured from the base of the stem to the tip of the apical inflorescence by placing a ruler beside the stem; and all side branches 5 cm or longer were counted. Reproductive output was monitored by counting the number of closed flowers removed every 2–3 days (before they opened) from the beginning of flowering, and by counting numbers of closed flowers and buds 2 mm or larger at the end of infestation M1 in 2010, and during all infestations in 2011. All growth and reproduction data were analyzed for differences in control versus <italic>M. sexta</italic>-infested plants within each genotype (statistics <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Because size-matched plants had been planted over one week in 2011, growth and reproduction data from plants in 2011 were organized by the number of days since planting for comparison between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Removal of flowers during infestations M1 and M3, and of reproductive meristems prior to infestation M4</title><p>Flowers were removed and counted periodically over the first 10 days of infestation M1 and during infestation M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4 and 6</xref>, statistics <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), in order to track plant reproduction while avoiding ripe seed capsules: the distribution of ripe seed is not permitted for genetically modified plants. For infestation M4 in 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), instead of regularly removing flowers, we removed all reproductive meristems by cutting inflorescences, which contained mostly buds, at their base, so that we would be able to follow a new set of reproductive meristems through to seed set without incurring ripe seed. Because plants were matched prior to M4 and had the same number of buds and of side branches (which usually terminate in inflorescences) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, see 'Discussion'), all plants were similarly affected by the removal of reproductive meristems.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Herbivore damage and plant health</title><p>Photographs were taken of entire plants and <italic>M. sexta</italic>-damaged leaves during infestations M2 and M3 in 2011. Damage caused by <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae was rated from photographs by an independent observer with no knowledge of plant identity. Total percent canopy damage due to <italic>M. sexta</italic> was rated as 1, 2, 3, or 4 using the damage index in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>We monitored herbivore attack to determine whether GLV-silenced plants suffered different amounts of herbivore damage, which could influence fitness measurements. The naturally occurring herbivore community on plants in 2010 and 2011 comprised mirids (<italic>Tupiocoris notatus</italic>) and noctuid larvae; in 2011 grasshoppers (<italic>Trimerotropis</italic> spp.) and flea beetles (<italic>Epitrix</italic> spp.) were also present. Total canopy damage due to herbivores occurring naturally on the field plot was quantified prior to the infestations in 2010 and 2011 and again during infestation M3 in 2011. Damage was calculated by identifying damage from specific herbivores according to their characteristic feeding patterns, counting the number of leaves per plant (small leaves were counted as 1/5 to 1/2 of a leaf based on leaf area and large leaves were counted as 1 leaf), estimating the total percentage of leaf area damage due to each herbivore, and dividing the total leaf area damage from each herbivore by the total number of leaves. Leaf area damage was estimated in categories of 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and so on, in steps of 5%. All such damage estimates were made by MCS or KB, who first practiced quantifying damage together until they consistently arrived at the same numbers.</p><p>As part of matching plants prior to infestation M4 in 2011, plant health was rated on a scale of 1 (dead) to 5 (healthy) using the index in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Fisher's exact tests were conducted using a macro (J H Macdonald, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statfishers.html">http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statfishers.html</ext-link>) for Excel (Microsoft). All other statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 17.0 (IBM). Count data were analyzed either by Fisher's exact tests (independent values) or by Friedman tests (repeated measures). Levene's test for homogeneity of variance was performed prior to all t-tests and ANOVAs and when necessary, data were log<sub>2</sub> transformed (volatile and transcript data), square root transformed (count data) or arcsin transformed (herbivore damage data) to meet requirements for homogeneity of variance. Parametric data were compared using ANOVAs, MANOVAs, or repeated-measure ANOVAs followed by Scheffe <italic>post hoc</italic> tests. If variance was not homogeneous following transformation, data were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests (for multiple comparisons) or Mann-Whitney U-tests (for two-way comparisons) and Bonferroni p-value corrections were used to correct for nonparametric multiple comparisons. For Kruskal-Wallis tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests, a Monte Carlo algorithm was used with 10,000 permutations and a 95% confidence level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

The following individual(s) responsible for the peer review of your submission want(s) their identity to be known: Detlef Weigel (reviewing editor); Joerg Bohlmann (reviewer).</p><p>We are happy to tell you that a revised manuscript shall be acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>. Here are the comments:</p><p>The hypothesis outlined in the title of this paper, that indirect defences in the form of herbivory-induced volatiles increase plant fitness, is being continuously discussed in the literature, without there being much definitive evidence for this phenomenon occurring in nature. It is a difficult hypothesis to test, but the authors of this work make a big step toward providing an answer.</p><p>In field studies over two seasons (with both wild and lab-reared predators) complemented with lab experiments, the authors examined how emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and a protease inhibitor (TPI) that reduces digestibility of plant tissue affect herbivore growth and plant fitness, as measured by flower buds and seed set in tobacco. The experimental approach was to reduce VOCs by silencing the <italic>LOX2</italic> gene, and TPI activity by silencing the PI gene.</p><p>The authors clearly show that plants that emit less VOCs attract fewer <italic>Geocoris</italic> predators to <italic>Manduca</italic> herbivores (Fig. 2), and that <italic>Manduca</italic> mortality is reduced in the presence of <italic>Geocoris</italic> (Fig. 3A). The result is that fewer flowers and flower buds are produced, but only in the presence of <italic>Geocoris</italic> (Fig. 3B).</p><p>The authors are to be commended for reporting a comprehensive set of measurements, including ones that are not easily explained or fit the hypotheses examined. This makes unfortunately in several places for difficult reading. In addition, the paper is extremely densely written and difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with the research program of the authors. To make the content of the work more accessible, the paper should be presented with separate sections for introduction, results, and discussion, and subsections for the results. In addition, the supplementary figures as well as the supplementary narrative should be integrated into the main text, and the data should be better and more consistently presented in the figures. For example, the colour code for different genotypes in Fig. S1-3 and 6A,B should also be applied in all other figures.</p><p>Some essential information is only mentioned in passing, e.g., that homozygous ir<italic>LOX2</italic> lines “… did not suffer reduced growth or reproduction from <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> feeding … and that they were too small …”. This must be explained, and better justification must be provided for focussing on the hemizygous lines, especially because it is not entirely clear how the effects on VOCs compare between hemi- and homozygous plants.</p><p>Other important points: (i) The statement in the Introduction (beginning “Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage…”) must be at least changed to: “… the oral secretions of <italic>Manduca</italic> convert 3-(Z)-GLVs to the 2-(E)-structures, …” (This is because this is a rearrangement, not an isomerisation). (ii) The authors should consider whether the experiments in Fig. 4 regarding the effects of TPI on <italic>M. sexta</italic> behaviour, though interesting, distract from the rest of the work. Perhaps they could be omitted from this manuscript?</p><p>A final remark: it is a pity that, because of global attitudes to genetically modified plants, the authors could not evaluate ripe seeds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00007.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer comments are in italics.</p><p><italic>The authors are to be commended for reporting a comprehensive set of measurements, including ones that are not easily explained or fit the hypotheses examined.

In particular, we have expanded the explanation of the data behind new Figures 8 and 9 (infestations M1 and M4).</p><p>We have also implemented consistent color codes for the genotypes, and consistent pattern codes for control vs <italic>Manduca</italic> spp.-infested or W+OS-treated plants, and a more consistent format for the figures. We have also merged some figures which were formerly separate but described the same results or sets of assays.</p><p>A note: in the interest of clarity, we now include reports of statistical analyses in the text and not only in figure captions or tables. Perhaps it could be considered to convert these in-text statistical reports to mouse-over hypertext in the online version of the paper, since the long parantheticals interrupt the flow of the text.</p><p><italic>Some essential information is only mentioned in passing, e.g., that homozygous irLOX2 lines “… did not suffer reduced growth or reproduction from Manduca sexta feeding … and that they were too small …”. This must be explained, and better justification must be provided for focussing on the hemizygous lines, especially because it is not entirely clear how the effects on VOCs compare between hemi- and homozygous plants (see minor comments below)</italic>.</p><p>We have tried to clarify our description of the GLV pools and emissions from the ir<italic>LOX2</italic> and hemi-ir<italic>LOX2</italic> plants. It is clearly stated in the Materials and Methods and in the Results that the hemi-ir<italic>LOX2</italic> plants contain an inactive ir<italic>PI</italic> construct, and the possible explanations for this construct's inactivity are discussed in a new section of the discussion, “WT <italic>levels of TPIs in hemi-ir<italic>LOX2</italic> plants are likely due to gene dosage effects”</italic>.</p><p><italic>Other important points: (i) The statement in the Introduction (beginning “Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage…”) must be at least changed to: “… the oral secretions of <italic>Manduca</italic> convert 3-(Z)-GLVs to the 2-(E)-structures, …” (This is because this is a rearrangement, not an isomerisation)</italic>.</p><p>We have changed this sentence to “Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage, the oral secretions (OS) of <italic>M. sexta</italic> convert 3-(Z)-GLVs to the 2-(E)-structures, resulting in greater <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predation than the damage-induced (Z):(E) ratio”.</p><p><italic>(ii) The authors should consider whether the experiments in Fig. 4 regarding the effects of TPI on M. sexta behaviour, though interesting, distract from the rest of the work. Perhaps they could be omitted from this manuscript</italic>?</p><p>We recognize that this is a long, complex, and data-heavy manuscript. However, we feel that the behavior data is essential to the story, because it is the only effect we found of TPIs, and it is a novel effect which is highly relevant for the efficiency of indirect defense. Both because of the experimental designs presented in the paper, and because of the implications of these results, we feel they belong as part of this story. Also, if these data were not included, we would have to re-analyze all experiments without the ir<italic>PI</italic> line, which we feel is artificial. The removal of these data would only save one figure and 3.5 paragraphs of text.</p><p><italic>A final remark: it is a pity that, because of global attitudes to genetically modified plants, the authors could not evaluate ripe seeds</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers' sympathy on this point!</p></body></sub-article></article>
