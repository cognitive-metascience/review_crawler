Here, we model the structure of the Chd1 protein in solution and when bound to nucleosomes. In the apo state, the DNA-binding domain contacts the edge of the nucleosome while in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ADP-beryllium fluoride, we observe additional interactions between the ATPase domain and the adjacent DNA gyre 1.5 helical turns from the dyad axis of symmetry. Binding in this conformation involves unravelling the outer turn of nucleosomal DNA and requires substantial reorientation of the DNA-binding domain with respect to the ATPase domains. The orientation of the DNA-binding domain is mediated by sequences in the N-terminus and mutations to this part of the protein have positive and negative effects on Chd1 activity. These observations indicate that the unfavorable alignment of C-terminal DNA-binding region in solution contributes to an auto-inhibited state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22510.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22510.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Chd1</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaramoorthy</surname><given-names>Ramasubramanian</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Amanda L</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Vijender</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiechens</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name><name><surname>Owen-Hughes</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097945/B/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaramoorthy</surname><given-names>Ramasubramanian</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Amanda L</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Vijender</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiechens</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name><name><surname>Owen-Hughes</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099149/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaramoorthy</surname><given-names>Ramasubramanian</given-names></name><name><surname>El-Mkami</surname><given-names>Hassane</given-names></name><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name><name><surname>Owen-Hughes</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaramoorthy</surname><given-names>Ramasubramanian</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Amanda L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiechens</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name><name><surname>Owen-Hughes</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 380-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Amanda L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural models of the chromatin remodeling enzyme Chd1 in solution and when bound to chromatin indicate that conformational changes to both the enzyme and the nucleosome occur upon nucleotide dependent engagement.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleosomes are not distributed randomly over the genomes of eukaryotes, but in general are aligned with respect to regulatory elements. In addition, the spacing between nucleosomes is also not random, with distinct nucleosome-to-nucleosome distances evident in different tissues and in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Holde, 1988</xref>). Abnormal inter-nucleosome spacing has been associated with increased intragenic transcription, and changes to nucleosome positioning at promoters results in changes to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raveh-Sadka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smolle et al., 2012</xref>). ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes act to organise nucleosomes over genomes with partial redundancy. For example, the Isw1 and Chd1 enzymes both play a major role in positioning nucleosomes over coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radman-Livaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These enzymes belong to an extended family of Snf2-related chromatin proteins that can act to reconfigure DNA-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>), with many acting on nucleosomes. This family of proteins share an ATPase module comprised of two RecA-related domains capable of ATP-dependent DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). The ATPase module is not found in isolation but is associated with accessory domains both within the same polypeptide and as components of multi-subunit complexes. These accessory domains allow Snf2-related proteins to mediate different types of alteration to nucleosome structure or act on other protein-DNA complexes. For example, the Mot1 protein contains 16 HEAT repeats that facilitate engagement with the TBP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Of all the Snf2 proteins, structural information is richest for the Chd1 proteins. The crystal structure of the ATPase domain in association with the N-terminal tandem chromodomains has been determined by crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). In this structure, the chromodomains impede access to a putative DNA-binding surface between the RecA domains, suggesting that reconfiguration is required in order for the RecA domains to engage productively with DNA. Supporting this, mutation of the chromodomains at the chromo-RecA interface increased the ATPase activity of Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). The concept that Snf2 proteins are subject to negative autoregulation is also supported by recent findings from the related ISWI proteins. Mutations in a region N-terminal to the ATPase domains of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI protein increase ATP-hydrolysis and remodelling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the conformation of this region changes during ISWI action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>). The Chd1 protein has a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) that is made up of SANT and SLIDE domains that are also present in ISWI proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grüne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). This second DNA-binding interface is required for efficient nucleosome repositioning both in the context of Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>) and ISWI proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grüne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hota et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, substitution of this domain with a heterologous DBD directs nucleosome positioning towards the DNA bound by this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Directed crosslinking has provided powerful insight as to the mode of interaction between remodelling enzymes and nucleosomes. Application of this approach to study the ISW2 enzyme showed that the ATPase domain engages with nucleosomal DNA near super helical location (SHL) 2, two turns from the dyad axis of symmetry. In the case of ISW2, the DNA-binding accessory subunits are observed to engage linker DNA extending up to 50 bp from the edge of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kagalwala et al., 2004</xref>). In the case of ISWI containing enzymes, it has been shown that two complexes can engage a single nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Racki et al., 2009</xref>) and this can facilitate the bidirectional movement of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blosser et al., 2009</xref>). Single-molecule fluorescence measurements have been used to monitor the transit of DNA through nucleosomes during the course of repositioning. These studies show that DNA is removed from nucleosomes in kinetically coupled bursts of 3 bp that comprise of shorter single base increments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deindl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Existing structural information for chromatin remodelling enzymes is largely limited to subdomains. Less is known about the putatively unstructured regions connecting these domains and how these domains are oriented with respect to each other. Here, we investigate the conformation of the ATPase Chd1 in solution and when engaged with nucleosomes. We find that there is a significant conformational change upon binding to nucleosomes. We obtain evidence to suggest that this change is limiting for Chd1 activity and contributes to maintenance of Chd1 in an auto-inhibited state. Regulation at this level provides a means of directing the action of remodelling ATPases towards specific aspects of nucleosome structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Use of small-angle x-ray scattering to study the solution structure of Chd1</title><p>We first sought to study the conformation of the Chd1 protein in solution. This is assisted by the fact that the structures of the chromoATPase domains and DBD have been determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). The linkage between these domains, however, is unclear as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. To help characterise the structure of intact Chd1, a series of fragments of Chd1 were expressed and purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then collected small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for each of these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For each fragment, the hydrodynamic radius of the protein fragment and molecular weight in solution was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The values obtained are consistent with Chd1 being predominantly monomeric in solution. Volumes consistent with each scattering curve were calculated <italic>ab initio</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These volumes are consistent with the known structural features of Chd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For example, the DBD can be docked within the volume obtained for this fragment of the protein and the chromoATPase domains within the volumes obtained for fragments that include this region. The volumes for the smaller fragments can be arranged within those of the larger fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicates that the DBD and N-terminal 133 residues contribute to the protrusion adjacent to one of the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterising the solution structure of Chd1 by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The overall structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Chd1 molecule.

To obtain higher resolution models we used site directed spin labelling and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) measurements to characterise the Chd1 protein. To do this, we first removed the six native cysteine residues converting them to serine. Importantly, this cys-free mutant protein displays nucleosome remodelling activity comparable to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Pairs of cysteine residues were then introduced at specific sites in Chd1 1–1305 via site-directed mutagenesis and these sites were then labelled with the thiol-reactive reporter (1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSL). The interaction between attached MTSL groups can be measured by PELDOR and used to extract distance information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pannier et al., 2000</xref>). To validate our approach, we first probed residues within the chromoATPase domains for which there is good structural information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The raw dipolar evolution signal for each pair of labelled sites was subject to background correction and Tikhonov regularisation to obtain a distance distribution describing the positions of the labels as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>). This experimentally determined distance distribution was then compared to the predicted distribution based upon the calculated ensembles of spin label locations at each labelling site. The experimentally measured distances correlate with the predicted distances derived from the chromoATPase crystal structure (3MWY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>) to within a few angstroms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the structure of the chromoATPase domains is similar in solution to that observed in the crystal structure.</p><p>In order to study the orientation of the DBD with respect to the chromoATPase domains, a series of labelling sites were selected in these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). A total of 16 distinct distance measurements were made between different pairwise combinations of these sites. Measurements between locations within the DBD and ATPase lobe 1 gave rise to several well defined measurements where an oscillation is evident in the background corrected signal and a single major distance distribution can be extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, measurements between ATPase lobe 2 and the DBD were in general less well defined, often giving rise to multiple distance distributions with similar probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This is likely to arise from increased dynamics between these domains. Similarly, measurements between chromodomains and the DBD did not provide tight single distance distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The most prominent distribution of distances for each pair of labelling sites (Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>) was used as a constraint in two separate modelling approaches. In the first approach, a conjugated gradient minimisation was carried with centres of the modelled distribution of the nitroxide atoms NOE constraints in Xplor-NIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwieters et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the second, TagDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) was used to compute all geometrically possible docking poses between the domains and evaluated those compatible with experimental distance constraints. The docking poses that are consistent with the constraints are then further refined. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In both Xplor and TagDock approaches, an ensemble of solutions with RMSD 2.8 and 1.6 Å, respectively, were obtained. In addition, the average of the ensemble solutions obtained using the two approaches has an RMS deviation of 2.4 Å. The final averaged solution obtained by TagDock-based modelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) was used to compare experimentally measured distances from those predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Most of the distances derived from measurements fit the model with a few angstroms deviation. The PELDOR-derived model is compatible with the volume envelopes obtained from the SAXS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>). The SAXS pattern computed by program CRYSOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Svergun et al., 1995</xref>) from the atomistic EPR-based model of Chd1 yields a poor fit to the experimental scattering data from the full length protein with discrepancy χ<sup>2</sup>= 11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B</xref>). However, this misfit is to be expected given that significant parts of the polypeptide (174 and 36 residues at the N- and C-termini, respectively, and a 82-residue linker between chromoATPase and DBD domains) are missing in the Chd1 model. To address this, the program BUNCH was used to reconstruct probable configurations of these missing portions in the form of dummy residue (DR) chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005</xref>). The addition of the missing loops significantly improved the agreement between the experimental and the calculated data with χ<sup>2</sup> improving from 11.5 to 2.08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A model for the solution structure of Chd1 based on pulsed EPR measurements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of DNA-binding domain and (<bold>B</bold>) chromoATPase domains of Chd1 shown in cartoon representation.

However, our PELDOR distance measurements clearly show that the DBD is generally constrained with respect to the chromoATPase region. The best explanation for this is that one or more of the regions of Chd1 for which there is no structural information interacts with the DBD and constrain its position. As a means of identifying putative regions that may interact with the DBD, we performed chemical crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometry using the amine-reactive crosslinker BS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). BS3 has a length of 11.4 Å and so it crosslinks regions of the protein that are relatively close in space. Consistent with this, we identify a number of crosslinks within regions of Chd1 known to be close to one another based on existing structural data, such as between the ATPase lobes and the chromodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, several crosslinks between the N-terminal region of Chd1 and the DBD are also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting these two regions are close to one another in the intact protein.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The N-terminus of Chd1 mediates interactions with the DNA-binding domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sites covalently linked by the crosslinker BS<sup>3</sup> were identified by mass spectrometry and are represented graphically using a plot generated with Xvis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>).

We observe that the isolated recombinant DBD is still able to form an intermolecular complex with a truncated form of Chd1 (residues 1–1010) lacking the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, when the N-terminal 133 amino acids are removed from Chd1 this complex with the DBD is no longer formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that contacts between the N-terminus of Chd1 directly contribute to the association with the DBD. To gain further insight into this, we compared the N-terminal sequences of Chd1 proteins across different yeast species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There is considerable conservation within the 133 amino acids N-terminal to the chromodomains and this includes a tract of acidic amino acids (57-88) followed by a positively charged region extending from 90 to 120. Indeed, when we delete just residues 57–88 the interaction with the DBD is also lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, this acidic patch appears to play an important role in mediating interactions with the DBD.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mutations to the Chd1 N-terminus have positive and negative effects on activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of Chd1 proteins from the indicated yeast species indicates that sequences in the N-terminal region are conserved.

To assess the contribution of the N-terminal regions to Chd1 activity, mutant Chd11-1305 proteins were expressed in which these regions were mutated. In addition to deletion of the conserved acidic region amino acids 57–88, an adjacent conserved basic region amino acids 90–120 and the entire N-terminus were also deleted. The ability of these proteins to reposition nucleosomes initially located near the ends of DNA fragments towards the centre of the fragments was assessed. Deletion of the acidic patch was observed to increase nucleosome sliding 2-fold, while deletion of the basic region shows no sliding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The ability of alterations within the N-terminus to either increase or reduce activity was born out by additional mutations. Deletion of the entire N-terminal 133 amino acids increased activity 1.5-fold (data not shown), while deletion of the extreme N-terminal 35 residues reduced activity 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Triple mutation of three conserved lysine residues within the basic region resulted in a greater than 10-fold reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These mutants also affected ATPase activity, with reduced or increased activity generally correlating with nucleosome sliding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Two mutants had such low activity that kinetic parameters could not be calculated. Amongst the others, Km and Kcat were affected. Reductions in Kcat were observed for the inhibitory mutations indicating functional interplay with the ATPase domain. The increased activity of Chd1 △ 57–88 arose primarily from an increased Kcat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, this mutant formed complexes with nucleosomes in the apo state more effectively as detected in gel shift assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The Chd1 △ 90–120, △ 1–35 and R20-21A mutations that strongly reduced activity also bound nucleosomes weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), while deletion of residues 1–35 enhanced nucleosome binding but was deleterious to enzymatic activity. As both the Chd1 △ 57–88 and △ 1–133 deletions that increase activity reduce association between the ATPase and DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we speculate that a more flexible linkage facilitates productive engagement with nucleosomes while inactivating mutations may orient these domains less favourably for full activity.</p><p>The enhancement of activity observed in Chd1 △ 57–88 is reminiscent of activating mutations observed in other chromatin remodelling ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate the consequences of this change in activity in vivo, full length Chd1 or Chd1 △ 57–88 were integrated into the <italic>CHD1</italic> locus of an <italic>isw1△chd1△</italic> mutant strain. In this strain, positioning of coding region nucleosomes is severely compromised and is partially restored when full length <italic>CHD1</italic> is reintegrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When <italic>chd1</italic> △ 57–88 is reintegrated, a nucleosomal oscillation is restored with slightly greater amplitude than the wild type. As the amplitude of the oscillation is dependent on Chd1, a greater amplitude is consistent with the increased activity observed in vitro. In addition, the maximal density of nucleosome dyads is offset downstream by four base pairs at nucleosome +3 and increments of approximately four base pairs at subsequent downstream nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with increased spacing between coding region nucleosomes with alignment to the transcriptional start site (TSS) retained. Although this is a small difference, nucleosome spacing is distinct in different yeast species and precisely determined by <italic>trans</italic> acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes and Rando, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>). The observation that Chd1 △ 57–88 directs increased inter-nucleosome spacing could result if the deletion affects the ‘measurement’ of linker length by the enzyme. Alternatively, it could arise from the increased activity of this protein. To test whether the total amount of Chd1 activity affected inter-nucleosome spacing full length Chd1 was introduced on a higher copy number plasmid, resulting in a &gt; 3 – fold increase in expression as assessed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The alignment of nucleosomal reads to the genome from this strain indicates a slightly greater increase in nucleosome spacing, approximately six base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Introduction of <italic>chd1</italic> △ 57–88 on the high copy pRS423 plasmid caused a further increase in spacing to approximately 26 base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). These observations are consistent with coding region internucleosome spacing being influenced by the level of Chd1 activity present. They also show that Chd1 can establish arrays of nucleosomes with a range of linker lengths in vivo. This differs from the fixed phasing observed in extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) but is consistent with variable spacing observed in newly replicated chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fennessy and Owen-Hughes, 2016</xref>). There are a number of potential explanations for this variable nucleosome spacing. It may result from competition between different enzymes involved in establishing nucleosome phasing in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>). From changes in nucleosome density following alteration of Chd1 activity in chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>). Or simply because increased nucleosome phasing activity drives nucleosomes apart via a statistically driven process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mavrich et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Chd1 △ 57–88 exhibits increased internucleosome spacing in vivo.</title><p>MNase-Seq was carried out on a <italic>chd1△isw1△</italic> strain transformed with <italic>CHD1</italic> and <italic>chd1△57-88</italic>(integrated at the <italic>CHD1</italic> locus) to obtain genome-wide nucleosome occupancy profiles.

Cryo-EM was adopted to achieve this and we initially studied the interaction of Chd1 1–1305 with nucleosomes with symmetrical 25 bp linkers using this approach. Under conditions favouring a 1:1 Chd1:nucleosome complex as assessed by native gel electrophoresis, a monodisperse distribution of particles was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Particles picked from micrographs could be assigned to 2D classes, some of which indicated the presence of an attachment adjacent to the nucleosome. Following 3D classification and refinement, a volume was obtained with a resolution of approximately 20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This volume is made up of separate areas into which our in solution model for Chd1 and a mononucleosome could be fitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A notable feature of this fit is that the engagement surface between Chd1 and the mononucleosome is minimal. It is highly unlikely that this involves the engagement of both the nucleic acid interacting region within the ATPase domains and the DBD itself. The simplest explanation for this mode of engagement would be that Chd1 is bound through interactions between the DBD and the ATPase domains are not engaged.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Interaction of Chd1 with nucleosomes in the APO state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative micrograph of frozen hydrated nucleosome-Chd1 apo complex.

This suggests a more compact structure. To characterise this further, complexes between Chd1 △ 57–88 and nucleosomes bearing an 11 bp asymmetric linker were assembled. This linker was selected to reduce the number of different conformations via which Chd1 could potentially interact via it’s DBD. These complexes were formed in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> which has been observed to stimulate binding of other enzymes to nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Racki et al., 2009</xref>). The complexes were subject to purification by gel filtration chromatography prior to preparation of grids and micrographs collected using a titan krios microscope equipped with a falcon II detector. 2450 movies were collected and from these 280,000 particles picked. 197,602 of these could be assigned into 2D classes that were consistent with a nucleosome with a bound attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). A first round of 3D classification resulted in the identification of four major classes three of which were similar. The particles from these classes were subjected to 3D auto refine. Subsequently, particle wise movie correction and particle re-centering was carried out and followed by a second round of 3D classification. Solvent masking was applied prior to the final refinement which resulted in a final volume with a resolution of 15 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A nucleosome can be docked within the volume and the DNA volume on the side of the nucleosome lacking linker provides a strong reference point to orient the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Docking of the DBD was more difficult most likely as it and the linker DNA it associates with can occupy different conformations.

Fluorescent dyes were introduced to DNA derived from the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence on either the forward (F) or reverse (R) strand at the indicated positions relative to the nucleosomal dyad axis of symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nucleosomes were assembled onto fragments with a six base pair extension to one side of the nucleosome and a 47 base pair linker on the other side 5’ labelled with biotin to provide a means of coupling to a streptavidin coated slide. When the FRET efficiency was measured between Alexa647 at F−71 and Tamra at F + 14 the mean FRET efficiency was 0.8 consistent with nucleosomal wrapping bringing these two sites into close proximity. When Chd1 1–1305 was added to these nucleosomes, no change in FRET efficiency was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This is consistent with the six base pair linker being too short to direct binding of the Chd1 DBD on this side of the nucleosome. In contrast, when nucleosomal DNA was labelled at F + 2 with Tamra and at R-66 with Alexa647, binding of Chd1 1–1305 in presence of AMP-PNP caused a reduction in the mean FRET efficiency from 0.5 to 0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This is consistent with Chd1 binding causing DNA nine base pairs from the edge of the nucleosome to dissociate in a fashion similar to that observed with Chd1 △57–88 by single particle cryo EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The larger change in FRET efficiency at this location made it more tractable to assess dynamic changes in FRET quantitatively. This made it possible to show that the reduction in FRET efficiency was more prominent in the presence of Chd1 1–1305 and AMP-PNP than it was in the presence of Chd1 1–1305 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Changes in FRET could be tracked on individual complexes either in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3C</xref>) or the presence of AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Statistical analysis of many single molecule traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3E</xref>) enabled kinetic parameters for this conformational change to be determined. In the presence of AMP-PNP, the unwrapped state was favored both as a result of an increased rate of transition to the unwrapped state and a reduction to the rate of DNA re-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3F</xref>). These observations indicate that DNA unwrapping occurs with a non-mutant form of Chd1 similar to that observed with Chd1 △57–88 by single particle EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, unwrapping is favoured in a nucleotide-bound state consistent with the distinct configurations of Chd1 observed in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and presence of ADP- BeF<sub>x</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The dissociation of the outer turn of DNA during the formation of this engaged complex may serve to prime the nucleosome for dynamics driven by ATP-hydrolysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we built models for the structure of the remodelling enzyme Chd1, both in free solution and when engaged with nucleosomes. We observe that Chd1 can engage with the nucleosome in different modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). It is likely that Chd1 can interact with nucleosomes in additional conformations as this study is not exhaustive in characterising a full spectrum of complexes that can be formed with different linker DNA lengths and in different stages of ATP hydrolysis. In addition, complexes with two molecules of Chd1 bound to one nucleosome can be formed but have not been characterised here. Because Chd1 can engage with nucleosomes in different ways, it is possible that ensemble approaches that have previously been used to characterise the interaction of Chd1 and other remodelling enzymes with nucleosomes may report on a mixture of different states.</p><p>In the absence of ATP analogues, Chd1 is bound to the nucleosome through a small interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The SANT-SLIDE domains of Chd1 and the related domains in ISWI, bind DNA with affinities in the low nanomolar range and are required for efficient interaction with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grüne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). DNA recognition by Chd1 does not appear to be sequence specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, the related DBD of Isw1a has been observed to interact with different regions of linker DNA dependent on the nucleosomal substrate used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that interaction of the DBD with linker DNA represents a first step in the association of Chd1 with chromatin. One-dimensional diffusive motion that has been observed for many non-specific DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stanford et al., 2000</xref>) provides a means for enrichment on longer linker DNA and a means of scanning exposed linker DNA for sites where engagement of the ATPase domains with nucleosomes is also possible.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we observe a hyperactive mutant of Chd1 bound to a nucleosome bearing an 11 bp linker in the presence of the ground state mimic ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>. In this case, a more compact particle is observed consistent with engagement of both the ATPase and DBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As structural data has previously been obtained for the nucleosome, Chd1 chromoATPase domains and SANT-SLIDE DBD it is possible to orient these major components within the volume obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The DBD is bound close to the edge of the nucleosome interacting with the first 10 base pairs of linker DNA. Previous studies have shown that Chd1 activity is greatly reduced when the SANT and SLIDE domains that comprise the C-terminal DBD are deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, fusion of Chd1 to heterologous domains that direct specific interactions with DNA restores activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). Chd1-AraC hybrids are dependent on an <italic>araI</italic> site and the optimal position for this is +8 bp from the nucleosome boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>). Chd1-streptavidin fusions are dependent on the introduction of biotinylated nucleotides with optimal location +11 bp from the nucleosome boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). Although these fusion proteins will not pack identically to the native SANT and SLIDE domains, these observations indicate that an interaction with the first turn of DNA outside of the nucleosome, as observed in our engaged structure, is functionally important. They also show that nucleosome repositioning is directed towards the bound linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The outer turn of nucleosomal DNA is removed from the surface of the histone octamer on the side of the nucleosome with the linker DNA bound to the Chd1 DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). This occurs in the absence of ATP-hydrolysis but may be facilitated by conformational changes promoted by the binding of the transition state mimics ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> or AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>). Consistent with this, the related enzyme Snf2h has also been observed to bind nucleosomes more effectively in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Racki et al., 2009</xref>) and ISW2 protects from hydroxyl radical digestion more effectively in the presence of bound nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gangaraju et al., 2009</xref>). More effective engagement of the ATPase domains may favour the binding of the DBD to linker DNA. This in turn may cause dissociation of nucleosomal DNA in a similar fashion to that observed upon binding of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Workman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polach and Widom, 1996</xref>). The loss of octamer contacts on the bound side of the nucleosome will reduce the energy required to affect dynamic alterations to nucleosomal DNA and may act as a priming step for subsequent ATP-dependent remodelling. This priming step may distinguish the initial ATP dependent changes from subsequent cycles of activity. Consistent with this seven base pairs of DNA have been observed to be removed from nucleosomes following the action of ISW2 and Isw1b complexes followed by subsequent three base pair movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deindl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>ATP-dependent repositioning occurs as a result of the action of the chromoATPase domain which engages with nucleosomal DNA, centred 1.5 superhelical turns off the nucleosomal dyad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). There are two SHL 1.5 locations either side of the nucleosome. The SHL 1.5 location that is bound is further away on the linear DNA sequence, separated by 90 rather than 60 base pairs from the bound linker. However, it is in closer spatial proximity once DNA has been wrapped around the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This arrangement is different to that previously reported for ISW2. In this case, the proximal dyad location in the DNA sequence is bound by the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>). The distinct topography with which the domains of Chd1 engage with nucleosomal DNA raise the possibility that the orientation of DNA translocation is also different to that observed with other enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>). High-resolution structures enable the strand specificity of nucleic acid contacts to be assigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sengoku et al., 2006</xref>). However, our structure is not at a resolution where this assignment can be made, so the directionality of translocation cannot be resolved. Similarly, the limited resolution does not enable us to comment on rearrangements that are anticipated to occur between the chromo and ATPase domains and within the ATPase domains during engagement with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hauk and Bowman, 2011</xref>). A recent study identifies cross-links between Chd1 and nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nodelman et al., 2017</xref>). The major DNA contacts made by the DBD, chromo domains and ATPase domain are consistent with the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. As a result our model derived from cryo-EM is reinforced by orthologous single-molecule FRET and cross-linking building understanding of how a near intact remodeling enzyme interacts with a nucleosome.</p><p>It is clear that there is a large change in the orientation of the DNA binding and chromoATPase domains upon engagement with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). A large-scale nucleotide-dependent change in conformation of the related enzyme SNF2h has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>). This involves repositioning of the SNF2h SANT-SLIDE DBD from a site that generates a FRET signal with a site +20 bp from the nucleosome edge to one that generates FRET at a site at −25 internal to a nucleosome. It is possible that this could involve redistribution of the SNF2h SANT SLIDE domain from positions distributed along the linker to high occupancy at the nucleosome boundary. Additional evidence for a conformational change upon binding to DNA and nucleosomes has been obtained by studying changes in protease digestion of Drosophila ISWI following binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>If the predominant conformation observed in solution is docked onto a nucleosome using the engaged chromoATPase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) as a reference point, steric clashes occur with the histone octamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, if the solution structure is docked using the DBD from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, a conformation related to that of the apo enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). It is likely that there is some interplay between these states. Many of the solution measurements include minor subpopulations that indicate conformational flexibility, for example between the DBD and ATPase lobe 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). These minor populations do not provide an obvious fit to the fully engaged conformation. Instead, ATPase lobe 2 may be more mobile perhaps reflecting the different conformations that have been observed in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dürr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomä et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xia et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, the major species observed in solution is not capable of binding nucleosomes in the fully engaged conformation which we assume to be active. As a result, the apo protein could be considered to be auto inhibited. Consistent with this, both within Chd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>]) and other remodelling ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), mutations have been reported that increase activity. Here, we show that mutations to the N terminus that increase activity, reduce interactions between the DBD and the chromoATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). This suggests that increased flexibility in the orientation of the chromoATPase and DBD increases the opportunity for productive engagement with nucleosomes. As a result, regulation of accessory domain orientation to enable engagement with the nucleosomal substrate represents a potent means of regulating the activity of remodelling ATPases. This may be important as the combined abundance of chromatin remodelling enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2011</xref>) could present a load on nuclear ATP levels. Regulation allowing increased activity when chromatin organisation is required, for example following transcription or DNA replication would reduce the energy expended organising chromatin.</p><p>Chd1 plays a major role in the maintenance of even nucleosome spacing within coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>). To achieve this, the activity of the enzyme is also anticipated to be influenced by the length of DNA between adjacent nucleosomes. Within the ISWI related ACF complex, the duration of pauses prior to repositioning is shortened when linker lengths are increased in the range 40 to 60 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>). An activation mutation termed AutoN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>), N-terminal to the ATPase domains, is found to impede DNA length sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>). This may function in a similar way to the hyperactive Chd1 △ 57–88 mutant, enabling engagement with nucleosomes in an active conformation independent of linker DNA length. However, there may also be important differences in the way in which the SANT-SLIDE domains of ISWI and Chd1 related proteins act. The structures of these domains do differ significantly in ISWI and Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grüne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, yeast Chd1 acts to organise nucleosomes with relatively short linker lengths of 16 base pairs within yeast coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>). In this respect, engagement with the first turn of extranucleosomal DNA as we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) provides a means of achieving activity within close packed nucleosome arrays. Nonetheless, steric clashes with the SANT-SLIDE-bound linker would be anticipated to get progressively more serious when the linker between nucleosomes is reduced below 20 bp with the effect of reducing enzyme activity. The inhibition of repositioning when linker length falls below a low limit is sufficient to drive the even spacing of nucleosomes via a bidirectional statistically driven process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blosser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mavrich et al., 2008</xref>). In future, structural characterisation of additional intermediates promises to provide further insight into how genomes are organised.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, protein expression, and purification</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Chd1 C-terminal and N-terminal truncations were made from the full length clone described in Ryan et al, using an inverse PCR strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>).

The interaction and the NOE energies of the final docked structures were evaluated and those solutions (200) that satisfy the all experimental distance distributions, were accepted for the final model.</p><p>In addition to the XPLOR-NIH approach, the Tagdock program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) was used to perform distance restrained rigid docking calculations. In brief, 100,000 decoys were generated during the first low-resolution docking phase with a random starting orientation. A Boltzmann-weighted MTSSL rotamer library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) was utilised for the respective spin labelled positions. A score for the docked complex was calculated based on the experimental distance restraints. The best scoring 200 structures were then taken to the high-resolution refinement stage where finer rotations and translations were applied. The structures that provided improved scores as well as good agreement with the experimental distances were accepted for the final model. A pymol session file of the Tagdock model is accessible on Dryad doi:10.5061/dryad.v5n53.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chemical crosslinking and MS analysis</title><p>Chemical crosslinking experiments on ScChd1 1305 protein was carried out using a BS<sup>3</sup> crosslinker [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA]. Crosslinker BS<sup>3</sup> was prepared at a concentration of 2 mM in DMSO. 5 µL of the crosslinker was then added to 145 µL 20 µM ScChd1 1305 enzyme in 40 mM HEPES pH 7.8 and 400 mM NaCl. The reaction was incubated on ice for 120 min and then quenched by the addition of 10 µL 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Nonspecific crosslinked products (i.e. multimers of ScChd1) were removed by gel filtration on a PC3.2/30 (2.4 mL) Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE healthcare, UK) that was pre-equilibrated in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl. Fractions containing the samples were pooled together, reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide (20 mM). The samples were then sequentially digested first with Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega UK) overnight at 37°C and then with GluC, using a protein to enzyme ratio of 20:1 for both digestions. The digested peptides were size exclusion gel filtrated using the Sephadex G-50 resin on a 50% acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The fractions were pooled and dried using centrifugal evaporation at 40°C and resuspended in 30 µL of 5% formic acid. The peptide mixture (1 μL) was injected onto a 15 cm EasySpray C18 column (Thermo Fisher) and separated by a linear organic gradient from 2% to 35% buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) over 110 min. Peptide ions were generated by electrospray ionisation from the EasySpray source and introduced to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Intact peptide ion and fragment ion peaks were extracted from the RAW format into the MGF format using the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software package, for subsequent analysis. Crosswork algorithm (MassAI software) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>) was used to analyse and annotate the crosslinked peptides. The Xvis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>) software was used to represent the annotated crosslinked sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Size exclusion chromatography of Chd1 fragments</title><p>Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a MAbPac SEC-1 column with pore size of 300 Å and particle size of 5 µm (Thermo Fisher), pre equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 80 mM NaCl, to analyse the association of DBD with ΔC1010, ΔN 133-ΔC1010 and Δ57–88-ΔC1010. For each run, Chd1 DBD was mixed with respective fragments at 3:1 molar ratio, incubated for 30 min and injected onto the column. The column was runn at the flow rate of 0.150 mL/min and 100 μL fractions were collected. The fractions from the size exclusion experiment were further analysed using SDS-PAGE gel.

In the case of Chd1 △57–88 the complex was formed in the presence of a fivefold molar excess of ADP-BeFx and 250 µM ADP-BeFx was included in the SEC buffer. Fractions were analysed by 6% Native PAGE and fractions containing ScChd1-nucleosome complexes pooled. A 4-µL drop of sample was applied to Quantifoil Holey carbon foil (400 mesh R1.2/1.3 µm) treated with glow discharge (Quorum technologies, Laughton, UK). After 15 s incubation at 4°C, grids were double side blotted for 3.5 s with a blot force of 5 in a FEI Mark IV vitrobot cryo-plunger (FEI , Hillsboro, Oregon) at 100% humidity and plunge frozen in −172°C liquefied ethane.

The microscope was operated at 200 kV, spot size 1, with a C2 condenser aperture of 50 μm and an objective aperture of 100 μm diameter. Semi-automatic data acquisition was performed using EMtools (TVIPS, Gauting, Germany). Micrographs of vitrified samples were recorded at a primary magnification of 68000 (pixel size 1.58 Å /pixel) and with an approximate dose of 17–22 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>. Data were processed and the cryoEM map of the final model was obtained with RELION 1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheres, 2012</xref>).

Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of ×59,000 on a Falcon II direct electron detector. In total, 3200 micrographs were recorded using a −1.5/–3.5 µm defocus range with a total electron dose of 40 e<sup>−</sup> per Å<sup>2</sup>. Each micrograph contains 22 frames and a total exposure time of 0.9 s with 2.1 e- per frame. All movies were corrected for beam-induced drift using the frame wise motion correction with Unblur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>). The contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters of each drift-corrected image were estimated using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Micrographs with large astigmatism, heavy contamination, or serious aggregation were discarded resulting in 2450 micrographs. RELION 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheres, 2012</xref>) was used for the rest of the data processing. About 5000 particles from 50 micrographs were first handpicked, then extracted and 2D classes were generated in Relion 1.4. These 2D classes were then used as a reference in Relion autopick routine and particles were picked from all 2450 micrographs. The autopicked particles were subsequently extracted and sorted using particle sorting routine. A first round of two-dimensional classification was performed to discard poorly averaging particles, resulting in a cleaned 197,602-particle data set. A three-dimensional classification was then performed using four classes and with low-pass filtered nucleosome volume as the initial cryo-EM map; 148607 particles belonging to the best three-dimensional classes were selected, 3D auto refined and subjected to single particle movie correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015</xref>) and particle re-centering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rawson et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, a second round of three-dimensional classification was performed using four classes. This approach yielded an improved volume belong to single class calculated from 70,481 particles. This class was further subjected to an additional round of 3D classification using three classes and finer rotational angle. These classes were inspected in chimera and two similar classes were merged, resulting in 52,208 particles. These were subsequently separated into 187 groups, on the basis of their refined intensity scale-factor, and subjected to a final three-dimensional refinement using the selected 60 Å low-pass filtered three-dimensional class as a starting model. User-defined soft edge solvent mask was provided for solvent inclusion during the refinement process. The density map was corrected for the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the Falcon detector. The final resolution after post-processing was 15 Å, according to the 0.143 cut-off criterion. UCSF Chimera was used for automated rigid-body docking as well as to generate figures and videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

The impressive technical range and comprehensive nature of the analysis provides confidence in the conclusions, and this first structural view of full-length Chd1 and Chd1 bound to nucleosomes is a significant advance likely to have high impact in this field. The data support a model for sequential rearrangement of Chd1 from an autoinhibited apo form to a nucleosome-bound form to a form in which the DNA is partially unraveled from the nucleosome, affecting our understanding of remodeling by Chd1 and drawing an unexpected mechanistic distinction between Chd1 and ISWI-family remodelers.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Several issues should be clarified by the authors prior to publication.</p><p>1) The authors report an increase in the internucleosomal spacing in cells when Chd1 activity is increased either by overexpression of WT Chd1 or by introduction of a chd1-∆(57-88) mutation. A clearer description of how the various strains were constructed should be provided, and additional discussion of how the authors think increased Chd1 activity leads to this outcome should be included. If the authors think this effect arises from an intrinsic property of Chd1, then can this effect on nucleosome spacing be mimicked in vitro using standard sliding rate or nucleosome centering assays with differing lengths of flanking linkers? Alternatively, if the authors think the altered spacing reflects a change in the interplay/competition with other nucleosome positioning forces in the cell, then they should propose a model for how this would result in the observed altered spacing.</p><p>2) It is not clear why the FRET experiments were performed with AMP-PNP while ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> was used in the EM samples as these analogs can either mimic the same ATP state (unhydrolyzed ATP) or different ATP states in different circumstances. A direct comparison of these analogs in some setting would therefore be useful, perhaps in the experimental approach shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref> panel B, or in a nucleosome binding assay. The authors should also describe their rationale for why Chd1 1-1305 was used in the FRET experiments and not the full-length protein or the δ 57-88 mutant.</p><p>3) The Km values reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> were obtained under conditions where the enzyme concentration (80 nM) was comparable to or higher than the nucleosome substrate concentration (10-120 nM). Standard Michaelis-Menten analysis assumes an excess of substrates relative to the enzyme concentration, and enzyme concentration below the Km, so this type of analysis is not appropriate here. This may explain why the apparent dissociation constants that can be estimated from the half-maximal gel shifts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> are quite different from the Kms reported. The authors either need to determine Kms under appropriate conditions or use a different method for quantitively comparing affinities.</p><p>4) The large error bars for the 1305R20-21A mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> make it difficult to determine the reliability of the conclusion that this mutation &quot;also reduced activity,&quot; so a less definitive conclusion should be made.</p><p>5) The nature of the bands above and below the Nuc-Chd1 complex in the gel shift assay for the Chd1-∆(57-88) variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) should be described; specifically, how were these bands treated for the quantitative analysis?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22510.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential Revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Several issues should be clarified by the authors prior to publication.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors report an increase in the internucleosomal spacing in cells when Chd1 activity is increased either by overexpression of WT Chd1 or by introduction of a chd1-∆(57-88) mutation.

We have included a section discussing some of the ways in which increased Chd1 activity could result in increased nucleosome spacing at the end of this Results section. We don’t anticipate that it is trivial to mimic the in vivo behaviours we have observed in vitro.</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear why the FRET experiments were performed with AMP-PNP while ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> was used in the EM samples as these analogs can either mimic the same ATP state (unhydrolyzed ATP) or different ATP states in different circumstances.

We have added a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref> in which we show that DNA unwrapping occurs with the Chd1 δ 57-88 mutant in addition to the 1305 protein. We also show that unwrapping occurs both in the presence of AMP-PNP (A) as well as in the presence of ADP-BeF (B)<sub>x</sub>. The Chd1 1-1305 protein was used for cryo-EM and PELDOR measurements so it is appropriate to also use it for single molecule measurements. When the C-terminal 163 amino acids are included it is not possible to express enough protein for structural studies. We revised the text to make this clear.</p><p><italic>3) The Km values reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> were obtained under conditions where the enzyme concentration (80 nM) was comparable to or higher than the nucleosome substrate concentration (10-120 nM). Standard Michaelis-Menten analysis assumes an excess of substrates relative to the enzyme concentration, and enzyme concentration below the Km, so this type of analysis is not appropriate here. This may explain why the apparent dissociation constants that can be estimated from the half-maximal gel shifts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> are quite different from the Kms reported. The authors either need to determine Kms under appropriate conditions or use a different method for quantitively comparing affinities.</italic> </p><p>The ATPase assays have been repeated using 5 nM enzyme and nucleosomes from 10 nM to 160 nM. The half maximal gel shifts still occur at 3-6 fold higher concentrations than the Km for ATP-hydrolysis. This is not completely unexpected as the Km for ATP-hydrolysis measures the concentration dependence of a limiting intermediate for ATP hydrolysis, whereas the gel shifts are performed in the absence of nucleotides and binding of the related enzyme ACF has been observed to be stimulated by ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>. In concert the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that mutations to the N-terminus can affect nucleosome binding, ATP-hydrolysis and nucleosome repositioning in different ways.</p><p><italic>4) The large error bars for the 1305R20-21A mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> make it difficult to determine the reliability of the conclusion that this mutation &quot;also reduced activity,&quot; so a less definitive conclusion should be made.</italic> </p><p>We have systematically reproduced all the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to reduce experimental error. However, we had problems with the 1305R20-21A mutant that we have not been able to resolve. We don’t think the inclusion of this mutant is essential, so we have removed all data for R20-21A to avoid delay.</p><p><italic>5) The nature of the bands above and below the Nuc-Chd1 complex in the gel shift assay for the Chd1-∆(57-88) variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) should be described; specifically, how were these bands treated for the quantitative analysis?</italic> </p><p>Between experimental repeats the species below the Nuc-Chd1complex in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is either low in abundance or not observed. We have included a new gel where it is not visible. The super-shifted bands are mentioned in the revised figure legend. The Methods section now states that the intensity of all shifted bands with a mobility equal to or slower than Nuc-Chd1 were combined in quantitation of Chd1 bound nucleosomes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
