However, the neural and molecular nature of this acquired ability remains elusive. In fruit flies, acoustic perception has been thought to be innate. Here we report, surprisingly, that auditory experience of a species-specific courtship song in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> shapes adult song perception and resultant sexual behavior. Preferences in the song-response behaviors of both males and females were tuned by social acoustic exposure during development. We examined the molecular and cellular determinants of this social acoustic learning and found that GABA signaling acting on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor Rdl in the pC1 neurons, the integration node for courtship stimuli, regulated auditory tuning and sexual behavior. These findings demonstrate that maturation of auditory perception in flies is unexpectedly plastic and is acquired socially, providing a model to investigate how song learning regulates mating preference in insects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34348.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many mammals and birds have a critical period in youth when hearing the vocal cues of their parents helps them to learn the specific features of their communication sounds. Scientists have been studying the brains of humans, birds and other animals to find out what is happening in their brains when the animals hear these sounds. However, the brains of these species are too complex to fully understand how early vocal influences shape the brain networks that control behavior.</p><p>Therefore, scientists often use ‘simpler’ organisms, such as insects, to study these processes. For example, fruit flies use a series of courtship behaviors – including mating calls – to attract their potential mates. To produce a courtship song, males vibrate their wings, which consists of short pulsed songs and sequences of humming. The time interval between the pulses is specific to a species. Until now it was thought that these mating calls are innate behaviors that cannot be learned or modified.</p><p>To test this, Li et al. clipped the wings of male fruit flies so they could not produce their own song. First, they placed the females with the males and played one species-specific courtship song, and one from a different species. Both songs resulted in successful copulation and did not affect the female’s choice.</p><p>To find out if a previous experience of a courtship song can influence the behavior of the fruit flies, Li et al. raised one group hearing their species-specific song and the other with a song from a different species. The results showed that females growing-up with their species-specific song, rejected males when a song of another species was played. However, the females accustomed to the other species’ song did not change their song preference and receptivity towards males. The same was also true for males: male fruit flies raised with their species-specific song later ignored another species’ song, which usually increased their mating drive.</p><p>Li et al. further identified a specific region in the brain of the fruit flies known to be important for courtship, and a key molecule that regulated this behavior. These findings suggest that far from being innate, the mating preference in fruit flies can be learned and influenced by social experience.</p><p>A next step will be to find out if fruit flies also have critical period for learning vocal cues and if so, how it is regulated at the molecular and neural levels. A better understanding of how fruit flies learn and discriminate sounds may bridge knowledge gaps in research using humans and other mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory experience</kwd><kwd>song</kwd><kwd>acoustic perception</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (16H04655)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamikouchi</surname><given-names>Azusa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Challenging Research (Exploratory) (17K19450)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamikouchi</surname><given-names>Azusa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovate Areas</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamikouchi</surname><given-names>Azusa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific research (C) (15K07147)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishimoto</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003844</institution-id><institution>Inamori Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishimoto</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Auditory experience of a species-specific courtship song in developing Drosophila tunes adult song perception and resultant sexual behavior more selective.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vocal learning in infants or juvenile birds relies heavily on the early experience of the adult conspecific sounds. In humans, early language input is necessary to form the ability of phonetic distinction and pattern detection in the phase of auditory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuhl, 2004</xref>). Because of the strong parallels between speech acquisition of humans and song learning of songbirds, and the difficulties to investigate the neural mechanisms of human early auditory memory at cellular resolution, songbirds have been used as a predominant model in studying memory formation during vocal learning. In juvenile songbirds, a small subset of neurons in the higher-order auditory cortex responded selectively to a song experienced in the early exposure, and thus were thought to be the neuronal substrate for song memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yanagihara and Yazaki-Sugiyama, 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear how the neurons that represent the sound memory are incorporated into the higher-order integration center to direct the sensorimotor output.</p><p>The auditory system of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has attracted increasing attention in recent years for the huge progress in understanding its underlying neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The courtship song produced by wing vibration of males during the courtship ritual has been studied most among the communication sounds in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laturney and Billeter, 2014</xref>). The courtship song, thought to be the primary cue affecting the female’s choice of the courting male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crossley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Villella and Hall, 2008</xref>), comprises two components: trains of pulses called pulse song and sequences of humming called sine song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">von Schilcher, 1976a</xref>). Although the function of the sine song is not well understood, sound playback experiments have demonstrated that the pulse song promotes copulation in paired flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kyriacou and Hall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ritchie et al., 1999</xref>). Receptivity of females is improved by playback of an artificial pulse song, which reduces female rejection responses and shortens the time to copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennet Clark and Ewing, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">von Schilcher, 1976a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">von Schilcher, 1976b</xref>). An artificial pulse song also increases sexual behavior in males, even without the presence of females, stimulating ‘chaining behavior’, in which males chase each other and form male-male chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crossley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). This chaining behavior presumably arises from the increase of sexual arousal, which induces a male to join the courtship strived by other nearby males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eberl et al., 1997</xref>). Intriguingly, the quality of the pulse song affects sexual arousal. The temporal gap between the pulses in the pulse song, namely the inter-pulse interval (IPI), differs among sibling <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cobb et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ewing and Bennet-Clark, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ewing and Manning, 1967</xref>) and is thought to be the crucial parameters for sexual arousal and species recognition. Indeed, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males prefer the pulse song with a certain range of IPIs including 35 ms, the mean IPI of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). This bias towards the conspecific pulse song raises a question of how IPI selectivity is formed, making the fruit fly a simple model to investigate the mechanism underlying sound perception.</p><p>Fruit flies detect sound with antennal ears and, specifically, with mechanosensory neurons of Johnston’s organ (JO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>). Regarding the two key features of <italic>Drosophila</italic> pulse song, intra-pulse frequency (IPF) and IPI, the antennal ear is mechanically tuned to detect the conspecific IPF, and the brain is hypothesized to process the conspecific IPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riabinina et al., 2011</xref>). Recently an auditory pathway to perceive the pulse song that underlies the mating decision was delineated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males. This pathway includes mechanosensory neurons in JO (JO neurons), aPN1 neurons (also known as AMMC-B1 neurons), vPN1 neurons, and pC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In males, the pC1 cluster includes the courtship command-like P1 neurons. Multi-stage transformations by neurons in this auditory pathway refine the perception of IPIs until the response of the pC1 neurons matches the behavioral response to songs with different IPIs. These studies illustrate how the tuning towards the conspecific song with 35 ms IPI can be achieved, and raise the question of how this IPI preference emerges. Although it is traditionally believed that the courtship behavior of flies is innate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auer and Benton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall, 1994</xref>), the programmed courtship machinery is susceptible to variables in development such as sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kayser et al., 2014</xref>), social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan and Baker, 2014</xref>) and juvenile social experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McRobert and Tompkins, 1988</xref>). Pioneering studies on zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cousillas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Woolley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yanagihara and Yazaki-Sugiyama, 2016</xref>) and bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Razak et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that auditory selectivity in these animals developed in an experience-dependent manner. Accordingly, we hypothesized that in young flies, IPI preference might also be refined by the experience of songs from nearby males, which might modulate the partner selection in sexual behaviors.</p><p>In this study, we examined whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> IPI selectivity was tuned by the auditory experience. Based on the sexual behaviors of males and females upon song playback, we established a new behavioral paradigm in which the flies were exposed to specific sound patterns for long periods before their IPI preference was evaluated. Surprisingly, we found that the experience of conspecific song, but not heterospecific song, tuned IPI perception in both males and female flies. Furthermore, we found that this experience-dependent IPI tuning relied on GABA synthesis, and that the ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor of pC1 neurons gated IPI tuning in females. Our discovery establishes a new and simple system to study how the experience-dependent auditory plasticity is incorporated into higher-order integration center to modulate sexual behaviors at the molecular and cellular levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experience-dependent tuning of IPI preference in male fruit flies</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, IPIs ranging from 35 ms to 75 ms induce the sexual behavior of males vigorously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Since the mean IPI of the courtship song in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is about 35 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cowling and Burnet, 1981</xref>), it seems noteworthy that 75 ms IPI, which is out of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> IPI range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>) and likely comes from another <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (for example, an evolutionarily far species <italic>Drosophila rosinae</italic> in <italic>fasciola</italic> subgroup) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa and Sene, 2002</xref>), induces sexual behavior as strongly as 35 ms IPI. We noticed that male flies that showed similar levels of response to both 35 ms and 75 ms IPI songs had been wing-clipped soon after eclosion and thus lacked experiences of wing-emitted sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Because <italic>Drosophilid</italic>s gather in groups in feeding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Powell, 1997</xref>), we reasoned that flies probably had experiences of the courtship songs of other males in social interactions, and tested how the auditory experience affected the IPI selectivity.</p><p>To evaluate how the experience of wing-emitted sound from other males affects later acoustic preference, we measured the chaining behavior of males that were reared for five to six days in the following three conditions: (1) grouped flies without wings, (2) grouped flies with intact wings, and (3) single-reared flies with intact wings. The wings of males in the latter two groups were clipped only one day before the chaining test. For the chaining test, we used two types of artificial pulse songs: 35 ms IPI and 75 ms IPI songs to represent conspecific and heterospecific songs, respectively. Consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>), flies grouped without wings responded strongly to both conspecific and heterospecific songs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, flies grouped with wings preferred conspecific over heterospecific song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This selective response was not observed in single-reared flies with wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the presence of other males with wings is required to shape the IPI preference in males.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34348.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Social interaction shapes the preference to the song.</title><p>Chaining response of naïve male flies that were housed in different experimental conditions, grouped without wings (<bold>A</bold>), grouped with intact wings (<bold>B</bold>), and single-reared with intact wings (<bold>C</bold>).

Especially, the perception of auditory signals has attracted much attention from researchers because acoustic communication plays important roles in species identification and reproductive isolation of not only fruit flies, but also other animals such as birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catchpole, 1987</xref>), fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amorim et al., 2015</xref>), frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Backwell and Jennions, 1993</xref>), and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hedwig, 2006</xref>). Here we identify a novel phenomenon revealing the experience-dependent auditory plasticity that shapes sexual preference in fruit flies (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>). Analogous to the regulatory role of GABA in shaping auditory circuits of zebra finch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yanagihara and Yazaki-Sugiyama, 2016</xref>), we demonstrate that GABA signaling also shapes auditory selectivity in flies. We further identify the receptors responsible for this signaling on a small subset of central neurons that mediate the tuning of IPI perception. Our findings document how the experience-dependent mechanism is incorporated with an innate auditory system and accordingly establish the fruit fly, with its abundant molecular-genetic tools, as a powerful model to investigate the mechanisms of auditory plasticity on the molecular and cellular levels.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Song experience shapes the IPI preference</title><p>Temporal pattern of sound is a crucial feature in the communication signals of many animals, such as in bird songs, frog calls, cricket chirps, and human speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pollack, 2001</xref>). Particularly in lower-vertebrates and insects, understanding the simple patterns of sounds used in communication, such as the specific pulse rate, is important in deciphering the meanings of these signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bass and McKibben, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schöneich et al., 2015</xref>). Fruit flies use the pulse songs with a species-specific IPI during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ewing and Bennet-Clark, 1968</xref>). In this study, we found that the flies’ initial wide-ranging IPI preference was refined by early auditory experience. Since the IPI distribution in the recorded natural courtship song is particularly enriched at around 35 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>), young adult flies are highly likely to be exposed to this conspecific IPI emitted by other males. This experience might tune the IPI preference and predispose partner selection in sexual behavior later in life. Indeed, our results prove that social interaction during early adulthood tunes the IPI preference towards the conspecific IPI (35 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This beautiful coordination between innate preference and experience-dependent refinement allows enough flexibility in mating, and reduces the risk of crossbreeding between species, which contributes to species isolation.</p><p>We find that only the experience of conspecific song tunes the auditory preference, while the experience of heterospecific song does not. This asymmetric learning of conspecific and heterospecific songs suggests that naïve flies can already distinguish conspecific song from heterospecific song, since only the former is capable of modifying their later preference behavior.</p><p>We previously reported that male <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed equal behavioral preference towards IPIs between 35 ms and 75 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>), which were used as conspecific and heterospecific songs in the present study. However, another report showed that male <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> preferentially responded to 35 ms over all other IPIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). This discrepancy can now be explained by the experimental difference between these two studies, whether the male flies kept in a group have the experience of carrying wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). As for how long the necessary experience is, and whether a critical period exists, further study is needed to answer these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Experience-dependent learning refines the mating preference</title><p>Whether nature or nurture plays dominant roles in the formation of animal behavior has been debated for a long time, yet the courtship behavior of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, including its underlying sensory perception, has long been recognized to be innate. Numerous empirical evidences have supported the capability of single-reared flies to perform all the courtship steps spontaneously and completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auer and Benton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall, 1994</xref>). However, our results reveal that the specific sound experience is necessary to refine the auditory preference in sexual behavior, which for the first time suggests a mechanism of learning in the song discrimination of flies.</p><p>In fact, animals in many species learn their mating preferences. One notable example is sexual imprinting, the process whereby mating preferences are affected by learning the species-specific characteristics at a very young age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irwin and Price, 1999</xref>). As observed in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ten Cate, 1999</xref>), fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kozak et al., 2011</xref>), and sheep and goats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owens et al., 1999</xref>), an early period of social interaction with parents or siblings helps the learner discriminate sex and species by learned phenotypic traits, and affects mating preference in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verzijden et al., 2012</xref>). Here we provide evidence that fruit flies refine the IPI preference by sexual imprinting, which would reinforce reproductive isolation together with innate auditory perception. This sexual imprinting of courtship song is apparently different from the lessons learned from the successful courtship experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saleem et al., 2014</xref>) or unsuccessful courtship attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffith and Ejima, 2009</xref>), by which male flies become more competitive over other males, or learn to avoid either mated or heterospecific females. Previous behavioral studies also indicated that social experience in juvenile stage affected adult courtship behaviors of insects. In crickets, juvenile experience of acoustic sexual signals influenced the development of three traits in adult: reproductive tactics, reproductive investment, and body condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2010</xref>). In fruit flies, young males courted by mature males with intact wings mated significantly faster than those that had been stored alone, suggesting auditory experience in immature stage might affect later courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McRobert and Tompkins, 1988</xref>). Consistent with these observations and going deeper, our study directly demonstrated, with the underlying mechanisms, that auditory experience during the immature stage shaped perception of courtship song, and directed the sexual behavior at the adult stage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A new model to study auditory plasticity</title><p>Our findings greatly expand the understanding of the experience-dependent auditory plasticity in insects, whose mechanism is consistent with that of mammals and finches. In vertebrates, maturation of excitation-inhibition balance that governs sound perception requires acoustic experience.

The courtship song preferences in female zebra finches are shaped by the developmental auditory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), which shares great similarity with that in fruit flies. The IPI in the courtship song of flies resembles the temporal gap between syllables in the finch song, which serves as a ‘barcode’ for song identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2016</xref>). The auditory study of these two model organisms therefore might complement and enlighten each other in exploring the mechanism of experience-dependent plasticity in conspecific sound perception, potentially contributing to the understanding of language acquisition in humans. Unlike zebra finch, fruit flies rarely see their parents. Our results demonstrate that learning from adolescent peers is sufficient to modulate the perception of IPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Flies housed in the first condition (grouped without wings) were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, their wings were clipped with forceps during brief anesthesia on ice soon after eclosion and the males were kept in a male-only group of 6 to 8. Flies housed in the second (grouped with intact wings) and third (single with intact wings) conditions were kept with intact wings for 5 to 6 days, either in a group of 6 to 8 male flies or singly. Only one day before the test, the wings of flies housed in the second and third conditions were also clipped. The chaining behavior of all the males housed in three conditions was tested 6 to 7 days after eclosion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Training</title><p>A protocol for the training session is described in more detail at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Training session started on the day of eclosion. Adult virgin males and females were collected within 8 hr after eclosion under anesthesia on ice, and the wings of males were clipped. Each fly, whether a male or a female, was introduced gently to a training capsule and placed in front of a loudspeaker (FF225WK, FOSTEX, Foster Electric Company, Tokyo, Japan). As experienced group, flies were continuously exposed to one particular training song for 6 days of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Training song was an artificial pulse song comprised of the repetition of 1 s pulse burst and a subsequent 2 s pause, in which the pulses in the pulse burst had an IPI of 35 ms (‘conspecific song’) or an IPI of 75 ms (‘heterospecific song’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Intrapulse frequency (IPF) of both IPI songs was set to be 167 Hz. As naïve group, flies were placed in front of the loudspeaker for 6 days after eclosion but not given any sound exposure.</p><p>During the training session, each fly was accommodated singly in a training capsule. A training capsule was made of a glass tube cut out from a Pasteur pipette, two pipette tips, mesh and mending tape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Pipette tips, whose volumes are 1 ml, were cut to make the larger ends about 20 mm long. Two of these 20 mm pieces were hooked to a glass tube at its both ends. The size of a glass tube was about 27 mm long, with the internal diameter of 5.2 mm and the external diameter of 6.5 mm. Both exits of the glass tube were sealed with a piece of mesh stocking (made of nylon and polyurethane), which allowed free passage of air but not the fly. A thin layer of fly food, standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> yeast-based medium, was paved at the bottom of the glass tube. The food in each capsule was renewed every 36 hr.</p><p>Training capsules were placed within latticework of a container, named a ‘sound nest’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). One of the mesh-ends of each training capsule faced the loudspeaker, so that sound could be delivered to each chamber with minimal disturbance. The distance between loudspeaker and the near end of the training capsules was 24 mm. All the setups for the training were placed into a soundproof box (W450 mm × L450 mm × H450 mm).</p><p>Sound playback was controlled by the Windows Media Player on a tablet PC (Windows 8.1, Diginnos DG-D08IWB, Dospara, Tokyo, Japan), and delivered by a loudspeaker with a digital power amplifier (Lepai LP-2020A + NFJ Edition, Bukang Electrics, Jieyang, China). The mean baseline-to peak amplitude of sound particle velocity was 8.6 mm/s when measured at the near end of the training capsules, and 6.6 mm/s at the far end of the training capsule. The sound particle velocity was identical for all training sounds.</p><p>After the 6 day training, male flies were collected into a group of seven without anesthesia, and transferred to a vial containing fly food. Female flies were still kept in the training capsules singly without sound playback until the copulation test. After one-night rest without any sound playback, all flies (7 days after eclosion) were subjected to the behavioral tests in the next morning (ZT 0–3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral tests</title><p>A protocol for the test session is described in more detail at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Male-male chaining test</title><p>For males, the sound-evoked chaining test was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Six flies were loaded into one lane of an acoustic behavior chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al., 2010</xref>) and placed in front of a loudspeaker with a distance of about 11 cm. As the test song, the artificial pulse song with 35 ms IPI or 75 ms IPI as used in the training session was delivered from a loudspeaker with an amplifier (Lepai LP-2020A + NFJ Edition, Bukang Electrics, Jieyang, China). Mean baseline-to peak amplitude of its particle velocity was 9.2 mm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>). The flies’ contour was outlined by a backlit LED light box (ComicMaster Tracer, Too Marker Products, Tokyo, Japan), and captured by a monochrome camera (Himawari GE60, Library, Tokyo, Japan) with a zoom lens (Lametar 2.8/25 mm, Jenoptik GmbH, Jena, Germany). Flies were not exposed to sound for 5 min, and then exposed to an acoustic stimulus that lasted for 6.5 min. The recorded video was then down-sampled to 1 Hz and analyzed off-line using ChaIN method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). We measured the number of only the follower flies in chains as the chain index using ChaIN version 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>), which is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bio.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~NC_home/chain_E.html">http://www.bio.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~NC_home/chain_E.html</ext-link>. The chain index between 5 min and the end of the sound playback were summed for comparison (summed chain index).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Female copulation test</title><p>For females, their receptivity was evaluated by the time course of cumulative copulation and the latency to accept copulation. To monitor the training effect on females, we paired naïve or trained females with the naïve wild-type males (7 day old, wings clipped). The test chamber, made of plexiglass, was made up by eight circular chambers (15 mm diameter, 3 mm depth) with their bottom covered with mesh for sound penetration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A pair of female and male flies was gently aspirated into one of the eight chambers without anesthesia. A pulse song was delivered to flies by a loudspeaker (Daito Voice AR-10N, Tokyo Cone Paper MFG. Co. Ltd. Saitama, Japan) placed 3.9 cm underneath the chambers. The sound particle velocity was 9.2 mm/s. Song playback was started at the same time as video recording was started. Behaviors of flies were recorded for 30 min with a web camera (Logicool HD Webcam C270, Tokyo, Japan). Copulation timing was analyzed manually from the video playback. Inhibition index = (copulation ratio<sup>Naïve</sup> - copulation ratio<sup>Experienced</sup>)/copulation ratio<sup>Naïve</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with R (version 3.0.3). Mann-Whitney U test (two-tailed) was used to compare two groups of samples in the chaining behavior. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated using R and Log rank test was performed to compare females’ accumulative copulation rate between two groups in the copulation tests. The Kruskal–Wallis test (two-tailed) followed by Scheffe’s test was used to compare the copulation latency. The detailed statistical results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The boxplot was drawn with ggplot2 package of R.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Leslie Griffith as Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Aki Ejima (Reviewer #2); Daniel F Eberl (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper provides the first evidence that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as in birds and mammals, neural plasticity plays a role in courtship song preferences. It had long been believed that courtship song preferences were completely innate. The authors show that, while the ability to hear and respond to courtship song is innate, both males and females exposed to certain variations of song parameters during early adulthood modulate their preferences and behavior. This modulation is dependent on GABA signaling, with a major integration center in the pC1 neurons of the auditory neural circuit, which also integrate chemosensory information. This work is major advance in the understanding of how auditory information is processed and integrated into the fly's behavior.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should cite and discuss the previous works, McRobert and Tompkins 1988 and Bailey et al., 2010, which demonstrated that auditory experience at young stage modified courtship performance in flies and crickets.</p><p>McRobert SP, Tompkins L.

Looking at the figures in question (4C and 3B), it seems that in some cases, close to 1/3 of the data points are called outliers! This does not look appropriate. The variance of the conditions with excluded data is much lower than the conditions without exclusion. This seems arbitrary at best. If the statistics were calculated after exclusion, they are really not reflecting the true variance of the phenomenon.</p><p>It is hard to imagine what the criterion for exclusion was. In the case of Figure 3B they are excluding control flies that had a normal latency. How could these possibly be outliers?</p><p>The authors need to explain this.

The outliers are defined as data points that are located outside the fences of the boxplot (outside 1.5 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile and below the lower quartile).</p><p>Consistent with similar researches, the copulation latency of the fly pairs that did not copulate within 30 min was set to be 30 min. In the first column of Figure 3B and the fourth column of Figure 4C, majority of the fly pairs did not copulate within 30 min (44/60 in the first column of Figure 3B; 28/36 in the fourth column of Figure 4C), which were densely plotted at the ceiling of the graphs. This is why data points that represent successful copulation were marked as outliers. We thought to mark these outliers in the boxplot would remind people of the fact that most fly pairs did not copulate, so we marked these outliers in the boxplot while included all the data points in the statistical comparison. The same standard was applied to all the data in this study.</p><p>To avoid confusion, in the revised manuscript we did not denote the data points located outside the 1.5x interquartile range as outliers. And still all the data points were considered in statistics.</p></body></sub-article></article>
