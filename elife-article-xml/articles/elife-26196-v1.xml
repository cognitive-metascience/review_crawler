This global organization, as well as the anatomical location and functional properties of individual areas throughout cortex, are similar across individuals, suggesting an early common program for the development of the visual system. Here we ask what the initial organization is and to what extent does it resemble the adult hierarchical organization. Using a combination of correlation and task-evoked analyses of fMRI data, we show that the hierarchical, topographic organization of visual cortex is present at birth and therefore constitutes a proto-organization for the entire primate visual system. In newborns, patterns of correlated activity across occipital, temporal, and parietal cortices revealed the arealization of visual cortex and the specialization of these areas into dorsal and ventral visual pathways. Correlated activity between areas reflected the topographic organization of visual space (retinotopy). Further, the retinotopic organization within high-level visual areas emerged prior to other functional selectivity. Specifically, we identified eccentricity representations in inferotemporal cortex (IT) months before IT showed the adult-like clustered organization for face selectivity. Tuning for spatial frequency and low-level shape features such as curvature were also present prior to the detection of category domain clusters in IT. These results show that areal differentiation, hierarchical organization, low-level shape selectivity, and retinotopic organization of the entire visual system is present at birth, and likely serve as the scaffold for subsequent activity-dependent modifications throughout visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional specificity in the neonate visual system</title><p>We evaluated the functional organization of the visual system in neonatal macaques using fMRI. During the first few weeks after birth, visually evoked responses were present only in the LGN and weakly in peripheral V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast to visually evoked responses, correlated activity between visual areas was significant even in these first few weeks, and clearly distinguished visual areas from the rest of cortex. For example, the mean signal of V1 was strongly correlated with occipital, temporal, and posterior parietal cortices during non-visual-stimulation rest periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We used retinotopic mapping in the same monkeys when they were more than 1.5 years old to map out the entire visual system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These maps were registered to the newborn data and confirmed that the extent of the V1 correlations in newborns covered the entire cortical visual system. The correspondence of the correlation maps to extrastriate visual areas was further verified at about 1 month after birth when visually-evoked responses could be reliably measured throughout these extrastriate areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Though the lack of early visually-evoked fMRI activity is in apparent contrast with previous electrophysiological findings that demonstrated visual responsiveness in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rust et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Endo et al., 2000</xref>), this may reflect differences between physiological and metabolic measurements as a similar lack of early activity has been observed using deoxyglucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Distler et al., 1996</xref>). As such, the apparent dissociation between the absence of visually-evoked activations and the presence of V1-correlated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>) may reflect population-level immaturity of the visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Distler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachevalier et al., 1991</xref>) or a low-arousal state in these neonatal monkeys. Regardless of the reason for the lack of visually-evoked activity, the patterns of V1 correlations indicate that signal correlation approaches can reveal the functional organization of the newborn visual system long before any visually-evoked fMRI mapping is possible.</p><p>We found evidence for still further regionalization of the neonatal brain using data-driven independent component analysis (ICA), similar to previous studies that had identified functionally related areas in adult monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hadj-Bouziane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hutchison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moeller et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to these findings in adults, several visual cortical ICs were identified in B1 and B2, at 10 and 18 days old respectively, comprising foveal or peripheral occipital cortex, dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, middle temporal (MT), and IT cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Spatial maps for each IC were bilateral and symmetric, encompassing comparable regions between hemispheres. These data further indicate that functionally specific regional differentiation, both of the entire visual system and even within the visual system, was already present in newborn macaques. Also, as in adults, there were ICs in these neonatal data within somatomotor, auditory, frontal, and parietal cortices, as well as within the thalamus, demonstrating regionally-specific signals throughout sensory and association regions in the newborn brain.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26196.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visuallyâevoked activity and correlated signal in neonatal monkeys B1 and B2.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Visually evoked-activity from 30Â s movie clips of faces, scenes, and scrambled images in monkeys B1 and B2 at 10 and 18 days postnatal, respectively, was largely absent on the lateral surface of visual cortex (t(782) &gt; 1.96; p&lt;0.05, uncorrected).

Previous anatomical studies in primates have shown callosal connections between the same visual areas in opposite hemispheres, thatÂ is, homotopic, in adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 1986</xref>) and infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Underleider and Mishkin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maunsell and van Essen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Essen et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehay et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldwin et al., 2012</xref>) primates, and these callosal connections are correlated with areal and hierarchical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maunsell and van Essen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Essen et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmidt, 2013</xref>). Consistent with these anatomical studies, previous fMRI studies in adult humans and monkeys have shown homotopic correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moeller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butt et al., 2015</xref>), which are mediated by callosal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that homotopic correlations could serve as an unbiased method for identifying regions that were already functionally distinct in neonate monkeys (i.e., areas that show strong homotopic correlations already must have functionally differentiated themselves from the surrounding cortex). Cortical areas determined by retinotopic mapping in the same monkeys atÂ &gt;1.5 years of age were used as seeds in the correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Across all 16 cortical areas tested, mean signals between homotopic cortical areas were significantly correlated in each monkey (ts(15)&gt;18.07; ps&lt;0.0001). To compare homotopic correlations with non-homotopic correlations, across-hemisphere correlations were grouped as a function of area pair (e.g., the correlation between right hemisphere V1 and left hemisphere MT was grouped with the correlationÂ between left hemisphere V1 and right hemisphere MT), and then grouped into homotopic areas (e.g., right and left hemisphere V1), areas neighboring homotopic regions (e.g., right hemisphere V1 and left hemisphere V2), and areas distal to homotopic regions (e.g., right hemisphere V1 and left hemisphere V3). The strength of correlation varied as a function of areal group (2-way ANOVA with monkey and areal grouping as factors; ps&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend). Across all 16 areas tested, pairwise correlations were strongest between homotopic cortical areas, followed by cortical areas neighboring homotopic regions, and then cortical areas distal, non-neighboring to homotopic regions (two-tailed, unpaired t-tests; Homotopic vs. Adjacent: t(134) = 3.96; Adjacent vs. Distal: t(478) &gt; 10.27; ps&lt;0.001). We verified that these correlations could not be attributed to biases in instrumental sampling or preprocessing by performing a control analysis where we simulated data with approximately the intrinsic spatial smoothness of fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smirnakis et al., 2007</xref>) and then passed these data through our analysis pipeline (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods: <italic>Simulation of correlation due to instrumentation and analyses).</italic> Across hemisphere correlations from these simulated data were not significantly different from 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; grey box plots). This control analysis also revealed that such potential biases affected only within-hemisphere correlations for neighboring areas, and even then could not fully account for the observed correlation structure.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26196.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Across-hemisphere correlations reveal arealization in neonates 10 and 18 days old.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Across-hemisphere neonatal correlation matrix for what we could later identify as 16 visual cortical areas from retinotopic mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

First, within-hemisphere pairwise temporal correlations were calculated between 16 retinotopic seed cortical areas for each hemisphere. The resulting matrix (labeled âWithin hemisphere area x area correlationsâ) is, by definition, symmetric, with each row or column corresponding to correlations between one seed cortical area and all other seed areas. Figure example is given for left hemisphere. Temporal correlations were also computed between each cortical seed area and voxels in the opposite hemisphere. Figure example is for left hemisphere seed areas and right hemisphere voxels. Each row of this matrix (labeled âAcross-hemisphere area x voxel correlationsâ) can be visualized as the spatial map of correlated activity for a given seed area (e.g., MT) with every voxel in the contralateral hemisphere. This is the typical approach for voxel-wise, seed-based correlation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>). Next, the within-hemisphere area x area matrix was correlated with the across-hemisphere area x voxel matrix of the contralateral hemisphere. This yields a matrix (labeled âAcross-hemisphere areal correlation profileâ) of similarity measurements between the profile of each seed areaâs within-hemisphere correlations with all other areas and the correlation profile of each voxel in the contralateral hemisphere with all other areas. Each row of this matrix can be visualized as a spatial map of similarity between a given areaâs (e.g., MT) within-hemisphere correlations and each contralateral voxelâs across hemisphere area correlations. i.e., illustrating which voxels have an across-hemisphere area correlation pattern similar to contralateral MT.

Temporal correlations were also calculated between the mean activity of each seed area and the activity of every voxel in the contralateral hemisphere. Then, for each seed area, we compared the within-hemisphere (area x area) correlation measure with the across-hemisphere (area x voxel) correlation measure for voxels in the opposite hemisphere. This areal correlation profile approach yielded a measure of similarity between each voxel and each seed area that factors in the similarity between areal seeds, and thus enhances the specificity of correlation patterns. To ensure that a given voxelâs activity was similar to that of the seed area, the initial across-hemisphere temporal correlations were used as the threshold (r &gt; 0.15; t &gt; 5.66; p&lt;0.0001, FDR-corrected). Across the 16 seed cortical areas, across-hemisphere areal correlation profiles were strongest for voxels within the homotopic area, with areal correlation profile strength dropping off with distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Within-hemisphere areal correlation profile maps were comparable to the across-hemisphere maps for matched seed areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1b</xref>).

Multidimensional scaling of the neonatal across-hemisphere (temporal) correlations between 16 visual cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), revealed the two principle dimensions of structure: posterior-anterior and dorsal-ventral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This indicates that the cortical location of an area was a good predictor of its connectivity; this is similar to what has been found in adult monkeys using within-hemisphere anatomical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Markov et al., 2011</xref>). Spectral community structure analysis of neonatal correlations partitioned these 16 cortical areas into 3 groups: (1) occipital areas V1, V2, and V3 (green dots), (2) ventral temporal areas V4, V4A, OTd, PITv, PITd, and OTS (red dots), and (3) dorsal areas V3A/DP, CIP, LIP, as well as the MT cluster (blue dots). Consistent with the organization found in adult monkeys, MT was functionally grouped with dorsal stream areas despite its anatomical location in temporal cortex and proximity to ventral stream areas V4, OTd, and PIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982</xref>). Occipital cortical areas were correlated with both ventral and dorsal groups. Correlations between dorsal and ventral groups were also present, though relatively weak compared to correlations within groups. This analysis thus yielded a clear distinction, at birth, between dorsal and ventral visual pathways, which is similar to the known organization of the adult visual system.</p><p>Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed nested layers within the functional segregation of dorsal and ventral pathways at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

The highest tier of the tree distinguished dorsal occipital and parietal cluster from occipital and temporal clusters. The next tier distinguished the occipital and MT clusters from inferior temporal cluster. Subsequent tiers differentiated the occipital clusters from the MT cluster and posterior occipital cluster from anterior occipital cluster. Taken together, the multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering revealed the presence, at birth, of the well-established (in adults) broad differentiation between dorsal and ventral visual pathways as well as a hierarchical organization within each pathway.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26196.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Hierarchical organization of dorsal and ventral visual pathways in newborns.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and community segmentation on pairwise contralateral correlations of the mean signals between 16 areal seeds (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for seed correlation matrix).

First, within-hemisphere correlations were assessed between posterior areas V1, V2, V3, V4, and V4A as a function of their dorsal and ventral quadrants, representing lower and upper visual fields, respectively. Within-hemisphere correlations between dorsal or ventral quadrant pairs (e.g., dorsal V1 and dorsal V2) were stronger than correlationsÂ between non-matched quadrant pairs (2-way ANOVA; main effects of quadrant group: F(1,156) = 45.1, p&lt;0.0001; marginal effect of monkey F(1,156)=3.63, p&lt;0.06; no interaction p&gt;0.10) even when excluding correlations between adjacent areas (e.g., V1 and V2), which mitigates the influence of fMRI signal spread (2-way ANOVA; main effect of quadrant group: F(1,92) = 12.8, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001 and monkey; main effect of monkey: F(1,92) = 4.29, p&lt;0.05; no interaction p&gt;0.10). Though correlations from simulated data were much weaker than the real data (Materials and methods: Simulation of correlation due to instrumentation and analyses), within-hemisphere correlations between quadrants could be partly biased by the intrinsic spread of the fMRI signal. To further rule out the influence of cortical proximity on retinotopic correlations, across-hemisphere correlations were assessed between posterior areas V1, V2, V3, V4, and V4A as a function of their dorsal and ventral quadrants. The mean signals of homotopic quadrants across hemispheres were significantly correlated in each monkey (ts(9)&gt;17.21; ps&lt;0.001). The checkerboard pattern of the correlation matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> indicates that the homotopic correlations were stronger for corresponding dorsal or ventral quadrants than for non-corresponding quadrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; 2-way ANOVA with monkey and quadrant group as factors; p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.0001). Across-hemisphere correlations between non-homotopic regions were also greater for corresponding dorsal or ventral quadrants (e.g., dorsal V1 right hemisphere to dorsal V3 left hemisphere) than for non-corresponding quadrants (2-way ANOVA; main effect of quadrant group: F(1,92) = 10.87, p&lt;0.0014; no main effect of monkey, p&gt;0.10; no interaction between monkey and quadrant group, p&gt;0.10). Because dorsal:dorsal and ventral:ventral correlations were stronger than dorsal:ventral correlations even across areas (e.g., V1 to V3), these correlations likely reflect the underlying topographic organization within each area, not solely mirror symmetrical point-to-point connections between hemispheres. Even though right and left hemispheres represent left and right visual fields, respectively, callosal connections linking neurons with overlapping receptive fields at or near the vertical meridian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehay et al., 1986</xref>) can account for correlated activity between hemispheres in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinzle et al., 2011</xref>). We again verified that these correlations could not be attributed to biases in instrumental sampling or preprocessing with the simulated data described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (Materials and methods: <italic>Simulation of correlation due to instrumentation and analyses).</italic> Across hemisphere correlations from these simulated data were not significantly different from 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; grey box plots).

We then asked how detailed this retinotopic organization was across visual cortex. At this age, we could not perform conventional retinotopic mapping.

Specifically, lateral occipital cortex had foveal correlations in neonates that extended anteriorly along the lower lip of the STS. Moving towards the medial occipital surface, eccentricity correlations gradually shifted towards the periphery. A region of foveal correlation, distinct from the foveal confluence of early visual cortex, was present within the fundus of the STS, corresponding to what later could be identified as the fovea of the MT cluster. Parafoveal and peripheral correlations encircled this fovea, especially in the dorsal-most portions of the STS near the prelunate gyrus and crown of the IPS; consistent with the retinotopic organization identified when the monkeys were older. Correlations were mostly sub-threshold within dorsal extrastriate cortex near V3A as well as within the IPS, but eccentricity correlations generally represented the periphery, also consistent with subsequent retinotopic mapping. Excluding V1 (i.e., the seed area), the mean absolute deviation between eccentricity correlations in newborns and the eccentricity measurements from retinotopic mapping after 1.5 years of age was 2.2<bold>Â°</bold> across all retinotopic areas, in both hemispheres, in both monkeys. Given the close spatial proximity between V1 and V2, some correlation should be expected due to spatial spread of the fMRI signal (Materials and methods: <italic>Simulation of correlation due to instrumentation and analyses)</italic>. However, this influence was minimal. Actual V1 correlations with V2 and V3 were approximately 2x and 5x, respectively, greater than estimated correlations attributable to spatial spread of the fMRI signal. Anterior to V3, correlations with V1 in our simulation were negligible. The neonate eccentricity correlation maps were also similar to correlation maps obtained in the same monkeys as juveniles (~3 years of age), indicating that retinotopic correlation patterns are present through development. Excluding V1, the mean absolute deviation between eccentricity correlations at newborn and juvenile ages was 2.0<bold>Â°</bold> across retinotopic areas, in both hemispheres, in both monkeys. Juvenile eccentricity correlations were more similar to the eccentricity mapping (mean deviation = 1.4<bold>Â°</bold>) than to the neonate eccentricity correlations, potentially indicating refinement of retinotopic maps over development. However, these differences might reflect non-biological variance (e.g., the precision of anatomical registration and proximity of coil placement due to brain size differences across ages). These data indicate that extensive retinotopic organization across both early and higher visual cortex was already present within the first weeks of life.</p><p>These early eccentricity maps extended into regions of IT cortex that in adults are organized into domains selectively responsive to different object categories, like faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinsk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bell et al., 2009</xref>). At this young age, however, regions of IT selectively responsive to face and non-face stimuli (measured with fMRI) were not differentiable in IT cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livingstone et al., 2017</xref>). Face patches would not emerge until about 200 days in these monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, thick black outline). Yet foveal biases were identified in this neonatal data along the lower lip of the STS, including a region that would eventually be identifiable as the middle face patch (ML), consistent with previous studies that compared eccentricity and face patch organization in adult monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rajimehr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013</xref>). In neonates, the eccentricity correlations within what would become area ML were mostly foveal, though midfield and peripheral representations were identified on the medial edge within the fundus in 3 of 4 hemispheres. This progression of eccentricity representations was consistent with eccentricity representations from subsequent mapping in these same monkeys atÂ &gt;1.5 years of age, and with a previous study in adult monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>). We further tested the retinotopic bias of these precursor-face-patches in neonates by correlating the mean signal of the region that would become ML with the mean signal of each V1 eccentricity bin. Correlations of the region that would become ML were strongest with the most foveal V1 bin and diminished towards the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). These correlations could not be accounted for by instrumentation or analysis procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>; red line). The pattern of V1 eccentricity correlations in neonates paralleled the distribution of eccentricity representations in ML from subsequent retinotopic mapping in these same monkeys atÂ &gt;1.5 years; both of which showed an overall foveal bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and c</xref>).</p><p>Though eccentricity representations were weak in the most anterior parts of IT, the anterior face patch (AL) showed a bimodal retinotopic correlation pattern, with the strongest correlations at foveal- and peripheral-most V1 bins, consistent with the sub-threshold distribution of eccentricity representations mappedÂ &gt;1.5 years later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Eccentricity correlations in the fundal face patches (MF and AF) were not investigated because eccentricity representations in our mapping varied in the STS fundus between monkeys, and the retinotopic organization, if any, in the fundus remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these data indicate that retinotopic organization of what would become category-selective regions in IT cortex was already established within the first weeks after birth.</p><p>Though neonatal correlation patterns distinguished retinotopic areas within IT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and neonatal ICA analysis revealed a broad IT component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), neither analysis revealed a face-patch organization in neonates. These data are consistent with a recent study from our lab showing that task-evoked face-selective clusters in IT do not appear until about 200 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livingstone et al., 2017</xref>). The failure to find a face-selective IC early in development cannot be ascribed to insensitivity of this analysis. We conducted ICA on several data sets at different ages in which the monkeys had viewed blocks of faces and other images. After 200 days of age both IC analysis and univariate analysis revealed face patches; before 200 days neither showed face-patch organization. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livingstone et al., 2017</xref>). In these older datasets, foveal and peripheral ICs were also identified, further demonstrating the stability of retinotopic organization through development. For datasets from monkeys older than 200 days, IC components comprising the face patch system also included foveal and parafoveal (~1<bold>Â°</bold>â6<bold>Â°</bold>) regions of occipital cortex, demonstrating that the link between retinotopy and category selective domains is consistent through development. Taken together, these data indicate that the retinotopic areal organization in inferior temporal cortex precedes category selectivity.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26196.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Relationship between correlation-based retinotopy and precursor-face-patches in newborns.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Faces-minus-objects contrast maps for monkeys B1 and B2 atÂ &lt;123 days andÂ &gt;1.5 years.

To see whether the eccentricity organization we found in neonates carried with it a similar selectivity for stimulus scale, we performed spatial frequency mapping in one infant monkey at 110 days old, well after significant visual responses had appeared with fMRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but prior to the emergence of face-selective clusters in IT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). At this age, the monkey could fixate on the stimulus screen, but not with the accuracy and consistency required for retinotopic mapping. The spatial frequency was constant across each 20Â° image, and therefore it was necessary only that the monkey look at the screen. We used a phase-encoded paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henriksson et al., 2008</xref>) to map tuning across eight spatial frequencies (See Materials and methods: Spatial frequency mapping). As in adults, preferred spatial frequency varied as a function of both visual hierarchy and eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). In particular, in each area, foveal regions preferred the highest spatial frequencies and peripheral regions lower spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9bâd</xref>). In addition, the mean preferred spatial frequency decreased moving up the hierarchy, in both dorsal and ventral pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). Thus, although we could not do spatial frequency mapping in neonatal monkeys, we nevertheless did observe a correlation between eccentricity and spatial frequency in infants that were slightly older but still prior to the emergence of category selectivity. We therefore assume that the presence of retinotopy, as measured by correlation patterns in the neonates, implies a corresponding early organization for receptive field scale.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26196.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Spatial tuning correlates with retinotopic organization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>, top) Cortical surface maps of preferred spatial frequency in monkey B3 at 110 days.

Responses to curved and rectilinear stimuli were measured in monkey B4 at 186 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This is around the age when face-selective clusters first emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livingstone et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to spatial frequency, curvature tuning varied as a function of both area and eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10bâe</xref>). Only V1-V4A, OTd, and PITd showed significant selectivity for curvature, and in each of these areas foveal regions preferred curved stimuli more than rectilinear, and peripheral regions either showed no preference or preferred rectilinear stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10câd</xref>). Therefore an organization for curvature tuning is present at least as early as the time in development that face clusters emerge. Area PITv showed a correlation between curvature and eccentricity, but in addition showed stronger average selectivity for rectilinear stimuli. V3A/DP also showed stronger average selectivity for rectilinear stimuli. These two regions correspond to scene-selective cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nasr et al., 2011</xref>), and have been shown to prefer rectilinear stimuli also in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). OTS (combined areas OTS1 and OTS2) also showed stronger average selectivity for rectilinear stimuli. OTS1 and OTS2 are located in a region of the occipitotemporal sulcus that likely corresponds to the scene area LPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>), which also prefers rectilinear stimuli in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kornblith et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that an organization for low-level shape selectivity precedes category selectivity, and contributes to the formation of category-selective domains.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26196.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Low-level shape selectivity correlated with retinotopic organization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cortical surface map of curved-minus-rectilinear contrast in monkey B4 at 186 days.

Visual cortex was functionally distinct from other sensory and non-sensory regions. Across-hemisphere correlations revealed arealization and a hierarchical organization that was similar to that seen in adults. Correlations between areas were retinotopically organized. Our data provide the developmentally earliest account of the global functional organization of the visual system, and demonstrate substrates for the adult organization across the whole visual system, not just thalamo-receipient V1 as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coogan and Van Essen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horton and Hocking, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burkhalter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blasdel et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Areal distinctions and retinotopy were present throughout visual cortex in our earliest data; 10 days of age. It is unlikely that this organization emerged postnatally as a result of visually driven activity. Given the rate of axonal growth (0.4â1.4 mm/day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lallemend et al., 2012</xref>), the wiring of visual cortex needed to support our results most certainly began prenatally. Our finding that arealization is functionally present at birth is consistent with previous anatomical studies in macaques showing that connections within occipital visual areas, V1 and V2, first develop around 100 days of gestation and that adult-like organization is evident later in gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coogan and Van Essen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Killackey and Chalupa, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barone et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BatardiÃ¨re et al., 2002</xref>) as well as within the first weeks of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldwin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horton and Hocking, 1996</xref>). By measuring functional organization of the whole visual system at once, we show that the large-scale organization of the visual system throughout ventral temporal and dorsal parietal cortex is established prenatally, prior to visual experience. How these maps are established is beyond the scope of this study, but must involve a combination of molecular cues and activity-dependent sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McLaughlin and O'Leary, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosa, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Functional organization was apparent at birth throughout the visual system, even though the visual system is still anatomically and functionally immature by several criteria. There is no consensus on what would define a âmatureâ visual areaâanatomy, physiology, connectivity, size, or malleability? InÂ neonates,Â V1 exhibits a high degree of adult-like connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coogan and Van Essen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horton and Hocking, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burkhalter et al., 1993</xref>), impressive adult-like modular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blasdel et al., 1995</xref>) and precise adult-like selectivity to visual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wiesel and Hubel, 1974</xref>). Yet V1 is clearly immature at birth, given how dramatically modifiable young (but not adult) V1 is by postnatal visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wiesel, 1982</xref>). Therefore studies in infant extrastriate cortex showing adult-like physiological properties and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rodman et al., 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">1993b</xref>) should not be interpreted as proving that these areas are mature and unmodifiable by experience. There is also evidence that both the physiology and anatomy of the extrastriate visual system is immature at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldwin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bourne and Rosa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiorpes and Movshon, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiorpes and Movshon, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kiorpes and Movshon, 2014</xref>). Further, the modular organization of IT can be altered by early experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srihasam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Op de Beeck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Srihasam et al., 2012</xref>). With so much evidence that extrastriate visual areas must be immature at birth, one might have expected not to find widespread functional organization within the first postnatal week. Yet we did find retinotopic organization and arealization as early as 10 days of age across the entire cortical visual hierarchy. Given the extensive anatomical and physiological changes that occur over the first postnatal year, the organization we describe must constitute a proto-architecture that subsequently undergoes maturation and refinement as a consequence of postnatal visual experience.</p><p>Neonatal monkeys exhibited a series of hierarchically organized retinotopic maps. The adult visual cortex contains a series of retinotopic maps; each map comprises a two dimensional gradient of visual field location. Correlated activity in neonates similarly varied as a function of visual field representation both along polar angle and eccentricity dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 and 7</xref>). In adults, each map in the hierarchy is not just a copy of the preceding map; rather both stimulus selectivity and receptive-field scale increase moving up the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubel and Wiesel, 1974</xref>). This convergence with increasing receptive field scale is an architectural feature of the visual hierarchy in adults that is thought to be an important computational principle underlying both increasing stimulus selectivity and invariance to scale and position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>). The hierarchical maps in infants similarly do not reflect a simple serial duplication from one map to the next, matched to scale, but the increasing average spatial frequency preference moving up the hierarchy indicates an increase in receptive field scale, as in adults. Thus our data indicate that the scaffolding for hierarchical computations thought to support object recognition is already present at, or emerges shortly after, birth.</p><p>Retinotopic correlation patterns were evident in parts of neonatal inferior temporal cortex that would eventually become selective for object categories, like faces or scenes. In adult humans and macaques, there is a correspondence between foveal bias and face selectivity and between peripheral bias and scene selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasson et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, we found that category selectivity emerges in monkeys at around 6 months of age (~200 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livingstone et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that the IT regions that eventually become face selective have a foveal bias at birth. Further, spatial frequency tuning, and by extension receptive field properties that scale with eccentricity, was identified throughout visual cortex several months before face clusters emerged. This means that different parts of IT would have receptive fields that were already differentially selective for low-level stimulus features, before they became selective for higher-level features, such as category. Thus the correlation between eccentricity and receptive-field size, and between eccentricity and curvature means that a retinotopic proto-map is also a proto-map for low-level stimulus features. Faces differ from most other object categories in being rich in curved contours, whereas scenes are richer in rectilinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Torralba and Oliva, 2003</xref>), so a shape-biased proto-map could contribute to the stereotyped localization of face selectivity to foveal regions of IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srihasam et al., 2014</xref>). We tend to foveate faces but not scenes; so viewing behavior could also contribute to the stereotyped localization of category domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levy et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our data provide novel evidence supporting the hypothesis that a retinotopic proto-organization in IT serves as the scaffolding for subsequent category-selective organization, because it carries with it a shape-based organization and/or because of where in the visual field different categories are preferentially experienced. We propose that the retinotopic organization of visual cortex emerges very early in development as a consequence of molecular cues and self-organizing principles and serves as scaffolding for further experience-dependent specialization. At a broader scale, we propose that parallels exist for other sensory areas, and possibly all of cortex. For example, somatotopic organization was also apparent in the newborn data. Thus topographic maps in general may form the proto-architecture of cortex on which experience-dependent specializations are elaborated; this is likely to be a general principle in development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Monkeys</title><p>Functional MRI studies were carried out on 4 infant/juvenile Macaca mulattas, three female (B2, B3 and B4) and one male (B1), all born in our laboratory.

To enhance contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leite et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanduffel et al., 2001</xref>) we injected 12 mg/kg monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (Feraheme, AMAG Parmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) in the saphenous vein just before scanning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>General preprocessing</title><p>Functional scan data were analyzed using AFNI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/">https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/nif-0000-00259">nif-0000-00259</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox, 1996</xref>), SUMA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/Suma">https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/Suma</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saad and Reynolds, 2012</xref>), Freesurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/nif-0000-00304">nif-0000-00304</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dale et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischl et al., 1999</xref>), JIP Image Analysis Toolkit (written by Joeseph Mandeville; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~jbm/jip/">http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~jbm/jip/</ext-link>) and Matlab (the Mathworks Inc., Natick MA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/nlx_153890">nlx_153890</ext-link>). Each scan session for each monkey was analyzed separately. All images from each scan session were aligned to a single timepoint for that session, detrended and motion corrected using AFNI. Data were spatially filtered using a Gaussian filter of 2 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while preserving spatial specificity. Each scan was normalized to its mean. Data were registered using a two-step linear then non-linear alignment approach (JIP toolkit) to a high-resolution (0.5 mm) anatomical image acquired in each monkey (&gt;1.5 years). First, neonate monkey brains were scaled by 130% in XYZ directions to match their 2-3 year old anatomical images and a 12-parameter linear registration was performed between the mean EPI image for a given session and a high-resolution anatomical image of that monkey when the monkey was 2â3 years of age. Next, a nonlinear, diffeomorphic registration was conducted. After registration, regions of Interest (ROIs) were projected from high-resolution anatomical volumes to in-session EPI images. ROIs were then manually edited to ensure conformity to the grey matter for in-session EPIs. Despite the relatively smaller size of the newborn brain, sampling area of individual voxels remained at a high enough resolution to differentiate individual areas for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Retinotopy analysis</title><p>A Fourier analysis was used to identify spatially selective voxels from the polar angle and eccentricity stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bandettini et al., 1993</xref>). For each voxel, the amplitude and phase â the temporal delay relative to the stimulus onsetÂ â of the harmonic at the stimulus frequency were determined by a Fourier transform of the mean time series. To correctly match the phase delay of the time series of each voxel to the phase of the wedge or ring stimuli, and thereby localize the region of the visual field to which the underlying neurons responded best, the response phases were corrected for a hemodynamic lag (4 s). The counterclockwise (expanding) runs were then reversed to match the clockwise (contracting) runs and averaged together for each voxel. An F-ratio was calculated by comparing the power of the complex signal at the stimulus frequency to the power of the noise (the power of the complex signal at all other frequencies). Data were threshold at p&lt;0.001. 19 visual field maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) were identified in accordance with previous studies using comparable methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kolster et al., 2009</xref>): V1, V2, V3, V4, V4A, MT, MST, FST, V4t, OTd, PITd, PITv, V3A, DP, CIP1, CIP2, LIP. Our definition of area PITd extended from its posterior border with OTd anterior and ventral to the anterior border of PITv. We recently identified two additional visual field maps, OTS1 and OTS2, in the occipitotemporal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>). Areas CIP1 and CIP2 were grouped together, as were areas V3A and DP and areas OTS1 and OTS2, yielding 16 seed areas for all subsequent correlation analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>For correlation analyses, several additional steps were performed on the data: (1) removal of signal deviationÂ &gt;2.5 SDs from the mean (AFNIâs 3dDespike); temporal filtering retaining frequencies in the 0.01â0.1 Hz band; (3) linear and quadratic detrending; and (4) removal by linear regression of several sources of variance: (i) six motion parameter estimates (three translation and three rotation) and their temporal derivatives, (ii) the signal from a ventricular region, (iii) the signal from a white matter region. Ventricular and white matter regions were identified on the mean EPI image for each scan session. Global mean signal removal was not included in the analysis. Each scan was normalized to its mean. To minimize the effect of any evoked response due to the scanner onset, the initial 5 TRs were removed from each rest scan. Regions of interested for correlation analyses were defined based on retinotopic mapping.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Temporal correlation analyses</title><p>Pearson correlation analyses were performed within and across hemispheres on the 16 retinotopic seed areas defined above. The normalized mean signal for each visual field map was calculated for each scan and concatenated. To identify within-hemisphere and across-hemisphere area x area correlations, the mean activity of each cortical area was correlated with the mean activity of every other retinotopic area in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows the across-hemisphere area x area correlation matrix. Across-hemisphere correlations were also calculated between the mean activity of dorsal and ventral quadrants for seed areas V1, V2, V3, V4, and V4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To identify across-hemisphere area x voxel correlations, the mean activity of each retinotopic area was correlated with the activity of each voxel in the contralateral hemisphere. To balance the number of datapoints (voxels) included in deriving the mean signal for each area, all areas were subsampled to the area with the smallest size (number of voxels), and the mean activity was then calculated and used for correlations. 100 iterations of this subsampling were performed and the average correlation coefficient across iterations was computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Areal correlation profile analysis</title><p>We then applied a second Pearson correlation analysis, referred to as the areal correlation profile, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to identify cortical areas whose profile of within-hemisphere correlations with all other cortical areas was similar to the across-hemisphere correlation profiles of individual voxels in the contralateral hemisphere. To do this, we correlated the within-hemisphere area x area correlation matrix with the across-hemisphere area x voxel correlation matrix. Effectively, for each voxel, the profile of correlations across all contralateral retinotopic areas was correlated with the profiles of each areaâs within-hemisphere area x area correlations from the hemisphere contralateral to each voxel. The within-hemisphere area x area correlations served as a template of the connectivity profile for each cortical area. To indicate, for a given areaâs profile, which area should have the strongest correlation, area self-correlations (having a value of 1) were included. When applying the template to across-hemisphere correlations, this tests the idea that homotopic areas will have the strongest correlations. This areal correlation profile approach yielded a voxel-wise measurement (map) of the similarity between each retintopic areaâs within-hemisphere correlation profile and every voxelâs between-hemisphere correlation profile. The original temporal correlations at rÂ &gt;Â 0.15 (tÂ &gt;Â 5.5; p&lt;0.0001, FDR-corrected) were used as the threshold to ensure that a given voxelâs activity was similar to that of the seed area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). See (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcaro et al., 2015</xref>) for similar approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Simulation of correlation due to instrumentation and analyses</title><p>Local signals between nearby voxels (&lt;3â4 mm) within hemisphere contain some degree of correlation simply due to the intrinsic spatial spread of the fMRI signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smirnakis et al., 2007</xref>). To avoid such biases, we focused our analyses on the organization of across-hemisphere correlations, leveraging the fact that contralateral anatomical connections exist between homologous regions in adult monkey and human visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehay et al., 1986</xref>) and that across-hemisphere connectivity has proven valid in reflecting the known organization of adult visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Essen et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kennedy and Dehay, 1988</xref>). Although it should be apparent that the intrinsic spatial spread of the fMRI signal would not interfere with across-hemisphere correlations, we conducted a simulation analysis where we generated random noise datasets matching the temporal length and spatial volumes of the real data acquired in each animal, spatially smoothed the noise data to approximately match the intrinsic spread of the fMRI signal, 3.5 mm, then passed these data through the same pre-processing and correlation analysis pipeline as the real data. As expected, there were no significant correlations in this simulation between visual areas across hemispheres. For within-hemisphere correlations, there were significant correlations between nearby visual areas, though the r coefficients were on average 64% that of the real data for adjacent areas and 20% for nonadjacent areas that border the same area (e.g., between V1 and V3). Within-hemisphere correlations between distal areas wereÂ &lt;10% that of real data and non-significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Community structure and clustering</title><p>To assess the structure of areal correlations, the high-dimensional 16 Ã 16 areal seed correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; averaged across monkeys and hemispheres) was converted to a dissimilarity (Euclidean distance) matrix and non-classical multi-dimensional scaling was applied with Kruskalâs normalized criterion (MATLABâs mdscale). The first two principal dimensions were visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Clustering of the data was performed using (1) a spectral (eigendecompositon) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newman, 2006</xref>) from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>) and (2) grouping the data into an agglomerative hierarchical tree algorithm and clustering based on (Euclidean) distances. The spectral community detection algorithm automatically subdivides a (weighted) network into non-overlapping groups that maximize the number of within-group links and minimize the number of between group links. This approach yields a metric (Q coefficient) of the degree of modularity of the functional network. The hierarchical cluster tree was created using Wardâs linkage. In contrast to the spectral clustering, the hierarchical tree clustering approach requires a cutoff to be set. This cutoff is based on an inconsistency metric that characterizes each link of the tree by comparing its height with the average height of other links at the same level of the hierarchy (i.e., higher values mean less similar). For illustrative purposes, the cutoff was set to a value of 1, which yielded five clusters. This cutoff corresponded to the lowest cutoff before individual clusters comprised single areas. Clustering from higher and lower cutoffs can be inferred by visual inspection of the hierarchical tree. For the hierarchical tree clustering approach, data were clustered directly on the dissimilarity matrix and were visualized as a dendrogram that illustrates the functional distances between areas. This approach yields a metric (cophenetic coefficient) that represents how well the hierarchical tree structure captures the distances between areas in a network. For both approaches, analyses were performed on averaged monkey data, though results were similar in each individual monkey.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>V1 eccentricity bin analysis</title><p>For each hemisphere, V1 was divided into 8 bins evenly spaced in cortical distance along the eccentricity axis up to 10 degrees. Correlations were computed between each bin and all voxels in the ipsilateral hemisphere. To balance the number of datapoints (voxels) included in deriving the mean signal, bins were subsampled to the lowest bin size (number of voxels), and the mean time-series was calculated, and then correlated with the time-series of every voxel. 100 iterations of this subsampling were performed and the average correlation coefficient across iterations was used for each bin to derive an estimate of the correlation between each bin and the rest of the brain. Voxels whose variance was significantly explained by some combination of eccentricity bins were included in subsequent analyses (assessed by linear regression; FÂ &gt;Â 20; p&lt;0.0001).

The authors employ functional connectivity of voxel timeseries to examine the extent to which arealization and retinotopy has emerged in macaques ~10 days old. They demonstrate that interhemispheric functional connectivity is capable of distinguishing different visual areas, and that a voxel's connectivity profile to the contralateral hemisphere well-matches its position in its respective hemisphere. They furthermore demonstrate that the functional connectivity during infancy already contains the hierarchical structure of adulthood and that this retinotopy may serve as a scaffold on which later category-selective regions emerge.</p><p>Overall, the study is thorough and very well done. This project is novel in that it extends our understanding of visual cortex organization into a very early developmental timepoint, and across the entire visual cortex. It also makes the important observation that regions of cortex that will later exhibit category-selectivity have a functional connectivity bias to certain eccentricity bands that precedes their category-selectivity. Retinotopy has for some time been a proposed organizational principle of high-level visual cortex and this study nicely offers strong evidence in its favor. I recommend this study for publication.</p><p>I have only a few minor comments and questions for the authors to address.</p><p>Subsection âArealization of newborn visual cortexâ: what is the t value associated with r values?</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, please put actual r-values and not min max on the colorbars.</p><p>It took some effort to understand what was going into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. A schematic illustrating the procedure might help. Below I describe what I think is going on. If it's wrong then the text might need clarification:</p><p>You correlate a voxel with the mean signal from each area in the other hemisphere. This gives you a between-hemisphere connectivity profile (BHCP). Separately, for each area in the other hemisphere you derive the areal correlation profile (ACP), which is an area's correlation with each other area in the ipsilateral hemisphere. You then take the voxel's between-hemisphere connectivity profile and correlate it with the ACP of an area in the other hemisphere, and then you color it according to &quot;how much its profile looked like that area's profile&quot; and you do this in a voxel for each area giving you <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which is why a voxel can take on different values in each map depending on which area its BHCP is being correlated with. However, a voxel will have a BHCP vector of length N (N=number of areas), however an area with will have an ACP vector of N-1 because you can't correlate it with itself. Did you just exclude that point in the vector when correlating? Or have I misunderstood something?</p><p>The phrase &quot;spatial pattern correlations&quot; is misleading: the pattern of activity in V1, for example, is not being correlated with anything. A better term would be something along the lines of profile correlation, since you're correlating profiles of connectivity.</p><p>In the subsection âRetinotopic organization in newbornâ: what does this mean &quot;these correlations likely reflect the underlying topographic organization within each area, not solely mirror symmetrical point-to-point connections between hemispheres&quot;? Different quadrants don't have point-to-point connections, right? Except for maybe stitching together of the vertical meridian they share, is that what you mean?</p><p>The analysis and result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is striking. However, I'm curious to know what is the outcome of functional connectivity analysis done during infancy when repeated in adulthood. Is the connectivity structure unchanged, or is there a refinement of the connectivity structure? Either way the result is will be informative. If the adult functional connectivity looks closer to the retinotopic mapping data, then that suggests that inherent connectivity is refined with development, which is interesting. However, it functional connectivity remains the same as it was in infancy, it suggests that the connectivity provides a scaffold on which later retinotopic maps develop.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is very nice! I'm satisfied with it as is. A future analysis might be to make a model relating cycles-per-degree (CPD) tuning in the infant data to the population receptive field (pRF) size of a voxel in the adult data. That will enable using independent data in infancy to determine if one can predict the pRF size in adulthood within each voxel. This could provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that CPD is related to pRF size.</p><p>While I recognize this is beyond the scope of the current paper, it would be interesting in the future to try and estimate the population receptive field of each voxel as a weighted sum of timecourses from voxels in V1 or prior visual areas. Using the known transformation of the visual field to V1, one then could use this weighting to derive the pRF of every voxel in subsequent areas and estimate the pRF size and eccentricity and then compare it to adult data. Might be a nice future direction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Based on monkey fMRI data, Arcaro and Livingstone showed that the newborn visual system contains a topographic organization reflecting that observed in adult macaques. This proto-organization emerges before the development of face selectivity and they propose that it provides a scaffold for the development of the fully-developed visual system, including category selective patches.</p><p>This is a very well written manuscript based on a data set that is exceedingly challenging to obtain. I truly commend the authors for this achievement. The analyses are state-of-the-art and well-done. I truly enjoyed reading this manuscript that conveys a very important result which is difficult/impossible to obtain without whole-brain imaging. This message should be of interest to a broad readership not restricted to vision scientists â as the authors may have discovered a general developmental principle. I only have a few comments that should be taken into account before I can formally recommend publication for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) An important (though not critical) result is the lack of visually-driven activity in cortex in newborns while rest correlations between V1 and extrastriate cortex are already profoundly present. Visually-driven activity becomes strong at an age of &gt;30 days. I've several questions with regard to this finding:</p><p>A) The two measures are fundamentally different (regression versus correlation), which required quite different pre-processing steps. Did the authors consider age-dependent differences in the hemodynamic response that may explain this result? This could affect the regression analysis but not the correlation analysis -and it could explain the difference in visual responses between day 10 and 30.

There is no obvious reason to confuse the readership.

A schematic illustrating the procedure might help. Below I describe what I think is going on. If it's wrong then the text might need clarification:</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this feedback. It has been challenging to communicate this analysis effectively. We have a schematic illustrating the procedure in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1. Note, this contains an illustration for both the areal pairwise correlations (referred to as Areal Correlation Profile) as well as the Across-hemisphere correlation profile.</p><p><italic>You correlate a voxel with the mean signal from each area in the other hemisphere. This gives you a between-hemisphere connectivity profile (BHCP). Separately, for each area in the other hemisphere you derive the areal correlation profile (ACP), which is an area's correlation with each other area in the ipsilateral hemisphere. You then take the voxel's between-hemisphere connectivity profile and correlate it with the ACP of an area in the other hemisphere, and then you color it according to &quot;how much its profile looked like that area's profile&quot; and you do this in a voxel for each area giving you <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which is why a voxel can take on different values in each map depending on which area its BHCP is being correlated with. However, a voxel will have a BHCP vector of length N (N=number of areas), however an area with will have an ACP vector of N-1 because you can't correlate it with itself. Did you just exclude that point in the vector when correlating? Or have I misunderstood something?</italic> </p><p>Your summary is correct. In Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, we refer to the âBHCPâ as Across-hemisphere correlation profile. When comparing the BHCP with the ACP, we do use the full ACP vector (not N-1), even though the areal correlation with itself is 1. We consider the ACP a template of what the connectivity should be. By including the area self-correlation (having a value of 1) in the template, this serves the purpose of setting the correlation value greater than any other pairwise correlation and tests the idea that homotopic correlations will have the strongest correlations. While working on a previous experiment looking at correlations between visual cortex and the thalamus in humans (Arcaro et al. 2015 Journal of Neuroscience), the first author tried several variants of this approach: (1) using a spearman rank correlation, (2) calculating the self-correlation between sub-sampled, non-overlapping portions of a given area, (3) simply dropping the self-correlation (N-1) as the reviewer suggested. All alternative approaches yielded very similar results to the current approach used in this study. We have uploaded the correlation code to GitHub with a sample dataset and included options to compute with Spearman rank correlations and use an n-1 approach: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mikearcaro/AreaProfileCorrelation">https://github.com/mikearcaro/AreaProfileCorrelation.</ext-link></p><p><italic>The phrase &quot;spatial pattern correlations&quot; is misleading: the pattern of activity in V1, for example, is not being correlated with anything. A better term would be something along the lines of profile correlation, since you're correlating profiles of connectivity.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We actually had been using the term âprofile correlationâ previously (Arcaro et al. 2015), but worried that would be too opaque to readers and wanted to emphasize that these correlations were not temporal, but rather across areas. We acknowledge that âspatialâ may be misleading and now refer to these correlations as âprofile correlationsâ. We have updated the text in the subsections âArealization of newborn visual cortexâ and âCorrelation Analysisâ accordingly.</p><p><italic>In the subsection âRetinotopic organization in newbornâ: what does this mean &quot;these correlations likely reflect the underlying topographic organization within each area, not solely mirror symmetrical point-to-point connections between hemispheres&quot;? Different quadrants don't have point-to-point connections, right? Except for maybe stitching together of the vertical meridian they share, is that what you mean?</italic> </p><p>That is correct; we were referring to the point-to-point correlations between overlapping receptive fields along the vertical meridian. Even in posterior occipital areas with relatively small RFs (e.g., V2 and V3) contralateral connections can spread up to several millimeters from the vertical meridian. To our knowledge the extent of the spread of such connections for higher order areas in temporal and parietal cortex have not been similarly quantified, but, given the relatively large receptive fields, we expect the spread (and link between homotopic quadrants) to be substantial. We now clarify this in the text with this additional comment:</p><p>âEven though right and left hemispheres represent left and right visual fields, respectively, colossal connections linking neurons with overlapping receptive fields at or near the vertical meridian (Dehay, Kennedy and Bullier, 1986) do generate correlated activity between hemispheres in adults(Heinzle, Kahnt and Haynes, 2011).â</p><p><italic>The analysis and result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is striking. However, I'm curious to know what is the outcome of functional connectivity analysis done during infancy when repeated in adulthood. Is the connectivity structure unchanged, or is there a refinement of the connectivity structure? Either way the result is will be informative. If the adult functional connectivity looks closer to the retinotopic mapping data, then that suggests that inherent connectivity is refined with development, which is interesting. However, it functional connectivity remains the same as it was in infancy, it suggests that the connectivity provides a scaffold on which later retinotopic maps develop.</italic> </p><p>We are presently working on tracking the retinotopic organization of older/juvenile (2-3 years of age) monkeys. So far, the organization appears to be similar, though it is difficult to make direct comparisons with the correlation approach. To match these early neonate data to the 2-3 year old data, we needed to scale the brains by ~130%, which means our effective sampling resolution was coarser for the neonate data. While our registration was good, this inherently introduces extra smoothing. In addition, as the brain size grew, the distance of medial regions from the coil grew, effectively shifting the SNR profile across the brain. These factors can bias the data in varied ways and we feel that some correction would be needed to appropriately assess any differences. We agree that this would be a very interesting avenue to explore and feel that in addition relating cpd to pRF size (as the reviewer suggests next) will be a complementary approach.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is very nice! I'm satisfied with it as is. A future analysis might be to make a model relating cycles-per-degree (CPD) tuning in the infant data to the population receptive field (pRF) size of a voxel in the adult data. That will enable using independent data in infancy to determine if one can predict the pRF size in adulthood within each voxel. This could provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that CPD is related to pRF size.</italic> </p><p>We agree. It will be interesting to compute pRFs and compare to the CPD in both infant and adult monkeys. We feel this will likely be the most accurate approach for addressing the prior comment.</p><p><italic>While I recognize this is beyond the scope of the current paper, it would be interesting in the future to try and estimate the population receptive field of each voxel as a weighted sum of timecourses from voxels in V1 or prior visual areas. Using the known transformation of the visual field to V1, one then could use this weighting to derive the pRF of every voxel in subsequent areas and estimate the pRF size and eccentricity and then compare it to adult data. Might be a nice future direction.</italic> </p><p>Definitely! In relation to the above comment, we plan to use an approach such as connective field modeling (e.g., Haak et al. 2013; Gravel et al. 2014; Bock et al. 2015) to compare the pRF estimates from the connective field modeling to direct pRF measurements in monkeys when they are older. As the reviewer said, this approach in conjunction with spatial frequency mapping could be a great way to track any changes to retinotopic organization across early development, though the challenges discussed above in making comparisons across different ages/brain sizes would also apply to this approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] 1) An important (though not critical) result is the lack of visually-driven activity in cortex in newborns while rest correlations between V1 and extrastriate cortex are already profoundly present. Visually-driven activity becomes strong at an age of &gt;30 days. I've several questions with regard to this finding:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The two measures are fundamentally different (regression versus correlation), which required quite different pre-processing steps. Did the authors consider age-dependent differences in the hemodynamic response that may explain this result? This could affect the regression analysis but not the correlation analysis -and it could explain the difference in visual responses between day 10 and 30. This strange GLM finding also conflicts with studies showing that many neurons show already stimulus selectivity around the time of natural eye opening, although weaker than in adults.</italic> </p><p>We did evaluate whether differences in the hemodynamic response could account for the apparent lack of visually-evoked activity in the early data. We conducted regression analyses with several shifts in the delay. No visually-evoked activity was observed when temporally shifting the MION function. We agree that this is in apparent conflict with previous electrophysiological data, but this may reflect differences between physiological measurements and metabolic measures: a similar lack of early activity has been observed using deoxyglucose (Distler et al. 1996), which is closer to the hemodynamic response, we measured. We do not think that the lack of early visually-evoked responses with imaging implies that there is a lack of neuronal activity. It is likely a combination of some physiological maturity and behavioral state (see below). We reported the lack of very early visual responsiveness in V1 in our recent paper (Livingstone et al. 2017: Development of the macaque face-patch system). To further address this point, we have added the following text:</p><p>âThough the lack of early visually-evoked fMRI activity is in apparent contrast with previous electrophysiological findings that demonstrated visual responsiveness in infants (Rust, Schultz and Movshon, 2002; Zhang et al., 2005; Endo et al., 2000), this may reflect differences between physiological and metabolic measurements as a similar lack of early activity has been observed using deoxyglucose (Distler et al., 1996).â</p><p><italic>B) A mutually non-exclusive explanation may be that the newborns simply closed their eyes inside the scanner (due to anxiety?) â as it must have been their first time in a rather obnoxious environment for them. Were eye-movement recordings analyzed in these very young infants?</italic> </p><p>When measuring visual responses we used eye-tracking information and selected only blocks where the eyes were open. Achieving central fixation was not possible in these infant monkeys, so we settled for selecting blocks where the monkeysâ eyes were open and they were looking at the screen. Even in the âeyes-openâ data (which is what was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we did not see significant evoked responses in cortex (with the exception of peripheral V1), though we did find a very strong response in the LGN that were smaller or absent in the eyes closed runs. We have been conducting additional experiments to follow up on this, but we do not have anything more conclusive to report at this time. We think this is an important result to probe further, but not necessary for the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors scaled the newborn brain by 130% relative to match it with the older brain and non-rigid registration was not applied, as far as I can see. How confident are the authors that this procedure is valid? Most results hinge on the back-mapping of maps acquired at an older age to the newborn cortex, so this is an important analytical step that requires validation. Why not adding non-rigid registration procedures?</italic> </p><p>This is an important detail of our analysis pipeline and our methods needed clarification. We did use a non-rigid registration for all EPIs to anatomical volumes. We used Joseph Mandevilleâs JIP toolkit. In our experience, JIP outperforms AFNIâs 3dQwarp and FSLâs FNIRT. To align a neonateâs EPI to an anatomical volume at an older age, we first scale the EPI brain by ~%130 in XYZ directions, we then perform a 12-parameter linear registration to get the volumes in rough correspondence. We then perform a nonlinear, diffeomorphic registration (all part of the JIP toolkit). To improve registration accuracy of ventral areas, we manually drew brain masks that removed the cerebellum for both EPIs and anatomicals prior to registration. Good back-projection of areal ROIs also requires good surface segmentation. Monkey surfaces were created using Freesurfer. After using their automated scripts for generating segmentations, surfaces were manually edited by the first author slice-by-slice in all three orientations to ensure proper segmentation of the grey and white matter. This is time consuming, but worth the investment. After projecting ROIs into the neonate EPI volumes, ROIs were manually edited to ensure conformity to the grey matter. We have expanded our description of the alignment in the subsection âGeneral preprocessingâ. We have also included a reviewer figure that illustrates the accuracy of registration.</p><p>This figure shows the alignment of EPI to the monkeyâs own anatomy. Blue indicates surfaces and red white matter. Note the good registration of anatomical details such as the âbumpsâ in the STS along the A-P orientation) (sagittal slice), which can vary greatly across individuals.</p><p><italic>3) I'm puzzled why the authors decided to use a novel nomenclature for areas that have been described previously. Apparently, previously described OTd (Janssens et al. and Kolster et al. 2014) corresponds to the new PITd (present manuscript) and previous PITd with aPIT (present manuscript). There is no obvious reason to confuse the readership. New areas PITd/PITv/ OT/aPIT is supposed to form a cluster with a shared foveal representation, but the same holds true for V4A, PITd, PITv, and OTd as described in Janssens et al. The data presented in the present manuscript are not detailed enough to defend a new nomenclature.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer has made a valid point. To maintain consistency with the prior literature, we have redefined the areas in accordance with Janssens and Kolsterâs papers. We have re-run all affected analyses and updated all relevant figures.</p><p>The reviewer was correct in his interpretation of our areas. What we referred to as PITd is referred to as OTd in Janssens et al. and Kolster et al. (and OT is V4A). We found the organization of V4A to be more complicated than previously described. In our mapping data, V4A consistently fell in-between the posterior fovea shared by V1-V4 and the anterior fovea shared by PIT and OTd. In addition, we found that the vertical meridians comprising the anterior borders of V4A to fork such that part of that border bends posterior and part bends anterior with off meridian representations in-between. Taken together, it was not entirely clear to us that V4A should be wholly attributed to the anterior cluster with OTd and PITd/v. We opted to split V4A along this meridian fork such that cortex from the anterior border of V4 up to the posterior fork was labeled as V4A and the cortex between the forks was labeled OT. We then labeled this anterior half OT, since it straddled occipital and temporal cortex. We labeled OTd (Kolster and Janssens) as PITd, since it is located immediately dorsal to PITv with the border between them straddling the crown of the lower bank of the STS. For the anterior-most area previously described as PITd by Kolster and Janssens (we refer to as aPIT), we found in most hemispheres that the polar angle map extended ventrally to PITv. To us, this made sense, as the PIT/OT cluster would then form an enclosed, circular cluster (similar to MT). As the reviewer appropriately pointed out, we have not substantiated our claim for diverging from Kolster and Janssensâ proposed organization. The particular parcellation of these areas is not critical for the current study. We have taken the advice of the reviewer and adjusted our area labels to match the previous literature.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this revision, the authors addressed most of the comments raised in the original review.

Thus, the outcome of this analysis will flesh out what the authors mean by proto-retinotopic organization.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for misunderstanding the reviewerâs original comment. We thought the reviewer was asking us to perform quantitative comparisons on the degree of retinotopic organization between young and older monkey data, which we do not think this is appropriate to perform on the correlation data for the reasons outlined previously. Given the above comment, it is now clear the reviewer was requesting us to just show that the retinotopic organization is present in the correlation patterns of older monkeys. This is a good suggestion. We agree that it is important to verify that the retinotopic correlation structure remains present in older monkeys.</p><p>We have collected comparable resting data in monkeys B1 and B2 (8 runs @ 40 mins. total) and have re-run the eccentricity correlation analysis. These monkeys are now âjuvenileâ (~3 years of age). We include these new data in a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In these new juvenile correlations, we find a similar organization to the neonate correlation data. The mean absolute deviation (across all visual areas tested) between the neonate correlation data and the juvenile correlation data is 2.0 degrees, comparable to the 2.2 degrees mean deviation between the neonate correlation data and the eccentricity mapping at &gt; 1.5 years. Interestingly, the mean deviation between the juvenile correlation data and the eccentricity mapping was only 1.4 degrees. It is enticing to infer that the greater similarity between the juvenile correlations and eccentricity mapping indicates a refinement of retinotopic organization over the first 3 years of development. However, we are hesitant to make such inferences on such a modest difference given that the brain shape of the 3-year-old correlation data is more similar to the retinotopy mapping data and the neonate data had to be enlarged by ~130% in each dimension. Further, changes in the SNR profile and coil positioning due to brain size differences can also affect correlations. Regardless, these data demonstrate that the retinotopic correlation patterns of visual cortex are indeed present in juvenile monkeys. We include this new data and a discussion of the possible interpretations in the Results, subsection âRetinotopic organization in newbornâ, third paragraph.</p><p>We would also like to point out that the ICA analyses reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref> further demonstrate the presence of retinotopic activity patterns in older monkeys. In these figures, we showed that foveal and peripheral components were identified in the neonate data as well as when the same monkeys were older (both prior to and after the emergence of face patches). In contrast, a face patch system ICA was only identified AFTER we could reliably detect task-evoked face selectivity in these monkeys, indicating that the retinotopic organization is present at birth, and likely serves as the scaffolding for subsequent development as it remains present through development. We have expanded discussion of these ICA results in the last paragraph of the subsection âRetinotopic organization in newbornâ.</p><p>To be clear, even though the retinotopic organization is present at birth and persists over development, we think it is entirely possible that the maps are refined through experience.

However, these differences might reflect non-biological variance (e.g., the precision of anatomical registration and proximity of coil placement due to brain size differences across ages). These data indicate that extensive retinotopic organization across both early and higher visual cortex was already present within the first weeks of life.â</italic> </p><p>In the Results section (corresponding to revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we did compare the resting state correlations in juveniles to neonates. We stated: &quot;Excluding V1, the mean absolute deviation between eccentricity correlations at newborn and juvenile ages was 2.0 degrees across retinotopic areas, in both hemispheres, in both monkeys.&quot; In the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we further provide a breakdown of this deviation for different regions of visual cortex: &quot;(1.8, 2.5, 1.7, and 2.5 for occipital areas, MT cluster, inferior temporal, and dorsal/parietal areas, respectively).&quot;</p><p>As we understand this comment, the reviewer had a different analysis in mind than what we provided, but what we have provided (i.e., updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) was sufficient. If the above figure clarification doesn't fully address the remaining concern and if the different analysis the reviewer had in mind addresses something substantially different from what we have provided, we would be happy to include in a revision. In that case, we ask that the reviewer provide more specific details on exactly what analysis he/she is thinking of to make sure we fully address it in this next revision.</p><p>We have made one addition to the âRetinotopic organization in newbornsâ, Results section.</p><p>We originally only reported across-hemisphere correlations between dorsal and ventral quadrant pairs. Within-hemisphere correlations were not originally reported due to the likely influence of the intrinsic spatial spread of the fMRI signal. While this issue was discussed earlier in the Results, we realized that this was not thoroughly explained in this section. As such, the reasoning for using across-hemisphere correlations for these analyses may be lost on some readers. We now first report the within-hemisphere correlations between quadrants then explain that these correlations may be partly biased due to spread of the fMRI signal. We now use this to better motivate the use of across-hemisphere correlations. No changes were made to the following across-hemisphere correlations section. The beginning of this section now reads:</p><p>âAn even finer level of differentiation within individual neonatal visual areas was apparent as a series of retinotopic representations that could be inferred from correlation patterns. [â¦] To further rule out the influence of cortical proximity on retinotopic correlations, across-hemisphere correlations were assessed between posterior areas V1, V2, V3, V4, and V4A as a function of their dorsal and ventral quadrants.â</p><p><italic>What is still missing is a figure illustrating these results. In the response letter they write: &quot;We include these new data in a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.&quot; However, I did not see these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> only shows the resting state correlations in the neonates. Please update <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to include the correlations in the juveniles.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer's previous request that we &quot;provide functional connectivity analysis in the older monkeys to enable the comparison with baby monkeys,&quot; we included a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in which we show functional connectivity analysis in the same monkeys at both neonate and older ages. In the response letter we referred to this figure as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (that was the original figure number), but because we moved another figure from supplementary to the main text (in response to a request from reviewer #1), the manuscript figure is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It was only the response letter that referred to this Figure as #6, the manuscript correctly refers to this Figure as #7. We are sorry for this mix-up. This should address reviewer #1's remaining concern: &quot;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> only shows the resting state correlations in the neonates.&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, not <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, shows the resting state correlations (as a function of eccentricity) for both neonate and juvenile ages.</p></body></sub-article></article>
