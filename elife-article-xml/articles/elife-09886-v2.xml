Histone H3 acetylation at K56 and phosphorylation at T45 are two important chromatin modifications that accompany chromatin assembly. Here we have identified the protein kinase Pkc1 as a key regulator that coordinates the deposition of these modifications in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> under conditions of replicative stress. Pkc1 phosphorylates the histone acetyl transferase Rtt109 and promotes its ability to acetylate H3K56. Our data also reveal novel cross-talk between two different histone modifications as Pkc1 also enhances H3T45 phosphorylation and this modification is required for H3K56 acetylation. Our data therefore uncover an important role for Pkc1 in coordinating the deposition of two different histone modifications that are important for chromatin assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09886.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09886.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09886.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Prior to cell division, DNA must be copied so that each new cell gets a complete copy of the cell’s genetic instructions. But DNA is so long that it is stored in a heavily compacted form in the nucleus of the cell, with the strands of DNA coiled around several proteins called histones. Before the DNA is copied, it must be unfurled. Then each new copy of DNA must be repackaged to fit compactly inside the nucleus of each new cell.</p><p>If errors occur in the process of copying DNA, it can lead to genetic mutations that may cause diseases like cancer. To prevent this, cells have mechanisms to identify errors and correct them before the DNA is repackaged. This requires a pause to allow the repairs to occur before the DNA recoils. However, it is not completely clear how this process is controlled.</p><p>Now, Darieva et al. show that an enzyme called protein kinase C (or Pkc1 for short) is essential to repackaging DNA after the errors are corrected. Several experiments showed that Pkc1 plays an important role when cells were exposed to stressful conditions that potentially cause errors in DNA copying. Specifically, Pkc1 helps prepare the third histone protein (histone H3) so that DNA can recoil around it. Pkc1 waits until the stressful conditions have passed and the DNA has been repaired to make the necessary changes.</p><p>Once the stress has passed, Pkc1 adds a phosphate to another enzyme called Rtt109 that prepares the histone. The Pkc1 simultaneously contributes to another necessary change to histone H3. These new details about DNA repackaging may help researchers understand how cells protect against DNA copying errors, and how this process goes wrong in cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09886.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09886.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>Rtt109</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H1010858/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103857/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Society Wolfson</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromatin structure is altered following DNA replication stress through the activity of protein kinase C signalling which leads to functionally coupled histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the cell cycle one of the key processes following DNA replication is the re-assembly of chromatin on the newly replicated DNA. This involves the re-deposition of both pre-existing and newly synthesised histones into intact nucleosomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ransom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</xref>). This process must be tightly controlled and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> one key event is the Rtt109-mediated modification of histone H3 by acetylation of lysine 56 (H3K56) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>). Rtt109 cooperates with two different histone chaperones Asf1 and Vps75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsubota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>) and although it is generally accepted that Asf1 is the major chaperone involved in promoting H3K56 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tang et al., 2011</xref>), recent evidence suggests a role for Vps75 in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radovani et al., 2013</xref>). However, the signalling pathways controlling Rtt109-mediated H3K56 acetylation are unknown. Another important modification that occurs coincidentally with DNA replication is H3 phosphorylation at threonine T45 (H3T45) but current evidence suggests that this modification has no relationship with the closely located H3K56 acetylation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). In the context of an unperturbed cell cycle, Cdc7-Dbf4 has been shown to be a major kinase involved in controlling H3T45 phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> possesses one protein kinase C isoform, Pkc1, and it is known to play a major role in cell wall integrity signalling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levin, 2005</xref>). Pkc1 has a growing number of nuclear functions and through genetic experiments this protein kinase has previously been implicated in cell cycle events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levin, 2005</xref>). Part of this role can be attributed to its connection to pathways sensing cell wall integrity and its effects on the activity of the downstream MAP kinase pathway. However MAP kinase-independent roles for Pkc1 have emerged and Pkc1 was recently shown to directly affect the cell cycle by inhibiting the activity of the transcriptional coactivator protein Ndd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darieva et al., 2012</xref>). This finding suggested that Pkc1p might act as a checkpoint kinase under conditions of replicative stress where progression to G2 phase is inhibited. However, mutant strains containing <italic>ndd1</italic> mutant alleles lacking the Pkc1 phosphorylation sites did not fully re-capitulate the <italic>pkc1</italic> mutant phenotypes, indicating that additional defects are associated with loss of Pkc1 activity. Indeed, <italic>pkc1</italic> mutants are sensitive to hydroxurea (HU) treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Queralt and Igual, 2005</xref>), suggesting a potential role for Pkc1 in controlling the response to replicative stress. It is unclear how Pkc1 might affect replicative stress but previous genetic studies have linked <italic>PKC1</italic> and components of the RSC chromatin remodelling complex and Pkc1 overexpression can suppress the defects associated with <italic>RSC</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosotani et al., 2001</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levin et al., 2005</xref>). This is suggestive of a potential role for Pkc1 in regulating chromatin assembly during DNA replication.</p><p>Here, we have investigated the potential role of Pkc1 in controlling chromatin modifications during replicative stress and found that it coordinates the deposition of two histone marks on histone H3, T45 phosphorylation and K56 acetylation. Mechanistically, Pkc1 controls H3K56 acetylation through phosphorylation-dependent activation of Rtt109. Moreover, Pkc1 also promotes H3T45 phosphorylation and this modification is important for the coordinated deposition of H3K56 acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pkc1 is required for cell viability and chromatin integrity under replicative stress conditions</title><p>To examine whether Pkc1 has a role in protecting cells from replicative stress we first determined cell sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) in the presence and absence of active Pkc1. To do this we made use of strains containing temperature sensitive <italic>pkc1</italic> alleles which could be inactivated by incubating yeast cells at 34ºC, thereby negating the confounding effects of heat shock stress response obtained using the traditionally used <italic>pkc1<sup>ts </sup></italic>allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasia et al., 2012</xref>). In comparison to cells containing wild-type <italic>PKC1</italic> (DK186), temperature sensitive <italic>pkc1-14</italic> (DK1690) cells, grown at 34ºC to inactivate Pkc1 were inviable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top panel) consistent with previous studies using a <italic>pkc1</italic>Δ deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Queralt and Igual, 2005</xref>). Loss of <italic>PKC1</italic> function results in cell lysis in the absence of osmotic support. The presence of sorbitol saved the <italic>pkc1-14</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel) but HU sensitivity was observed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel). This suggested a role for Pkc1 other than signalling through the well studied downstream MAP kinase cascade which includes the kinase Bck1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1993</xref>). Indeed <italic>bck1</italic>Δ (Y01328) cells were not sensitive to HU, further emphasising a new alternative mechanism of action for Pkc1 under replicative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether the kinase activity of Pkc1 is needed to protect cells from replicative stress, we attempted to rescue <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells by re-expressing a catalytically dead (KD) version of Pkc1 in the presence of HU. However, while wild-type (WT) Pkc1 was able to rescue the growth defect of <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells, the catalytically dead version was unable to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09886.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pkc1p is required for cell viability and chromatin integrity in the presence of hydroxyurea.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Cell growth assays.

We therefore examined whether Pkc1 is required for H3K56 acetylation under replicative stress conditions. Upon release from a HU block, wild-type cells showed accumulation of acetylated H3K56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 1–6). In contrast, temperature sensitive <italic>pkc1-21</italic> cells (DK1697) showed much reduced levels of H3K56 acetylation when grown at 34ºC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 7–12) even though they had progressed through S phase and arrested at G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, this effect was not limited to strains harbouring the <italic>pkc1-21</italic> allele but was also observed in a different temperature sensitive strain, harbouring the <italic>pkc1-14</italic> allele either upon release from a HU block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or upon entry into S phase upon release from an α factor block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This suggested that Pkc1-mediated phosphorylation might be important for stabilising Rtt109. Indeed, we found that Rtt109 protein was expressed to lower levels in <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was not due to a transcriptional defect as <italic>RTT109</italic> mRNA levels were elevated in <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that these cells are attempting to compensate for the loss in Rtt109 protein. This lower level of Rtt109 likely contributes to the decreased levels of H3K56 acetylation we observed. Together, these results indicated that Pkc1-mediated Rtt109 phosphorylation is required for maintaining Rtt109 protein levels and H3K56 acetylation levels as cells recover from HU-mediated replicative stress.</p><p>One prediction from these results is that any chromatin changes should manifest themselves in similar gene expression profiles when <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells or cells expressing Rtt109(T46A) are compared. Indeed, in cells released from HU block, a highly significant overlap was observed for <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells or cells expressing Rtt109(T46A) in genes either downregulated or upregulated compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Importantly no such significant overlaps were observed when we considered genes that were regulated in opposite directions in the two mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, when we considered the biological processes that were affected, there was a strong overlap in gene ontology (GO) terms, with over-representation of GO terms associated with processes such as 'cell wall' and 'nucleolus' strongly associated with both mutant strains and reciprocal effects seen with 'telomere maintenance' and 'DNA helicase activity' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). These data therefore further support a strong association between Pkc1 activity, phosphorylation of Rtt109 at T46 and subsequent downstream effects on chromatin structure and gene expression. One prediction of these results is that the phosphomimetic version of Rtt109 might be able to bypass the defects seen in <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells. However, no rescue of the growth defects of <italic>pkc1-14</italic> cells in the presence of HU was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore a working model suggested a direct role for Pkc1 in controlling H3K56 acetylation through Rtt109 phosphorylation but also that additional activities were controlled by Pkc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09886.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>Pkc1</italic> and <italic>RTT109</italic> phosphorylation mutants generate overlapping gene expression defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagrams showing the overlap of significantly upregulated (top) or downregulated (bottom) genes in <italic>pkc1-14</italic> (DK1690) or <italic>rtt109(T46A)</italic> (DZ6) cells released from a 200 mM HU block.

We therefore examined whether Pkc1 could phosphorylate H3T45 in vitro by using purified histone H3 and immunoprecipitated Pkc1p. Efficient H3 phosphorylation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and phosphorylation at T45 was confirmed as the only major phosphorylation site by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Importantly, H3K56 acetylation was greatly reduced in cells containing the H3(T45A) allele upon release from a HU block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In contrast only a small change in H3K56 acetylation was observed upon release from an alpha factor block under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). However, if cells were released from an alpha factor-mediated G1 arrest into HU, and the HU subsequently removed, H3K56 acetylation again accumulated following HU removal in wild-type cells. This accumulation of H3K56 acetylation did not occur in cells harbouring the <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> mutant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggested functional coupling between H3T45 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation. To further probe this phenomenon, we asked whether the Rtt109(T46D) mutant could bypass the defects seen in cells containing the <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> mutant allele. However, only low levels of H3K56 acetylation were observed in the presence of Rtt109(T46D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), demonstrating that this protein was unable to suppress the defects from H3(T45A) thereby indicating a crucial role for H3T45 phosphorylation in promoting H3K56 acetylation. Indeed, the Rtt109(T46D) mutant couldn’t bypass the growth defects of <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> cells in HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We also tested whether Rtt109(D) could bypass the HU-mediated growth defects of <italic>H3(K56R)</italic> cells but again this mutant was unable to rescue the growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This further emphasises the importance of Rtt109-mediated H3K56 acetylation in protecting against the deleterious effects of HU treatment, even when H3T45 was available for phosphorylation. These results lead to a model whereby Pkc1 signals through promoting phosphorylation of both Rtt109 and histone H3 to promote H3K56 acetylation. One prediction from this model is that downstream gene expression defects should be at least partially shared by <italic>pkc1-14, H3(T45A)</italic> and <italic>Rtt109(T46A)</italic> mutant strains. Indeed pairwise comparisons of the gene expression changes observed between these strains following release from a HU block, showed highly significant overlaps in genes being upregulated in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly though, of the 51 genes showing significant upregulation in the <italic>pkc1</italic> and <italic>Rtt109(T46A)</italic> mutant strains, 41 (80%) were also upregulated in the <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Moreover, consistent co-regulation of genes in the 'DNA helicase' GO term category could be observed across all mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These mutants therefore exhibit common defects in gene expression. This finding provides further supporting evidence that adds to the mechanistic links we have uncovered between Pkc1, Rtt109, H3T45 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation, and strengthens our major discovery that Pkc1 coordinates histone H3 modifications during the replicative stress response.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09886.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of histone H3 T45 is required for efficient H3 K56 acetylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Western blot analysis of K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac) and total H3 levels in (MSY748) cells containing plasmids expressing H3(WT) or the H3(T45A) mutant following release from an alpha factor or HU block for the indicated times.

Histone H3 T45 phosphorylation and K56 acetylation are two important modifications that occur during S phase and are required for chromatin reassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ozdemir et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). Here we show that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pkc1 coordinates the deposition of these two marks under conditions of replicative stress. Previous results had implicated the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase complex in directly controlling H3T45 phosphorylation during S phase of and unperturbed cell cycle but this kinase did not affect H3K56 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). However, a role under replicative stress conditions was not investigated and residual levels of H3T45 phosphorylation were observed in the <italic>cdc7</italic>Δ cells, indicating the existence of another H3T45 kinase. Indeed, Cdc7/Dbf4 activity has been shown to be downregulated under conditions of replicative stress, suggesting the involvement of a different histone H3 kinase under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>). Here we focussed on histone H3 modification control under replicative stress conditions and in combination with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2010</xref>) our data indicate that at least two different kinases are involved in controlling H3T45 phosphorylation, with Cdc7/Dbf4 operating during an unperturbed cell cycle and Pkc1 operating under replicative stress conditions where it also coordinates H3K56 acetylation.</p><p>In cells subjected to replicative stress it is important to delay chromatin re-assembly until the DNA damage has been resolved, and one way to do this, would be to delay H3 modifications. It is not clear how this delay is achieved but Pkc1 promotes the re-activation of H3 modifications upon removal of replicative stress. Mechanistically, Pkc1 controls H3K56 acetylation through phosphorylating the Rtt109 acetyltransferase. This modification stabilises Rtt109 and thus safeguards its availability for modifying histone H3 following removal of replicative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle. It is possible that Pkc1 might also directly target other elements of the chromatin modification machinery to coordinate efficient chromatin assembly such as occurs with Cdc7-Dbf4 which can also target CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerard et al., 2006</xref>) as well as H3T45.</p><p>Under replicative stress conditions, H3T45 phosphorylation appears to be critically important for coupled H3K56 acetylation, and this phosphorylation event is promoted by Pkc1-mediated H3T45 phosphorylation. This is likely direct as histone H3 is efficiently phosphorylated at this site in vitro. This leads to a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) whereby Pkc1 promotes the coordinate modification of these two chromatin modifications and H3T45 phosphorylation is functionally coupled to H3K56 acetylation. It is not clear how this coupling is mediated but one possibility is that H3T45 phosphorylation blocks histone binding to DNA, thus allowing H3K56 to be exposed and hence accessible for acetylation by Rtt109. More complex scenarios are of course possible such as phosphorylated H3T45 acting as binding platform for recruiting a histone mark reader which then coordinates H3K56 acetylation. Indeed, further complexities in the regulatory links between histone H3 modifications and Pkc1-mediated signalling are suggested by the observation that Pkc1 levels appear to be reduced in <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> mutant strains (data not shown). Future studies will be required to distinguish between and dissect out the underlying molecular mechanisms. One outcome of perturbed Pkc1 activity and its downstream molecular events following HU treatment is likely to be defective chromatin assembly and preliminary evidence suggest that this might be the case (data not shown). Our data show a consistent sensitivity of <italic>pkc1, rtt109(T46A)</italic> and <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> mutants to HU treatment which complements previous data showing that <italic>H3(K56A)</italic> alleles are also sensitive to HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsubara et al., 2007</xref>) and supports a role in replicative stress. However, the response to other stress inducing conditions such as MMS and 6-AU treatment is less clear. For example, the <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> strain is sensitive to both MMS and 6-AU whereas the <italic>rtt109(T46A)</italic> strain is only sensitive to MMS (data not shown). Thus different elements of the regulatory network we have uncovered may be used to respond to different stress inducers.</p><p>Another open question is how Pkc1 is specifically targeted/activated during replicative stress but one potential regulator would the cell cycle-dependent changes of the cell wall and signalling through the cell wall integrity pathway. Alternatively, other upstream pathways might be involved, and one potential link might be through TOR signalling as TORC2 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Pkc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nomura and Inoue, 2015</xref>) and TOR signalling has also been linked to H3K56 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Whether such a route operates during replicative stress or is employed under different conditions is not clear but re-emphasises the potential widespread importance of connections between Pkc1 and histone H3 modifications we have identified.</p><p>Our work may be directly relevant to mammalian systems where PKCδ has been shown to phosphorylate H3T45 under apoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hurd et al., 2009</xref>), although others have identified AKT as an additional H3T45 kinase under DNA damage conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). It is not clear whether PKC is linked to H3K56 acetylation in mammals but this modification is induced by replicative stress and its deposition is mediated by p300/CBP, the functional homologue of Rtt109 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vempati et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, atypical protein kinase C zeta has been shown to phosphorylate and control the histone acetylation output of CBP in the context of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Given these links between PKC and CBP/p300 it appears likely that our findings will be directly relevant to human cancer where oncogene-driven replicative stress is an important contributory event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartek et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction and mutagenesis</title><p>For bacterial expression: pET28a+His-Rtt109 and pET3a-Tr-Vps75-Flag was kindly provided by Paul Kaufman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsubota et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>For yeast expression; pVD67 (pAS1995; encoding wild-type GFP-Pkc1), pVD61(empty vector) and pVD124 (kinase-dead GFP-Pkc1) were kindly provided by Martha Cyert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denis and Cyert, 2005</xref>). pAS4104 encoding Myc-Rtt109, pAS4105 (myc-Rtt109T46A) and pAS4106 (myc-Rtt109T46D) were made by inserting BamHI-cleaved PCR product generated using the templates pAS4101-4103 and primer pair ADS4723/4724 into pCM188. pAS4101 was generated by amplifying the cDNA sequence of the <italic>RTT109</italic> gene encoding full-length protein from yeast genomic DNA and cloning into pGBKT7 using EcoRI/SalI restriction sites. pAS4102 (encoding Rtt109[T45A]) and pAS4103 (encoding Rtt109[T45D]) were created by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the primer pairs ADS4727/ADS4728, ADS4729/4730 and pAS4101 as a template. pGal1Vps75-flag was kindly provided by Tom Owen-Hughes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein production, pulldown assay and western blotting</title><p>His-tagged fusion proteins were prepared using Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and HA epitope-tagged Pkc1p were prepared essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darieva et al., 2012</xref>).

They also show that Pkc1 promotes phosphorylation of H3 T45, which also promotes H3 K56Ac. The findings are novel and important. Some of the westerns are rather ugly but are still convincing. The micrococcal nuclease analyses however are not technically acceptable nor credible, nor consistent with data published for the same mutants in the literature previously. Additionally, they do not add anything to the story and need to be removed, given the effect of lack of H3 K56Ac on chromatin and MNase ladders is well established already.</p><p>For future reference this is what is wrong with the MNase ladders (probably irrelevant here, because these all have to be removed from the paper), MNase accessibility analysis requires multiple time points or different MNase concentrations to be shown for each chromatin sample, not just one. The gel percentages and ladders need to be used that will enable 150bp and 300bp fragments to be seen. Also, the same amount of sample has to be digested for different samples. This is clearly not the case in these MNase analyses, especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. For the MNase digestion in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the wild type sample is totally unconvincing. It is not a MNase ladder – there are intermediate bands between the nucleosomes and the tri-nucleosome is far brighter than the mono and di bands, but there is no tetra. This does not happen; they never look like this; and the state of overdigestion of the Pkc1 mutant would not be compatible with life! The results of the MNase digestion analysis of H3 K56R is far more extreme than what Steve Jackson published in Nature nearly ten years ago, and this degree of relative lack of chromatin would not support life. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> MNase also lacks a ladder. The labeling of the size markers on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not correspond to the size markers and appears to be completely arbitrary. Where is the mononucleosome on this analysis? A ladder cannot have di and tri and no mononucleosome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> Sharrocks and colleagues present a number of interesting experiments that implicate the yeast PKC kinase in chromatin assembly regulation. Yeast growth phenotypes are applied to implicate pkc1 alleles in HU resistance and H3K56 acetylation as well as to study H3 and Rtt109 PKC phosphorylation site mutant alleles. Co-IP and in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation assays suggest a network of phosphorylation whereby PKC may directly phosphorylate H3 on T45 and Rtt109 on T46. The emergent model is attractive because there appears to be a two-pronged PKC-mediated regulatory pathway, whereby direct PKC phosphorylation of H3T45 promotes acetylation of H3K56 whilst concomitant phosphorylation of the H3K56 acetylase Rtt109 on T46 also promotes H3K56 acetylation. The model appears to have been tested adequately to sustain the claims, including epistasis experiments using colony formation and gene expression as a read-outs.</p><p>The MNase experiments are scattered over three figures (1C, 2C, 6E), assessing MNase patterns in wild type, <italic>pkc1-14</italic> (1C) H3K56R (2C) and a H3T45A mutant +/- PKC1 expression (6E). It is not clear whether as such these add substantially to the manuscript. Technically a full titration/time course of MNase for each strain/condition would be more informative. Furthermore, as different strain backgrounds are compared (1C = W303, 2C = Rothstein 1983 = W303, 6E = FY406), at different temperatures (30ºC? and 34ºC), the only result is that the chromatin structure is MNase hypersensitive and therefore 'messed up'. The assays displayed do not have the resolution to indicate in what way or to what extent the chromatin is messed up. Darieva et al. again do not systematically indicate at what temperature the control strain was grown. I feel that one dedicated accessibility figure describing a logical set, rather than the present chronological-discovery-set across three figures would render the manuscript stronger on this front. For instance, comparing WT, H3T45A and H3T45D combined with <italic>pkc</italic> mutants at 34ºC. A further set of possibilities would include the H3K56A, and R mutations. Yet another, would employ the rtt109 null and Rtt109A and Rtt109D alleles. Leaving MNase experiments out altogether is also an option, however.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09886.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) All MNase analyses have to be removed from the paper.</italic> </p><p>We have now removed all of this data and amended the text appropriately. We would like to emphasise however that the MNase digests were carried out on chromatin isolated from cells released from HU treatment (perhaps not made clear in the paper). Under these conditions, it might be expected that chromatin would not be fully assembled correctly as many cells are still in S phase. In the case of defective Pkc signalling (and its downstream molecular events) we consistently saw changes relative to WT cells, and the increased MNase susceptibility would likely be resolved after longer release times from HU block (and hence compatible with cell survival). We do however appreciate that there are technical shortcomings with the current data (although we did use equal amounts of chromatin for each digestion) and agree that the data are not central to the paper and merit further investigation to pin down the precise defects involved. We have now mentioned this possibility in the Discussion as an area to investigate more fully in the future.</p><p><italic>2) Show the effect on H3 K56Ac of Pkc inhibition in the</italic> pkc1-14 <italic>and</italic> pkc1-21 <italic>mutants, to establish whether they are epistatic, given their different effect on the kinetics of H3 K56Ac.</italic> </p><p>We have done this experiment and included it in the revised version (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>).

The difference in effects is likely caused by incomplete inhibition of Pkc1 activity by the inhibitor, leading to less severe effects on H3K56Ac levels (now commented on in the text).</p><p><italic>3) Indicate concentrations of HU and temperatures used for all experiments.</italic> </p><p>This information has now been added to the figure legends where currently missing.

This lends further support for the model that Rtt109 functions primarily through H3K56Ac in this context.</p><p><italic>5) Make the gene expression data publicly available.</italic> </p><p>This data was already deposited in the ArrayExpress database (mentioned in first version of the manuscript) and will be released to the public upon publication.</p><p><italic>6) Please show or report result of sensitivities of the</italic> pkc1<italic>, H3T45 and Rtt109T46 alleles to MMS and 6AU.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed these experiments and there is a complex behaviour which is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate in detail. We have therefore not shown this data in the current paper. However, the data do show that although the phenotypic defects we see for all the mutant alleles investigated in this study under HU-mediated stress conditions, show consistent sensitivity responses, this is not the case in the context of MMS or 6-AU treatment which are known to elicit different molecular defects in yeast cells. We have however included an additional paragraph in the Discussion section to highlight this point:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Our data show a consistent sensitivity of <italic>pkc1, rtt109(T46A)</italic> and <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> mutants to HU treatment which complements previous data showing that <italic>H3(K56A)</italic> alleles are also sensitive to HU (Matsubara et al., 2007) and supports a role in replicative stress. However, the response to other stress inducing conditions such as MMS and 6-AU treatment is less clear. For example, the <italic>H3(T45A)</italic> strain is sensitive to both MMS and 6-AU whereas the <italic>rtt109(T46A)</italic> strain is only sensitive to MMS (data not shown). Thus different elements of the regulatory network we have uncovered may be used to respond to different stress inducers.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
