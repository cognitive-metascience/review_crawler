There have been significant advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of adaptive evolution including that adaptation is often polygenic and involves loci that are predominantly intergenic and putatively regulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brawand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Transcriptional regulation of gene expression can be controlled through <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements that are linked to their target gene alleles (e.g. promotors, enhancers), or through <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanisms such as transcription factors whose action typically impacts both target alleles.</p><p>During rapid adaptation, selection may favor master regulator genes that trigger concerted changes in many downstream genes within a gene regulatory network through <italic>trans-</italic>acting mechanisms. This view has theoretical backing and has been demonstrated in multiple examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern and Orgogozo, 2009</xref>). Alternatively, selection may favor the modularity and tighter linkage offered by <italic>cis</italic>-acting mechanisms under the following scenarios: moderate changes to single alleles in a tissue-specific manner, rather than systemic changes to gene expression; or frequent out-crossing or hybridisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll, 2008</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and adaptation is expected to promote co-evolution between <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanisms so that optimal gene expression levels are reached and maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>). Interdependence of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms has been hypothesized to act as a barrier for gene flow and contribute to incipient speciation: incompatible regulatory factors fail to promote optimal gene expression levels in hybrid progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landry et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Landry et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Given their different properties, it stands to reason that different evolutionary scenarios and selection contexts may alternatively favor <italic>trans-</italic> and <italic>cis-</italic>acting mechanisms in the early stages of intraspecific adaptive divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern and Orgogozo, 2009</xref>). In this context, divergent adaptation to local environments often occurs in the face of ongoing gene flow. The shuffling effects of recombination will tend to dissociate co-evolved factors and selection may be more efficient on the larger effect haplotypes carrying multiple such factors that are maintained by linkage-disequilibrium. Thus, the advantage of a rapid adaptive response mediated via a small number of <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mutations in a gene regulatory network, may shift to favor <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory architecture where co-evolved mutations are more closely linked to each other and the gene whose expression they regulate. Parallel evolution provides a powerful context to explore the relative importance of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- regulation in the early stages of intraspecific adaptive divergence. Using independent biological replicates of the evolutionary process it is possible to ask whether the same phenotype has evolved via the same or different molecular underpinnings. While regulatory changes seem to predominate in adaptation of natural populations we know little about the extent and parallelism in gene expression and its <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulation.</p><p>The threespine stickleback fish is an excellent system to address these questions. Following the retreat of the Pleistocene ice sheet 10–20 k years ago, the parallel evolution of freshwater ecotypes from ancestral marine forms has occurred repeatedly and independently in thousands of populations across the Northern Hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bell and Foster, 1994</xref>). Considerable evidence points toward an important role for gene regulation in this adaptive divergence. Firstly, forward mapping and functional dissection have identified mutations in cis-regulatory elements underlying the parallel loss of major morphological traits (bony armor plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Brown et al., 2015</xref>) and pelvic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapiro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). Further, whole genome sequencing of marine and freshwater sticklebacks from multiple populations revealed that repeated parallel evolution of freshwater ecotypes from marine ancestors involves reuse of pre-existing genetic variation at ~81 loci across the genome that are repeatedly involved in parallel evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). These loci are predominantly intergenic and thus may act through regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>During adaptation to their divergent environments marine and freshwater sticklebacks have evolved differences in numerous morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. Two key divergent traits include their anadromous (migratory marine) versus resident-freshwater life histories and the ability to live in fresh- and saltwater. For this adaptation, the gill’s role in osmoregulation and respiration is likely to be particularly important (e.g. through regulation of ion channel genes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2005</xref>). In saline water, fish counteract water loss and ion gain by ion exclusion. In freshwater, fish compensate against ion loss and water gain by ion uptake. Expression changes in osmoregulatory genes has been linked to freshwater adaptation by anadromous ancestors in sticklebacks and other fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Velotta et al., 2017</xref>). Further, previous studies have shown that freshwater adaptation in sticklebacks and other fish is associated with changes in gene expression plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gunter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCairns and Bernatchez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitehead, 2010</xref>). The genetic basis of these gene expression differences is not known but leads to the prediction that loci showing parallel divergence in gene expression levels show parallel and environmentally insensitive mechanisms of gene regulation in independently evolved marine and freshwater ecotypes.</p><p>Here, we study the evolution of gene expression and its <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- regulation in the gills of threespine sticklebacks as a model for regulatory evolution during early stages of parallel adaptive divergence with gene flow. Using freshwater-resident and anadromous marine sticklebacks from rivers in Scotland (3) and Canada (1), we ask to what extent parallel divergent adaptation to marine and freshwater environments involves parallel expression divergence in the gills under standardized laboratory conditions. We explore whether parallel differentially expressed genes are found more frequently near previously identified adaptive loci and whether they show molecular signatures of natural selection. We then dissect the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- regulatory basis of gene expression differences using allele-specific expression analysis of marine-freshwater F1 hybrids and their parents. We ask whether <italic>cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>- regulatory changes predominate in the early stages of adaptive divergence with gene flow, and, by comparisons across marine and freshwater ecotypes from four independently evolving river systems examine the degree of parallelism in <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- architecture. Finally, by rearing F1 siblings in different water salinity conditions, we explore the extent to which the degree of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of divergently expressed genes is influenced by the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stickleback gill transcriptome assembly</title><p>We analyzed gene expression in the gill of marine and freshwater ecotype pairs each collected and derived from four river systems in Scotland and Canada (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Gills of mature and reproductively active first-generation lab-raised female and male fish were dissected and their transcriptomes analyzed using strand-specific RNA-seq. We built a reference-guided assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>) of the stickleback gill transcriptome based on RNA-seq reads from 10 freshwater and 10 marine fish from 4 marine and four freshwater strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The stickleback gill transcriptome contains 29295 transcribed loci, 17304 of which are multi-transcript loci with 171620 different transcripts combined. This is considerably more than Ensembl gene build 90 for the stickleback genome (22456 loci, 29245 transcripts), likely because of the higher sequencing coverage of the current dataset compared to the low coverage EST libraries used to inform gene annotations of Ensembl’s genebuild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kingsley et al., 2004</xref>). The number of transcripts per locus is highly skewed with a median of 3 and a small number of loci, including genes with immune function, with very high numbers of splice forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The transcriptome includes 7147 novel transcribed loci that do not overlap with any transcript in Ensembl gene build v90. Of these novel loci, candidate coding regions with complete open-reading frames and likelihood scores &gt; 20 were identified for 1018 using TransDecoder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 2013</xref>). At the locus level our assembly shows very high sensitivity (Sn = 81%) with few false negatives (fSn = 100%) and moderate specificity reflective of the appreciable number of novel coding regions we detected relative to the Ensembl gene build 90 (Sp = 59%, fSp = 69%). Considering the raw FPKM data 21399 (73%) of loci were expressed at FPKM &gt;= 1 in at least one of the 20 marine and freshwater fish analyzed, and 16195 (55%) in more than 10 individuals.

We defined a composite PC axis that captures parallel divergence in the transcriptomes of freshwater and marine ecotypes by summing the eigenvalue-weighted loadings from PC2 and PC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The loadings of each transcript on this composite PC were used as a measure of each transcript’s individual contribution to parallel transcriptome divergence. Parallel transcriptome divergence is highly correlated with river-specific measures of marine-freshwater transcriptome divergence (log of marine/freshwater expression fold change in the River Tyne and Little Campbell Rivers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similar to the only 0.01% parallel genetic divergence observed at the genomic DNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2012</xref>), here parallel divergence of gene expression between marine and freshwater ecotypes reared under common environmental conditions represents only a small proportion of transcriptome variation.

Top ranking genes include Na-Cl cotransporter (slc12a10), Basolateral Na-K-Cl Symporter (slc12a2), cation proton antiporter 3 (slc9a3.2), Potassium Inwardly-Rectifying Voltage-Gated Channel (kcnj1a.3), potassium voltage-gated channel (KCNA2), Epithelial Calcium Channel 2 (trpv6), Sodium/Potassium-Transporting ATPase (atp1a1.4), aquaporin 3a (aqp3a), and carbonic anhydrase 2 (ca2) — genes known to play a role in osmoregulation in fish and other organisms. We also note that our analyses identified differentially expressed novel loci that have no overlap with gene annotations from the Ensembl gene build.

We observed that an unexpectedly high proportion of parallel diverged transcripts also showed an effect of salinity on expression level (97 of 586, hypergeometric test p&lt;4.3e-6), suggesting a large proportion of the parallel diverged transcripts in the gill are involved in physiological responses to water salinity.</p><p>Plasticity in expression of a given genotype in different environments can be mediated by either <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms. Focusing on the 97 transcripts with parallel expression divergence that showed a salinity response, we asked whether the regulatory control of these loci is sensitive to salinity conditions. We first calculated an expression profile for each F1 sibling by scaling the FPKM expression of each transcript to the average expression level across all individuals and then compared the profiles using Spearman correlation to capture the strength and direction of correlation in expression profiles among salinity treatments. F1's raised in similar salinities tended to have high positive correlation coefficients while the expression profiles of individuals raised in freshwater tended to be negatively correlated (opposite expression) with expression in individuals raised in salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, left triangle).</p><p>Then, using allele-specific expression as a proxy for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence we investigated the stability of <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of expression across the salinity treatments. Despite the observed plastic response of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, left triangle), the degree of <italic>cis</italic>-divergence of salinity-responsive genes with parallel expression divergence was highly correlated across salinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, right triangle), indicating that the observed salinity response was not caused by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence but largely due to <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulation that influenced the expression of both alleles in similar magnitude. Based on these results we hypothesize that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes provide a mechanism for genetic assimilation of plastic responses into heritable variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Waddington, 1942</xref>) where the effects of regulatory alleles are independent of the environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regulation of gene expression is thought to play a major role in adaptation, yet relatively little is known about the patterns and predictability of adaptive regulatory mechanisms in the early stages of intra-specific adaptive divergence that evolve in the face of on going gene-flow. We characterized parallel expression divergence in the threespine stickleback gill transcriptome - an organ with important respiratory and osmoregulatory functions - and dissected the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- regulatory architecture in four marine-freshwater ecotype pairs in order to infer the rules and patterns shaping genome evolution and influencing rapid adaptation in natural populations.</p><p>We found that when sticklebacks are reared under the same standard husbandry conditions, parallel transcriptomic divergence involves only a few hundred genes each with relatively small effect on expression divergence, similar to the small proportion of the genome that shows parallel adaptive divergence at the DNA sequence level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Parallel divergently expressed genes are proximal to adaptive loci identified from signatures of parallel divergence at the sequence level, and support a role for the reuse of ancient standing genetic variation in the parallel adaptive divergence of gene expression. We also observed a large proportion of loci with marine-freshwater divergent expression that was unique to a local river system (see Appendix 1) indicating there is room for drift and/or local adaptation to play a major role shaping the evolution of divergent gene regulation and gene expression in any given river system. The transcripts showing strongest parallel expression divergence are associated with genes involved in gill ion transport and osmoregulation, a key physiological trait in marine-freshwater divergence, and in agreement with studies in other fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Velotta et al., 2017</xref>). Through population genomic analysis, we show how natural selection on divergently expressed genes is shaping the evolution of the genome - strong molecular signatures of selection (elevated F<sub>ST</sub>, reduced Pi) were detected around the transcription start sites of parallel divergently expressed genes.</p><p>We see overwhelming evidence for the importance of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence underlying marine-freshwater gene expression divergence through analysis of allele-specific expression in F1 hybrids relative to their marine and freshwater parents. The predominance of <italic>cis</italic>-divergence was observed in marine-freshwater ecotypes from four independent river systems, in analysis of all informative transcripts genome wide, and enriched in the set of loci identified as having evolved parallel marine-freshwater divergence in expression across rivers.</p><p>Many studies have reported that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences contribute strongly to divergence in gene regulation over long evolutionary divergence scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emerson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prud'homme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern and Orgogozo, 2009</xref>). The stickleback ecotype pairs studied here diverged from each other within the last 10–20 k years (approximately 10–20 k generations) following the retreat of the Pleistocene ice sheet, indicating that strong <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence can also evolve in relatively short timescales. Instead of fixed rules governing the major modes of regulatory divergence, the genetic basis of adaptive regulatory changes will likely depend of the genetic architecture of the trait under selection. For example during maize domestication, while <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory divergence did not dominate, it did contribute to stronger magnitude regulatory changes over a relatively short evolutionary time-span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>). It should also be noted that while we observe an association between nascent ecotype divergence and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence, within population <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation can be initially produced through non-adaptive processes, for example relaxed purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steige et al., 2017</xref>). While adaptation via re-use of ancient standing genetic variation is important in sticklebacks and may explain some part of the predominance of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes, we also found that the extent of genomic divergence varied substantially between the parallel evolving stickleback ecotype-pairs we studied, and the proportion of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence scaled positively with this genomic divergence. This suggests that much of the genetic differences that accumulate in the early stages of adaptive divergence with gene flow translate to <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory differences. Mutation-accumulation experiments have shown that genetic drift, which promotes random regulatory changes, is biased toward <italic>trans-</italic>acting divergence due to a larger <italic>trans</italic>-mutational target size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landry et al., 2007b</xref>). Since most expression changes between freshwater and marine ecotypes, however, tended to be due to divergence in <italic>cis-</italic>, this points toward a stronger contribution of selection rather than drift.</p><p>Our results further indicate that reinforcing <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>acting regulatory divergence that act in a manner to amplify one another, although rare, has an important contribution to early ecotype divergence with gene flow. Overrepresentation in <italic>cis+trans</italic> coevolution seemed to grow with increasing genetic and expression divergence between lineages, which is notable in the context of incipient ecological speciation. Given enough evolutionary time, the accumulation of amplifying <italic>cis+trans </italic>regulatory divergence independently in diverging populations may lead to the evolution of genetic (Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller) incompatibilities. Because recombination between coevolved <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory factors disrupts their combined phenotypic effects, it is expected that selection would favor linkage disequilibrium between the coevolved regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verta et al., 2016</xref>). Association between increasing proportion of divergence in <italic>cis+trans</italic> regulation and genome-wide divergence as seen here suggests that selection against recombination between coevolved regulatory factors may contribute to increased genetic divergence as adaptation proceeds and thus shape the genomic landscape of incipient speciation.</p><p>Parallel adaptive divergence of marine and freshwater ecotypes provides biological replicates of the evolutionary process which we can interrogate to identify common patterns governing the molecular basis of adaptation. We not only identified parallelism across marine-freshwater ecotype pairs in the predominance of <italic>cis</italic>- divergent gene expression, but also parallelism in the quantitative extent of both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- regulation of divergently expressed loci. This strong parallelism was particularly notable in parallel divergently expressed genes that are upregulated in freshwater ecotypes, and considerably less strong and less predictable in parallel divergently expressed genes that are downregulated in freshwater. Similar to the underlying shared genetic basis of freshwater adaptation due to the parallel reuse of standing genetic variation, our results suggest we can not only predict that freshwater populations are likely to carry the same alleles at adaptive loci across the genome, but also that the magnitude and extent of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- upregulation of divergently expressed genes is likely to be shared among freshwater populations. It is possible that there are fewer molecular mechanisms available to freshwater fish to ‘turn on’ gene expression and more diverse mechanisms to ‘turn-off’ gene expression. Coinciding with the stronger parallelism in genes upregulated in freshwater, we observed a tendency for the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory effect size to be of larger magnitude than the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory effects of genes downregulated in freshwater. It is plausible that this larger effect size enables selection to be more efficient and contributes to the observed stronger parallelism. Further, the marine ecotype is thought to be the ancestral state in threespine sticklebacks and has been evolving in a comparatively stable marine environment for millions of years. Under this evolutionary context, freshwater populations have a comparatively smaller effective population size with reduced access to pre-existing adaptive standing genetic variation, and have been subject to more recent and potentially stronger selection pressures than their marine ecotype counterparts. Thus, marine ecotypes have more opportunity to evolve via soft sweeps on standing genetic variation. Combined this evolutionary context is likely to have influenced which molecular mechanisms of gene expression regulation are visible, and efficiently respond to selection, resulting in relatively few paths to evolve adaptive upregulation of gene expression in freshwater populations compared to marine.</p><p>We note that our results contrast with a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hart et al. (2018)</xref> who reported a predominance of, and parallelism in, the <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory control of marine-freshwater divergent gene expression in the pharyngeal tooth plate. One possible biological explanation for this might be differences in the multifunctional (pleiotropic) functional roles of the gill and its likely complex genetic architecture compared to dental tissue with a less pleiotropic functional role and more simple genetic architecture involving a few large effect loci upstream of other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cleves et al., 2014</xref>) that cause a dominant <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory signal in the allele-specific expression assay.</p><p>Our results indicate that parallel evolving divergence may converge on <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory changes driven in part by a higher level of additivity and lower level of epistasis of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory factors. Known as the effect of ‘<italic>Haldane's sieve</italic>’, the fixation of beneficial recessive alleles are hindered due to its phenotype being hidden from selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haldane, 1927</xref>). When alternative alleles are favored in their respective environments, as seem to be the case in sticklebacks, additive alleles have the highest likelihood of becoming fixed in both populations as both alleles can rise quickly to a high frequency. <italic>Cis-</italic>regulatory variation also tended to have a lower level of epistasis within populations compared to other types of regulatory effects. Epistatic regulatory alleles tend to have different phenotypic effects depending on the genetic background, therefore inducing unpredictable fluctuation in expression levels. Hence, parallel evolution of gene expression seems to favor non-epistatic regulatory alleles that have similar effects on expression levels independently of the genetic background.</p><p>In addition to promoting divergence in expression levels that is independent of genetic backgrounds, adaptation-with-gene-flow is predicted to promote reduced expression plasticity, especially in cases where selection is strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern and Orgogozo, 2009</xref>). Toward this end, our results indicate that divergence in <italic>cis</italic>-regulation may play a particularly important role in the evolution of reduced plasticity. Since plasticity is known to be involved in the divergent adaptation of marine and freshwater sticklebacks we investigated the sensitivity of gene expression and its <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans-</italic>regulation to environmental salinity. Genetic assimilation involves the heritable encoding and loss of plasticity of a once plastic trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Waddington, 1942</xref>). Previous studies have found evidence for genetic assimilation in gill gene expression evolution between stickleback ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCairns and Bernatchez, 2010</xref>). While we found a strong component of plasticity in gene expression among siblings raised in different salinities, the <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of this gene expression was stable and insensitive to differences in the environmental conditions. From this we infer that the observed plasticity in expression is likely mediated via <italic>trans</italic>-regulation, and hypothesize that the stable divergence in <italic>cis</italic>-regulation component may serve as a mechanism for genetic assimilation.</p><p>The importance of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence underlying parallel marine-freshwater expression differences has implications for our understanding of genome function in natural populations in the early stages of adaptive divergence. The loci with parallel expression divergence that are predominantly regulated by <italic>cis-</italic>acting changes are dispersed throughout the genome but proximal to previously identified adaptive loci. We observed signatures of selection around their transcription start sites likely to be a result of natural selection acting on <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements. We show that <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory divergence acts in an additive manner and is robust to both different environmental contexts, and potential epistasis caused by differences in genetic background. Comparing across marine-freshwater ecotype pairs from independent river systems, we observed parallelism and large magnitude effect sizes for <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of divergently expressed loci upregulated in freshwater. These features make <italic>cis-</italic>divergence a well-poised target for natural selection and may explain parallelism in the predominance and quantitative extent of <italic>cis</italic>-divergence in the early stages intraspecific adaptive divergence. Combined our study highlights how natural selection on adaptive <italic>cis-</italic>divergence is a likely contributor to the dispersed genomic landscape of adaptation in sticklebacks.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Data access</title><p>Data has been deposited to the Sequence Read Archive under the accession PRJNA530695.

In our study, we refer to ‘parents’ as the actual parents of the ‘F1’s’ analysed.</p><p>Compared to plants, transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic changes is minimal in vertebrates, and we attribute expression differences observed in the ‘pure ecotype’/‘parent’ as well as the ‘F1’ generations to genetic differences. While we cannot rule out the possible contribution of transgenerational plasticity (e.g. maternal effects from wild caught fish) contributing to expression differences among the lab-reared ‘parents’, we note that this would not influence allele specificity of F1 hybrid offspring expression. If anything, our results are therefore likely to be conservative underestimates of the role of divergent <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of expression.

After inspection of <italic>VQSR</italic> tranche plots, we selected the 99.9% quality tranche for downstream analysis, which captured 1.66M and 3.52M SNPs with transition/transversion ratios of 1.14 and 1.18 for Tyne and Little Campbell population genomic analyses respectively, and 2.27M, 1.62M, 2.75M, 1.54M SNPs with transitition/transversion ratios ranging from 1.16 to 1.17 for parents of the four crosses (strains from Forss, Tyne, Little Campbell, Shiel) used in allele-specific expression analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Population genetic analyses</title><p>Population genetic analyses were based on a set of six freshwater and six marine fish from both Tyne and Little Campbell River. From the GATK variant calling analysis (described above) we identified over 3.5 million SNPs in the Little Campbell populations and over 1.6 million SNPs in Tyne. We calculated per-site statistics for Weir and Cockerham's F<sub>ST</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weir and Cockerham, 1984</xref>) and average pairwise-nucleotide diversity (Pi) genome-wide, and for 400 kilobase (kb) regions centered on transcription start sites (TSSs) using <italic>VCFtools</italic> (version 0.1.14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) allowing for a maximum of 4 missing genotypes per SNP for calculation of F<sub>ST</sub> and a maximum of 2 missing genotypes per SNP for calculation of Pi, corresponding to a maximum of 20% missing genotypes in each case. Negative F<sub>ST</sub> values were rounded to zero. CSS score was calculated based on Pi and following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) in 10 kb non-overlapping windows across the genome. We used the 10 kb windows to assign genome regions as having strongest level of parallel genetic divergence between Tyne and Little Campbell freshwater and marine ecotypes, keeping the top 1% windows with the highest CSS score.</p><p>We used custom R scripts to calculate F<sub>ST</sub> and Pi in 1 kb windows centered on transcription start sites (TSSs, as reported by <italic>CuffLinks</italic>). We used custom R scripts and the R package <italic>GenomicRanges</italic> to compare the genomic cordinates of transcripts showing parallel expression divergence to the cordinates of the genomic windows showing high CSS values. We calculated the average distance between CSS outlier windows and transcripts in increments of 10 kb and compared the average distance to distances calculated based on 1000 randomized sets of transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Allele-specific expression analysis</title><p>We defined a set of high-confidence SNPs for allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis, based on genomic resequencing of parent fish used in controlled crosses (above). We then used <italic>GATK FastaAlternateReferenceMaker</italic> to mask the stickleback reference genome in the corresponding position with Ns in order to avoid preferential mapping of reference SNP alleles. We aligned RNA-seq reads from each F1 and the parents onto the N-masked reference genomes using <italic>STAR</italic> and parameters as described above, with the exception that we allowed for only uniquely mapping reads (--<italic>outFilterMultimapNmax</italic> 1). No significant preferential mapping of reference SNPs was observed after these steps.</p><p>We selected SNPs where the genotypes of the parents were covered by at least 10 DNA sequencing reads in each parent and where the genotypes of the parents were homozygous for different alleles. These SNP positions were assigned as informative for allele-specific analysis in each cross. Expression levels for allele-specific analyses were represented as read counts overlapping informative SNP positions. We generated allele-specific read counts for F1's and parents with the <italic>GATK ASEReadCounter</italic> tool and enabling default filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castel et al., 2015</xref>). We verified that parents had more than 99% counts assigned to right genotypes and excluded the few SNPs where the RNA-seq reads indicated that both alleles were expressed in a parent that should be homozygous. We combined all individuals in each cross (parents and F1's) in one data frame and normalized read counts between individuals to the total library size using <italic>DESeq2</italic> function <italic>estimateSizeFactors</italic> in order to have equal power across F1s. We then filtered for SNP positions covered by more than 10 reads in at least one F1 in order to avoid underpowered tests of allele-specific expression at loci showing no or very low expression. Finally, we intersected the SNP-based results with transcript models from our reference-guided assembly using the R package <italic>GenomicRanges</italic>, assigning each informative SNP position to an expressed locus and exon.</p><p>We tested for ASE in each informative SNP position using a binomial exact test in <italic>R</italic> and an FDR level of 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Storey, 2002</xref>). Normally the null hypothesis of binomial test is 0.5, in our case meaning that 50% of the RNA-seq reads represented either marine or freshwater parent alleles. Our approach takes into account a possible residual effect of preferential mapping of reference allele reads by calculating the null-hypothesis for the binomial test based on the ratio of all reference reads over all alternative reads per each F1 following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buil et al., 2015</xref>). The null hypothesis calculated this way was between 0.5 and 0.52, indicating that the residual effect of preferential mapping of reference alleles, if detected, was small. Finally, the results for the ASE test were converted from reference allele versus alternative allele format into marine parent versus freshwater parent by comparing to the genotypes of the parents.</p><p>Following ASE testing, we tested for analogous expression difference between parents in the corresponding SNP positions, again using binomial exact test and FDR of 10%. We tested for difference in allele-expression ratio versus parental expression ratio with Fisher's exact test. We then compared ASE significance, ASE sign and ASE magnitude to parental expression difference in order to dissect parental expression differences into divergence classes following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Landry et al., 2005</xref>), outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. We verified that our results were robust toward sequencing depth by down-sampling to 30 million RNA-seq reads per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Given that the median number of assembled transcript isoforms per gene (locus) is 3, and the mean number of ASE informative SNPs tagging a given gene (locus) range from 2.0 to 6.2, we concluded that the level of evolutionary divergence between marine and freshwater stickleback strains used in our study was insufficient to dissect the <italic>cis</italic>- vs <italic>trans</italic>- genetic architecture underlying expression divergence at the transcript (isoform) level (see Supplemental Note for more information). We instead analyzed ASE at the gene (locus) level, classifying <italic>cis</italic>-/<italic>trans</italic>- architecture of each gene into one divergence class based on the SNP that showed the highest statistical support (see above).</p><p>We performed concordance analysis for validating the reproducibility of allele expression levels and divergence classes on SNPs assigned to the same exon and the same transcript (Supplemental Note). For the final classification of transcripts to divergence types, we ordered informative SNPs per transcribed locus per F1 by the product of the p-values of the three tests (above) and selected the SNP that had the lowest product of p<italic>-</italic>value as a representative SNP for that transcript, per F1. We selected this approach among alternatives after taking into account the high concordance of allele expression levels, relatively complex isoform expression patterns, analysis sensitivity, statistically balanced approach, and parsimony in biological explanation of expression divergence (Appendix 1).</p><p>A small number of SNPs showed monoallelic expression in F1's where RNA-seq reads overlapping one of the parent alleles were not observed (e.g. 1129 SNPs in Little Campbell River cross). Analysis of RNA-seq read coverage indicated that these SNP positions had lower coverage specifically of the alternative allele, and this effect was not observed when evaluated based on all SNPs or subsets of SNPs e.g. assigned as <italic>cis-</italic>diverged. This indicated that the cases of monoallelic expression are likely caused by mappability issues, and that the issue was specific to SNPs showing monoallelic expression. Although including these SNPs did not impact the results in a significant way we decided to exclude SNPs showing monoallelic expression in F1s or parents from the analysis.</p><p>We summarized the frequencies of transcripts assigned to divergence classes for each F1 using custom R scripts, excluding transcripts that showed differential expression between sexes at FDR 10%. We then assigned transcripts to two classes according to whether or not they showed parallel expression divergence in PCA and differential expression analysis. We tested for over-representation in divergence classes using a randomization test. For the purposes of calculating the background frequencies of genetic architectures, we defined a set of differentially expressed genes between each ecotype-pair based on PC one loadings (10% outliers, median FDR per outlier 13.5–14.5%, see Supplementary analysis 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Salinity response</title><p>A clutch of Tyne marine x freshwater F1 siblings were raised in standard laboratory 3.5 ppt salinity until 3 months old, separated into three groups and acclimated to over 4 months. At reproductive maturity, we analyzed the gill transcriptomes of four F1s from each salinity using RNA-seq.</p><p>For testing the effect of salinity acclimation on gene expression in F1 gills, we estimated transcript-level expression using <italic>CuffQuant</italic> and normalized counts for each sample to total library sizes using <italic>CuffNorm</italic>. We then imported the gene count tables into <italic>R</italic> and tested for expression differences between salinity treatments using contrasts and an FDR level of 1%, as implemented in <italic>DESeq2</italic>.</p><p>For analysis of expression profiles, we imported FPKM values from <italic>CuffLinks</italic> into R. The FPKM values were highly correlated with normalized expression values from <italic>DESeq2 VarianceStabilizingTransformation</italic>, and allow for a more intuitive interpretation. We sub-set the data to only include the transcripts showing differential expression between at least one contrast and parallel expression divergence (N = 97). We then log-transformed and normalized the expression of each transcript to the average expression level across all samples to produce an expression profile that represent expression in a given sample relative to others (for that transcript). We then compared the profiles of samples with Spearman correlation. A correlation approaching one indicates that expression profiles tended to be similar relative to other samples. In contrast, a correlation approaching −1 indicated that sample profiles were mirror-images of one another. Finally, we clustered the samples based on euclidean distance and visualized the sample similarity profiles using the <italic>pheatmap R</italic> function.</p><p>For analysis of allele-specific expression in salinity treatments, we imported allele-specific counts over informative SNPs (as defined above) into R and transformed the counts into log-fold change of marine over freshwater allele. We identified one of the samples acclimated to 35 ppt as having outlier allelic expression levels very different from all other samples and excluded the sample from further analysis. We intersected the SNPs with transcripts that exhibited salinity response and parallel expression divergence (N = 11 transcripts). We measured the similarity of fold-change expression differences between alleles across samples with Spearman correlation, analogous to FPKM counts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing, Designed the study, Conducted the experiments, Analyzed the data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—draft, review and editing, Designed the study, Contributed to data analysis</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All of the animals were housed at an approved animal facility and handled according to Baden-Württemberg State approved protocols at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany (license numbers 35/9185.82-5 and 35/9185.40).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43785.024</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Sampling locations.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-43785-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43785.025</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq library sequencing and yield.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-43785-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43785.026</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology term enrichment.</title><p>Available as a supplementary xls file. Two different Gene Ontology analyses were performed using parallel divergent gene expression outliers defined through parametric analysis (CuffDiff) and composite PC analysis (compPC).

Your article has been reviewed by three reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised version of your manuscript for resubmission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes an original and informative study characterizing the extent of parallel expression divergence in stickleback gills and its genetic architecture. Using a mixture of parental originating from freshwater and marine environments and some F1 hybrids, the authors describe the <italic>cis-/trans</italic>- acting basis of transcription change, showing that <italic>cis</italic>-acting change overlap with genomic regions carrying population genetics signatures of adaptation. They further investigate patterns of dominance, epistasis and plasticity affecting genes with parallel expression divergence and conclude that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants are best suited to be the preferred basis of adaptive evolution in gene transcription levels. Finally, the authors observe that <italic>cis</italic>-regulation makes a predominant contribution to the genetic assimilation of plastic responses into heritable variation. In this study, genes were also identified that are excellent candidates for evolved adaptive changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulation that can be the subject of future studies.</p><p>The stickleback system is arguably the best platform to investigate the role of gene expression variation in parallel adaptation because of the many examples of repeated adaptation to freshwater as well as the large body of previous work documenting signatures of selection at the genomic level. This novel piece of work informs the community about the pattern and process by which gene expression changes contribute to adaptive phenotypic change. We therefore believe it has the potential to be eventually suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we have noted three crucial shortcomings that should be addressed in a much revised version as well as two important aspects that are not sufficiently considered in the present manuscript. These can be summarized in 5 major points, three of which warrant essential revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Point 1. The analysis of enrichment in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation among genes showing parallel expression divergence was not properly tested. While <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation appears to be pervasive, and therefore an important component of the adaptation of gene expression, the question of the universe against which this enrichment is tested is crucial. The authors tested the proportion of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes detected in genes with parallel expression change against the whole set of genes with analyzable ASE (e.g. expressed and with SNPs allowing assignment of parental origin), most of which show no parental difference. Instead, we believe the right test would be to compare parallel-divergence genes to random genes with a significant parental expression difference (regardless of whether it is parallel or not). Since the conclusion that parallel divergent genes are more <italic>cis</italic> than random genes is the titular claim of the paper, this question is crucial and the authors may have to re-formulate their conclusions.</p><p>Point 2. The unconventional use of PCA to identify the parallel-diverged genes also raised questions. We wondered why you did not use a linear model of the type: expression ~ river x ecotype or expression ~ ecotype/river. The robustness of your approach against random patterns of gene expression variation is not known. Choosing 1% of the tail of the distribution is a rather blind approach that could be better supported with a permutation approach. We believe you should produce an estimate of the proportion of false positives among the 586 genes you identify as showing a parallel expression change. Here again, depending on the proportion of false positives, your conclusions may have to be revised.</p><p>Point 3. An inherent difficulty in <italic>cis-/trans</italic>- studies is that the two sources of variation differ in the respective power with which significant differences can be identified. In F1, alleles are always expressed in the same cell, by contrast with adult parental fishes. <italic>Cis-/trans</italic> frequencies can be computed. A potential solution is to infer the proportion of parental expression variance that is associated with a detectable <italic>cis</italic>-acting change in hybrids.</p><p>Point 4. The possibility that epigenetic differences could explain some proportion of the ASE reported here should be discussed, since the parents of the F1 grew up in the wild.</p><p>Point 5. Finally, we wondered whether the authors have deliberately chosen to omit references to studies of gene expression completed in plant systems. Back in 2014, a study conducted in maize reported that <italic>cis-</italic>acting variants are enriched in genomic segments carrying signatures of selection (Lemmon et al., 2014), in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species specific functions were enriched in derived <italic>cis</italic>-acting changes (He et al., 2016) and in Capsella grandiflora, <italic>cis</italic>-acting changes were associated with relaxed selection (Steige et al., 2017). It seems the authors should refer to the broader body of literature dissecting the genetic basis of expression changes associated with adaptation. Placing their finding into the broader context of the field will give greater resonance to this work, beyond the boundaries of the fish community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43785.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Point 1.

As noted above, the comparison is invalid because by definition the background set cannot contain genes assigned as “conserved” or “compensatory”.</p><p>To accommodate the recommendation that the background set of genes to which genes with parallel expression divergences are compared should comprise only genes that are differentially expressed between ecotypes, we re-analyzed the data following the steps below:</p><p>i) We performed principal components analyses (PCAs) between freshwater and marine ecotypes separately for Little Campbell and Tyne.</p><p>ii) We defined a set of differentially expressed genes between ecotypes based on principal component 1 loadings, which is the major principal component separating the ecotypes (10% outliers, median FDR 13.5-14.5% (Tyne and Little Campbell respectively), see response 2 for calculation).</p><p>iii) We used the principal component 1 outliers, which are differentially expressed between ecotypes (and therefore fulfil the requirement in the reviewer’s comment), as the background set of genes to which genes with parallel expression divergence were compared.</p><p>Using set of differentially expressed genes between ecotypes as the background set, we provide the results in Figure 4, which leads to similar conclusion as in our initial analysis: genes with parallel expression divergence are enriched with cis-regulation compared to the background set of diverged genes.</p><p>The above analysis has now been included in the main text (replacing the original analysis).

For genes assigned as <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans,</italic> both methods showed low correlation between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> estimates for individual genes (which is desired). Estimates of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> divergence were highly correlated between the two approaches.</p><p>We have added this information to Appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4. The possibility that epigenetic differences could explain some proportion of the ASE reported here should be discussed, since the parents of the F1 grew up in the wild.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a misunderstanding. The parents were indeed raised in the lab in identical environment to the F1’s, as explained in the Materials and methods section. We revised the Materials and methods section for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 5. Finally, we wondered whether the authors have deliberately chosen to omit references to studies of gene expression completed in plant systems. Back in 2014, a study conducted in maize reported that cis-acting variants are enriched in genomic segments carrying signatures of selection (Lemmon et al., 2014), in Arabidopsis species specific functions were enriched in derived cis-acting changes (He et al., 2016) and in Capsella grandiflora, cis-acting changes were associated with relaxed selection (Steige et al., 2017). It seems the authors should refer to the broader body of literature dissecting the genetic basis of expression changes associated with adaptation. Placing their finding into the broader context of the field will give greater resonance to this work, beyond the boundaries of the fish community.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we had missed references to this valuable literature and have added discussion of these studies to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
