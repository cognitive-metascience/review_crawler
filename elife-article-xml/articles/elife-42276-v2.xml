interest for the treatment of various liver disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poelstra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reddy and Couvreur, 2011</xref>). In particular if cell-type specific delivery of macromolecular therapeutic agents, selective targeting of parenchymal liver cells and internalization is needed. Previously, hepatocyte targeted nanoparticles have been developed exploiting endogenous and exogenous targeting ligand-based mechanisms using glycan, protein or antibody modifications of the nanoparticle surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akinc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinc et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Detampel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Witzigmann et al., 2016a</xref>). Most established systems for liver-specific drug delivery rely on targeting the hepatic asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) or low density lipoprotein (LDLR) receptors. However, studies investigating alternative targeting strategies based on other hepatocyte-specific receptors are limited. In this respect, a promising alternative might be offered by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which shows a pronounced efficacy to infect the human liver due to its strong affinity to hepatocytes. Less than 10 virus particles have been shown to be sufficient to efficiently target hepatocytes of chimpanzees resulting in a pathogenic HBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asabe et al., 2009</xref>). The reason for its extraordinary liver tropism is a highly specific amino acid sequence in the large HBV envelope protein (<italic>i.e.</italic> HBVpreS1 domain), which is essential for target receptor recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schieck et al., 2013</xref>). For decades, the specific target of HBV on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes was unknown until in 2012 the interaction with the human sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP/SLC10A1) was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yan et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, Urban and colleagues performed a fine mapping of the HBVpreS sequence to identify the amino acids responsible for efficient binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schieck et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, the first HBV/HDV entry inhibitor, a myristoylated peptide named Myrcludex B, was developed and successfully introduced in clinics (currently phase II clinical trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Urban et al., 2014</xref>). Myrcludex B binds with high affinity and specificity to human NTCP on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes thereby blocking binding of virus particles to their target cells.</p><p>Based on these findings, the question arises whether Myrcludex B might serve as a targeting ligand to design a hepatotropic, NTCP-specific nanoparticle. In recent years, several groups have therefore attempted to develop targeting strategies based on HBV envelope proteins, for example recombinant HBV envelope protein particles (bio-nanocapsules) or HBV preS1-derived functionalized liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Somiya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Somiya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, the nanoparticulate drug delivery systems developed had physicochemical properties (e.g. size, colloidal stability, and immunogenic potential), which were sub-optimal for efficient in vivo targeting of hepatocytes. Especially the size of the nano-formulations presented a limitation. Most developed formulations had sizes above the average diameter of hepatic fenestrations in healthy humans (i.e. 100 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wisse et al., 2008</xref>) thereby limiting the passage through liver fenestrations and consequently the access to the space of Disse and the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. Notably, the liver fenestrae diameter of rodents show high species and strain differences ranging from around 100 nm to 160 nm, possibly explaining positive liver targeting of published formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braet and Wisse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steffan et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wisse et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, a nanoparticle size above 100 nm triggers phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelial system (<italic>i.e.</italic> hepatic Kupffer cells and spleen macrophages) resulting in rapid blood clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kettiger et al., 2013</xref>). Both factors significantly decrease the likelihood of reaching the parenchymal liver tissue and increase the risk for potential off-target effects in untargeted tissues.</p><p>Surface properties are another important characteristic of nanoparticles. The surface charge (i.e. ζ potential) should be slightly negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>) to prevent sequestration of particles in the lung (<italic>i.e.</italic> due to a positive charge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiwata et al., 2000</xref>) or rapid clearance by cells expressing scavenger receptors (<italic>i.e.</italic> due to an excessive negative charge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothkopf et al., 2005</xref>). According to the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloids, a neutral charge has to be avoided to prevent particle agglomeration. In addition to surface charge, steric stabilization by PEGylation mediates long circulating properties and prevents opsonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karmali and Simberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milla et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It was the aim of the present study to design and optimize a nanoparticle based on liposomes combined with derivatives of Myrcludex B to efficiently target hepatocytes while minimizing interactions with off-target cell types. Optimization of physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles included size and charge optimization and steric shielding by PEGylation. Derivatives of Myrcludex B were selected based on target binding, cellular uptake and their impact on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles. For the lipid membrane composition, we used a FDA and EMA approved multi-component lipid formulation based on Doxil (<italic>i.e.</italic> liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barenholz, 2012</xref>). To design an optimal targeted system, several Myrcludex B derivatives with variations in the peptide sequence or fatty acid modification were covalently linked to the distal end of PEG-lipids. NTCP-specific and ligand-dependent uptake was confirmed in vitro using human liver-derived cell lines. Recently, Shan et al. reported huge discrepancies between in vitro systems and rodent experiments during the development of targeted nanomedicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shan et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we used the zebrafish as a complementary in vivo screening model based on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sieber et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Einfalt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sieber et al., 2017</xref>). We assessed the effect of nanoparticles` ligand type and ligand density on their pharmacokinetics. To this end, human-derived cell lines lacking or expressing the human NTCP (hNTCP, <italic>SLC10A1</italic>) were xenotransplanted into zebrafish embryos prior to systemic administration of nanoparticles. Finally, tissue distribution of dual-labeled nanoparticles was qualitatively (fluorescence-based) and quantitatively (radionuclide-based) investigated in vivo in mice to demonstrate the targeting potential of our hepatotropic nanoparticle platform in higher vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and characterization of a hepatotropic nanoparticle for NTCP-specific targeting</title><p>The aim of our study was the design of a hepatotropic, targeting ligand-modified nanoparticle. To this end, the surface of liposomal nanoparticles was modified using targeting peptides or lipopeptides derived from the preS1 domain of the HBV large envelope protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on a previous screening of 26 HBVpreS peptide variants, we selected Myrcludex B, the first HBV entry inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogomolov et al., 2016</xref>), and five additional Myrcludex B-derived peptides to evaluate the influence of amino acid sequence variations or acyl chain modifications on targeting efficiency and thereby optimize our hepatotropic nanoparticle. All Myrcludex B derived (lipo)peptides were synthesized in high yields and purity by standard solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc-chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schieck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schieck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). Lipopeptides were N-terminally modified with the fatty acids myristic acid (saturated C14) or capric acid (saturated C10), since our previous studies have shown that fatty acid modification is key for mediating interactions with target cells. C-termini of synthesized targeting (lipo)peptides were modified with cysteine residues to allow conjugation to the distal end of PEGylated phospholipids (DSPE-PEG2000-Maleimide) integrated into sterically stabilized liposomes. Coupling was achieved by a chemically reactive maleimide, giving rise to a metabolically stable thioether bond suitable for applications in living organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Successful conjugation of Myrcludex B to lipid-based nanoparticles was demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using Myrcludex B-Atto488. The autocorrelation curve of nanoparticle conjugated peptides showed a significant shift to longer diffusion times as compared to the free peptide, with average diffusion times of τ<sub>d</sub> = 1639 μs and τ<sub>d</sub> = 192 μs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42276.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hepatotropic nanoparticles based on liposomes modified with Myrcludex B-derived peptides for NTCP-specific targeting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of peptides derived from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) large envelope protein including the first entry inhibitor, Myrcludex B.

This choice was based on the following observations:</p><p>First, only nanoparticles modified with lipopeptides but not peptides without conjugated fatty acid (e.g. preS2-48) can bind to NTCP. This set of experiments confirmed that the acyl modification of peptides on nanoparticles` surface is a crucial prerequisite for hepatocyte binding as reported recently for free peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schieck et al., 2013</xref>). Only acyl modified peptides increased nanoparticle binding and internalization. Second, liposomes decorated with peptides conjugated to capric acid had a reduced colloidal stability. Their storage stability was limited due to particle aggregation. Furthermore, their size of around 134 nm exceeds the diameter of liver sinusoid fenestrations presumably limiting their access to the space of Disse. Third, Myr-preS2-48A modified nanoparticles were excluded due to poor NTCP specificity as demonstrated by the lack of binding competition by free Myrcludex B. In addition, the uptake of these nanoparticles was independent of NTCP expression levels and even higher in HepG2 wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mechanistic studies on NTCP mediated cellular binding and internalization</title><p>In order to demonstrate the importance of covalent peptide attachment, we used a triple fluorescence labeling strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The targeting ligand Myrcludex B was labeled with Atto633, the liposomal phospholipid bilayer was labeled with DiI, and the aqueous cargo payload of nanoparticles consisted of CF. Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 was labeled at an additionally introduced lysine at position 2, in order to still allow conjugation to the nanoparticle surface by the terminal cysteine. Recently, we have shown that additional N-terminal amino acids do not interfere with specific liver enrichment (for comparison Myr-preS−11-48) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schieck et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>First, CF-loaded, DiI-labeled nanoparticles were incubated with Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 and purified using size exclusion chromatography to remove free targeting ligand. Cell experiments confirmed successful removal of free Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 (no signal on cell membrane) and as expected no uptake of PEGylated nanoparticles. As a control, we added a mixture of free Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 and PEGylated nanoparticles to HepG2 <italic>SLC10A1</italic> cells without prior purification. Notably, a strong fluorescence signal on the cell membrane was observed due to specific binding of free Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 to <italic>SLC10A1</italic> indicating specific targeting despite an additional N-terminal amino acid. Free Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 did not interact with PEGylated nanoparticles and thus did not trigger nanoparticle entry into HepG2 <italic>SLC10A1</italic> cells. Finally, we covalently linked the Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 to the nanoparticle surface by Michael addition of the distal cysteine residue to maleimide-functionalized PEGylated phospholipids integrated in the nanoparticle structure. A strong cellular binding and uptake of Myr-preS2-31-K-Atto633 modified nanoparticles was observed already within 1 h.</p><p>Interestingly, nanoparticles including their payload entered the target cell whereas the targeting ligand remained on the cell surface. Since Myrcludex B has a remarkably high affinity to the NTCP (K<sub>D</sub> of 67 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meier et al., 2013</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the targeting ligand is retained by NTCP on the cell surface while the dissociated liposome payload is internalized and further processed by a yet unknown mechanism. Of note, intracellular CF signals were considerably higher when compared to DiI signals. This might also indicate liposome dissociation and perhaps loss of DiI during the internalization process. Uptake experiments using pharmacological pathway inhibitors suggested a partially clathrin-dependent and caveolin-independent mechanism, which differs from the process of phagocytosis and micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intriguingly, additional factors besides NTCP binding seem to contribute to this process. Non-hepatic HeLa cells transduced with mouse NTCP (mNtcp; <italic>Slc10a1</italic>) or <italic>SLC10A1</italic> can bind Myrcludex B-modified nanoparticles. However, binding is reduced as compared to binding in hepatic cell lines and no uptake is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, additional hepatic cell dependent factors seem to play a role for efficient binding and internalization. Indeed, Verrier et al. reported recently that glypican five expression is an important co-factor for HBV entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verrier et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, uptake experiments using psgA745 cells (CHO xylosyltransferase mutants) overexpressing NTCP showed that binding of Myrcludex B alone is not influenced by glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In sharp contrast, binding of nanoparticles could be partially inhibited in HepG2 WT cells using heparan sulfate suggesting an involvement of glycosaminoglycans in the binding and subsequent internalization process of nanoparticles for hepatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, it will be an important step for the design of next-generation carrier systems to elucidate such co-factors in detail and adapt the nano-sized delivery system accordingly.</p><p>To demonstrate concentration-dependent nanoparticle uptake of Myr-preS2-31 and investigate the effect of ligand density, qualitative and quantitative fluorescence techniques were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, we performed in vitro experiments using nanoparticles with variable amounts of coupled Myr-preS2-31 (0 mol% - 0.5 mol% initial maleimide functionalities on nanoparticle surface). With increasing targeting ligand concentration, a significant increase in cellular uptake was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Notably, we identified a threshold value of at least 0.25 mol% for efficient cell binding by qualitative confocal imaging as well as quantitative flow cytometry experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Below this value, no uptake was observed, whereas above 0.25 mol% cellular binding was improved. Stoichiometric estimations assuming a bilayer thickness of 5 nm, a phosphatidylcholine headgroup area of 0.71 nm<sup>2</sup> and an equal distribution of DSPE-PEG in the outer and inner nanoparticle membrane result in 157 ± 16, 79 ± 8, or 39 ± 4 maleimide moieties per liposome capable for lipopeptide conjugation corresponding to 0.5 mol%, 0.25 mol%, or 0.125 mol%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maurer et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, a minimum of 80 functional maleimide moieties per nanoparticle is necessary for efficient cellular targeting after Myr-preS2-31 conjugation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>In vivo systemic circulation in the zebrafish vertebrate model</title><p>Since in vitro experimental models are not able to mimic the physiological complexity of nano-bio interactions at an organ level, we screened in the next step the effect of ligand density on pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles in vivo for Myr-preS2-48 and Myr-preS2-31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

With increasing ligand density on the nanoparticle surface, the systemic circulation of nanoparticles decreased for both peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicating that ligand modification of nanoparticles interferes with the shielding properties of PEG. Increased blood clearance was thereby paralleled by accumulation in the posterior caudal vein region.

Thus, Myr-preS2-31 modified nanoparticles were selected for further investigations.

In recent years, several groups have used xenografted zebrafish for various investigations including the assessment of nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sieber et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wertman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veinotte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). Despite anatomical differences with mammals, zebrafish xenotransplantation models are an emerging preclinical tool offering several practical advantages as compared to mouse xenografting models including prolific reproduction, facilitated xenotransplantation (no immune rejection due to limited adaptive immune response), and optical transparency enabling high throughput screening. For our study, we used HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP for further genetic modification and establishment of xenotransplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Witzigmann et al., 2015b</xref>). HEK293-GFP cells were transiently transfected with <italic>SLC10A1</italic> to express the targeting factor for our hepatotropic nanoparticles. Wild type HEK293-GFP without <italic>SLC10A1</italic> served as control. Both cell lines were injected into ABC/TU wild type zebrafish embryos to create human xenotranplants. The different nanoparticles were injected as soon as transgenic human cells stopped circulating and remained in the caudal vasculature tail region (<italic>i.e.</italic> after approximately 1 h). Interestingly, a clear difference in targeting capacity dependent on <italic>SLC10A1</italic> expression and ligand density was revealed. Whereas there was no significant difference in targeting capacity at different ligand densities for <italic>SLC10A1</italic>-deficient HEK293-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), a significant increase in binding to HEK293-GFP cells was observed if <italic>SLC10A1</italic> was overexpressed as the nanoparticles could bind specifically and be readily internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

No signals were observed in spleen and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Modification of nanoparticles with 0.125 mol% Myr-preS2-31 did not result in significantly increased liver levels. A marginal binding of nanoparticles to hepatocyte membrane was visually observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that a threshold level of targeting ligand density present on the nanoparticle surface is necessary for successful targeting. Importantly, strong signals for nanoparticles modified with 0.25 mol% Myr-preS2-31 were observed on the basolateral membrane of parenchymal liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) demonstrating the strong hepatotropism of our nanoparticles.

The zebrafish model demonstrated to be an excellent tool to pre-screen various nanoparticle formulations, to assess the effect of Myrcludex B modifications on their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and thus increase the accuracy of predictions for experiments in rodents. The developed delivery systems can increase liver uptake levels, decrease accumulation in off-target tissues and at the same time avoid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system by mimicking HBV targeting properties. Despite the fact that current liver targeting strategies such as ASGPR- or LDLR-targeted delivery systems have already demonstrated improved drug and gene delivery in various preclinical models, these systems also suffer from certain drawbacks including complex synthesis of multivalent glycans or strong evidence that a majority of endocytosed gene carriers is recycled back to the cell exterior thereby reducing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Witzigmann et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sahay et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the availability of efficient peptide manufacturing protocols, the proposed NTCP targeted delivery platform is an alternative and promising approach which warrants further investigation. For future clinical applications, optimized Myr-preS2-31 conjugated nanoparticles entrapping small molecule drugs, nucleic acids or proteins need to be studied in appropriate animal models of disease. In particular, we see a great potential for our nanoparticle targeting strategy in the field of metabolic diseases of the liver.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HepG2 WT</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.12599">DOI: 10.1111/hepr.12599</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0027">CVCL_0027</ext-link></td><td>Cell depository of the Institute of Pathology (University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HepG2 <italic>SLC10A1</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.12.024">DOI: 10.1053/j.gastro.2013.12.024</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_JY40">CVCL_JY40</ext-link></td><td>Prof. Dr. Stephan Urban (University Hospital Heidelberg)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HuH7 WT</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.12599">DOI: 10.1111/hepr.12599</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0336">CVCL_0336</ext-link></td><td>RIKEN Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HuH7 <italic>SLC10A1</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.12.024">DOI: 10.1053/j.gastro.2013.12.024</ext-link></td><td/><td>Prof. Dr. Stephan Urban (University Hospital Heidelberg)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa WT</td><td>-</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td>Prof. Dr. Jörg Huwyler (University of Basel)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293-GFP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b01684">DOI: 10.1021/acsami.5b01684</ext-link></td><td/><td>Prof. Dr. Jörg Huwyler (University of Basel)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>)</td><td>CHO</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/bi702258z">DOI: 10.1021/bi702258z</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0214">CVCL_0214</ext-link></td><td>Prof. Dr. Joachim Seelig (University of Basel)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>)</td><td>psgA745</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/bi702258z">DOI: 10.1021/bi702258z</ext-link></td><td/><td>Prof. Dr. Joachim Seelig (University of Basel)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>kdrl:EGFPs843 zebrafish</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.08.023">DOI: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.08.023</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-070117-47">https://zfin.org/ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-070117-47</ext-link></td><td>Prof. Dr. Markus Affolter (University of Basel)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Myr-preS2-31 antibody (MA18/7)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Prof. Dr. Wolfram Gerlich (Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen);

For the conjugation of HBV-derived peptides, DSPE-PEG2000 was replaced by DSPE-PEG2000-maleimide (Avanti Polar Lipids) at indicated molar ratios.

Desired ratios of lipids were mixed; a homogenous thin film was prepared and dried using a Rotavapor A-134 (Büchi). Lipid films were rehydrated using 0.01 M PBS pH 7.2 containing 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent metal ion catalyzed maleimide oxidation. For passive loading and fluorescence labeling of inner core, a 60 mM 5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (pH 7.4) was used for the rehydration step.

For functionalization with HBV-derived peptides, nanoparticles were mixed with peptides at molar maleimide-to-cysteine ratio of 1:1 and incubated at RT overnight. To remove non-conjugated peptides and/or free hydrophilic dye, size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex G50 column (GE Healthcare) eluted with 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 was performed.

Hepatotropic nanoparticles were concentrated to a final lipid concentration of 10 mM using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units with a 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off (Millipore). DiI and cholesterol were used as marker lipids to quantify total lipid content. DiI content was quantified based on relative fluorescence signals as compared to liposome standards and in combination with Triton X-100 treatment to account for potential DiI self-quenching.

Several experiments were carried out, which entailed analysis in cultured cells, zebrafish and mice. Although interesting, the work has significant shortcomings and is not suitable for publication in its present form. Some of the major concerns are the following:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript the nanoparticle is referred to as a 'virus mimetic'. However, the only similarity of the liposome to a virus is presence of the HBV-derived peptide. The description therefore seems to overstate the virus like properties. The particle does not have a capsid, nor does it carry any nucleic acid. Both are essential features of viruses.</p><p>2) Limitations of vectors used for delivery of nucleic acids are provided as justification for developing the liver targeting liposome. This point is re-emphasized in the conclusions where it is stated that the vector may have utility for treatment of monogenic diseases. However this opinion is not supported by the content of the manuscript. None of the experimentation characterizes properties of the vector when complexed to nucleic acids, nor is there any comparison to lipoplexes that use other targeting moieties, such as galactose.</p><p>3) In the experiments carried out on cultured cells, evidence that the payload is active or reaches the cytosol is not convincing. The punctate nature of the fluorescence suggests that the molecules may be trapped in the endosomes (Figure 1C).</p><p>4) Utility of the zebrafish model is minimal and the manuscript overstates the importance of the results from these experiments.</p><p>5) Data from analysis of the biodistribution of the particles and the radioactive payload in mice are particularly problematic.</p><p>a) Figure 6B indicates a thoracic location of the liver. Also images of mice in Figures 5 and 6 show dominant location of radioactivity in bilobed structures that look remarkably like lungs.</p><p>b) It is not clear whether the mice are prone or supine, which means that the left or right sides of the animals is unclear. Organ location is thus uncertain, and this adds to concerns about interpretation of the data</p><p>c) Evidence that the <sup>111</sup>In was retained inside the nanoparticles is lacking.

Furthermore, the images reported in Figure 5D indicate very similar distributions in the liver of the 0.125 and 0.25 mol% formulations.

Reporting ROI analysis of the in vivo images as well as ratios between for example blood/spleen/liver may be useful here.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Optimization-by-Design of a Hepatotropic Hepatitis B Virus-Mimetic Nanocarrier&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The major scope of this study was the development and in-depth optimization of NTCP-targeted nanoparticles using a unique approach of combining in vitroinvestigations and experiments in rodents with the emerging zebrafish model. Since the reviewer’s concern is not related to the validity of our study, we deleted statements regarding the delivery of nucleic acids and modified the “Introduction” and “Conclusion” section as follows:</p><p>Introduction: “In particular for the cell-type specific delivery of macromolecular therapeutic agents, selective targeting of parenchymal liver cells and internalization is needed.” AND “However, studies investigating alternative targeting strategies based on other hepatocyte-specific receptors are limited.”</p><p>Conclusion: “In particular, we see a great potential for our nanoparticle targeting strategy in the field ofmetabolic diseases of the liver.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the experiments carried out on cultured cells, evidence that the payload is active or reaches the cytosol is not convincing.

We demonstrate the time-dependent internalization and toxicity of doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles into hNTCP overexpressing HepG2 cells. This result demonstrates that the payload is released into the cytosol resulting in cytotoxic effects. To avoid such misunderstanding, we emphasized this experiment as follows:</p><p>Results and Discussion: “Interestingly, Myr-preS2-31 modification enhanced the cytotoxic effects of propidium iodide and doxorubicin as compared to PEGylated nanoparticles (Figure 1—figure supplement 7 and 8) demonstrating that the payload is active and reaches the cytosol.”</p><p>In addition, we included an additional study performed using propidium iodide loaded nanoparticles. This data set confirms the release of the payload inside the cells resulting in nuclear accumulation of propidium iodide. An additional Figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 7) is presented.

In addition, we regret that recent headlines about our research using the zebrafish as an early vertebrate in vivomodel for nanoparticle screening became available during the review process only. The zebrafish has emerged as an early vertebrate in vivomodel for nanoparticle screening and our recent publications have been highlighted in several top-tier journals including ACS Nano and Journal of Controlled Release. In addition, we have an accepted original article in Nanomedicine:NBM and a review article in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews. References were added accordingly. Recently, Shan et al. (doi: 10.1007/s13346-014-0210-2) reported huge discrepancies between in vitrosystems and rodent experiments during the development of targeted nanomedicines. Thus, there is a tremendous need to find innovative strategies for the development of cell-type specific delivery systems. It is important to mention, that the zebrafish model was not used as an alternative to rodent experiments but as a complementary in vivomodel to screen our nanocarriers. The zebrafish offers unique advantages: i) high reproducibility, ii) low costs, iii) high level of genetic homology to humans, iv) availability of transgenic lines, and v) most importantly optical transparency. This enables in vivoimaging at spatio-temporal resolution (i.e. down to a cellular level and at various time points). Consequently, we combined transgenic zebrafish lines with fluorescently labeled nanocarriers. Our approach offers the possibility to gain advanced insights into the circulation behavior and targeting properties of nanocarriers. We validated the data obtained in the zebrafish model in an established rodent model. To highlight the value of our work, that, we provide an additional reference and modified the “Introduction” and “Conclusion” sections as follows:</p><p>Introduction: “Recently, Shan et al. reported huge discrepancies between in vitro systems and rodent experiments during the development of targeted nanomedicines.(Shan et al., 2015) Therefore, we used the zebrafish as a complementary in vivo screening model based on our previous work. (Sieber et al., 2018; Campbell et al., 2018; Einfalt et al., 2018; Sieber et al., 2017) We assessed the effect of nanoparticles` ligand type and ligand density on their pharmacokinetics.” and “Strikingly, nanoparticles modified with 0.25 mol% Myr preS2 31 demonstrated a significant increase in the liver-to-kidney ratio confirming our conclusions from the zebrafish model, i.e. 0.25 mol% Myr-preS2-31 as an optimal ligand density (Figure 4B).”</p><p>Conclusions: “…and thus increase the accuracy of predictions for experiments in rodents”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Data from analysis of the biodistribution of the particles and the radioactive payload in mice are particularly problematic.</p><p>a) Figure 6B indicates a thoracic location of the liver.

We had the possibility to discuss this issue with experts in the field. Indeed, the presented qualitative data allows different interpretation. The dominant location of radioactivity in a bilobed structure in the abdominal cavity with an enhanced intensity in the right lobe suggesting the liver. Lungs would be expected to be symmetrical and localized in the thorax; see whole-body mouse atlas for comparison of organ localization (Baiker et al., 2008). In addition, quantitative biodistribution studies of harvested organs demonstrate that there is no accumulation in the lung. However, to clarify this point, we restrict our discussion to the quantitative biodistribution analysis. The planar imaging will just be used for informative purposes (now Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We adjusted Figure 5 and 6 accordingly and modified the manuscript as follows:</p><p>Results and Discussion: “One-hour post injection, plasma and organs were harvested to perform a quantitative biodistribution analysis ex vivo (Figure 5A). PEGylated nanoparticles showed the typical biodistribution of sterically stabilized nanoparticles with a strong signal in the blood (Figure 5A). […] Planar γ scintigraphy imaging of injected mice confirmed these observations (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Legend Figure 5—figure supplement 2: “in vivo biodistribution and liver targeting of Myr-preS2-31 conjugated nanoparticles in mice.

Instead we used a lipid-chelator (i.e. DSPE-DTPA) to label the nanoparticle surface with <sup>111</sup>In. In order to clarify this comment, we included a Discussion section highlighting the advantages of our labeling strategy. Two additional references are provided and the manuscript was modified as follows:</p><p>Results and Discussion: “Importantly, we incorporated DTPA-conjugated DSPE into the lipid bilayer to chelate <sup>111</sup>In on the surface of nanoparticles.

Photographical pictures were taken to indicate position and organ type. Rats were selected as additional species to increase the value of our study and to exclude species dependent effects. Three additional figures are provided (Figure 5—figure supplement 2-4), additional methods were added, and the manuscript was updated as follows:</p><p>Materials and methods: “Planar imaging of harvested organs from mice and rats ex vivo. For planar imaging of organs, animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane (Baxter) and <sup>111</sup>In labeled nanoparticles were intravenously injected into the tail vein.

In the present work, we therefore combine results in the zebrafish with data from two additional species (mouse and rat). Furthermore, we would like to point out that zebrafish is an emerging screening model for nanomedicines. This is increasingly recognized by other experts in the field. Our recent published review article “Zebrafish as a Preclinical in vivo Screening Model for Nanomedicines” was selected by the Editor for the Editors’ Collection issue by Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews. It is one of the highlights of our study that the observations made in the zebrafish are highly predictive for experiments in rodents. To address the concern of the reviewer regarding the use of xenografted zebrafish, we added eight additional references and updated the “Discussion” section to highlight advantages and disadvantages of xenotransplanted zebrafish as follows:</p><p>Results and Discussion: “In recent years, several groups have used xenografted zebrafish for various investigations including the assessment of nanoparticles.(Sieber et al., 2019; Evensen et al., 2016; Wertman et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2017; He et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2017; Veinotte et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2010) Despite anatomical differences with mammals, zebrafish xenotransplantation models are an emerging preclinical tool offering several practical advantages as compared to mouse xenografting models including prolific reproduction, facilitated xenotransplantation (no immune rejection due to limited adaptive immune response), and optical transparency enabling high throughput screening.

The authors developed a potent liver-specific drug delivery carrier modified with an alternative liver-targeting moiety. They utilized the zebrafish and murine model to optimize and characterize the ligand-modified liposome. The liver-specific delivery carrier showed increased liver uptake and decreased off-target delivery to other tissues in murine models. In general, the article describes a well performed study. There are some major concerns:</p><p>1) Although the authors mentioned small molecule drugs, nucleic acids or proteins can be encapsulated and studied in appropriate disease models in the future. Lake of demonstration of further application may hamper the impact of this work. The authors should show the application of the carriers, which is a usual practice for high impact journals such as eLife. For example, does the liver-specific carrier increases plasmid DNA delivery and enhanced the transfection efficacy in livers sites?</p></disp-quote><p>The scope of this study is the development and in-depth optimization of NTCP-targeted nanoparticles using a unique approach of combining in vitro investigations and experiments in rodents with the emerging zebrafish model. in vivo liver transfection studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we performed an in vitro study to investigate the potential application of NTCP-targeted lipid nanoparticles as gene delivery systems. We successfully entrapped a DNA vector coding for GFP into lipid nanoparticles and modified their surface with Myr-preS2-31. These systems were tested in HepG2 SLC10A1 cells regarding their gene delivery efficacy. An additional figure was provided (Figure 1—figure supplement 9), additional methods and references were added, and the manuscript was updated as follows:</p><p>Results and Discussion: “In order to demonstrate the potential application of Myr-preS2-31 modified nanoparticles as drug delivery system, we successfully incorporated small molecular payloads as well as larger compounds into nanoparticles payloads (i.e. propidium iodide, doxorubicin, FITC-labeled peptide, DNA vector) to enhance their internalization into NTCP expressing cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 6, 7, 8 and 9) […] To investigate the potential application of NTCP-targeted lipid nanoparticles as gene delivery systems, we encapsulated a DNA vector coding GFP into lipid nanoparticles based on a clinically approved lipid composition and modified their surface with Myr-preS2-31. High content screening analysis demonstrated that modification of nanoparticles with Myr-preS2-31 significantly increases the transfection of NTCP expressing cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 9).”</p><p>Materials and methods: “DNA vector loading. Lipid nanoparticles entrapping DNA were prepared as previously described with modifications.(Kulkarni et al., 2019, 2018, 2017) Briefly, lipids (ionizable lipid, cholesterol, DSPC, DSPE-PEG2000, and DSPE-PEG2000-Maleimide at a molar ratio of 50:39:10:0.75:0.25 mol%) were dissolved in ethanol at a total lipid concentration of 15 mM. The DNA vector was dissolved in 25 mM sodium acetate (pH 4) at an N/P ratio of 6). After T-junction mixing at a flow rate ratio of 3:1 v/v, the pH was neutralized using a 5x excess of D-PBS, the appropriate amount of Myr-preS2-31 was added, and the resulting suspension was dialyzed against D-PBS to remove residual ethanol.”</p><p>“High-content screening. To quantify the transfection of HepG2 cells deficient or expressing NTCP using DNA loaded nanoparticles, high-content screening was performed as described previously.(Lin et al., 2013) Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture dishes, were allowed to adhere for 24 h, and treated with lipid nanoparticles at a DNA concentration of 1.5 μg/mL. To assess the transfection efficacy using high-content screening, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde 24 h post treatment and cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Plates were scanned and analyzed using a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI (Thermo Scientific).”</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 9: “Activity of DNA loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNP).

Although the authors defined their drug carriers as alternative approaches. The advantage and limitation of the alternative approaches should be highlighted and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. To clarify this point, we modified the conclusion section and included important drawbacks of ASGPR and LDLR-targeted delivery systems and illustrated a possible advantage of our system as follows:</p><p>Conclusion: “Despite the fact that current liver targeting strategies such as ASGPR- or LDLR-targeted delivery systems have already demonstrated improved drug and gene delivery in various preclinical models, these systems also suffer from certain drawbacks including complex synthesis of multivalent glycans or strong evidence that a majority of endocytosed gene carriers is recycled back to the cell exterior thereby reducing activity.(Witzigmann et al., 2016; Sahay et al., 2013) Due to the availability of efficient of peptide manufacturing protocols, the proposed NTCP targeted delivery platform is an alternative and promising approach which warrants further investigation. For future clinical applications, optimized Myr-preS2-31 conjugated nanoparticles entrapping small molecule drugs, nucleic acids or proteins need to be studied in appropriate animal models of disease.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
