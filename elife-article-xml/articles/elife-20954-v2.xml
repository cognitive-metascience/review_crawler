This complex formation can modulate their folding, activity as well as substrate selectivity. Non-disruptive methods avoiding critical steps, such as membrane disintegration, transfer into artificial environments or chemical modifications are therefore essential to analyze molecular mechanisms of native membrane protein assemblies. The combination of cell-free synthetic biology, nanodisc-technology and non-covalent mass spectrometry provides excellent synergies for the analysis of membrane protein oligomerization within defined membranes. We exemplify our strategy by oligomeric state characterization of various membrane proteins including ion channels, transporters and membrane-integrated enzymes assembling up to hexameric complexes. We further indicate a lipid-dependent dimer formation of MraY translocase correlating with the enzymatic activity. The detergent-free synthesis of membrane protein/nanodisc samples and the analysis by LILBID mass spectrometry provide a versatile platform for the analysis of membrane proteins in a native environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20954.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20954.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cell-free synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>non-covalent mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>nanodisc</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>oligomeric state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Center (SFB) 807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henrich</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Peetz</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><name><surname>Hein</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DO545/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laguerre</surname><given-names>Aisha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Beate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Research School for Structure and Function of Biological Membranes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Beate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cluster of Excellence Frankfurt</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name><name><surname>Morgner</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Instruct</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhard</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>P4EU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhard</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ ERC Grant agreement n° 337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgner</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As the function of membrane proteins is often influenced by its membrane environment the presented combinatorial approach is of great value for the investigation of membrane protein complexes in natural or even manipulated lipid bilayers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Crucial cellular processes depend on membrane proteins and their interactions. The majority of membrane proteins is organized in higher order complexes and oligomeric assembly is frequently used to modulate protein function or it is even essential for activity. Unfortunately, the analysis of membrane protein oligomerization <italic>in vivo</italic> is challenging due to the high complexity of natural membranes. Furthermore, classical <italic>in vitro</italic> studies need to implement disruption of membranes and subsequent solubilization of the membrane proteins into detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seddon et al., 2004</xref>). This relatively harsh treatment can irreversibly modify the stoichiometry or even disrupt and unfold native membrane protein complexes. In addition, the presence and composition of the lipid environment can influence folding, proper adoption of quaternary structures and the assembly of heteromeric complexes. Lipids can even be components of membrane protein structures and act as modulators of membrane protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Dalen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunte and Richers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laganowsky et al., 2014</xref>). In this respect, the recently developed nanodisc technology, based on well-defined disc-shaped bilayer patches stabilized by two copies of a membrane scaffold protein, provides excellent and well-defined alternative lipid environments for membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayburt and Sligar, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The utilization of nanodiscs is extremely beneficial as they are completely soluble, enabling the application of numerous biophysical and biochemical techniques for the characterization of membrane proteins in a native bilayer environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denisov and Sligar, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in order to avoid potentially critical detergent contacts of membrane proteins, we have developed a detergent-free strategy for the co-translational insertion of membrane proteins into preformed empty nanodiscs by cell-free (CF) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roos et al., 2014</xref>). For example, in the case of the extremely detergent-sensitive <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY translocase, a membrane-integrated enzyme essential for lipid I biosynthesis, this lipid-based CF expression (L-CF) was the only way to obtain functionally folded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henrich et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, CF expression enables the production of toxic or otherwise difficult membrane proteins and provides numerous options for their efficient labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reckel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henrich et al., 2015b</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20954.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Processes for membrane protein complex characterization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) Workflows implementing cellular expression and detergent solubilization of membrane proteins.

However, oligomeric states of proteins can be extremely sensitive toward covalent modifications or environmental parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Politi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maciejko et al., 2015</xref>). Recently developed non-covalent mass spectrometry (MS) using mild ionization techniques such as electrospray-ionization (ESI) or laser-induced-liquid-bead-ion-desorption (LILBID) thus became key technologies for the analysis of soluble proteins as well as of detergent solubilized membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera and Robinson, 2011</xref>). Sample transfer from solution to gas phase is most critical for non-covalent MS and requires carefully adjusted settings to maintain intact membrane protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrera et al., 2008</xref>). LILBID-MS as a technique complementary to ESI-MS emerged as new tool to investigate membrane proteins in native-like environments, especially based on its wide tolerance to additives needed for membrane protein solubilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vonck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maciejko et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The approach to employ ESI-MS in combination with nanodiscs has recently been successful to investigate membrane proteins in a native-like lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hopper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marty et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, this procedure still includes the risk of complex disintegration by the classical detergent treatment of the protein samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). By combining cell-free synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodgman and Jewett, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), nanodiscs and LILBID-MS, we have established a new platform avoiding any detergent contacts and enabling the analysis of non-modified membrane proteins in their initial expression environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In addition, the created synergies streamline the process of membrane protein complex analysis by reducing the workflow to three basic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The platform is suitable for a wide range of applications as it extends the analysis of challenging membrane proteins (i) that cannot be synthesized in vivo, (ii) that are sensitive to detergents, (iii) that do not tolerate covalent modifications or (iv) that require stable isotope labeling for better resolution.</p><p>We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by analyzing oligomeric states of six different membrane proteins from different functional classes and by gaining first insights indicating a lipid-dependent dimerization of <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY translocase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LILBID-MS analysis of empty nanodiscs</title><p>Initially, we investigated empty nanodiscs consisting only of the scaffold protein and lipids to define the individual particle behavior. When the LILBID laser, desorbing the sample droplets, was tuned to a low laser power of 10 mJ, signals were revealed corresponding to intact nanodiscs comprising two copies of the scaffold protein and roughly 200 DPPC lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, spectra remain broad and not well resolved and are not suitable for detailed assignments. Nevertheless, single lipids could be resolved by tuning the laser power to 23 mJ causing the disintegration of the nanodiscs. Detected signals correspond to scaffold proteins with a few remaining lipid molecules.

To investigate the influence of different nanodisc features on the obtained mass spectra, we scanned various scaffold proteins and lipids. Switching from MSP1D1ΔH5 over MSP1 to the larger MSP1E3D1 scaffold protein coincides with an increase from six to up to eleven attached DMPG molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Elongation of the alkyl chain with unsaturated alkyl groups led to further increased numbers of attached lipids with 15 or 20 for POPG and DOPG, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast to the chain length, the variation of the lipid head groups (from DOPG to DOPS or DOPC) did not modulate lipid attachments drastically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the utilization of DOPE lipids leads to the formation of highly heterogeneous nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). This could be caused by the intrinsic tendency of PE lipids to form non-bilayer phases with higher curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gruner, 1985</xref>), which possibly prevents the formation of proper nanodiscs. Moreover, as shown for the multi-drug transporter EmrE, non-bilayer lipids can significantly decrease reconstitution and activity of membrane proteins in liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Curnow et al., 2004</xref>). Due to these possible negative effects on disc stability, nanodiscs reconstituted with DOPE were excluded from further studies.</p><p>More complex lipid compositions as present in native membranes were mimicked by mixtures including lipids such as cholesterol or cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In case of DMPG:cardiolipin mixtures, the mass difference between the two lipids was sufficient to clearly distinguish and count the scaffold-bound cardiolipin and DMPG molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). It appears therefore feasible to tune the complexity of resulting mass spectra via specific nanodisc selection as well as to identify lipids staying attached to proteins within the sample. In general, spectra of nanodiscs composed out of lipids with shorter chain length lead to better resolved spectra due to the decreased number of attached lipid molecules. This will be especially important the more complicated the spectra of membrane protein/nanodiscs complexes are. Therefore, nanodiscs containing the short-chain lipids DMPG and DMPC were chosen for the following studies of membrane protein/nanodiscs complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Oligomeric state analysis of membrane proteins in nanodiscs</title><p>To establish the reliability of the method for analyzing membrane proteins from nanodiscs, we started with well-studied model systems with known subunit stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

We could reveal a dimeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), despite the lack of the intracellular domain being proposed as the main dimerization interface.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, the signals of the free KcsA tri- and tetramer fragments without attached scaffold proteins are ambiguous as they are too close in mass to other potential species. As an example, the 85.32 kDa KcsA tetramer differs only by 0.07 kDa from a complex of two MSP1E3D1 scaffold proteins with one KcsA monomer. An efficient approach for minimizing such overlap is labeling of the membrane proteins with stable isotopes such as <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C and/or <sup>2</sup>H, which is a key advantage of the implemented cell-free expression technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sobhanifar et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>2</sup>H isotope labeling of KcsA in MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs improved spectral resolution and revealed signals for the free tetramer at 91.08 kDa, now separated by 4.14 kDa from the KcsA monomer with two attached MSPs detected at 86.93 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, ambiguity is also present in the spectra of hHv-1-VSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The scaffold protein MSP1D1ΔH5 without the implemented His<sub>6</sub>-tag has a molecular mass of 19.49 kDa and is therefore close to the hHv1-VSD monomer (20.80 kDa). Again, <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>2</sup>H labeling of hHv1-VSD separates both signals clearly by increasing the mass of hHv1-VSD to 22.20 kDa, now resulting into a mass difference of 2.71 kDa. For KcsA and hHv1-VSD, the separation of signals by heavy isotope labeling was sufficient to reveal the different oligomeric states despite the attachments of lipids. Unfortunately, similar lipid attachments prevented the clear separation of the signals of uncleaved MSP1D1ΔH5 at 21.46 kDa from that of a signal peptidase monomer LspA at 22.84 kDa by the <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>2</sup>H labeling approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). However, signal overlap can alternatively be addressed by using different scaffold protein derivatives for nanodiscs assembly. Translation of unlabeled LspA (21.52 kDa) into MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs instead of MSP1D1ΔH5 nanodiscs sufficiently separated the signals now revealing the expected monomeric state of LspA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Oligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs</title><p>In order to explore the limits of our strategy, we analyzed the seven transmembrane helix green-light absorbing PR, a light-driven retinal containing proton pump.

To interpret these it is helpful to compare KcsA and PR. Mild laser conditions revealed only tetrameric complexes for KcsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), but a variety of oligomeric states for other proteins such as PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). A possible explanation could be laser-induced dissociation of protein complexes, with the degree of dissociation depending on the particular complex stability. Detection of several oligomeric forms could also reflect a natural variation in complex formation. PR is folded and active under numerous conditions such as pentamers or hexamers, and its characteristic photocycle is observed even in monomeric conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reckel et al., 2011</xref>). However, we have seen that, if laser dissociation occurs, the scaffold proteins are among the first proteins to leave the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), giving rise to signals representing complexes with only one or no scaffold proteins. As the dominating species of the heterogeneous distribution of PR oligomerization states under mild laser conditions all include both scaffold proteins we can conclude that the detected species represent complexes in solution, meaning that PR is present in different oligomeric states. Under high laser intensities PR oligomers without scaffold proteins are released and can be detected as well up to hexamers, indicating that the PR proteins indeed form complexes and are not present as individual entities in the nanodiscs.</p><p>The potential importance of the lipid environment for protein oligomerization is further demonstrated by the comparison of cell-free expressed PR either in the presence of nanodiscs or detergents. Protein synthesized in the presence of the detergents DH7PC and GDN, previously identified to support the folding and stability of PR, was mostly present in monomeric conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This observation is in agreement with previous structural studies with solution NMR by using identical sample preparations and showing monomeric PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reckel et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to the utilization of different detergents that results in different oligomer distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reckel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maciejko et al., 2015</xref>), the variation of the lipid within the nanodiscs bilayer does not change the oligomerization behavior of cell-free produced PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In the case of PR lipids seem to support the formation of higher oligomer complexes but PR does not discriminate between different lipid species. Due to the increased number of attached lipids for other lipid species as discussed before for empty nanodiscs the peaks get broader and less resolved, but the overall peak pattern stays the same indicating a comparable oligomeric composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structure-function relationship of MraY</title><p>The membrane-integrated enzyme MraY is essential for the bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis by linking cytoplasmic precursors to membrane-bound lipid carrier molecules resulting in lipid I formation.

In contrast to PR which’s oligomer formation is not discriminated by the bilayer environment, the activity of MraY homologues is remarkably dependent on specific lipid requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henrich et al., 2016</xref>).

The presented strategy is therefore complementary to established techniques as it allows a completely detergent-free process suitable also for detergent-sensitive membrane proteins. Moreover, our platform provides valuable synergies by combining (i) fast and efficient production of even toxic or specifically labeled membrane proteins enabled by cell-free expression, (ii) defined, stable membrane environments contributed by nanodiscs and (iii) sensitive and tunable particle detection facilitated by LILBID-MS. This strategy is, furthermore, a fast and straightforward process and does not depend on chemical protein modifications.</p><p>The complexity of MS spectra of membrane protein/nanodiscs complexes is increased by the presence of the scaffold protein that can impede the clear identification of membrane protein signals. Labeling of the target protein with stable isotopes can address this problem as demonstrated for KcsA or hHv1-VSD. The sample production by cell-free expression is here highly advantageous, as the complete control over low-molecular-weight compounds in cell-free systems allows efficient labeling of synthesized proteins in any amino acid combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reckel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sobhanifar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LaGuerre et al., 2015</xref>). Switching to a different scaffold protein upon nanodiscs preparation could be an alternative option to improve spectral resolution as demonstrated for LspA. In general, even complicated LILBID-MS spectra are comparably straight forward to analyze. Despite the complexity caused by numerous oligomeric states of the target protein in addition to its combinations with different numbers of the scaffold protein, within LILBID-spectra every species is only present with a few charge states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgner et al., 2006</xref>). In our nanodiscs spectra mainly the singly charged species are observed.</p><p>An important tool to probe complex stability as well as interactions between membrane proteins and/or lipids is the laser intensity of LILBID-MS. Elevated laser intensity modulates the LILBID process resulting into partly disintegrated nanodisc structures. This is presumably caused during the explosive expansion of the sample droplet after laser irradiation. Lipids are lost most likely due to deformation and subsequent rupture of the flat disc-shaped membrane. However, the mild ionization conditions of LILBID-MS are capable of preserving at least partly the initial membrane protein complex. The absence of scaffold proteins and lipids, furthermore, improves spectral resolution and helps to identify the intact as well as partly dissociated protein complexes. This is especially effective if the scaffold size is largely compared to the protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>The presented platform appears to be well suited to address challenging biological questions. Complexes indicating an artificial stoichiometry different from the expected oligomeric state could never be found for any tested protein. The highest detected oligomeric state always corresponded to the previously determined native state of the target. The results, furthermore, indicate that the implemented L-CF expression of membrane proteins results into the assembly of native complexes. Therefore, the strategy allows to rapidly determine the oligomeric state of a protein within the nanodiscs in context of a membrane with defined lipid composition, giving important insights for the understanding of functional dynamics. Lipid-dependent oligomerization is a so far rarely observed regulatory mechanism of membrane proteins. The reported study on the <italic>E.coli</italic> MraY translocase is one of the first examples showing such a lipid-triggered dimerization. Notably, even close homologues such as <italic>B. subtilis</italic> can significantly differ in their oligomeric assembly mechanism and the LILBID-MS observations nicely match with previous reports on MraYs functional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henrich et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Instrumental improvements will continuously contribute to higher resolution and will open the method to extended applications. One further direction could be the identification of specific and tightly bound lipids, which could affect structural and functional features of a membrane protein. According to the identification of lipid-protein interactions in mixed micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gault et al., 2016</xref>) or tightly bound lipids by a delipidation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechara et al., 2015</xref>), individual lipid types selectively interacting with a protein might be identified out of a provided mixture in nanodiscs membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Detergents and lipids</title><p>Polyethylene glycol P-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-butylphenyl-ether (Triton X-100), sodium cholate, 1,2 diheptanoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC), glyco-diosgenin (GDN), 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-racglycerol) (POPG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-racglycerol) (DMPG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn-</italic>glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS), 1,2-dipalmitoyl<italic>-sn-</italic>glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1',3'-bis[1,2-dimyristoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho]-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (Cardiolipin), cholesterol.</p><p>Detergent stock solutions of DHPC, DPC and GDN were prepared with a concentration of 10% (w/v) and water as solvent.

In brief, purified MSP and the desired lipids were mixed at the defined ratios, combined with 0.1% DPC and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. For the nanodiscs formation, these mixtures were applied to dialysis bags with a MWCO of 12–14 kDa or Slide-A-Lyzer devices with a MWCO of 10 kDa and dialyzed against 5 l DF-buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) for ~16 hr at room temperature.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Analyzing native membrane protein assembly in nanodiscs by combined non-covalent mass spectrometry and synthetic biology&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Morgner et al. present novel and interesting data on the use of LILBID MS to investigate transmembrane protein (complexes) in nanodiscs. There is a considerable number of different proteins, lipids and scaffold proteins shown and a relatively clear picture of the performance of &quot;AMPLE-MS&quot; for the characterization of these reconstituted particles emerges. The reviewers were positive in their evaluation of the work, but significant concerns were voiced.</p><p>The key shared concern was the use of LILBID MS as a bundled &quot;novel&quot; approach with protein production into nanodiscs.

Cell-free expression has been described before, and so has the production of lipid nanodiscs.

If the authors believe this to be the case, they should show the evidence.</italic> </p><p>LILBID-MS does not principally depend on cell-free expression and it can be postulated that membrane protein/nanodisc complexes prepared by the “classical” post-translational reconstitution process involving detergent solubilization could also be analyzed. Previous reports showed the ESI-MS analysis of comparable samples prepared by the classical post-translational mechanism and corresponding references have been cited (see Introduction, third paragraph). However, the stoichiometry of membrane protein assemblies could be affected by the rigid membrane extraction and detergent solubilization process used for the “classical” strategy. One discussed example is proteorhodopsin, which is monomeric in the particular detergent DH7PC but multimeric in lipid environments (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, many membrane proteins are hard to synthesize in traditional cell-based expression systems or denature upon membrane extraction or contact with detergents. One shown example is <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY, which was completely inactive and aggregated in presence of detergents. This sample cannot be prepared by the classical technique. Therefore, cell-free expression largely extends the portfolio of membrane protein complexes that can be analyzed by LILBID-MS or similar techniques, it removes uncertainties and risks due to the necessary detergent treatment with classical protocols and it significantly accelerates and streamlines the overall sample preparation process concomitant with enabling numerous labelling and sample refinement opportunities (see Introduction, third paragraph).</p><p>We have rewritten the Introduction and Discussion sections in order to make these basic considerations and resulting advantages of our strategy clearer.</p><p><italic>2) If the nanodisc-based production were retained in the manuscript, then more details would be required. How does one select lipoproteins for the formation of the nanodiscs? Are there experimental advantages/disadvantages of distinct proteins in view of the proposed methodologies? What are checkpoints in the process; i.e. how does one know that the proteins have been properly expressed and folded in the nanodiscs? In general, the description of the cell-free expression into nanodiscs is only cursory.</italic> </p><p>The in vitro production of empty nanodiscs and the co-translational integration of membrane proteins by cell-free expression was described in detail before and we have cited the references. For a better description the Methods section has been expanded (see subsections “Nanodisc preparation” and “Cell-free protein production”). Key advantages are the detergent-free process along with other general advantages of cell-free expression such as efficient labelling (see Introduction, first paragraph and following). We have now highlighted this better in the manuscript. In addition, a more detailed overview of the nanodisc production technique also indicating critical checkpoints, is included (see subsection “Nanodisc preparation”). Proper expression of all proteins could be revealed by MS-spectra or e.g. SDS-PAGE. Within this study, we only used proteins where the functional characterization of the corresponding samples has already been published in previous papers which have now been cited.</p><p><italic>3) How would one determine whether the observed species reflect heterogeneity of the sample following cell-free expression or disruption of the complex during gas phase formation? Could multiple copies of monomeric proteins be inserted into the same nanondiscs in the absence of protein:protein interactions? How would one know?</italic> </p><p>This is an important consideration. As we learned from measurements of different protein complexes, we can monitor their stoichiometry present in nanodiscs. The nanodisc complexes may differ in the amount of proteins they carry, but always have two scaffold proteins. A key point of our platform is that we can probe the tightness of protein interactions by tuning the laser power of LILBID-MS (see subsection “Oligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs”, second paragraph). So, weak non-specific interactions, e.g. in between membrane proteins and the scaffold proteins or in between two different membrane protein complexes inside one nanodisc, will dissociate first at already low laser power. “Real” membrane protein complexes having a tight and specific interface will only disrupt at higher laser power. Tuning the disruption of the membrane protein/nanodisc complexes leads then to gradually loss of integrated membrane proteins as well as of scaffold proteins (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Spectra taken at lower laser power still reveal the integrated membrane proteins together with both scaffold proteins and thus could indicate potential sample heterogeneity, e.g. by multiple integration of monomeric or dimeric proteins. However, spectra taken at higher laser power, and this was the routine measurement condition in the manuscript, show the dissociation of the sample into complexes still remaining one or two scaffold proteins, but also gave signals of the free membrane proteins. The maximum stoichiometry of these free protein complexes, which have already lost the non-specific interaction to both scaffold proteins, therewith reflect the highest oligomeric stoichiometry of the particular membrane protein (see the aforementioned paragraph). We speculate, and this is supported by the results obtained with all six analyzed membrane proteins, that potential non-specific interaction in between multiple inserted proteins within one nanodisc membrane would not stay together after applying laser power conditions that already result into loss of both scaffold proteins.</p><p>As a note, we have not observed evidence of such a multiple insertion even with the analyzed relatively small monomeric or dimeric membrane proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). However, multiple integration may also depend on experimental conditions such as nanodisc size and concentration. So we would propose that it may occur, but with our strategy we either won’t detect it or we could easily identify it.</p><p>In short: Heterogeneity in complexes with two scaffold proteins reflect a heterogeneity of complexes present in solution. The highest observed Oligomeric state of a protein complex without scaffold proteins determine the biologically relevant stable complex.</p><p>We added an additional Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) showing a representative tuning of complex dissociation by applying different laser powers, and we added a better explanation of the theory behind (subsection “Oligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Finally, it is unclear form the manuscript how common is LILBID instrumentation setup. If it is not common, how easy is it to establish based on more commonly accessible instruments. What are the advantages (current or potential) of LILBID compared to more common ESI?</italic> </p><p>LILBID-MS is an emerging technique and we hope to increase its application by presenting results such as shown in this manuscript. The major difference if compared with Esi-MS is the mechanism of gas-phase transition of the analyzed sample. We use a single power transfer of a 6 nsec laser pulse while Esi-MS is based on a permanent ion collision mechanism. These differences could have significant effects on sample stability and dissociation kinetics. A corresponding study that directly compares Esi-MS with LILBID-MS by using identical samples is currently in preparation.</p><p>We added a sentence specifying the difference between the two MS techniques into the Introduction.</p><p><italic>4) The term &quot;synthetic biology&quot; is uncommon for cell-free expression.</italic> </p><p>The term has recently been introduced and cell-free expression is accepted as a core platform in synthetic biology. We have added corresponding references (Hodgman &amp; Jewett, Metab Engin 14, 261-269, 2013, or Smith et al., FEBS Lett 2014, 588: 2755-61.) (See Introduction, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Statements are also made about the use of detergents (e.g. bacteriorhodopsin), which while true are somewhat misleading. In order to natively reconstitute a transmembrane protein, a suitable environment needs to be provided, i.e. the correct lipid or lipid mixture, or the correct detergent (which is obviously meant to mimic the lipid). Just comparing some lipids with some detergents is not sufficient to conclude which method is better.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree that many membrane proteins stay folded and even in oligomeric assemblies in detergent micelles. However, to find out which detergent or detergent combination is suitable for a given membrane protein can become a time-consuming task. Membrane extraction and detergent treatment is a relatively harsh procedure and represents always a risk of complex disintegration. Whether oligomeric complexes re-assemble upon the classical reconstitution procedure into membranes cannot be predicted. Our strategy eliminates the solubilization step and the proteins are directly analyzed in the initial membrane, in which they have been co-translationally inserted (see Introduction, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We therefore propose that our strategy provides a less risky procedure to view the native situation of membrane protein complexes and we support this by the analysis of six different systems (see Introduction, last paragraph).</p><p>In the discussed example of proteorhodopsin, also the monomeric form in the detergent DH7PC folds into its active conformation and its NMR structure has been solved in that detergent. In the detergent DDM it forms multimeric complexes similar to that in native membranes and we have included a corresponding reference of that (see subsection “Oligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs”, last paragraph). However, this example shows that functional assays alone must not be a proof of native conformation (see also Laguerre et al. 2016, which has been included now). The direct co-translational insertion of proteorhodopsin into nanodisc membranes results into the native multimeric complexes and eliminates tedious screening of detergents supporting multimer formation by photocycle kinetics. With the second example of <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY, we have previously shown that contact with detergent completely inactivates the protein (see corresponding citation Ma et al. 2011). The established strategy of detergent-free production with nanodiscs is therefore the only way to isolate this protein for in vitro characterization.</p><p><italic>5) The laser power required to resolve individual masses of nanodiscs is too high to keep them intact. All the investigations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and supplements seem to be of the remaining few lipid molecules, not reflecting intact nanodiscs. It is not explained in sufficient detail what is the value of these experiments. The use of shorter lipids is based on these controls, but it is not clear how critical is this selection.</italic> </p><p>These have been basic experiments in order to define optimal measurement conditions and to improve resolution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the different “stickiness” of the individual lipids on the scaffold proteins. This correlates with the “stickiness” to other proteins as well. Therefor the lipids which are less “sticky” are chosen for the rest of the experiments, as they allow for better spectral resolution (see subsection “LILBID-MS analysis of empty nanodiscs”, last paragraph). Depending of the mass differences one wants to observe, the lipid selection is more or less critical. An explanatory sentence is added to the aforementioned subsection and a new figure (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) has been added for better illustration. Further refinement of the LILBID-MS technique will allow to stepwise implement a higher variety of different lipid types.</p><p><italic>6) In all experiments, attention is given to resolving partially dissociated species. How is that information used to infer biologically relevant conclusions?</italic> </p><p>Please also refer to answer to point #3. The laser dissociation of the assemblies depends on the applied laser power in the experiment and on the strength of interaction. The largest complex in the spectra thus represents the highest stably incorporated oligomerization state and the biologically relevant complex in the membrane. The partially dissociated species under higher laser conditions originate from dissociation and appear with no or one scaffold protein as well. In order to support this assumption, we have analyzed several well-studied model proteins having different oligomeric forms such as proteorhodopsin (hexamer), KcsA (tetramer), EmrE (dimer) and LspA (monomer). In all cases, the detected highest oligomeric form exactly matches with the expected complex. Therefore, we think that our strategy is indeed suitable to analyze the biological relevant complexes in its native stoichiometry. However, for the dissociated lower order complexes, it cannot be ruled out that some of them may already exist in addition within the membrane as well. These would be observable as lower smaller complex with two scaffold proteins under low laser conditions. This should be clearer now from the changes we made in the second paragraph of the subsection “Oligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and we further modified the statement on the interpretation of the spectra in the Discussion accordingly.</p><p><italic>7) Subsection “Oligomeric state analysis of membrane proteins in nanodiscs”, second paragraph: if that was true, then switching to diff. scaffold proteins or isotopes should show such species, but I don't think that they are actually released intact from the nanodiscs! This is too important to brush over with a &quot;cannot yet be assigned&quot; comment. Please elaborate this point in the paper.</italic> </p><p>As seen later in the manuscript, the proposed species could be released intact from the nanodiscs. This issue is picked up in second paragraph of the subsection “Oligomeric state analysis of membrane proteins in nanodiscs”, where we show that labelling now allows for the unambiguous assignment.</p><p><italic>8) Subsection “Refinement of LILBID-MS signal resolution by isotope labeling”, first paragraph: what type of deuterium labeling is used (during expression or later?) and how stable do the authors think that such labels will be?</italic> </p><p>The labels are applied during expression by the addition of labeled amino acids (see subsection “Cell-free protein production”). Besides some minor amino acid scrambling in the cell-free lysate specific to asparagine and glutamine residues, this labelling is extremely stable even at high temperatures used for NMR measurements. The labelling strategies by cell-free expression have been published numerous times before and they have been used to facilitate full assignments of rather large membrane proteins within NMR. We have added some corresponding references (Laguerre 2015,2016 and Reckel 2010).</p><p><italic>9) A reviewer is not fully convinced by data on MraY from B. subtilis and E. coli. It seems clear that there is dimer of B. subtilis MraY in both DMPG and DMPC, but the amount of a monomer/nanodisc complex is much greater in DMPC. In contrast, the amount of dimer is very small, barely out of the noise. This does not correlate with comparable activity observed in these two lipids. Overall, it is not clear whether similar amounts of proteins were produced and analyzed. SDS gels showing the protein assembled into different lipids would have been helpful. In contrast, inclusion of previously published data in the figure seems unnecessary.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for that confusion; we zoomed in one spectrum for better illustration but forgot to indicate that (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Both spectra are now shown at identical scale and dimer formation in both lipids is quite comparable. The larger peak area of the monomer/scaffold protein signal with DMPC represents a dissociation product resulting from non-specific interactions in between MraY and the scaffold proteins. Those might be influenced by the different charge of DMPC versus DMPG, but are not of relevance for the interpretation of our results. Samples were always purified by Strep-tags of the inserted membrane proteins (see subsection “Purification of cell-free expressed membrane proteins”, first paragraph) and analyzed at similar concentrations of approx. 1.5 mg/mL. Yes, we agree that showing already published data is not necessary but we think that here it illustrates the results nicely and makes it simple for the reader to follow without having to download and going deeply into previous publications.</p><p><italic>10) The conclusion needs to be rewritten as it mixes and confuses issues of protein production, nanodisc preparation and MS characterization.</italic> </p><p>The Discussion has been completely re-organized and re-written.</p><p><italic>11) Discussion, third paragraph and elsewhere: I disagree that the spectra are straightforward to analyze. The authors use specialized, home-written software and peak shapes are often ambiguous (see above).</italic> </p><p>What is meant here is that the spectra are comparably easy to interpret (e.g. if compared with ESI spectra), as the LILBID desorption process leads to only few, very low charged gas phase ions (see Discussion, second paragraph). In the case of the here shown species, mainly the singly charged ones are observed. While the home-written software is helpful, it is not essential. However, the software is open accessible and the corresponding URL has been included. This is clarified now in the third paragraph of the subsection “LILBID-MS”.</p><p><italic>More importantly, while I agree that the largest complex is here always matching the expected species, there are plenty of smaller subcomplexes visible.

This leads at the same time to fragmentation of part of these complexes and therewith to the detection of the full-size complex along with potentially all possible lower size complex fragments. This mechanism should now become clearer from the changes made in the second paragraph of the subsection “Oligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
