during mitosis depends upon Kinesin-5 motors, which display a conserved, bipolar homotetrameric organization consisting of two motor dimers at opposite ends of a central rod. Kinesin-5 motors crosslink adjacent microtubules to drive or constrain their sliding apart, but the structural basis of their organization is unknown. In this study, we report the atomic structure of the bipolar assembly (BASS) domain that directs four Kinesin-5 subunits to form a bipolar minifilament. BASS is a novel 26-nm four-helix bundle, consisting of two anti-parallel coiled-coils at its center, stabilized by alternating hydrophobic and ionic four-helical interfaces, which based on mutagenesis experiments, are critical for tetramerization. Strikingly, N-terminal BASS helices bend as they emerge from the central bundle, swapping partner helices, to form dimeric parallel coiled-coils at both ends, which are offset by 90°. We propose that BASS is a mechanically stable, plectonemically-coiled junction, transmitting forces between Kinesin-5 motor dimers during microtubule sliding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02217.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02217.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02217.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Successful cell division requires copies of the chromosomes containing the genetic material of a cell to be accurately copied and then separated so that when a cell divides, each new daughter cell contains exactly one copy of each chromosome. If this does not happen, the cell may malfunction or die.</p><p>To separate the duplicated chromosomes, a biological machine called the mitotic spindle forms inside the cell. This has two poles, one at each end, with each pole being responsible for gathering together the chromosomes for delivery to each of the daughter cells. Large numbers of long, thin protein tubes called microtubules extend out of each pole. Some microtubules attach to the chromosomes, whilst others are responsible for pushing apart the two poles—and the chromosomes attached to them—to the opposite sides of the cell before it divides.</p><p>To move the poles, motor proteins slide pairs of microtubules that are attached to opposite poles over each other. The Kinesin-5 family of motor proteins is particularly important for mitosis, because it is essential for forming the mitotic spindle and for making it work correctly. These motors assemble into motile machines that can apply a force to both of the microtubules in a sliding pair at the same time because they contain motor units at each end connected by a central rod.</p><p>The structure of this central rod is crucial for the successful operation of Kinesin-5. Scholey, Nithianantham et al. have now worked out the structure of a region of this filament called the bipolar assembly, or BASS domain. This structure is more complicated than expected: it contains four helixes made of protein that are all intertwined with each other.</p><p>In addition, Scholey, Nithianantham et al. found two ‘molecular pockets’ that small molecules can access. By entering the pockets, the molecules could disrupt the structure of the BASS domain, and consequently prevent Kinesin-5 from forming the dual-ended machines required to work properly. As Kinesin-5 is required to build the mitotic spindle, this would interfere with cell division. Targeting molecules into these pockets could therefore potentially form part of an anti-cancer therapy, preventing the rapid cell divisions behind the spread of the disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02217.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02217.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>Kinesin-5</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>motor protein</kwd><kwd>coiled-coil</kwd><kwd>X-ray structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-GM08249, R01-GM55507, R01-GM05550712S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Bassam</surname><given-names>Jawdat</given-names></name><name><surname>Scholey</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of California Cancer Coordinating committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Bassam</surname><given-names>Jawdat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Bipolar Assembly domain of kinesin-5 comprises an anti-parallel four-helix bundle, which explains how kinesin-5 subunits assemble into bipolar tetramers with two motile ends that transmit forces while crosslinking and sliding adjacent microtubules during mitosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis is known to underlie the propagation of all cellular life. This process depends upon the action of a bipolar, macromolecular machine, the mitotic spindle, which uses dynamic microtubules (MTs) plus multiple kinesin and dynein motors to generate the piconewton-scale forces required for mitotic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loughlin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshima and Scholey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walczak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McIntosh et al., 2012</xref>). Of these, the MT-based motor, Kinesin-5 plays a key role, being essential for the assembly of bipolar spindles in most eukaryotic cells and driving or constraining the rate of spindle elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enos and Morris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sawin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saunders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brust-Mascher et al., 2009</xref>). Purified, native Kinesin-5 is a ‘slow’, plus-end-directed, bipolar, homotetrameric motor capable of using pairs of N-terminal motor domains at opposite ends of a central rod to crosslink MTs into bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashina et al., 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon and Roof, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, single Kinesin-5 holoenzymes can crosslink and slide adjacent MTs, displaying a threefold preference for MTs in the antiparallel vs the parallel orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hentrich and Surrey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weinger et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these data support the hypothesis that Kinesin-5 functions via a ‘sliding filament’ mechanism, crosslinking adjacent MTs into bundles throughout the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharp et al., 1999</xref>), and exerting outward or braking forces on antiparallel MTs to coordinate bipolar spindle assembly and to drive or constrain poleward flux and anaphase B spindle elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valentine et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaseda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scholey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012</xref>). In this model, the assembly of four Kinesin-5 polypeptides into a bipolar, tetrameric minifilament is crucial, but the molecular basis of this arrangement, which is, so far as we know, unique among MT-based motor proteins, remains unclear.</p><p>The kinesin superfamily of MT-based motors is organized into 14 or more families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wickstead and Gull, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). A characteristic feature of kinesin motors is the presence of a pair of adjacent motor domains capable of hydrolyzing ATP to walk in a hand-over-hand fashion along a MT track, thereby generating force and motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>). The adjacent motor domains are oriented by a parallel, α-helical coiled-coil rod that is capable of transmitting forces generated by the pairs of motor domains at one end of the rod to the associated cargo at the other end. The striking bipolar organization of Kinesin-5 family motor proteins means that the cargo for each motile unit (i.e., the pair of motor domains stepping along a MT protofilament) is another motile unit located at the opposite end of the bipolar minifilament. Therefore, the central rod must be able to transmit forces between pairs of motor domains located at its opposite ends in order to drive or constrain MT–MT crosslinking and sliding within the mitotic spindle, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Moreover, because the homotetrameric architecture of Kinesin-5 appears to be required for MT–MT crosslinking and for normal mitosis and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hildebrandt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tao et al., 2006</xref>), it is plausible to think that the disruption of its bipolar, oligomeric state could inhibit the rapid divisions of proliferating cancer cells, thereby providing a strategy for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Owens, 2013</xref>). Therefore, understanding how Kinesin-5 adopts its bipolar architecture is an important problem whose solution could lead to medical applications in addition to advancing our understanding of the basic mechanisms of motor protein function and mitosis.</p><p>Structure-function analysis of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Kinesin-5, KLP61F, identified a central bipolar assembly (BASS) domain within the coiled-coil rod that is critical for this motor’s bipolar organization and whose deletion results in disassembled, mostly monomeric, Kinesin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>). It is likely that the ability of this domain to organize four Kinesin-5 subunits into a bipolar minifilament and to transfer forces between pairs of motor domains situated at opposite ends of a 60-nm rod is essential for Kinesin-5 activity and mitotic cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hildebrandt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tao et al., 2006</xref>). To better understand how the BASS domain promotes the assembly of Kinesin-5 into bipolar tetramers, we determined its structure using X-ray crystallography and validated the structure using structure-based mutational analysis. Instead of the expected antiparallel arrangement of two side-by-side parallel coiled-coils proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashina et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>), we find that the BASS domain has a novel four-helix bundle structure, which very likely has important implications for its mechanism of action within the spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of the Kinesin-5 BASS domain</title><p>We purified a minimal BASS domain construct that assembles into a tetrameric, 220 Å long rod based on EM (KLP61F residues 635–835; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>). This BASS tetramer formed hexagonal (P6<sub>4</sub>22) crystals, which were used to determine its structure to 2.6-Å resolution using X-ray crystallography with the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method from selenomethionine-and mercury-derived crystals (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The asymmetric unit contains a canonical anti-parallel coiled-coil BASS domain dimer encompassing residues 640–802 of both chains, which represents the basic assembly unit of a Kinesin-5 minifilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This anti-parallel dimer is associated with a second dimer through a crystallographic dyad axis to form the full tetramer, whose dimer–dimer packing surface extends over a large area (≈7000 Å<sup>2</sup>) and is stabilized by sequential, alternating hydrophobic and ionic residue interfaces, each occupying three-helical turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The resulting four-helix bundle, which is 22 Å wide, 26 Å high, and 260 Å long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) is the longest helical minifilment structure determined to date, and it displays a striking organization. It consists of a 220-Å-long central bundle that is visible by EM and matches fairly well to other anti-parallel four-helix bundles, where helical axes are separated by equal distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, panel III) but then transitions to an asymmetric diamond-shaped bundle near its ends, where C-terminal helical axes become displaced and N-terminal helical axes are closer mediated by helical bends, termed elbows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The diamond shape helical organization at the poles brings the N-terminal ends of the helices at each pole into close juxtaposition so they emerge as parallel coiled-coil dimers, which were not resolved by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>), with a 90° rotational offset with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This 26-nm BASS domain lies at the center of the rigid 60-nm Kinesin-5 central rod and can direct the assembly of four KLP61F subunits into a bipolar Kinesin-5 tetramer with pairs of N-terminal motor domains on each end capable of processive hand-over-hand motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; see discussion in section entitled ‘Model for the Kinesin-5 minifilament’ below). The unique anti-parallel BASS organization presented here is structurally novel as it does not match the initial predictions of an anti-parallel arrangement of parallel coiled-coils across the central helical rod region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashina et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>), yet it is entirely consistent with all previous data on the BASS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>). The BASS structure may be representative of a new class of force-pliable four-helical anti-parallel junctions capable of orienting two dimeric coiled-coils in opposite directions.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02217.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Kinesin-5 BASS domain is an anti-parallel coiled-coil four-helix bundle that switches polypeptide partners at both ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic domain structure of a Drosophila Kinesin-5 subunit (KLP61F).

Dimeric anti-parallel coiled-coils are stabilized by complementary hydrophobic residues between <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions of the heptad repeat that are guided by salt bridges in the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). The tetrameric central bundle displays a precise and unusual pattern of alternating hydrophobic and ionic interfaces between the four helices, not previously observed in other anti-parallel coiled-coil bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4, 5, 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ernst and Brunger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yadav et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara and Minor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neculai et al.</xref>. This pattern can be clearly observed by electrostatic surface representation of the BASS tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each interface occupies approximately three alpha-helical turns on each helix within the bundle, starting at the center with interface A of the BASS tetramer and symmetrically extending toward both ends with paired interfaces B–F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3">Videos 2 and 3</xref>). The hydrophobic central interface (A) is bracketed by an ionic interface (B), another hydrophobic interface (C), and finally another ionic interface (D) positioned at the ‘elbows’ marking the transition between anti-parallel four-helix bundle and parallel coiled-coils at the ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Interface A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel IV) is composed of Met729, 730 and 733 from two helices and Leu725 and 726 from the anti-parallel helix. In other Kinesin-5 orthologs, conservative substitutions of the cluster of methionine residues to other bulky hydrophobic residues are universally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interface B lies outside interface A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel III), and consists of salt bridges between Arg716 and Glu715 within a single chain, and Glu715/Glu722 and Arg740 residues of anti-parallel helices. Lys737 also engages the conserved Asp723 residues of the non-partner anti-parallel helices. Arg740 and Glu722 are highly conserved and are present in other species at equivalent positions or 3–4 residues apart positioning them on the same side of the helices in the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These ionic interfaces are solution-accessible and contain visible electron density for several ordered water and cryoprotectant molecules. On the edges of interface B, hydrophobic heptad interfaces stabilize each BASS anti-parallel dimer, involving conserved Leu725 and 718 engaging the conserved Ile736. Next, the hydrophobic interface C is composed of Leu705, 708, and 712 in two helices engaging Met747, Leu751, and Met754 in anti-parallel helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel II). At the edge of interface C, complementary salt bridges are observed between Glu704 and 711 with His750 of the non-partner anti-parallel helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel II). Interface D lies at the elbow region, and involves two Arg761 residues engaging both Asp701 residues of the anti-parallel subunits at the center of the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel I). In total, these seven unique interfaces in the central bundle provide highly precise environments to form the tetramer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Such a precise pattern of alternating complementary interfaces was not observed in other four-helical bundles, and is likely to be specifically required for the precise architecture of the Kinesin-5 bipolar minifilament. It may serve to mechanically stabilize the central rod’s organization while transmitting forces between the two pairs of N-terminal motor domains at opposite ends of the tetramer. Moreover, the ionic interfaces B and D are open molecular pockets that are critical for specifying Kinesin-5 organization and are accessible to small molecules, such as the cryoprotectants observed in our structure. These pockets provide a new potential target site for small molecules that, instead of inhibiting the activity of the conserved kinesin superfamily motor domain in the manner of monastrol and related inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maliga et al., 2002</xref>), may interfere with Kinesin-5 oligomerization by disrupting these salt bridges to inhibit Kinesin-5 biopolar tetrameric assembly and function during mitosis.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02217.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The BASS central bundle is assembled through an alternating pattern of antiparallel hydrophobic and ionic interfaces.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full side-view of the BASS structure as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, describing the regions of the BASS bundle, termed interfaces <bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>.

This transition promotes a swap in helical organizations, from anti-parallel coiled-coil dimers in the central bundle to parallel coiled-coil dimers at its ends. The swap transition is promoted by two helical ‘elbows’ in which Pro699 and Gly693 bend the helices by 10° which ultimately bring the N-terminal helices at each pole into close proximity, emerging as parallel coiled-coils associating directly through heptad residue packing on opposite ends with a 90° rotational offset around the filament axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig6">Figures 2, 4 and 6</xref>). Near the ends of the bundle, two interfaces mediate these helical swaps: a hydrophobic interface (E) and a di-tyrosine interface (F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">video 3</xref>). Interface E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel III) maintains a 45° rotated anti-parallel four-helix bundle organization via Met687, Leu691, Leu694 of two helices packing with Met768 and Ile772 of the anti-parallel helices in a four-helix hydrophobic packing interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, panel II and V). Within interface F, C-terminal helices are positioned further away from center of the bundle axis, due to two Tyr residues whose rings undergo end-to-end hydrogen bonding between their hydroxyl groups. Two His683 residues of the N-terminal helices stack their imidazole rings against Tyr775 residues through π–π interactions to stabilize their end-on orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel II). Bulky residues Tyr775 or His683 are conserved suggesting that this motif is retained with some modifications in all Kinesin-5 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Beyond interface F, the N-terminal helices swap organization to form parallel coiled-coils between residues 670–640 stabilized by hydrophobic <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> heptad packing interaction (pCC interface). Two heptad interactions are observed between the two N-terminal helices, with two half heptads at each N- and C-terminal end. Ile651, His658 and Met665 form the ‘d’ positions, and Asn655, Leu662, and Phe669 form the ‘a’ positions in these heptads. Phe669-Phe669 residues pack using π–π hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the C-termini to form parallel coiled-coil structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>, panel I). In Kinesin-5 sequence alignments, the last two heptads contain a Phe residue in either <italic>a</italic> or <italic>d</italic> position, which is likely to stabilize the reorganization at the tips of the N-terminal parallel coiled-coil structures via benzyl–benzyl ring interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that the N-termini of full-length Kinesin-5 extending beyond the boundaries of the BASS tetramer likely form continuous parallel coiled-coils.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Testing the Kinesin-5 tetrameric model using structure-based mutagenesis</title><p>To test the role of the conserved residues within interfaces A–F and the swapped parallel coiled-coils in the assembly of the BASS domain, we disrupted them by structure-based mutagenesis and assessed the oligomeric state of the resulting BASS mutant proteins using hydrodynamic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>), wild-type BASS forms a monodisperse tetramer based on gel filtration chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig8">Figures 1 and 8B</xref>). Mutations that target residues within various hydrophobic and ionic interfaces in the BASS central bundle cause defects in BASS oligomerization, observed as a shift in the protein’s elution profile from tetramers (broken vertical line) to monomers (solid line) or an intermediate, presumptively dimeric species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Strikingly, single Arg740 and Arg761 residue mutations in interfaces B and D of BASS cause potent defects in specifying BASS tetramers producing a mixture of dimer and tetramer species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–I</xref>). In contrast, mutagenesis of the region where helix-swapping forms parallel coiled-coils at the ends of the BASS domain (Phe669Glu BASS mutant) remained tetrameric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>). Mutagenesis of multiple interfaces across the tetramer, for example interfaces A and F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J–K</xref>); interfaces, A, F and the parallel coiled-coil swap regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>); and interfaces A, B, C, D, F and the swap region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>) enhanced the disruptive effects of the single mutants and produced monomeric BASS species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>). Our mutational analysis validates the proposed BASS tetrameric organization revealed by the structure by demonstrating the critical roles of the alternating interfaces in forming and stabilizing the BASS tetramer and further suggests that both hydrophobic and ionic interfaces have cumulative guiding roles in selectively organizing the BASS tetramer fold and stabilizing the Kinesin-5 tetramer minifilaments. The strong defects observed for single Arg BASS mutants (Arg740 and 761) suggest that small molecules that interfere with these ionic interactions in BASS interfaces B and D can disrupt Kinesin-5 minifilament assembly and may inactivate Kinesin-5 sliding motility.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02217.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Structure-based biochemical analysis of the BASS interfaces in stabilizing Kinesin-5 bipolar minifilaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic view of BASS tetramer, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

Our model was built by superimposing dimeric parallel coiled-coils at the bipolar ends of the BASS tetramer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and indicates that; (i) the rigid tetrameric fold of the Kinesin-5 BASS domain into bipolar tetramers dictates long-range strict structural and functional assembly of helical coiled-coils N-terminal to BASS with the helical section C-terminal to BASS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We modeled the Kinesin-5 motor and tail domain to lie at the ends of the central rod, consistent with EM and with them both binding MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</xref>). The anti-parallel organization of BASS dimers likely produces head-to-tail junctions at the bipolar ends of Kinesin-5 coupling two dimeric kinesin heads with the conserved C-terminal tails, by traversing in the opposite orientation within the central rod filament; and (ii) The Kinesin-5 sequences C-terminal to BASS may not be fully helical nor form coiled-coil structures because their length is shorter than the length of the N-terminal-to-BASS domain coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig9">Figures 1, 9</xref>). Moreover, while the overall model length matches that seen by EM, the rod itself is longer than that observed, similar to the Kinesin-1 rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>).

The structure explains how Kinesin-5 assembles into bipolar, homotetrameric minifilaments, but what are the biological implications of the BASS domain structure? Our main findings are that; (i) the central bundle of the BASS tetramer is a novel anti-parallel coiled-coil four-helix bundle, which is held together by a unique and alternating arrangement of hydrophobic and ionic interfaces; and (ii) helical bends, at the outer ends of the central bundle promote transitions into parallel coiled-coils, which are offset by 90° around the filament axis with respect to each other. One significant consequence of this structure is that the BASS tetramer orchestrates a parallel organization and rotational offset of the pairs of motor domains at each end of a Kinesin-5 minifilament resembling the organization of the two motor domains comprising the motile end of the unipolar Kinesin-1 motor. This organization may be important in allowing the adjacent motor domains on either end of a Kinesin-5 minifilament to step processively in a hand-over-hand fashion along each MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valentine et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaseda et al., 2009</xref>), thus enabling the Kinesin-5 tetramer to slide MTs outward or to constrain their sliding apart within the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hentrich and Surrey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weinger et al. 2011</xref>). A second consequence is that the four helices of the BASS domain are highly intertwined, in a manner reminiscent of the plectonemic coiling of the two polynucleotide chains of a DNA double helix, far more so than the simple association of two anti-parallel side-by-side dimeric coiled-coils proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashina et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>). The resulting heavily intertwined four-helix bundle is likely to be torsionally stiff, and this may be crucial in setting the 90° offset between the two dimeric ends of the BASS structure. This offset could in turn contribute to the motor’s observed threefold preference for crosslinking anti-parallel vs parallel MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</xref>) but further work is required to test this idea. We hypothesize that the nature of the bundling of the BASS domain is critical for the Kinesin-5-mediated sliding filament mechanism because it functionally links the pairs of motor domains located at opposite ends of the Kinesin-5 minifilament by transmitting forces and possibly allowing allosteric signaling between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, we propose that the alternating pattern of interfaces revealed by the BASS structure serves not only to specify the assembly of Kinesin-5 subunits into bipolar tetramers, but also to increase central rod stability during force transmission in a manner that facilitates its ability to push apart or to restrain the sliding apart of cross-linked MTs. Measuring the magnitude of forces that the rod can transmit or withstand would be a useful test of this idea, but this is currently not technically feasible. Finally, we note that we have obtained no convincing evidence for the assembly of Kinesin-5 tetramers into higher order oligomers, and the extensive inter-twining of its four chain makes it’s dissociation into, for example, dimers during force transmission unlikely. Thus it seems reasonable to propose that the Kinesin-5 bipolar tetramer represents the functional unit of Kinesin-5 activity, consistent with motility assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weinger et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02217.020</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The implications of BASS structure on the Kinesin-5 motility and force transfer mechanism.</title><p>Schematic model of Kinesin-5 minifilament showing the potential role of BASS in force transfer between two motile ends of Kinesin-5 tetramers: the orientation of Kinesin-5 tetramers and role of BASS bipolar tetramer in transmitting the forces between two motile Kinesin-5 ends.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02217.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02217.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02217-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The conservation in amino acid sequence, structural features and length of the 4-stranded helical rod among members of the Kinesin-5 family, but not in members of other kinesin families, suggests that the properties of the BASS domain reported here are likely to be key to understanding how Kinesin-5 can either drive or constrain spindle pole separation during spindle assembly, spindle maintenance, and anaphase B spindle elongation in a broad range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enos and Morris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saunders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brust-Mascher et al., 2009</xref>). The bipolar organization of Kinesin-5 resembles that of the bipolar class 2 myosin filament that drives the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction, cytokinesis and other forms of motility in non-muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huxley, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turbedsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billington et al., 2013</xref>). However, whereas varying numbers of myosin-2 motors can assemble into filaments of variable length, all capable of pulling actin filaments inward, we propose that the unique structure of the BASS domain allows it to organize four Kinesin-5 subunits into stable, mechanically robust bipolar tetramers of uniform length, that represent functional units capable of bearing both compressive and tensile forces as they slide cross-linked MTs outward, or resist their outward sliding. Finally, we speculate that our structure may enable the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting the ionic interfaces within the BASS central bundle, leading to the disruption of Kinesin-5 tetramer assembly and inhibiting its function in rapidly proliferating cancer cells, thereby providing a possible avenue towards therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Owens, 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kinesin-5 BASS construct design, expression and purification</title><p>Oligonucleotide primers for shortened KLP61F (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Kinesin-5) wt construct (residues 633–835) were designed based on hydrodynamic and EPR analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>).

X-ray diffraction data were indexed with program imosfilm and scaled with Scala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Project, 1994</xref>), combined with ellipsoidal truncation and anisotropic scaling, which included 84% completeness in the overall resolution shells. We used 2.6 Å as the high-resolution cut-off to avoid excessive loss of completeness. Selenium edge X-ray diffraction data set was collected at 0.9792 Å wavelength. The diffraction was also anisotropic (minimum Bragg spacing 2.9 Å, and 3.1 Å in the weakest, intermediate, and strongest diffracting directions). We used 2.9 Å as the high-resolution cut-off with 92% completeness in the overall resolution shells. The data set was not adequate to provide phase information directly, due to high number of Met at the hexagonal sixfold axis. Phase information was initially determined using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) method, using a 3.8 Å Mercury diffraction data set collected at the Mercury anomalous edge at 1.007 Å wavelength, with the program SHELEXD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sheldrick 2010</xref>). Five heavy atom sites were identified and refined with SHELEXD. Initial BASS electron density was used to build backbone density for short helical segments, which were then combined with the heavy atom sites to further refine phases in PHENIX suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). Selenium substructures were obtained by running Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) in its MR-SAD mode with phases from BASS-Hg poly-alanine model. These phases were subjected to automatic density modification with solvent flattening and histogram matching as implemented in PHENIX. Automatic chain tracing with the program RESOLVE yielded several helical fragments. Manual tracing in the program COOT was used to fill the gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>).

The stereochemical quality of the models was assessed using the program PROCHECK and MolProbity. The native BASS model includes two chains with density observed for residues 640–791 and 660–795 for the two chains. The final selenomethionine BASS model, described here, includes two BASS subunits, including residues 640–802 and 648–802 of the two chains. Residues 803–843 were disordered and not observed in the BASS structures. All structural rendering figures were generated using UCSFchimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The Kinesin-5 model was built using a combination of COOT, O and PyMOL programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeLano, 2002</xref>). We reasoned that the BASS domain is asymmetrically positioned in a phylogenetically conserved position within the Kinesin-5 primary sequence, 280 residues C-terminal to the motor domain and 120 residues N-terminal to the tail domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Sequences between the BASS and motor domains (KLP61F residues 361–640) are likely helical with a high coiled-coil propensity, as measured by PAIRCOILS2, whereas sequences C-terminal to the BASS domain but upstream of the tail (residues 796–922) are predicted to form short helical segments, but with very low coiled-coil prediction scores (data not shown). To construct a model of the rigid Kinesin-5 central rod region, we overlaid a canonical parallel coiled-coil structure (tropomyosin; PDB ID 1C1G) onto the extreme N-termini of the BASS tetramer structure, where it has transitioned to a parallel coiled-coil conformation (C-alpha r.m.s.d. = 1.4 Å for 14 residues overlaid per chain). We extended each parallel coiled-coil region by 230 residues to form a 79-nm long rod.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Major datasets</title><p>The coordinates and structure factor data for the Selenomethionine and native Kinesin-5 BASS structures were submitted to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the ID 4PXT and 4PXU, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ruben Diaz-Avalos for electron microscopy data collection, John Voss for discussions on the Kinesin-5 BASS EPR spectroscopy data and Julie Leary, and Youjin Seo for help with mass-spectrometry.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Tony Hyman as the Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision. All three reviewers were enthusiastic about your manuscript and in discussions we decided to accept it for publication as is. The reviewers had a number of comments that we think would improve the clarity of the manuscript, and these are included below. Please modify your manuscript appropriately, and upload a final version. You do not need to provide a cover letter saying what you did in this case.</p><p>1) Introduction: “Bipolarity is unique amongst MT motor proteins…” Not sure we know this. Crosslinking and sliding abilities have recently been described for Kinesin-8 and Kinesin-15.</p><p>2) Make the point that the bipolar K-5 tail structure may have to bear compressive loading as well as stretching?</p><p>3) Point out more explicitly that the heavily entwined 4-coil structure is expected to be torsionally stiff and that this can be key to making the rotational offset between the two ends impact the motor's preference to crosslink parallel or antiparallel MTs.</p><p>4) Results and Discussion subsection “Structure of BASS central bundle”: “Such a precise pattern... stabilizes its organization mechanically while transmitting forces...” Is it possible to roughly estimate how much stability in terms of, say, binding energy, the precisely alternating interfaces add to the overall tetrameric coiled-coil? Could it be possible that the total interaction energy might not be the most important feature of this novel construction principle, but maybe rather the possibility that this design could provide an efficient kinetic pathway to first form antiparallel dimers with the correct register before two of those associate to a tetramer?</p><p>5) Concluding remarks: “The 90<bold>°</bold> offset between the two dimeric ends..may set a larger rotational offset.” This is unclear. Larger than what? Isn't it the case, due to symmetry, that both dimeric catalytic motor head ends of the teramer rotate by the same amount if one were to fix the BASS domain in space, such that their relative angular orientation should remain the same?</p><p>6) Concluding remarks: “We hypothesize that this bundling is critical...” It is not so clear how or in what sense increased central rod stability would enable or improve force transmission. What kind of load on the coiled-coil stalk do the authors envision? I would think that the sketch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is highly schematic or do they envision lateral bending as important? Is there any evidence for that? A simple possibility would be that the stalk is always extensionally stressed. Compression seems unlikely because buckling would not need much force. Clearly a motor can push filaments apart in any direction while it is itself under extensional stress. In this vein, as far as the load on the motor goes, it does not make sense to distinguish between “inward pulling” and “outward pushing”. The difference between those two modes only affects the filaments that are being pushed or pulled, not the motors that could in both cases be either under compression or extension.</p><p>7) When modeling the C-termini of the motors, where does the tail end up with respect to the heads on that side? It seems, given the fact that the C-terminal stalk segments overhanging the BASS domain are much shorter than the N-terminal stalk fragments, that the tail would end up short of the heads.</p><p>8) It might be interesting to speculate, based on the new results, how the allosteric signaling from one end to other can take place. The way the two antiparallel coils are stapled together presumably prevents any relative sliding which could have been a possibility.</p><p>9) There appears to be some confusion in the figures and figure captions: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> caption somehow is mixed up a supplementary figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> caption is unclear: explain colors, give some more details. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> caption: “The lines in panel C” should read “The lines in panel B”? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> caption also seems to have mistakes and inconsistent formatting.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> there seem to be skip residues in some positions. This is hard to make out because the asterisks in some places bridge two positions – please adjust and mark positions where there is an octad rather than a heptad pattern. Please explain in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> what the asterisks indicate.</p><p>11) This is the first and only crystal structure of a kinesin tail to date and this is worth stating.</p><p>12) Do the temperature factors provide any clues to dynamics?</p><p>13) “Interface” is overused – this same term is used for the helical seams between neighbouring chains and for the axial boundaries between hydrophobically and electroststically-stabilised sections of tetracoil.</p><p>14) Given that <italic>eLife</italic> likes to buck convention, perhaps the authors could consider contributing their PyMOL .py session files so that readers can have a 3D look at colour-coded structures?</p><p>15) The hierarchy of interactions stabilising the 4-coil could be better described. The diamond profile beyond the elbows makes it clear that the tetracoil in these regions is the interaction of two coiled coils, but elsewhere the spacing between the chains is much more similar and it looks much more as though each chain makes quasi–equivalent interactions with 3 others? Perhaps make this explicit, or else make it clear why this is not so.</p><p>[Editors’ note: there is not an accompanying Author response to these minor comments.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
