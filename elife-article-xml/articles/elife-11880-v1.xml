ATF6α target genes encode foldases, chaperones, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes that increase protein-folding capacity in response to demand. The off-state of ATF6α is maintained by its spatial separation in the ER from Golgi-resident proteases that activate it. ER stress induces trafficking of ATF6α. We discovered Ceapins, a class of pyrazole amides, as selective inhibitors of ATF6α signaling that do not inhibit the Golgi proteases or other UPR branches. We show that Ceapins block ATF6α signaling by trapping it in ER-resident foci that are excluded from ER exit sites. Removing the requirement for trafficking by pharmacological elimination of the spatial separation of the ER and Golgi apparatus restored cleavage of ATF6α in the presence of Ceapins. Washout of Ceapins resensitized ATF6α to ER stress. These results suggest that trafficking of ATF6α is regulated by its oligomeric state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11880.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11880.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11880.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Newly made proteins must be folded into specific three-dimensional shapes before they can perform their roles in cells. Many proteins are folded in a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. The cell closely monitors the quality of the work done by this compartment. If the endoplasmic reticulum has more proteins to fold than it can handle, unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate and trigger a stress response called the unfolded protein response. This increases the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to fold proteins to match the demand. However, if the stress persists, then the unfolded protein response instructs the cell to die to protect the rest of the body.</p><p>A protein called ATF6α is one of three branches of the unfolded protein response. This protein is found in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is inactive. Endoplasmic stress causes ATF6α to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to another compartment called the Golgi apparatus. There, two enzymes cut ATF6α to release a fragment of the protein that then moves to the nucleus to increase the production of the machinery needed to fold proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>In a related study, Gallagher et al. identified a group of small molecules called Ceapins, which inhibit ATF6α activity. Here, Gallagher and Walter investigate how Ceapins act on ATF6α. The experiments show that Ceapin causes ATF6α molecules to form clusters that prevent the protein from moving to the Golgi apparatus by keeping it away from the machinery that moves proteins between these compartments. When the enzymes that cut ATF6α are sent to the endoplasmic reticulum, Ceapin treatment no longer prevents ATF6α activation, which shows that these small molecules specifically inhibit the stress-induced movement of ATF6α. When Ceapins are washed out of cells, the ATF6α clusters fall apart and ATF6α can now move to the Golgi.</p><p>These experiments show that ATF6α is actively held in the endoplasmic reticulum by a mechanism that is stabilized by Ceapins. Gallagher and Walter propose that the small clusters of ATF6α in unstressed cells act to keep this protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, when cells experience stress, the ATF6α clusters fall apart to allow the protein to move to the Golgi. The next steps following on from this work are to find out what these clusters are, how they are influenced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and exactly how the Ceapins stabilize these clusters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11880.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11880.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>ATF6-alpha</kwd><kwd>ER to Golgi trafficking</kwd><kwd>small molecule inhibitors</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallagher</surname><given-names>Ciara M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ceapins specifically inhibit ATF6α signaling by preventing its transport to the Golgi during endoplasmic reticulum stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activating transcription factor six alpha (ATF6α) is a type-II transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where, with its close homolog ATF6β, it functions as an ER stress sensor in one of the three principal branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Haze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). ATF6α target genes are exclusively cytoprotective, functioning to increase the folding capacity of the ER and restore ER homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Cells or animals lacking ATF6α show impaired survival upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). When demand exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, ATF6α is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where sequential cleavage by two Golgi-resident proteases – site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P), respectively - releases its N-terminal domain (ATF6α-N) from the membrane as a functional b-Zip transcription factor. ATF6α-N is then imported into the nucleus (nuclear translocation) where it activates transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanism that retains ATF6α in the ER and then releases it to allow transport to the Golgi apparatus is unknown. Deciphering the mechanism of ATF6α’s regulated trafficking is essential to understanding how proteostasis is maintained in the ER.</p><p>The mechanism whereby ATF6α senses ER stress has remained a mystery since its discovery in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>). The lumenal domain of ATF6α (ATF6α-LD) dictates whether ATF6α localizes to the ER or to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>). In fact, the soluble ATF6α-LD alone is sufficient to sense ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Sato et al., 2011</xref>), and attaching the ATF6α-LD to the constitutively transported SNARE protein Sec22 is sufficient to retain Sec22 in the ER of unstressed cells, allowing its trafficking to the Golgi apparatus only upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>). Thus ATF6α-LD is ATF6α‘s stress-sensor and regulates its trafficking. It is unclear what aspect of the folding environment ATF6α-LD is sensing, or if ATF6α senses misfolded proteins directly.</p><p>The molecular machinery required to move ATF6α from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, the COPII coat, is positioned on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Activation of ATF6α therefore requires transmitting the signal from the ER lumen to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Nadanaka et al., 2004</xref>). It is unknown whether ATF6α interacts with the COPII coat directly or requires a transmembrane adaptor or traffics by bulk-flow after release from a transport-incompetent state. SREBP, the membrane bound transcription factor that responds to low cholesterol, has an elegant trafficking mechanism involving binding of a retention factor, INSIG, to a transport factor, SCAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). Indeed it is SCAP, not SREBP, that binds to and senses cholesterol and this binding regulates the interaction of SCAP both with its retention factor INSIG and with the COPII coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Motamed et al., 2011</xref>). SREBP itself neither senses the signal nor interacts with the trafficking machinery. Similarly, a putative ACAP (ATF6α cleavage activating protein) and/or a putative INSIG-like ATF6α retention factor may remain to be discovered.</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanism whereby ATF6α senses stress we performed high-throughput cell-based screens to identify small molecule modulators of ATF6α signaling. In the accompanying paper, we describe the identification of Ceapins, a class of pyrazole amides that inhibit selectively the processing of ATF6α by S1P and S2P in response to ER stress but not the other UPR sensors, including – surprisingly – ATF6β, or SREBP. Using Ceapins to interrogate each step of ATF6α activation, we show here that Ceapins prevent selection of ATF6α into COPII vesicles by retaining it in foci in the ER membrane. Removing the requirement for trafficking by bringing together substrate and proteases restored cleavage in the presence of Ceapins. Ceapins induce rapid clustering of ATF6α, indicating that its oligomeric state plays a key role to regulate its trafficking and thereby activation in response to ER stress. Based on its mode of action corralling ATF6α into ER-restricted foci, we named Ceapins after the Irish verb 'ceap,' meaning 'to trap' .</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ceapins clusters GFP-ATF6α into foci, preventing its nuclear accumulation</title><p>To understand how Ceapins inhibit ATF6α activation and processing in response to ER stress, we monitored ATF6α trafficking. To this end, we used a U2-OS cell line, which stably expresses a fluorescent GFP-ATF6α fusion protein at low levels. We followed nuclear translocation of GFP-ATF6α-N, the proteolytic fragment resulting from GFP- ATF6α cleavage in response to ER stress. In unstressed cells, GFP-ATF6α localized to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>, <italic>green</italic>). As expected, after induction of ER stress by treatment with thapsigargin (Tg), which inhibits the ER calcium pump, or tunicamycin (Tm), which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, we observed a fraction of the GFP fluorescence in the nucleus, apparent by co-localization with DAPI-stained nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F</xref>, DNA in <italic>purple</italic>, co-localization indicated by <italic>white color</italic> in overlay).

To this end, we used immunofluorescence in 293 T-REx cells that stably express a doxycycline-inducible 3xFLAG-6xHis-tagged ATF6α (3xFLAG-ATF6α). In unstressed cells, we found 3xFLAG-ATF6α in the ER, co-localizing with the ER marker calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thirty minutes after induction of ER stress, a portion of 3xFLAG-ATF6α had moved out of the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, arrowheads in zoomed views). Treatment of these cells with Ceapin-A1, either in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) or absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) of ER stress, led to formation of 3xFLAG-ATF6α foci that decorated ER tubules (arrowheads in zoomed views). As expected, ER stress induced co-localization of 3xFLAG-ATF6α with giantin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). No such co-localization was observed upon co-treatment with Ceapin-A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus the Ceapin-induced formation of ATF6α foci is independent of the nature of the tag and likely reflects an intrinsic property of ATF6α.</p><p>To ask to what degree Ceapins completely block or just delay GFP-ATF6α transport to the Golgi apparatus, we induced ER stress in U2-OS cells in the absence or presence of active Ceapin analogs and imaged cells after a prolonged 2.4 hr incubation. We stained cells for an ER (GRP94) and a Golgi apparatus (giantin) marker. In unstressed cells, GFP-ATF6α co-localizes with the ER marker with only marginal Golgi marker co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). After 2.4 hr of ER stress, GFP-ATF6α showed pronounced Golgi apparatus localization with some ER staining remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). (Note that fixation conditions that best preserve ER structure are not optimal for nuclear staining, making nuclear translocation difficult to see in these images.) In the presence of active Ceapin analogs, GFP-ATF6α foci decorated ER tubules and show minimal co-localization with the Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O and P</xref>). Taken together, these results show that in different cell types and using different ATF6α variants, Ceapins induce ATF6α foci and prevent ATF6α trafficking to the Golgi apparatus in response to ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Ceapins induce foci formation of endogenous ATF6</title><p>Using qPCR analysis, we showed in the accompanying manuscript that Ceapins inhibit ATF6α signaling.

Here we show that one of the earliest steps in ATF6α activation – its selection as cargo to leave the ER – can be inhibited using Ceapins, a newly identified chemical scaffold. In cells treated with Ceapins, ATF6α clusters in foci that do not leave the ER, because it no longer engages with ER exit sites upon ER stress. Consequently, ATF6α is trapped in its uncleaved, inactive state. Importantly, Ceapins no longer inhibit proteolysis and activation of ATF6α upon lifting the requirement for ATF6α trafficking from the ER for proteolytic processing by relocalizing the Golgi-resident S1P and S2P proteases back to the ER. This is in contrast to the S1P inhibitor, which as expected, inhibits S1P independently of its subcellular localization. Thus Ceapins do not drive ATF6α into an uncleavable form that would occlude the interaction with S1P.</p><p>This Ceapin-mediated inhibition of ER-to-Golgi trafficking is selective for ATF6α without inhibiting its closely related homolog ATF6β whose transport is similarly regulated by ER stress [accompanying manuscript; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>]. This is the first evidence that there is a difference in the activation mechanisms employed by these two highly similar proteins. To date, ATF6α and ATF6β were thought to be equivalent in their mechanism of stress-sensing and trafficking. These data become even more surprising, because the lumenal domains of ATF6α and ATF6β are highly conserved and regulate ER stress-sensing and ER exit. Similarly, Ceapins do not interfere with SREBP signaling in response to cholesterol depletion, further underscoring that neither stress-sensing, cargo selection, nor ER-Golgi transport are generally affected by the drug. Ceapins could act on either side of the membrane to inhibit ATF6α trafficking. Its high level of selectivity strongly suggests that Ceapins act by binding to ATF6α or to an ATF6α–dedicated accessory factor that remains to be identified.</p><p>How ATF6α is retained in the ER in unstressed cells and how it is allowed to enter transport vesicles upon ER stress remains unknown. Our data showing that Ceapins trap ATF6α in the ER membrane in foci distinct from ER exit sites suggest a simple model of its action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): Ceapins bind to ATF6α or some unknown accessory factor, stabilizing an oligomeric state that is not transport competent. In an oligomer, the interface required for interaction with the COPII coat could be buried, while in its monomeric form ATF6α would be recognized as cargo. This model is attractive because of the speed with which ATF6α foci form and dissolve after addition or removal of Ceapins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is further supported by data showing that all active Ceapin analogs tested induced foci formation of ATF6α. In contrast, inactive Ceapin analogs either did not induce ATF6α foci or induced unstable foci that quickly disassembled during drug treatment. Moreover, dissolution of foci after washout of Ceapin analogs restored ER stress-induced transport to the Golgi apparatus.</p><p>Foci formation of ATF6α is also observed in the absence of Ceapin. We found that unlike over-expressed ATF6α fusion proteins, endogenous ATF6α in unstressed cells is found in foci, suggesting that the resting, ER-retained state of ATF6α is an oligomer or higher order complex. In addition, ATF6α signaling attenuates in the face of unmitigated ER stress: although ATF6α is still plentiful in the ER, its proteolytic cleavage to produce ATF6α-N is only observed at early time points after induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rutkowski et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed formation of ATF6α foci in cells treated with ER stress alone at time points at which attenuation of ATF6α signaling occurs. Our model poses that activation of ATF6α is achieved by shifting the equilibrium from a higher-order complex to a smaller entity (most likely an ATF6α monomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>]) that can be productively recruited into transport vesicles and that attenuation is achieved by shifting the equilibrium back. Ceapins prevent the formation of the transport-competent form even in the presence of ER stress. In this view, Ceapins engage the mechanisms that control normal retention/attenuation of ATF6α.</p><p>Our model is consistent with data showing that ATF6α exists in monomeric and oligomeric forms in the ER but that only the monomeric form is found in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Both stress-induced ER-Golgi trafficking and oligomerization of ATF6α are regulated by its stress-sensing lumenal domain. Thus the ATF6α ER-lumenal sensor domain would respond to stress in the ER by conversion from an oligomer to a monomer that would allow the information to be transmitted across the membrane to the cytosolic side initiating interactions with the COPII trafficking machinery. Among signaling transmembrane proteins there is precedence for conformational changes on one side of the bilayer leading to subsequent changes on the other side – notably for SCAP, the cholesterol sensor / trafficking adaptor of SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Motamed et al., 2011</xref>), but also for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Endres et al., 2013</xref>). Conformational epitopes that regulate COPII mediated trafficking have also been shown for Sec22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>) and for the potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>How ER stress is sensed by ATF6α is unknown. While it has been shown that ATF6α activation correlates with the release of BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2005</xref>), there is also evidence for ATF6α activation induced by direct ligand binding. These two principles are not mutually exclusive, as previously reconciled for the activation principles of IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence for activation by ligand binding comes from models of physiological ER stress in cardiac cells. In this system, ER stress induces expression of thrombospondin (Thbs4), which then binds to the lumenal domain of ATF6α and activates ATF6α signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>). As with IRE1, ATF6α may bind newly accumulating misfolded proteins directly as ligands to activate signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). We envision that Ceapins act as antagonists to prevent such binding and stabilize ATF6α in its inactive state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>Human bone osteosarcoma (U2-OS) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HTB-96, ATCC Manassas, VA).

Masks for the ER and nucleus of each cell were created using the GRP94 and DAPI staining respectively. The ratio of the GFP intensity in the nucleus versus the ER was calculated for each cell and plotted as a histogram per well. A threshold for the minimum ratio of nuclear to ER signal corresponding to an activated (i.e. nuclear localized ATF6) cell was calculated as the minimum nuclear: ER ratio greater than 1 where the number of ER stressed cells (Tg) was greater than the corresponding unstressed control. Percent activation per well was calculated as the percentage of cells per well with a nuclear: ER ratio greater than the calculated threshold for that plate. Mean percent activation per well for a minimum of three replicate wells per treatment was plotted; error bars are 95% confidence limits. Compounds are annotated as hits if they show percent activation more than three standard deviations lower than the mean of ER-stress treated control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Live Imaging of GFP-ATF6α in U2-OS cells</title><p>U2-OS cells expressing GFP-ATF6α were plated at 7500 cells per well in eight-well ibiTreat μSlide (ibidi 80826) in growth media containing 500 μg/mL G418 two days prior to compound addition.

Briefly, the Sec31A and Sec16 images for each slice of each stack were multiplied so that only pixels containing both Sec31A and Sec16 fluorescence would be non-zero. In this resulting image, ERES were identified as objects with a diameter range of 0.167 – 1.67 μm. Thresholding was automatic and clumped objects were separated based on intensity. The resulting outlines of ERES were used as masks to count the intensity of Sec31A (405 nm), Sec16 (561 nm), GFP-ATF6α (488 nm) and GRP94 (633 nm) within ERES in the original images. The correlation between fluorophores was calculated on a pair-wise basis for all four and the results for correlation of Sec31A and GFP-ATF6α in double Sec31A / Sec16 positive punctae are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.

The following day, cells were washed once in PBS (Sigma Aldrich D8537) and growth media without antibiotics or selection agent was added. 2 ng of pmRFP-p125A (kind gift from Meir Aridor) and 78 ng of salmon sperm DNA (carrier DNA, Life Technologies 15632011) were transfected per well using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega E2311) in OptiMEM reduced serum media (Gibco 31985) according to manufacturers instructions. After six hours, media was replaced with growth media supplemented with 500 μg/mL G418 to ensure expression of GFP-ATF6. The transient transfection protocol was optimized to prevent transfection-induced ER stress (as visualized by ER versus nuclear localization of GFP-ATF6α in transfected cells) and to minimize over-expression of pRFP-125A to prevent distortion of ERES. Only unstressed cells with normal ER and ERES morphology were selected for imaging.</p><p>Twenty-four hours after transfection cells media was exchanged for imaging media (as described above). Cells were imaged on a spinning disk confocal with Yokogawa CSUX A1 scan head, a 100x ApoTIRF objective NA 1.49 (Nikon) and a 565 nm long pass filter to split the emission light between two Andor iXon EMCCD cameras. For each cell, a z-stack with 0.25 μm steps was acquired every five minutes. Compounds were mixed to 6x from 1000x DMSO solutions in imaging media and added to cells for 1x final after acquisition of two z-stacks per cell. Post-acquisition, images from the cameras were aligned using the GridAligner plugin for ImageJ written by Nico Stuurman (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nstuurman/ijplugins/GridAligner.html">http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nstuurman/ijplugins/GridAligner.html</ext-link>) with the affine matrix calculated from reference images taken of a NanoGrid (an array of sub-wavelength sized holes, Miraloma Tech LLC, San Francisco, CA, A00011) using trans-illumination imaging.

We generated these chimeric constructs. Unfortunately over-expression of GFP-ATF6α through transient transfections does not reliably reproduce the biology of the endogenous protein – very few transfected cells show nuclear translocation in response to ER stressor and Ceapin induced foci are difficult to see given the high level of expression in the ER. It is difficult to infer Ceapin mediated inhibition or lack thereof for either ATF6α or the chimeras given the low level of nuclear translocation in the controls. This experiment will require substantial additional work and validation, which if successful will be included in a follow-up paper.</p><p><italic>6) Third paragraph, subsection “Ceapin-induced GFP-ATF6α foci are located along ER tubules and do not move to the Golgi apparatus”, figures numbers should be 3O and 3P.</italic></p><p>Thanks; done.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> just isn't intuitive, or useful to drive home the big picture, even after reading both of the linked manuscripts-maybe my printer didn't indicate ATF6α?</italic></p><p>This figure was corrupted during the upload process.
