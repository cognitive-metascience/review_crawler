Using the cellulolytic fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> as a model, we identified a xylodextrin transport and consumption pathway required for its growth on hemicellulose. Reconstitution of this xylodextrin utilization pathway in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> revealed that fungal xylose reductases act as xylodextrin reductases, producing xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as metabolic intermediates. These xylosyl-xylitol intermediates are generated by diverse fungi and bacteria, indicating that xylodextrin reduction is widespread in nature. Xylodextrins and xylosyl-xylitol oligomers are then hydrolyzed by two hydrolases to generate intracellular xylose and xylitol. Xylodextrin consumption using a xylodextrin transporter, xylodextrin reductases and tandem intracellular hydrolases in cofermentations with sucrose and glucose greatly expands the capacity of yeast to use plant cell wall-derived sugars and has the potential to increase the efficiency of both first-generation and next-generation biofuel production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05896.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05896.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05896.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants can be used to make ‘biofuels’, which are more sustainable alternatives to traditional fuels made from petroleum. Unfortunately, most biofuels are currently made from simple sugars or starch extracted from parts of plants that we also use for food, such as the grains of cereal crops.</p><p>Making biofuels from the parts of the plant that are not used for food—for example, the stems or leaves—would enable us to avoid a trade-off between food and fuel production. However, most of the sugars in these parts of the plant are locked away in the form of large, complex carbohydrates called cellulose and hemicellulose, which form the rigid cell wall surrounding each plant cell.</p><p>Currently, the industrial processes that can be used to make biofuels from plant cell walls are expensive and use a lot of energy. They involve heating or chemically treating the plant material to release the cellulose and hemicellulose. Then, large quantities of enzymes are added to break these carbohydrates down into simple sugars that can then be converted into alcohol (a biofuel) by yeast.</p><p>Fungi may be able to provide us with a better solution. Many species are able to grow on plants because they can break down cellulose and hemicellulose into simple sugars they can use for energy. If the genes involved in this process could be identified and inserted into yeast it may provide a new, cheaper method to make biofuels from plant cell walls.</p><p>To address this challenge, Li et al. studied how the fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> breaks down hemicellulose. This study identified a protein that can transport molecules of xylodextrin—which is found in hemicellulose—into the cells of the fungus, and two enzymes that break down the xylodextrin to make simple sugars, using a previously unknown chemical intermediate. When Li et al. inserted the genes that make the transport protein and the enzymes into yeast, the yeast were able to use plant cell wall material to make simple sugars and convert these to alcohol.</p><p>The yeast used more of the xylodextrin when they were grown with an additional source of energy, such as the sugars glucose or sucrose. Li et al.'s findings suggest that giving yeast the ability to break down hemicellulose has the potential to improve the efficiency of biofuel production. The next challenge will be to improve the process so that the yeast can convert the xylodextrin and simple sugars more rapidly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05896.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05896.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>xylose</kwd><kwd>hemicellulose</kwd><kwd>biofuel</kwd><kwd>xylodextrin</kwd><kwd>cofermentation</kwd><kwd>xylosyl-xylitol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>N. crassa</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Energy Biosciences Institute</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Vivian Yaci</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yuping</given-names></name><name><surname>Chomvong</surname><given-names>Kulika</given-names></name><name><surname>Estrela</surname><given-names>Raíssa</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Annsea</given-names></name><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Julie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Znameroski</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Feehan</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Soo Rin</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yong-Su</given-names></name><name><surname>Glass</surname><given-names>N Louise</given-names></name><name><surname>Cate</surname><given-names>Jamie HD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estrela</surname><given-names>Raíssa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel pathways of xylose metabolism identified in fungi that grow on plants can be used in yeast to promote hemicellulose conversion to biofuels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The biological production of biofuels and renewable chemicals from plant biomass requires an economic way to convert complex carbohydrate polymers from the plant cell wall into simple sugars that can be fermented by microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll and Somerville, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chundawat et al., 2011</xref>).

To test whether the xylosyl-xylitol oligomers resulted from side reactions of xylodextrins with endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> enzymes, we used two separate yeast strains in a combined culture, one containing the xylodextrin hydrolysis pathway composed of CDT-2 and GH43-2, and the second with the XR/XDH xylose consumption pathway. The strain expressing CDT-2 and GH43-2 would cleave xylodextrins to xylose, which could then be secreted via endogenous transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamacher et al., 2002</xref>) and serve as a carbon source for the strain expressing the xylose consumption pathway (XR and XDH). The engineered yeast expressing XR and XDH is only capable of consuming xylose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When co-cultured, these strains consumed xylodextrins without producing the xylosyl-xylitol byproduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that endogenous yeast enzymes and GH43-2 transglycolysis activity are not responsible for generating the xylosyl-xylitol byproducts, that is, that they must be generated by the XR from <italic>S. stipitis</italic> (<italic>Ss</italic>XR).</p><p>Fungal xylose reductases such as <italic>Ss</italic>XR have been widely used in industry for xylose fermentation. However, the structural details of substrate binding to the XR active site have not been established. To explore the molecular basis for XR reduction of oligomeric xylodextrins, the structure of <italic>Candida tenuis</italic> xylose reductase (<italic>Ct</italic>XR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kavanagh et al., 2002</xref>), a close homologue of <italic>Ss</italic>XR, was analyzed. <italic>Ct</italic>XR contains an open active site cavity where xylose could bind, located near the binding site for the NADH co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kavanagh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kratzer et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, the open shape of the active site can readily accommodate the binding of longer xylodextrin substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Using computational docking algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>), xylobiose was found to fit well in the pocket. Furthermore, there are no obstructions in the protein that would prevent longer xylodextrin oligomers from binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We reasoned that if the xylosyl-xylitol byproducts are generated by fungal XRs like that from <italic>S. stipitis</italic>, similar side products should be generated in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, thereby requiring an additional pathway for their consumption. Consistent with this hypothesis, xylose reductase XYR-1 (NCU08384) from <italic>N. crassa</italic> also generated xylosyl-xylitol products from xylodextrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, when <italic>N. crassa</italic> was grown on xylan, no xylosyl-xylitol byproduct accumulated in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, <italic>N. crassa</italic> presumably expresses an additional enzymatic activity to consume xylosyl-xylitol oligomers. Consistent with this hypothesis, a second putative intracellular β-xylosidase upregulated when <italic>N. crassa</italic> was grown on xylan, GH43-7 (NCU09625) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), had weak β-xylosidase activity but rapidly hydrolyzed xylosyl-xylitol into xylose and xylitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The newly identified xylosyl-xylitol-specific β-xylosidase GH43-7 is widely distributed in fungi and bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that it is used by a variety of microbes in the consumption of xylodextrins. Indeed, GH43-7 enzymes from the bacteria <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cleave both xylodextrin and xylosyl-xylitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To test whether xylosyl-xylitol is produced generally by microbes as an intermediary metabolite during their growth on hemicellulose, we extracted and analyzed the metabolites from a number of ascomycetes species and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> grown on xylodextrins.

For glucose plus xylodextrin co-fermentations, glucose was fed continuously at 2 ml/hr from a 10% stock. Analytes were detected as described for xylose plus xylodextrin co-fermentations, with the addition of the measurement of glucose concentrations in the culture broth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Co-fermentation of sucrose plus xylodextrins</title><p>Yeast strain SR8U with plasmid pXD8.7 was pre-grown aerobically to late-log phase in oMM medium lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose, washed with water, and resuspended in oMM medium. Media containing 75 g/l sucrose plus or minus 15 g/l xylodextrins were inoculated with 20 OD of the washed yeast seed culture and purged with N<sub>2</sub>. Fermentations were carried out in 50 ml of oMM medium in 125 ml serum bottles shaking at 220 rpm in a 30°C shaker. At the indicated time points, 1 ml samples were removed and pelleted. 5 μl supernatants were analyzed by ion-exclusion HPLC to determine sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose, xylitol, glycerol, and ethanol concentrations. 2 μl of 1:100 diluted supernatant was analyzed by LC-QToF, as described below, to determine xylodextrin concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ion-exclusion HPLC analysis</title><p>Ion-exclusion HPLC was performed on a Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a refractive index detector. Xylose fermentation samples were resolved on a Rezex RFQ-Fast Fruit H+ 8% column (100 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 50°C. Xylodextrin fermentation samples were resolved on Aminex HPX-87H Column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min at 40°C. Both columns used a mobile phase of 0.01 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>HPAEC analysis</title><p>HPAEC analysis was performed on a ICS-3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher, Sunnyvale, CA) using a CarboPac PA200 analytical column (150 × 3 mm) and a CarboPac PA200 guard column (3 × 30 mm) at 30°C. Following injection of 25 μl of diluted samples, elution was performed at 0.4 ml/min using 0.1 M NaOH in the mobile phase with sodium acetate gradients. For xylodextrin and xylosyl-xylitol separation, the acetate gradients were 0 mM for 1 min, increasing to 80 mM in 8 min, increasing to 300 mM in 1 min, keeping at 30 mM for 2 min, followed by re-equilibration at 0 mM for 3 min. Carbohydrates were detected using pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) and peaks were analyzed and quantified using the Chromeleon software package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mass spectrometric analyses</title><p>All mass spectrometric analyses were performed on an Agilent 6520 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF coupled with an Agilent 1200 LC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were resolved on a 100 × 7.8 mm Rezex RFQ-Fast Fruit H+ 8% column (Phenomenex) using a mobile phase of 0.5% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 55°C.</p><p>To determine the accurate masses of the unknown metabolites, 2 µl of 1:100 diluted yeast culture supernatant was analyzed by LC-QToF. Nitrogen was used as the instrument gas. The source voltage (Vcap) was 3000 V in negative ion mode, and the fragmentor was set to 100 V. The drying gas temperature was 300°C; drying gas flow was 7 l/min; and nebulizer pressure was 45 psi. The ESI source used a separate nebulizer for the continuous, low-level introduction of reference mass compounds (112.985587, 1033.988109) to maintain mass axis calibration. Data were collected at an acquisition rate of 1 Hz from m/z 50 to 1100 and stored in centroid mode.</p><p>LC-MS/MS was performed to confirm the identity of xylosyl-xylitol and xylosyl-xylosyl-xylitol. The compound with a retention time (RT) of 5.8 min and m/z ratio of 283.103 and the compound with an RT of 4.7 min and m/z ratio of 415.15 were fragmented with collision energies of 10, 20, and 40 eV. MS/MS spectra were acquired, and the product ions were compared and matched to the calculated fragment ions generated by the Fragmentation Tools in ChemBioDraw Ultra v13.</p><p>To quantify the carbohydrates and carbohydrate derivatives in the culture, culture supernatants were diluted 100-fold in water and 2 µl was analyzed by LC-QToF. Spectra were imported to Qualtitative Analysis module of Agilent MassHunter Workstation software using m/z and retention time values obtained from the calibration samples to search for the targeted ions in the data. These searches generated extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) based on the list of target compounds. Peaks were integrated and compared to the calibration curves to calculate the concentration. Calibration curves were calculated from the calibration samples, prepared in the same oMM medium as all the samples, and curve fitting for each compound resulted in fits with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.999. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES), the buffer compound in the oMM medium with constant concentration and not utilized by yeast, was used as an internal standard (IS) for concentration normalization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank L Acosta-Sampson and A Gokhale for helpful discussions, J Dueber for xylose utilization pathway plasmids, Z Baer, J Kuchenreuthe and M Maurer for helps in anaerobic fermentation, and S Bauer and A Ibañez Zamora for help with analytical methods.

However, there are several points that we ask you to consider for further improvement. Specifically, we would like to see that either the Thevelein strain is used (e.g. Biotechnol Biofuels, 2013, Jun 21; 6(1):89) and the experiments regarding the XI-based pathway is repeated, or that the entire paragraph about XI (paragraph ten of the Introduction, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">figure 5</xref>) is removed. In addition, please discuss the potential advantages of an XI-based pathway in connection with xylodextrin fermentation.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>There are a couple of points, which I still recommend to reconsider:</p><p>a) In the Abstract, the finding of the xylosyl-xylitol intermediates in other organisms should be mentioned, underlining the broader finding of the manuscript.</p><p>b) The manuscript of Ryan et al. should be cited.</p><p>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>: Growth of <italic>N. crassa</italic>.

I suggest you provide a proper biomass measurement.</p><p>d) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 6</xref>: It is difficult to believe that the <italic>N. crassa</italic> GH43-3 is so different from the other enzymes that it appears more closely related to enzymes of basidiomycetes (<italic>Schizophyllum</italic>) than to other ascomycetes.</p><p>e) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>: SDs of data are missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>When you state that “The excess reducing power generated by the XR/XDH pathway, initially deemed a problem…”, the XR/XDH pathway does not generate excess reducing power. The problem of the pathway is rather the cofactor imbalances between NADH and NADPH.

Also, the reviewer questioned the relevance of the novel oligosaccharides identified. Reviewer <italic>#</italic>2 was more positive. However, at the end also this reviewer questioned the break-through provided in your manuscript. In summary, we do not feel that the manuscript in its present version has sufficient novelty and quality for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we could imagine being interested in a manuscript describing the combination of both pathways for xylose catabolism in a genetically engineered yeast, which should show a superior capacity to degrade xylose and to produce ethanol.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript the authors describe the continuation of their work on the generation genetically engineered <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) strains which are able to concert xylose to ethanol.

Thus, the only novelty of this manuscript is the production of xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as a side-activity of <italic>S. stipitis</italic> and <italic>N. crassa</italic> xylose reductases (XR). These oligomers appear to be inhibitory in engineered <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to utilize xylodextrins. The authors solved this problem by the identification and expression of a new hydrolyase, GH43-7, which can cleave the xylosyl-xylitol oligomers. Although the authors claim that these oligomers appear to be widely distributed in nature, evidence for this statement is lacking. By contrast, the production of these oligomers might just result from the strategy applied. In general, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can be engineered to consume xylose either by expressing a xylose isomerase (XI) or by applying the XR/XDH pathway. Surprisingly, the authors used the XR/XDH pathway, although it is generally accepted that the XI pathway is more favorable for yeast (Biotechnol Biofuels, 2013, 6, 89; Metab Eng., 2012, 14: 611-22). As far as I know, the available xylose fermenting yeast strains from industry (DSM, Lesaffre, Terranol) are all based on the XI strategy. When the authors had used the XI strategy, they never would have encountered the problem of generating the xylosyl-xylitol oligomers by the heterologous XR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes expression of a novel pathway for metabolism of xylobiose and other short chain xylans in yeast. The pathway was identified in <italic>N. crassa</italic> and then transferred to yeast. The pathway involves two transporters and three intracellular hydrolysases, which were all identified in <italic>N. crassa</italic> based on RNAseq analysis. The xylose consumption pathway relies on the less efficient xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase pathway, but it still seems to work due to the partly reduction of xylodextrins intracellularly. This activity is, however, only conferred by the <italic>P. stipidis</italic> XR, so the pathway for uptake of xylodextrins could work equally well (and probably better) with the xylose isomerase pathway, which is to be preferred as it does not result in accumulation of xylitol (also here observed by the authors, but not commented).</p><p>I think this paper is a fantastic new contribution to the field and it definitely serves consideration. Even though it could be interesting to combine the new pathway with the XI route for xylose catabolism, I do not think it is fair to ask the reviewers to demonstrate this. However, I suggest that they clearly state that the main benefit of their work is actually that they have found a way to overcome one of the most fundamental problems in xylose catabolism, namely an alternative transport of xylose into the cell. Xylose is transported through the HXT transporters and has competitive inhibition by glucose. This pathway may work in concert with glucose consumption, and this may be the real benefit. The data presented by the authors even indicate this. I suggest that this is clearly stated in the paper.</p><p>Besides this I do not have any major comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05896.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We think your manuscript was significantly improved and has now given some fundamental insights into novel metabolic intermediates. However, there are several points that we ask you to consider for further improvement. Specifically, we would like to see that either the Thevelein strain is used (e.g. Biotechnol Biofuels, 2013, Jun 21; 6(1):89) and the experiments regarding the XI-based pathway is repeated, or that the entire paragraph about XI (paragraph ten of the Introduction, with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) is removed.

The problem of the pathway is rather the cofactor imbalances between NADH and NADPH. This sentence should be omitted</italic>.</p><p>We can see why the reviewer does not like this sentence, as it is not very precise. We have reworded the sentence to more accurately reflect what is going on, i.e. that cofactor imbalance leads to accumulation of reduced byproducts (xylitol and glycerol). We do think it’s worth keeping this sentence in the paper, as realistic hydrolysates will likely have a mixture of xylose and xylodextrins, and we have conclusively demonstrated that the cofactor imbalance of XR/XDH pathway can be exploited to drive reduction of acetate to ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al<italic>.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p>In the last round of review, the reviewers were not convinced that the xylodextrin consumption pathway we identified in <italic>N. crassa</italic> and the xylosyl-xylitol metabolic intermediates were widespread in nature. Furthermore, the reviewers were not convinced that this pathway could be competitive with one using xylose isomerase (XI) as opposed to xylose reductase plus xylitol dehydrogenase (XR/XDH). We have now carried out a large number of experiments to address these concerns.</p><p>First, we tested whether xylosyl-xylitols are generated intracellularly in a number of fungi, as well as in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, we find xylosyl-xylitols present in all of these organisms when they are grown on xylodextrins. These experiments convincingly show that xylosyl-xylitols are in fact widespread in nature, generated by microbes spanning well over 1 billion years of evolution. They are not simply a byproduct of reconstituting xylodextrin consumption in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Second, we carried out a direct comparison between two of the best xylose fermentation strains in the public domain–strain SR8, which uses the XR/XDH pathway (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2013</xref>, PLOS One), and strain SXA-R2P-E which uses the XI pathway and which was kindly provided by Prof. Hal Alper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/7/1/122">http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/7/1/122</ext-link>). Using anaerobic conditions, we find that, regardless of starting conditions, cell loading, or media, strain SR8 is far superior to strain SXA-R2P-E in terms of ethanol productivity. Strain SXA-R2P-E has a slightly higher yield of ethanol and produces less xylitol. To our knowledge, this is the first direct experimental comparison between high-performing XI and XR/XDH strains in the literature, and will be of wide interest.</p><p>Remarkably, we were surprised to find that, when using xylodextrins, the XR/XDH pathway produces far less xylitol when compared to xylose fermentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, not only does the capacity of the XR/XDH pathway for high flux far exceed that of the XI pathway, the propensity of the XR/XDH pathway to produce xylitol can be reduced by using xylodextrins as opposed to xylose in fermentations. Thus, we think it is highly worthwhile to explore the potential of the xylodextrin pathway we’ve identified for the first time. Although the flux through the upstream part of the xylodextrin consumption pathway is not as high as with xylose fermentation, we think future efforts such as directed evolution of the xylodextrin transporter can be used to solve this problem (see Ryan, 2014, eLife 3:e03703).</p><p>Finally, we now show that the xylodextrin pathway can be exploited in a range of cofermentation scenarios, including glucose plus xylodextrins (suggested by reviewer <italic>#</italic>2) and sucrose plus xylodextrins. These are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Cofermentation of xylose equivalents with glucose equivalents is a “holy grail” in the biofuel field, and we have now at least doubled the options available for future exploration (two previously described scenarios include glucose plus xylose and cellobiose plus xylose).</p><p>In summary, for both the ecological insights regarding xylodextrin consumption by microbes in nature, and the possible applications of xylodextrin fermentation to produce biofuels, we think this paper should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>In the current manuscript the authors describe the continuation of their work on the generation genetically engineered</italic> Saccharomyces cerevisiae <italic>(yeast) strains which are able to concert xylose to ethanol.

However, we note that this is the approach evolved in <italic>N. crassa</italic> for optimal growth on the plant cell wall, and involves an entirely surprising metabolic intermediate that had not been identified before. Furthermore, we now show this to be a very general pathway for consuming xylose. It is used in fungi spanning evolutionary time to the likely advent of the general architecture of the plant cell wall now extant in plants. Furthermore, the pathway is even present in bacteria, as we have now shown using <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and phylogenetic analysis of other bacteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, this pathway has arisen in organisms that span well over a billion years of evolutionary history. From a fundamental science perspective, we think this is certainly conceptually new and worth publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) Furthermore, the here analyzed xylodextrin transporter CDT-2 was recently characterized in detail by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><italic>Cai et al., 2014</italic></xref> <italic>(PLOS One 9:e89330)</italic>.</p><p>As noted above, xylodextrin transport is only a small part of the story.

There have been few if any direct comparisons of these pathways in the literature, with what could be described as state-of-the-art strains. To overcome this deficiency we have used two of the best strains available in the public domain in head-to-head comparisons. For the XR/XDH pathway, we used strain SR8, which is one of the best reported strains for xylose fermentation. For the XI pathway, we used strain SXA-R2P-E from Prof. Hal Alper’s lab, which he kindly provided us for these comparisons. This strain was recently reported in Biotechnology for Biofuels, and is one of the two best XI strains in the public domain (the one from Metab. Eng., 2012, 14: 611-22 is not available, although we requested it).</p><p>We used a number of conditions, all anaerobic, to compare the two strains head-to-head in batch fermentations. We find that, regardless of starting OD (or g cells/L culture), the SR8 strain expressing the XR/XDH pathway is far superior to the XI strain, with roughly twice the ethanol productivity. By contrast the XI strain is slightly better in terms of ethanol yield for the XR/XDH strain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Figure 6–figure supplement 1, Figure 6–figure supplement 2 and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in the new manuscript). Thus, even prior to considering the use of xylodextrins, the XR/XDH pathway is highly competitive, if not outright superior, to the XI pathway. Thus the rationale put forward by reviewer #1 that the XI pathway is preferred is not obvious.</p><p>We have also made the surprising observation that using xylodextrins minimizes xylitol byproduct formation by the XR/XDH pathway, which was previously seen as a fundamental weakness of the pathway. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2B</xref>. This suggests that, with further optimization of the upstream part of the pathway, i.e. through directed evolution of the transporter (see our recent work in eLife, Ryan et al.), the XR/XDH pathway could achieve both high ethanol productivity and yield, eliminating the rationale for the use of XI.</p><p>In addition, we discussed with Dr. Amit Gokhale from BP scenarios that could be of immediate use in improving biofuel production. He noted that, as we indicated in our original manuscript, xylodextrin fermentation could be used as an add-on to existing sugarcane ethanol production processes. In short, hot water pretreatment could be used to release xylodextrins from bagasse, and the resulting water could be used as the diluent for the cane juice used in ethanol fermentations. This would have the benefit of increasing ethanol yield beyond that possible from using cane juice alone. Indeed, we find this to be the case (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the new manuscript). Thus, cofermentation of sucrose and xylodextrins is a new and promising direction for producing biofuels.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This paper describes expression of a novel pathway for metabolism of xylobiose and other short chain xylans in yeast.

We also show that the use of xylodextrins reduces the amount of xylitol byproduct produced by the strain expressing XR/XDH. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now shown that glucose plus xylodextrin cofermentation is indeed possible, and produces very little xylitol as a byproduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We have also used xylodextrins in combination with sucrose, and see increased ethanol yields that are very promising in terms of an application to enhance sugarcane ethanol production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
