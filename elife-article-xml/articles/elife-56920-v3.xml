(ChI) activity are thought to contribute to Parkinson’s disease pathophysiology and dyskinesia from chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment, but the physiological basis of these changes is unknown. We find that dopamine lesion decreases the spontaneous firing rate of ChIs, whereas chronic treatment with L-DOPA of lesioned mice increases baseline ChI firing rates to levels beyond normal activity. The effect of dopamine loss on ChIs was due to decreased currents of both hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. L-DOPA reinstatement of dopamine normalized HCN activity, but SK current remained depressed. Pharmacological blockade of HCN and SK activities mimicked changes in firing, confirming that these channels are responsible for the molecular adaptation of ChIs to dopamine loss and chronic L-DOPA treatment. These findings suggest that targeting ChIs with channel-specific modulators may provide therapeutic approaches for alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in PD patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>HCN</kwd><kwd>SK</kwd><kwd>spontaneous firing</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS101982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Un Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS075222</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mosharov</surname><given-names>Eugene V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA007418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The JBP foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HCN and SK channel currents in striatal cholinergic neurons are decreased with dopamine loss, but only HCN is restored by chronic L-DOPA and SK abnormality persists in dyskinesia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The loss of dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta results in depletion of striatal DA and the manifestation of the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Though DA replacement therapy with its metabolic precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) remains the most effective treatment for PD symptoms, L-DOPA therapy can cause debilitating involuntary movements termed L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fahn, 2015</xref>). Dysfunction in striatal neurocircuitry due to nigrostriatal neurodegeneration and non-physiological DA synthesis from L-DOPA by non-dopaminergic neurons are thought to underlie the development of LID. The striatum is comprised primarily of GABAergic spiny projection neurons with a small population of GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons that in mice constitute ~5% of all striatal neurons. Though small in number, these interneurons have widespread effects on basal ganglia function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abudukeyoumu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>) and are thought to be important contributors to both PD-related motor dysfunction and LID.</p><p>In particular, striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) have been shown to contribute to movement abnormalities and LID development in rodent models of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aldrin-Kirk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bordia et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Divito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gangarossa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Wu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Won et al., 2014</xref>). Using mice deficient for paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (Pitx3) which lack substantia nigra DA neurons from birth, we previously reported that repeated L-DOPA treatment caused LID, increased baseline ChI firing rate, and potentiated ChI response to DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2011</xref>), while ablation of ChIs in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model significantly attenuated LID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Won et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, increasing ChI firing rate by chemogenetic or optogenetic methods enhanced LID expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aldrin-Kirk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bordia et al., 2016a</xref>), while decreasing ChI firing rate by inhibiting H2 histamine receptors that are preferentially expressed in ChIs in the striatum, attenuated LID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). Alterations in ChI activity following DA depletion have been studied, although with conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). However, the basis of changes in ChI physiology resulting from chronic L-DOPA treatment of DA depleted mice has not been identified.</p><p>Here, using acute striatal slice electrophysiological recordings in the dorsolateral striatum prepared from DA depleted and L-DOPA treated mice, we show that changes in intrinsic properties of ChIs cause slower spontaneous firing rates following DA depletion and faster firing rates after chronic L-DOPA treatment compared to sham controls. We found that both HCN and SK current were decreased in the DA depleted condition, whereas only SK current remained depressed after chronic L-DOPA. Changes in the activities of these two channels were sufficient to explain the observed alterations in ChI firing. Targeting altered activity of striatal ChIs with specific channel modulators may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the alleviation of LID in PD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in ChI spontaneous firing rate following DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment</title><p>To study alterations in ChI physiology in the parkinsonian mouse striatum, we induced dopaminergic lesions by infusing 6-OHDA unilaterally to the medial forebrain bundle (MFB).

Cholinergic neurons were identified by their large soma size relative to other cells in the dorsolateral striatum. The spontaneous firing frequency of ChIs decreased in 6-OHDA lesioned mice, but this decrease was reversed by chronic L-DOPA treatment to a level higher than that of sham-lesioned mice (sham: 2.6 ± 0.2 Hz, <italic>n =</italic> 83 neurons/26 mice; 6-OHDA: 1.7 ± 0.2 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 81 neurons/29 mice; chronic-LD: 3.5 ± 0.2 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 87 neurons/25 mice; p&lt;0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test; pairwise: sham vs. 6-OHDA, p=0.0002; sham vs. chronic-LD, p=0.0029; 6-OHDA vs. chronic-LD, p&lt;0.0001, Dunn’s multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). These changes persisted in the presence of blockers of ionotropic GABA and glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that altered spontaneous firing was driven by ChI-intrinsic mechanisms.</p><p>ChIs exhibit cell autonomous firing patterns, including irregular firing with bursts and pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson and Goldberg, 2006</xref>). Previous reports showed that DA depletion decreased the regularity of spontaneous firing and the number of bursts and pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we found an increase in the coefficient of variation (CV) of the instantaneous frequencies of sAP in ChIs from 6-OHDA mice, which was restored to sham control levels after chronic L-DOPA (sham: 0.36 ± 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 81 neurons/26 mice; 6-OHDA: 0.57 ± 0.05, <italic>n =</italic> 80 neurons/29 mice; chronic-LD: 0.36 ± 0.04, <italic>n</italic> = 87 neurons/25 mice; p&lt;0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test; pairwise: sham vs. 6-OHDA, p=0.0004; sham vs. chronic-LD, p=0.8126, Dunn’s multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, we found that 6-OHDA lesion decreased the number of both bursts and pauses, while chronic L-DOPA treatment of lesioned mice increased the number of bursts and restored the number of pauses compared to sham control levels. The duration of each burst was not different between the three groups, whereas pause duration was longer in the 6-OHDA and shorter in the chronic-LD groups. When the number of bursts and pauses were normalized to the number of sAP in each group, there was no significant difference between groups, suggesting that these irregularities of firing pattern changed in parallel with altered firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed evoked AP firing as a measure of ChI excitability with current clamp recordings during current injection steps from 0 to 300 pA. Similar to the changes in sAP frequency, ChI from 6-OHDA lesioned mice fired fewer evoked AP than ChI from sham animals, indicating that dopamine depletion decreased excitability. Chronic treatment with L-DOPA, however, only restored excitability back to sham levels (at 300 pA; sham: 35.8 ± 0.8 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 11 neurons/4 mice; 6-OHDA: 26.1 ± 1.2 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 16 neurons/5 mice; chronic-LD: 33.4 ± 1.6 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 18 neurons/5 mice; p&lt;0.0001 for interaction, Two-way ANOVA; pairwise group means: sham vs. 6-OHDA, p=0.0003; sham vs. chronic-LD, p=0.4173, Tukey’s multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Our group previously reported that chronic treatment with L-DOPA in a genetic model of dopamine depletion, but not in dopamine-intact mice, rendered ChI hyper-responsive to bath-applied dopamine during recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that bath exposure to dopamine increased spontaneous ChI firing rate only in brain slices from the 6-OHDA and chronic-LD groups, indicating that the effect of dopamine is biased towards excitation by dopamine depletion (dopamine-mediated change in sAP frequency: sham: 0.6 ± 0.3 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 7 neurons/3 mice, p=0.056; 6-OHDA: 2.4 ± 0.4 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 7 neurons/2 mice, p=0.0012; chronic-LD: 1.7 ± 0.4 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 10 neurons/3 mice, p=0.0026, Paired t test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>).</p><p>Thus, DA depletion significantly decreases the spontaneous firing rate, regularity of spiking and excitability of ChI, while increasing the firing rate in response to dopamine.

Next, using slice preparations from control mice (no sham surgery), we performed cell-attached recordings of ChI activity before and after bath application of 1 nM apamin either alone (to mimic decreased SK but normal HCN activity seen in chronic-LD group) or in combination with 1 µM ZD7288 (to mimic inhibition of both SK and HCN channels in 6-OHDA group).

Here, we examined the consequences of DA loss and those of chronic treatment with L-DOPA on mouse ChI physiology. In addition to altered morphology, synaptic connectivity and responsiveness to DA receptor stimulation, we found significant alterations of cell-intrinsic properties of ChIs. In the DA depleted striatum, both HCN- and SK-mediated currents were diminished. HCN current reduction was accompanied by reduced TRIP8b, which regulates trafficking and gating of HCN channels, rather than changes in <italic>Hcn</italic> mRNA expression. Interestingly, chronic treatment of lesioned mice with L-DOPA restored HCN activity to sham levels while SK currents remained depressed. The pharmacological blockade of HCN and SK channels to mimic the DA depleted and chronic L-DOPA treated states recapitulated the changes in rate and pattern of ChI firing, providing new insights into molecular adaptations that follow striatal DA depletion in PD patients receiving L-DOPA therapy.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Changes in ChI tonic activity following DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment</title><p>Anticholinergic drugs have been effective in the treatment of PD symptoms, highlighting the importance of cholinergic neurotransmission to basal ganglia function. Early observations showed that the severity of PD symptoms in patients is worsened by drugs that increase cholinergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duvoisin, 1967</xref>), while more recent reports demonstrated that direct optogenetic and chemogenetic inhibition of ChIs improved DA depletion-mediated motor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanimura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ztaou et al., 2016</xref>). Though the contribution of aberrant ChI neurotransmission to PD pathophysiology is unquestioned, conflicting results on the change in ChI activity caused by DA depletion have been reported. We show here that both spontaneous activity and excitability of dorsolateral striatal ChIs in 6-OHDA injected mice are significantly decreased. Similar changes were recently demonstrated using a genetic model with diphtheria toxin to induce dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, other studies using similar protocols in rodents have shown no significant change in the tonic firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2006</xref>), and increased excitability of ChIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Some of these discrepancies can be attributed to differences in animal species (mice vs. rats) or experimental conditions (DA-lesion protocol, composition of the recording solutions, etc.) but careful evaluation of the contribution of these differences is currently lacking.</p><p>Levels of acetylcholine in striatal tissue or CSF from PD patient samples are not different from controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duvoisin and Dettbarn, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Welch et al., 1976</xref>), but these approaches cannot resolve differences in acetylcholine release due to altered synaptic activity. The lack of change in overall acetylcholine levels raises the question of whether the ‘hypercholinergic state’ in PD reflects an increase in basal cholinergic release, a shift in the balance between DA and acetylcholine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>), or altered firing of ChIs in response to physiological stimuli. For example, striatal tonically-active neurons (putative ChIs) in non-human primates exhibit a pause response that is acquired after training in a classical conditioning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aosaki et al., 1994</xref>). In trained animals, the conditioned stimulus elicits a brief pause (~200 ms) in ChI tonic firing, followed by a brief rebound increase in firing rate. Lesion of the striatonigral system with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) did not change the tonic firing rate of ChIs, but abolished this pause response in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aosaki et al., 1994</xref>). As this pause is thought to provide a ‘window’ to encode cortico-striatal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains and Bergman, 2015</xref>), loss of this pause response and increased variability of ChI firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>) may cause dysregulation of cortico-striatal neurotransmission and aberrant striatal plasticity. Additionally, the loss of DA may change the response of striatal neurons to acetylcholine as the degree of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding is altered in the brain tissue of PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aubert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joyce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pimlott et al., 2004</xref>) and after experimental DA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cremer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joyce, 1991</xref>). Combined with the dendritic remodeling observed in our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lozovaya et al., 2018</xref>), and changes in the connectivity from ChIs to spiny projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salin et al., 2009</xref>) that may drive changes in the regulation of neurotransmitter release from striatonigral synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borgkvist et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that the regulation of striatal output by ChIs is perturbed as a result.</p><p>Chronic L-DOPA treatment of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice increased the tonic firing of ChIs beyond the sham lesioned group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while restoring many firing pattern abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) back to sham levels. This may represent the cellular mechanism underlying the hypercholinergic state that contributes to motor dysfunction in PD patients who have undergone DA replacement therapy. Consistent with this idea, ablation of ChIs reduces LID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Won et al., 2014</xref>) and direct activation of ChIs increases LID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aldrin-Kirk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bordia et al., 2016a</xref>) in rodent PD models, although the effect of ChI modulation is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bordia et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Divito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>). It is important to note that these effects of long-term DA replacement require the parkinsonian state as chronic treatment with L-DOPA of DA-intact mice does not alter the tonic firing rate of ChI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the exaggerated response to DA receptor activation following DA depletion underlies the adaptations that increase in tonic firing of ChI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In aggregate, these studies suggest that there is an interaction between an increased rate and improper pattern/context of ChI firing in PD and after L-DOPA treatment. Reinstating both of these aspects of cholinergic neurotransmission may be critical for restoring the functional behavior.</p><p>In slice preparations, ChIs fire spontaneously and generate a variety of spiking patterns and firing frequencies autonomously. Though excitatory and inhibitory inputs to ChIs are present, these are largely silent as the firing rate and pattern of ChIs are unaffected by blockade of AMPA, NMDA, GABA<sub>A</sub>, D1, D2, or muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett and Wilson, 1999</xref>). Consistent with this, the changes in tonic firing rate caused by DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment persisted in the presence of blockers of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that these changes are intrinsic to ChIs. Furthermore, the increases in dendritic branching and GABAergic inputs onto ChIs after chronic L-DOPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which likely represent compensatory remodeling of striatal circuitry, did not have significant effect on the tonic firing of ChIs in our preparation. Together with altered responsiveness to DA receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), these synaptic adaptations may, however, play important roles in vivo, which will be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment change HCN activity</title><p>HCN channels are essential for the tonic firing of ChIs and serve to depolarize neurons back towards spike threshold during the hyperpolarization that follows an action potential.

In line with this, we found that DA depletion reduced <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> and shifted the gating for channel activation to more negative potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which was accompanied by slower and irregular firing. By contrast, chronic treatment of DA depleted mice with L-DOPA restored <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> to the level of sham-lesioned animals, though the firing rate exceeded that of ChI from sham animals. These findings are consistent with a recent study using a targeted diphtheria toxin model of DA depletion which found a similar decrease of <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> that was mediated by the transcriptional downregulation of specific <italic>Hcn</italic> isofroms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>). Although we did not observe statistically significant changes in <italic>Hcn</italic> mRNA levels, we found that DA depletion significantly decreased Trip8b mRNA levels in ChIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Trip8b is expressed in neurons and regulates surface expression and trafficking of HCN channels. Knockdown of Trip8b in vivo causes the mis-localization of HCN channels and reduces <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> in hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piskorowski et al., 2011</xref>). Our results confirm a previous report of reduction in Trip8b mRNA after DA depletion in the external globus pallidus (GPe) in conjunction with decreased <italic>I<sub>h </sub></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, chronic treatment with L-DOPA reversed the decrease in Trip8b suggesting that striatal DA, including the levels achieved with once daily administration of L-DOPA, may maintain HCN activity by regulating Trip8b expression. This effect lasts longer than pharmacokinetic availability of L-DOPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1990</xref>) since the recordings were performed at least 20 hr after the last L-DOPA dose, reflecting the long-term adaptation to chronic L-DOPA exposure rather than the immediate pharmacologic actions of L-DOPA itself. A possible mechanism linking DA depletion with changes in HCN biophysical properties may involve the regulation of cAMP production by DA receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greengard, 2001</xref>). Binding of cAMP to HCN channels, which can also be regulated by Trip8b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>), shifts their activation kinetics towards more positive potentials and increases channel opening kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>). We found that HCN activation was shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials in ChIs from DA depleted mice and restored by chronic L-DOPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), although whether these changes are mediated by decreased cAMP availability or other DA-dependent mechanisms remains to be tested.</p><p>The somatodendritic localization of HCN channels determines their effect on neuronal activity. In ChIs, HCN channels located at the soma depolarize neurons towards threshold potential and increase the firing rate of tonically-active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2000</xref>). However, high expression of HCN channels in the distal dendrites of cortical or hippocampal pyramidal neurons dampens temporal summation of excitatory synaptic input to enforce dendritic integration, decreasing excitability. Accordingly, deletion of HCN1, HCN2, Trip8b, or pharmacological inhibition with ZD7288 increases dendritic summation in these neurons and increases dendritic and cellular excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harnett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). In layer five cortical pyramidal neurons, this property is acquired during postnatal dendritic maturation where the attenuation of dendritic excitability follows the trafficking and concentration of HCN channels in the distal apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson and Williams, 2009</xref>). The ‘maturity’ of the newly formed ChI dendritic arbors in dopamine-depleted and L-DOPA treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in terms of HCN channel localization and function may dictate whether they enhance or inhibit excitatory synaptic input onto ChIs in vivo. The downregulation of Trip8b mRNA in ChIs following dopamine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) suggests that HCN channels may not be efficiently trafficked to dendritic sites which would increase dendritic excitability despite decreased tonic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DA depletion decreases SK current</title><p>During tonic firing of ChIs, calcium entry following each action potential induces outward potassium currents mediated by apamin-sensitive SK-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg and Wilson, 2005</xref>) and the kinetics of this afterhyperpolarization current determines the firing rate of ChIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2000</xref>). We found decreased SK current in ChIs from DA depleted mice both with or without L-DOPA treatment, consistent with smaller AHP amplitudes. Although the reduction in SK current was the same for both groups, only parkinsonian mice treated chronically with L-DOPA showed higher firing rates, indicating that in the 6-OHDA group the decrease in firing rate from HCN current loss cannot be overcome by the increase in firing rate expected to result from reduction in SK current. The mRNA levels of SK channel isoforms were not different between groups indicating that the changes in channel activity are not directly mediated by their gene expression. In ChI, SK channel activation is coupled to calcium entry through Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 (N-type) channels, which are strongly inhibited by dopamine D2 and muscarinic M2/M4 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan and Surmeier, 1996</xref>). The reduction of SK current we observed could indicate persistent dysregulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 channels or the G-protein signaling pathways to which they are coupled. Interestingly, modulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents by M4 autoreceptors, but not D2 receptors, is diminished following dopamine depletion through the downregulation of G-protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). This was proposed to prevent a decrease in SK current by M4 activation, though no direct measurements of SK current were made. Whether decreased SK channel activity is caused by perturbed auto-receptor signaling remains to be tested, although muscarinic antagonists did not influence spontaneous firing of ChIs in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett and Wilson, 1999</xref>).</p><p>As with HCN channels, the subcellular location and channel subtype dictates the contribution of SK channels to neuronal activity. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons express SK1-3 subunits, with somatically localized SK3 channels being the dominant subtype and SK2 channels localized to distal dendrites. As with the ChI in our study, blockade of SK channels with apamin increases the rate of tonic activity, though the concentration of apamin used was higher (200 nM vs. 1 nM). The ability of apamin to increase firing rate is occluded in neurons from SK3<sup>-/-</sup>, but not SK2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, this high concentration of apamin still caused firing irregularities in SK3<sup>-/-</sup> that were attributed to blocking dendritic SK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deignan et al., 2012</xref>). As SK3 channels are the most abundantly expressed subtype in ChI, they likely play similar role in regulating tonic firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), though the somatodendritic distribution SK channel subtypes in ChI is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Pharmacological blockade of HCN and SK channels in ChIs mimics firing patterns caused by DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment</title><p>Several changes in spontaneous firing of ChIs in our animal models were recapitulated by pharmacological inhibition of HCN and SK channels in striatal slices from control animals, including altered spontaneous activity and rhythmicity. Critically, we were able to titrate the concentrations of antagonists to resemble the degree of channel inhibition caused by DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment. Consistent with previous studies, a saturating concentration of apamin caused ChIs to transition into burst firing mode, characterized by increased firing frequency within bursts, long pauses between bursts and decreased average firing frequency (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yorgason et al., 2017</xref>). However, when SK channels were only partially inhibited using an IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of apamin, the average firing rate of ChIs was increased without an increase in burstiness, closely mimicking changes observed in the ChIs from L-DOPA treated mice. Likewise, partial blockade of both HCN and SK channels caused significant depression of ChI firing rate, consistent with the DA depleted state. These findings confirm that reducing the current from these channels is sufficient to account for the changes in ChI activity and show that the slower rate of depolarization from hyperpolarized potentials caused by HCN inhibition overrides the smaller AHP resulting from reduced SK activity. Importantly, further studies should address whether targeted restoration of these channels’ activities can be employed to ameliorate PD-related motor deficiencies, such as akinesia and LID.</p><p>In summary, we followed up on our previous finding that chronic L-DOPA treatment of DA lesioned mice is associated with increased ChI firing and now demonstrate a novel cellular mechanism that implicates changes in HCN and SK currents that results from DA depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment. Critically, these changes are evident beyond the pharmacological time course of L-DOPA, suggesting that they reflect the physiological state of ChIs upon which DA replacement works in patients treated with L-DOPA. Interestingly, we found that only some of the changes in ChI physiology caused by DA depletion are restored by chronic L-DOPA treatment and some persisted despite treatment. Our data suggest that HCN and SK channels can be targeted for therapeutic intervention, although development of cell type-specific modulators of channel activities is desired for effective and safe behavioral outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> MF)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J mouse</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> MF)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Chat</italic>-Cre;

Animal were head-fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments) with ear cups, and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; H-116; 4.5 ug dissolved in 1.5 microliters of 0.05% ascorbic acid in 0.9% saline) was injected into left medial forebrain bundle (MFB) (coordinates: AP −1.3 mm and ML +1.3 mm from Bregma, and DV −5.4 mm from skull surface) through a small borehole in the skull. The entire volume was infused over 7.5 min through a stainless-steel cannula (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA; RM-SBL STD), which was left in place for an additional 5 min before withdrawal and incision closure. Desipramine (Sigma D3900; 25 mg/kg delivered IP) was given 30 min prior to 6-OHDA infusion to block uptake of the toxin by noradrenergic neurons. Intensive post-operative care included providing supplemental nutrition (Bacon Softies F-3580, Bio-Serv, Flemmington, NJ) and extra fluids (saline subcutaneously and dextrose saline IP). The health status of the animals was monitored daily until stabilization of body weight with free access to food and water.

For slice electrophysiology studies, mice were used at 3–11 weeks after the first injection of saline or L-DOPA. For gene expression analysis, striatal tissue was collected after 3 weeks of daily L-DOPA treatment. Dopaminergic lesion was confirmed in some cohorts of mice by western blot analysis of striatal tissue lysates for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels which showed near &gt;98% depletion of TH in the striatal hemisphere ipsilateral to the 6-OHDA lesion (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Weight-supported treadmill stepping task</title><p>Stepping tests to assess akinesia of the impaired forelimb (contralateral to the 6-OHDA lesion) were performed 3–4 weeks post 6-OHDA injection before the initiation of repeated L-DOPA or saline treatment. Both forelimbs were placed on a treadmill with the surface moving at 4.6 cm/sec away from the head of the mouse while the body weight was supported by examiner. Forepaw steps were video recorded from five nonconsecutive cycles of treadmill. The number of left and right paw steps was counted over a distance of 45 cm per trial for five non-consecutive trials and averaged to obtain the stepping score per mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>LID assessment</title><p>L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were assessed after the first IP injection of L-DOPA (the acute L-DOPA in naïve state) and again after 3 weeks of daily L-DOPA treatment (chronically-treated state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). One cohort of mice was tested again at 10 weeks of L-DOPA treatment, which showed no difference from the 3 week time point indicating that LID scores remained stable throughout the time course of the experiments (not shown). At the start of the session, each mouse was placed into a clear polypropylene cylinder and allowed to acclimate for at least 3 min. L-DOPA was then injected and the mouse was video-recorded for 1 min periods at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min post injection.

Slices were prepared at least 20 hr after the last L-DOPA or vehicle treatment. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and coronal 270 µm-thick striatal slices were prepared on a vibratome (VT1200; Leica, Sloms, Germany) in oxygenated ice cold cutting-artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose (pH 7.4, 290 ± 5 mOsm).

All recorded ChIs were located in the dorsolateral striatum and identified by larger somatic size than neighboring neurons. Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and maintained under perfusion with normal ACSF (1.5–2 mL/min) at 34°C. Patch pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were pulled using P-97 puller (Sutter instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with internal solutions as indicated below. All chemicals for ACSF as well as gramicidin, biocytin, dopamine, picrotoxin, sulpiride, and SCH23390 were purchased from Sigma. TTX, apamin, ZD7288, APV, and CNQX were from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Patch clamp recordings were performed with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Forster City, CA) and digitized at 10 kHz with InstruTECH ITC-18 (HEKA, Holliston, MA). Data were acquired using WINWCP software (developed by John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK) and analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices), Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA).</p><p>The pipette solution contained (in mM): 115 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 KCl, 2 MgATP, 1 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, and 0.3 GTP (pH = 7.3; 280 ± 5 mOsm). After recording cell firing rate in cell-attached mode, rheobase was measured by first applying a hyperpolarizing −10 pA/sec ramp for 5 s, then applying a depolarizing 55 pA/sec current ramp to +500 pA, followed by a −15 pA/sec ramp to 0 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maurice et al., 2004</xref>). Next, the neuronal membrane was ruptured and basal electrophysiological characteristics of ChIs, including IV curve, RMP, input resistance and membrane capacitance were measured in current-clamp mode. For perforated-patch recordings, 60 mg/ml gramicidin was added to the patch pipette solution.</p><p>Glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp mode in cells pre-treated with 25 µM picrotoxin to inhibit GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors; the internal pipette solution contained (in mM) 120 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 2 Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 2 Na-ATP, and 5 QX314 to block of voltage-activated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (pH = 7.3, 280 ± 5 mOsm). GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 25 µM APV, and 10 µM CNQX (or NBQX) to inhibit glutamatergic receptors; internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 1 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 GTP and 5 QX314 (pH = 7.3, 280 ± 5 mOsm). Postsynaptic currents were detected and analyzed using Mini Analysis program (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA).

To measure <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> currents in voltage-clamp mode in the presence of TTX, ChIs were held at −60 mV, then depolarized to −40 mV followed by 1 s hyperpolarizing steps to −140 mV in 10 mV voltage increments. Sensitivity to 25 µM ZD7288 was used to confirm that the voltage sag and <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> were mediated by HCN channels. Average access resistance in V-clamp recordings was 12.3 ± 5.4 MΩ; recordings with access resistance of more than 30 MΩ or those where it changed by more than 25% after the application of ZD7288 were discarded (3 of 14 cell in sham; 2 of 14 cells in 6-OHDA; 5 of 18 cells in chronic LD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Similarly, recordings with input resistance of more than 600 MΩ (mean+2.5SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>) in I-clamp mode were discarded (7 of 46 cell in sham; 2 of 25 cells in 6-OHDA; 1 of 31 cells in chronic LD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To measure Ba<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents, cells were clamped at −60 mV in the presence of TTX followed by a 300ms-long depolarizing step to +10 mV. <italic>Peak</italic> current amplitude was measured in the first 200 ms following the offset of the depolarizing voltage step, while the <italic>late</italic> phase was the average steady-state current at 900–1000 ms after the end of the step.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jun Ding as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joshua A Goldberg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The reviewers are impressed by the thorough analysis of the properties of striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChI) in parkinsonian animals chronically treated with levodopa. The topic is of both translational and basic science interest. In addition, the reviewers think that this will be one of the highest quality studies in ChI in the literature, once published. The physiology is of a very high quality, the writing is exceptionally clear, and the overall conclusions are well-justified.</p><p>The reviewers did raise some concerns.

The main revision should focus on clarity and presentation, and critically on data reporting.</p><p>1) Data reporting: please report both number of cells and number of animals in each figure.</p><p>2) Data reporting: for readability, it would be useful to put numbers for some of the major findings in the Results text, not only in the figures/figure legends, mean =/- SEM.

However, the basis of changes in ChI physiology in PD and LID is still not clear. In the manuscript by Choi and colleagues, the authors performed thorough electrophysiological analysis on the firing of ChI in acute brain slices from control, DA depleted and L-dopa treated mice. They identified that both HCN and SK currents were decreased in the DA depleted condition, in addition, HCN currents were rescued after L-dopa treatment, but SK current remained depressed after chronic L-dopa. These changes of intrinsic properties can explain the decreased firing frequency seen in DA depleted state, and elevated firing frequency in L-dopa treated condition. To confirm the changes in HCN and SK, the authors performed thorough pharmacological manipulations and analysis, as well as the HCN and SK mRNA expression levels. It would be fantastic to directly manipulate ion channel activity selectively in ChIs in vivo and examine the behavioral consequences. However, such manipulation (especially fine adjustment of ion channel activity to certain level in vivo) is technically not possible. Overall, the data quality is high. It would be one of the most thorough analysis of ChI physiology in DA depletion and L-dopa treatment conditions. The overall conclusion is well supported by the experimental data. I do have a couple of concerns/suggestions:</p><p>1) What is the effect of chronic L-dopa treatment on ChI physiology? This would be valuable to access the increased firing is caused by L-dopa treatment or requires prior DA depletion.</p><p>2) What is the relationship between the change of ChI dendritic arborization and HCN, and/or SK current? This is particularly relevant because HCN is highly expressed in dendrites. More discussion would be helpful.</p><p>3) The statistical and data reporting can be further improved.</p><p>4) The data included in Supplementary Figure 3 are particularly confusing. It is not clear what the authors want to tell here. It seems that either D1 or D2 antagonist alone could significantly decrease the firing frequency in DA depleted and LID conditions. However, the statistical analysis here is very confusing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Choi et al. examine the properties of striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChI) in parkinsonian animals chronically treated with levodopa. Prior work showed that ChI are required for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), but it was unclear whether and how ChI properties changed in these conditions. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, the authors find that ChI indeed show changes in their spontaneous firing rates, and furthermore are able to identify some of the underlying cellular mechanisms. The topic is of both translational and basic science interest, and this will be one of the highest quality studies in ChI in the literature, once published. The physiology is of a very high quality, the writing is exceptionally clear, and the overall conclusions are well-justified. However, I have a few concerns:</p><p>1) The authors have three main conditions: healthy control, 6-OHDA (dopamine depleted), and 6-OHDA (dopamine depleted) + levodopa treated. Their key finding is that the firing rate of ChI is reduced in the 6-OHDA condition, but restored to above healthy control levels in the 6-OHDA + levodopa condition. Ideally, they would have included a fourth group, healthy control + levodopa, to assay whether levodopa treatment can cause changes in healthy ChI as well, or whether there is a synergy between the parkinsonian striatal changes and the levodopa. If they are unable to include/add this fourth group, it would be valuable to comment on what the authors think might be going on in this condition.</p><p>2) The critical findings of this paper are related to the intrinsic properties of ChI, and the numbers of cells recorded are quite large for these primary analyses. However, they have also included data related to ChI synapses (sIPSC, sEPSCs), which have much smaller sample sizes, and indeed, one of their experiments (sEPSCs) shows no difference between conditions. Given the typical variability in sEPSC and sIPSC or mEPSC and mIPSC measurements, from slice to slice, mouse to mouse, and cell to cell, I think a larger n is required to definitively say whether ChI synapses are similar or different across conditions. I would favor increasing the n, dropping this section, or rephrasing the text to acknowledge these experiments are underpowered.</p><p>3) At the end of the Results section, the authors include data where they have washed on dopamine. While potentially interesting, the relationship of these experiments to their overall result is not clearly articulated, and again, the n is exceptionally small (3-8) by comparison to the robust numbers for their central findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript of Choi and co-workers addresses the issue of alterations in the firing rate of striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) upon treatment with 6-OHDA, which causes hemiparkinsonism, and then following chronic levodopa induced dyskinesia. While there is clear evidence for decades that dopamine depletion leads to adaptation in cholinergic signaling in the striatum, it has been difficult to determine what actually happens to ChIs which are the main source of tonic striatal acetylcholine (ACh). Several papers have addressed this issue and have reach contradictory results. I myself have tried this for decades while at various labs including my own and have not been able to reach a clear finding. Dr. Kang is one of the first to have reported a clear increase in the firing rate of ChIs after induction of LID in a seminal paper published a decade ago. This finding has been replicated since by several groups, but whether there is a change after 6-OHDA treatment has been hard to tell.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors put this question to rest with incontrovertible evidence that there is indeed a reduction in the firing rate of ChIs. But more importantly, the authors have provided compelling mechanistic evidence that the HCN and SK currents are responsible for these changes in firing rate. They have done this with the use of direct measurements of these currents showing that they are altered with the various treatments. They also showed that pharmacological manipulation of these currents can phenocopy the effect. It would have been nice to have seen a rescue experiment, however, this is not really possible because we don't have reliable drugs to boost HCN or SK currents. They have also measured the transcript of these channels subunits. So, as far as I'm concerned, they have done an excellent job.</p><p>In addition to the high technical quality and commendable rigor of the work, and the resolution of this long standing question, there is great clinical relevance to this finding. It has been known for decades that the anticholinergic therapy can be effective to treat parkinsonism, albeit with unpleasant side effects. Discovering the precise biophysical mechanism of the adaptation in ChI firing rates, provides new potential therapeutic targets. For these reasons, I find this manuscript, highly relevant to the general audience of neuroscientists and biologists.</p><p>I think this study is well done and basically ready.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56920.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers did raise some concerns.

For this, we used a combination of D1 and D2 antagonists to determine relative contributions of D1- and D2-like receptors in mediating the response to dopamine. As these experiments as a whole are relatively underpowered (n=3-8) and we don’t currently have a means to increase the N, we have decided to remove these data from the manuscript. The figures showing the response to dopamine (n=7-10) are now presented on Figure 1F and G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In some data sets, the number of replicates is small, for example, n=3-8. Even though the conclusion is clear, the reviewers think that the minimum n number for such electrophysiology experiments should be n=6-8.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the experiments with low replicates (old Supplementary Figure 3C and D). All of our data reported for electrophysiology experiments are from at least 6 replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please add some discussion of whether L-DOPA treatment alone (in healthy animals) could potentially affect ChI physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous publication, we used <italic>aphakia</italic> mice, which lack dopaminergic projections to the dorsal striatum due to a mutation in <italic>Pitx3</italic>. Only mice harboring homozygous <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutations exhibit LID and show increased ChI firing rate and responsiveness to dopamine with chronic L-DOPA treatment. Heterozygous <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant mice, which are phenotypically and dopamine normal, do not exhibit LID or changes in these parameters of ChI physiology when treated with L-DOPA in the same way (Ding et al., 2007). These findings reinforce that dopamine depletion is needed to bring about chronic L-DOPA-mediated changes to ChI physiology. We have addressed this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please add discussion on the potential relationship between change of ChI dendritic morphology and physiological findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added discussion regarding how localization (or lack thereof) of HCN channels to newly formed dendrites may affect excitability in response to synaptic input as with cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. As we found a decrease in Trip8b mRNA with dopamine depletion, HCN channels may not be appropriately trafficked into dendrites, suggesting that this may cause increased dendritic excitability, despite decreased spontaneous activity. Additionally, we discuss a role for dendritic SK2 vs. somatic SK3 channels in regulating firing pattern vs. rate as seen in dopaminergic neurons. These points are added in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) What is the effect of chronic L-dopa treatment on ChI physiology?

It is not clear what the authors want to tell here. It seems that either D1 or D2 antagonist alone could significantly decrease the firing frequency in DA depleted and LID conditions. However, the statistical analysis here is very confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the experiments using D1 and D2 antagonists due to low number of replicates and have moved the figures showing response to dopamine to Figure 1F and G.

Their key finding is that the firing rate of ChI is reduced in the 6-OHDA condition, but restored to above healthy control levels in the 6-OHDA + levodopa condition. Ideally, they would have included a fourth group, healthy control + levodopa, to assay whether levodopa treatment can cause changes in healthy ChI as well, or whether there is a synergy between the parkinsonian striatal changes and the levodopa. If they are unable to include/add this fourth group, it would be valuable to comment on what the authors think might be going on in this condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Treating dopamine intact mice chronically with L-DOPA did not change ChI physiology in our previous study. Please see Reviewing Editor comment #5 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The critical findings of this paper are related to the intrinsic properties of ChI, and the numbers of cells recorded are quite large for these primary analyses. However, they have also included data related to ChI synapses (sIPSC, sEPSCs), which have much smaller sample sizes, and indeed, one of their experiments (sEPSCs) shows no difference between conditions. Given the typical variability in sEPSC and sIPSC or mEPSC and mIPSC measurements, from slice to slice, mouse to mouse, and cell to cell, I think a larger n is required to definitively say whether ChI synapses are similar or different across conditions. I would favor increasing the n, dropping this section, or rephrasing the text to acknowledge these experiments are underpowered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a larger number of observations would be desirable for these experiments, especially due to the low frequency of sEPSCs in ChI. As such, we added “However, due to the rarity of spontaneous excitatory events, we are likely underpowered for a definite conclusion about the lack of change in sEPSCs,” to the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At the end of the Results section, the authors include data where they have washed on dopamine. While potentially interesting, the relationship of these experiments to their overall result is not clearly articulated, and again, the n is exceptionally small (3-8) by comparison to the robust numbers for their central findings.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were designed to show that dopamine depletion and chronic L-DOPA treatment alters response to dopamine. We agree that the number of replicates for experiments using D1 and D2 antagonist needs to be increased and have decided to remove these from the manuscript. The remaining data has been moved to Figure 1. Please see Reviewing Editor comment #3 and #4 above.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Ding, Y., Restrepo, J., Won, L., Hwang, D.Y., Kim, K.S., and Kang, U.J.
