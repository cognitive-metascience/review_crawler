critical but controversial question. A paradigmatic system for studying this is the mammalian visual cortex. Maps of orientation preference (OP) and ocular dominance (OD) in the primary visual cortex of ferrets, cats and monkeys can be individually changed by altered visual input. However, the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps has appeared immutable. Using a computational model we predicted that biasing the visual input to orthogonal orientation in the two eyes should cause a shift of OP pinwheels towards the border of OD columns. We then confirmed this prediction by rearing cats wearing orthogonally oriented cylindrical lenses over each eye. Thus, the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps can be modified by visual experience, revealing a previously unknown degree of brain plasticity in response to sensory input.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13911.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13911.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13911.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The structure of the brain results from a combination of nature (genes) and nurture (environment). The brain’s ability to adapt to changes in the environment is known as plasticity, and the young brain is especially plastic. An animal’s sensory experiences in early life help to determine how its brain will process sensory input as an adult. One of the best sensory systems in which to study this process is the visual system.</p><p>Within the visual system, some brain cells respond only to input from the left eye and others only to input from the right eye. Cells that respond to input from the same eye are arranged to form columns. Within each column, some cells respond only to lines with a particular orientation. Cells with different preferred orientations are grouped together in patterns that resemble pinwheels. The relative positions of the pinwheels and eye-specific columns within the brain tissue belonging to the visual system have so far been robust to changes in visual experience during development, suggesting that they are determined by an animal’s genes.</p><p>However, Cloherty, Hughes et al. have now tested the unexpected predictions of a computer model. The model suggested that rearing animals so that they saw mostly vertical lines through one eye, and mostly horizontal lines through the other, would cause a form of plasticity that had never been observed before. Specifically, it would change the relative positions of the pinwheels and eye-specific columns within the visual parts of the brain. This prediction turned out to be correct. Young cats that wore special lenses – which slightly distorted what they saw but did not obviously affect their behavior – showed the predicted changes in brain structure.</p><p>The results confirm that this aspect of brain structure is partly determined by nurture, as opposed to being entirely specified by nature. A key future challenge is to identify the chemical signaling that enables sensory input to have these effects on brain structure. It might then be possible to use drugs to restore normal brain activity in cases where abnormal sensory input has altered the brain, for example in the condition known as amblyopia (or “lazy eye”).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13911.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13911.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cat</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>orientation preference map</kwd><kwd>orientation pinwheel</kwd><kwd>ocular dominance map</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Victorian Lions Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lions Vision Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cloherty</surname><given-names>Shaun L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT0525459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodhill</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ibbotson</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE140100007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibbotson</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE0561903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibbotson</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new form of brain plasticity extends the known limits for how much early sensory input can alter the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In cats and monkeys neurons in the primary visual cortices are selective for both the orientation of the visual input (orientation preference, OP) and its eye of origin (ocular dominance, OD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubel and Wiesel, 1977</xref>). These feature preferences are arranged spatially in the form of OP and OD maps, with stereotypical structure within each map, and strong spatial relationships between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blasdel and Salama, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartfeld and Grinvald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Obermayer and Blasdel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hübener et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nauhaus et al., 2012</xref>). While some aspects of the structure of OD and OP maps individually are plastic in response to altered visual input, such as monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shatz and Stryker, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farley et al., 2007</xref>) or stripe rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sengpiel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>), none of these manipulations has succeeded in modifying the overall spatial relationships between OD and OP maps, which have appeared immune from environmental influence. In particular OP map pinwheels, where domains representing all orientations meet at a point, always tend to lie close to the center of OD regions. This is true even after manipulations of the visual input such as rearing animals with artificially induced strabismus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubel and Wiesel, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Löwel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Löwel et al., 1998</xref>) or monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crair et al., 1997</xref>). However, whether this relationship is a fundamental aspect of map structure that is determined by innate mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godecke and Bonhoeffer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crair et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaschube et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katz and Crowley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tomita et al., 2013</xref>), and thus beyond the limits of brain plasticity, is unclear.</p><p>Computational models of map formation based on Hebbian plasticity principles have played an important role in understanding the mechanisms governing visual development. In particular ‘dimension reduction’ models predict negative correlations between the local gradient magnitudes of different maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durbin and Mitchison, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swindale, 1996</xref>), thus explaining why pinwheels, which have a high orientation gradient, normally tend to lie near the centre of OD regions, where the ocularity gradient is small. However, such models also suggest that the spatial relationship between pinwheels and OD regions might be sensitive to visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacomantonio et al., 2010</xref>). Here we used a computational model to predict how rearing animals with visual input biased to vertical orientations in one eye and horizontal orientations in the other eye (cross-rearing) would change these relationships. We then confirmed this prediction by raising cats with weak (-10 dioptre) cylindrical lenses placed in front of their eyes throughout the critical period. This demonstrates a form of plasticity in the relationships between visual feature maps that has not previously been observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Computational prediction</title><p>The elastic net algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durbin and Mitchison, 1990</xref>) uses Hebbian learning to optimize a trade-off between coverage and continuity constraints, and can explain many aspects of visual map formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swindale, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodhill, 2007</xref>). When simulating normal rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erwin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira-Perpinan and Goodhill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carreira-Perpinan et al., 2005</xref>) this reproduces the experimental observations cited above that pinwheels tend to be located near the center of OD columns. However, previous simulations of map development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacomantonio et al., 2010</xref>) suggested that this relationship would be disrupted when horizontal orientations were over-represented in one eye and vertical orientations were over-represented in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirsch and Spinelli, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blakemore, 1976</xref>). Here we simulated this scenario using the elastic net algorithm to quantify further the degree to which the relationship between pinwheels and OD borders would change as a function of the strength of over-representation (see Materials and methods).</p><p>To measure the relationship of pinwheels to OD regions we separately divided the left and right eye regions of simulated OD maps into five equally sized bins, which represented areas of the OD map from the centres of the OD columns to the border regions, similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hübener et al. (1997)</xref>. As the strength of over-representation (α) increased, the histograms became increasingly biased away from the center of OD regions, indicating a shift in the relative location of pinwheels towards the OD borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To determine whether this is due to the movement of pinwheels, OD borders, or both, we then fixed the random seed in the algorithm and explored how the spatial relationships changed within reproducible maps as a function of α. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, from which it is clear that both pinwheel positions and OD borders move in the cross-reared case. The average distance that pinwheels move from their original (α = 1) positions as a function of α is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>. Thus, in the model, cross-rearing alters the spatial relationship between pinwheels and OD borders by causing movement of both.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13911.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The elastic net model predicts changes in spatial map relationships under cross-rearing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Simulated orientation preference map (colours), orientation pinwheels (black dots), and ocular dominance borders (black lines) under normal rearing (relative strength of over-representation of horizontal and vertical contours in the input α = 1).

The lens covering the left eye had its axis aligned vertically, so that the left eye was exposed to high contrast contours with primarily horizontal orientation. Conversely, the lens covering the right eye had its axis aligned horizontally, so that the right eye was exposed to high contrast contours with primarily vertical orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The lens strength was chosen based on preliminary observations that animals wearing -10 dioptre lenses exhibited normal behavioural activity, while animals with higher power lenses (e.g., as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al. [2006]</xref>) were noticeably less active. Animals wore the masks for 6 hr per day while the room was illuminated and were otherwise kept in darkness. During light periods the animals were monitored at least every 30 min to ensure the masks remained in place and to encourage active visual behaviours, such as chasing light patterns and balls. Paw striking behaviour towards objects in front of the animals appeared normal. From age 20 weeks we used intrinsic signal optical imaging followed by extracellular single unit recordings to map OP and OD preferences in cortical areas 17 and 18 of 5 cross-reared animals (10 hemispheres), and 6 normally reared control animals (11 hemispheres).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13911.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optical characteristics of the -10 dioptre cylindrical lenses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Circular square wave test grating (1 cycle/°) viewed normally (no lens).

Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper and Pettigrew, 1979</xref>) we found a torsional disparity in the preferred orientation of the two eyes in both our control (mean ΔOP = 11.7°, p&lt;0.001, two-tailed t-test) and cross-reared (mean ΔOP = 9.8°, p&lt;0.001, two-tailed t-test) animals. We found no significant difference in the distribution of ΔOP for control and cross-reared animals (p=0.44, two-tailed, two-sample t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Units from cross-reared animals showed a higher level of monocularity than those from control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The median monocularity index (<italic>MI</italic>, see Material and methods) of units from control and cross-reared animals was 0.24 and 0.38, respectively. This difference was significant (p=0.002, Kruskal-Wallis test). Cross-rearing therefore appears to induce subtle changes in the combination of input from the two eyes at the level of single neurons.</p><p>In addition to each unit’s ocular dominance and orientation preference, we also quantitatively measured their tuning for spatial and temporal frequency (See Materials and methods). We found no significant differences in the monocular spatial or temporal frequency tuning for dominant vs non-dominant eyes or for left vs right eyes (regardless of dominance) in either control or cross-reared animals (p&gt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis tests). We therefore combined the populations of left- and right-eye dominant units within the two experimental groups (i.e., control and cross-reared) and compared their tuning parameters for the dominant eye. Units from cross-reared animals exhibited marginally higher preferred spatial frequencies compared to those from control animals (median preferred spatial frequency 0.24 and 0.16 cycles/° for cross-reared and control animals respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). While this difference was significant (p&lt;0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test), the tuning curves were very broad and overlapped substantially. We found no difference in either the bandwidth (p=0.19; Kruskal-Wallis test) or skew (p=0.40; Kruskal-Wallis test) of the spatial frequency tuning curves for normal and cross-reared animals. Similarly, we found no significant difference in either the preferred temporal frequency (p=0.2, Kruskal-Wallis test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), the temporal frequency bandwidth (p=0.28, Kruskal-Wallis test) or the skew of the temporal frequency tuning curves (p=0.63, Kruskal-Wallis test) of units from control and cross-reared animals.</p><p>Using the optimal grating parameters (orientation, size, spatial and temporal frequency) for each unit we also measured their response as a function of stimulus contrast. We found no difference in either the maximum spike rate (p=0.56, Kruskal-Wallis test) or the semi-saturation contrast (p=0.81, Kruskal-Wallis test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) of units from control and cross-reared animals. Selectivity for stimulus parameters, responsiveness and sensitivity to stimulus contrast therefore appeared normal in the cross-reared animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Extended spatial decorrelation for intrinsic signal optical imaging</title><p>While previous studies have usually used red light (wavelengths &gt;600 nm) for intrinsic signal imaging, here we used green light (520 nm) due to the much higher signal to noise ratio obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Conventional techniques for map generation from intrinsic signal imaging data are based on the calculation of difference images by either subtraction or division by a reference image that is independent of the stimulus of interest. We found that these techniques left strong blood vessel artifacts in the maps derived from green light data, particularly for ocular dominance maps. However we were able to overcome this problem by using extended spatial decorrelation (ESD), a more sophisticated analysis technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stetter et al., 2000</xref>) (see Materials and methods). This technique robustly separated the noise and mapping signals even in the green light data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref>). Consistent with a brief earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frostig et al., 1990</xref>), by imaging one of our control animals with both green (520 nm) and red (609 nm) wavelengths we found that the maps produced were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–h</xref>). We also compared measures of orientation preference from the OP maps with corresponding measures obtained from single unit recordings from the superficial layers of the cortex at each electrode track location. Where we obtained robust estimates from both the imaging and unit recordings we found a high level of correlation between the two measures (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.64, p=0.003) with a median absolute difference of 15.2°.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13911.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Extended spatial decorrelation recovers OP and OD maps from green light imaging.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time course of the relative change in reflectance (∆R/R) during a trial, averaged over all pixels and all trials, measured with red (609 nm) and green (520 nm) light.

Cross-rearing caused a very slight reduction in orientation selectivity, as derived from the OP maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the selectivity distributions appear very similar, the difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001, two-sample Kruskal-Wallis test). However cross-rearing induced profound changes in map structure. In control animals there was an over-representation of cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations in the OP map. This is consistent with the distribution of orientation preferences of single units described above, and with previous reports for ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coppola et al., 1998</xref>) and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2003</xref>).

The distribution of intersection angles between OD and OP maps was also similar in both rearing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We found consistent changes in cortical response properties from both our electrophysiology and optical imaging. Our findings agree with previous cell population surveys and imaging experiments on cats raised in environments with a single orientation (stripe-rearing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blakemore and Cooper, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sengpiel et al., 1999</xref>) or with orthogonal orientations presented to the left and right eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirsch and Spinelli, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blakemore, 1976</xref>). These studies, like our own, revealed an over-representation of single units tuned to the orientation that matches the rearing conditions. Interestingly, we found no significant difference in ΔOP – the inter-ocular difference in preferred orientation – of units from our control and cross-reared animals. This might seem surprising given the mismatched inputs in the cross-reared animals. However, previous work using much stronger orientation biases found that cells tend to become monocular rather than maintain large ΔOP values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirsch and Spinelli, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blakemore, 1976</xref>). Consistent with these earlier reports, we observed an increase in the monocularity of units from our cross-reared animals compared to the controls (median monocularity index, <italic>MI,</italic> of 0.38 versus 0.24 for the cross-reared and control animals, respectively). However, only about 10% of single units in our cross-reared animals were monocular, suggesting that relatively normal binocular summation developed in these animals. This is consistent with the relatively low power lenses that we used during rearing (-10 dioptres), compared to the higher power lenses used by others (67 dioptres, cats, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al. (2006)</xref>; 167 dioptres, mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kreile et al. (2011)</xref>). Evidently, cortical neurons in our cross-reared animals retained access to a sufficiently broad range of orientations to form fused binocular images during development. Similarly, units from our cross-reared animals generated similar maximum spike rates and had indistinguishable contrast sensitivity to the control animals, again suggesting that the lenses had little impact on basic visual processing.</p><p>A theoretical prediction based on symmetry principles was that pinwheels move during normal development and annihilate in pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolf and Geisel, 1998</xref>), leading to a final pinwheel density relative to map wavelength of π (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaschube et al., 2010</xref>). However chronic imaging experiments have suggested that, with normal visual input, the positions of pinwheels do not move from the positions at which they are first observed during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crair et al., 1998</xref>). In adult cats, chronic imaging of OP maps in response to spatially synchronous cortical activity induced by intracortical electrical microstimulation has shown substantial rearrangement of pinwheel positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Godde et al., 2002</xref>). However, our results reveal for the first time that pinwheels can be repositioned relative to OD columns purely by abnormal sensory input.</p><p>In simulations of normal rearing, pinwheels form near the centre of OD columns to provide good coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>): the gradient of OP is highest where the gradient of OD is lowest. However in the cross-reared case the over-represented orientations are the first to appear in the cortex, aligned with the initial formation of OD columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacomantonio et al., 2010</xref>). The representation of other orientations then forms around this initial configuration, and thus pinwheels are pushed away from the centre of the OD regions, which are dominated by the over-represented orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>). In the model, movement of both pinwheels and OD borders contribute to the change in their spatial relationship; however we cannot directly assess whether this is also true in our experimental data.</p><p>The degree of plasticity of the tuning of V1 neurons depends on their position in the OP map, in particular whether they lie close to a pinwheel or in an iso-orientation domain (i.e. depending on the spatial gradient of OP). However, the direction of this dependence is controversial: while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragoi et al. (2001)</xref> reported greater plasticity of tuning curves at pinwheels in response to an adapting visual input, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuett et al. (2001)</xref> found less plasticity at pinwheels in response to pairing a visual stimulus at a particular orientation with direct cortical electrical stimulation. It would be interesting to perform cortical microstimulation studies in cross-reared animals, to determine whether the plasticity of pinwheels that have been repositioned away from the center of OD regions is the same as unperturbed pinwheels in normally reared animals.</p><p>From a methodological perspective, we found that blood vessel artefacts common in intrinsic signal imaging of cortex with green light can be overcome by using more statistically sophisticated analysis techniques than are typically employed. Changes in cortical reflectance of green wavelengths are believed to indicate changes in blood volume, while those at longer (red) wavelength primarily indicate changes in blood oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sirotin et al., 2009</xref>). Several previous studies have employed shorter wavelengths for intrinsic signal imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spitzer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Versnel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sirotin et al., 2009</xref>) and our results suggest that this does not strongly affect the resulting maps, provided appropriate analysis techniques are used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the strength of the lenses worn by our cross-reared animals (-10 dioptres) was considerably less than that in recent stripe rearing studies in cats (67 dioptres) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>) and mice (167 dioptres) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kreile et al., 2011</xref>). This was motivated by our preliminary observations that weak lenses were required to avoid obvious behavioural changes in the kittens. The relatively low power of the lenses in our experiment suggests sensitivity of visual cortical structure to relatively small variations in sensory input. This raises the intriguing possibility that a component of the large variability in visual map structure between individuals, seen in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaschube et al., 2002</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2007</xref>), could be partly due to individual variations in visual experience (astigmatism, the closest analogy to rearing with cylindrical lenses in humans, has been reported with powers of up to 6 dioptres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitchell et al., 1973</xref>]). More generally, our results redefine the limits of cortical plasticity, and emphasize the importance of appropriate patterns of sensory stimulation during critical periods for normal brain development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental and surgical procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the University of Melbourne and were performed in compliance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cat rearing</title><p>Five animals wore -10 dioptre cylindrical plano-concave lenses mounted in soft neoprene rubber masks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzioba et al., 1986</xref>).

Six control animals (i.e., not cross-reared) were housed under identical conditions, subject to the same 6:18 hr light:dark cycle.

Animals were prepared for acute physiological recordings as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Kleef et al., 2010</xref>). Animals were anaesthetised by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>) and medetomidine (15 μg.kg<sup>-1</sup>). Once deeply anaesthetised, as confirmed by the absence of corneal and toe withdrawal reflexes, animals were placed on a heated surgery table and intubated to ensure adequate respiration. Anaesthesia was then maintained for the remainder of the surgery by inhalation of gaseous isofluorane (0.7–1.0% in O<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>To ensure that adequate levels of oxygenation and anaesthesia were maintained at all times (during surgery and throughout the remainder of the experiment), animals were immediately instrumented to allow continuous monitoring of non-invasive physiological indicators, including heart rate and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub>), blood pressure, the electroencephalogram (EEG) and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The EEG was sampled continuously at 256 Hz and Fourier analysis was performed within a sliding window 30 s in duration. The depth of anaesthesia was considered adequate when the power in the EEG was concentrated in the delta band (&lt;4 Hz) and no change in power distribution was observed in response to noxious stimuli. An increase in power in the EEG at frequencies &gt;8 Hz was interpreted as a sign the depth of anaesthesia may be inadequate. If at any stage the depth of anaesthesia was deemed to be inadequate the concentration of the anaesthetic agent was increased.</p><p>The cephalic vein was cannulated to permit delivery of fluids and intravenous drugs. Animals were then transferred to a stereotaxic frame and the head fixed using ear bars, a bite bar and a screw placed on the skull at the midline 30 mm anterior to inter-aural zero. Body temperature was maintained at 37.7°C by means of an electric blanket under feedback control.</p><p>A craniotomy (10 mm × 15 mm; A4 to P6) was made spanning the midline to expose primary visual cortex (Areas 17 and 18) in both hemispheres. A stainless steel chamber was fixed to the cranium with dental acrylic. The dura mater was removed and the recording chamber filled with silicone oil (Dow Corning 200, 50 cSt) and sealed with a glass cover slip.</p><p>To prevent eye movements during recording, animals were subject to neuro-muscular blockade by continuous intravenous infusion of vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>). During neuro-muscular blockade animals were mechanically ventilated to maintain end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> between 3.5 and 4%. For fluid replacement all animals received a constant intravenous infusion of Hartmann’s solution (25% by volume), 5% glucose in 0.9% NaCl solution (25% by volume) and a 10% amino acid solution (Synthamine-17; 50% by volume) at a rate of 2.5 mL.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>. Animals also received daily injections of atropine (0.05 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>; s.c.) to reduce salivation, dexamethasone phosphate (1.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>; i.m.) to reduce cerebral oedema, and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Clavulox; 0.2 mL.kg<sup>-1</sup>; i.m.) to prevent infection.</p><p>To prevent desiccation of the corneas the eyes were fitted with neutral power rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. Refractive errors were assessed by reverse ophthalmoscopy and corrected as required using spherical lenses placed in front of the eyes to focus the stimulus on the retina. Eye drops (1% atropine sulphate; 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride) were administered daily to cause dilation of the pupils and retraction of the nictitating membranes.</p><p>After surgery and for the remainder of the experiment, anaesthesia was maintained by inhalation of gaseous halothane (0.5–1.0%) in a 60:40 mixture of N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>.

Each stimulus direction, together with a blank condition (no grating), was presented at least 30 times with the order of presentation randomised across trials.</p><p>For single unit recordings, stimuli consisted of patches of sine wave gratings presented within a circular aperture on an isoluminant grey background matched to the mean lumunance of the gratings.

The focal plane was positioned 500 μm below the cortical surface, determined by focusing on the surface vasculature and then lowering the camera by way of a micromanipulator. The camera was configured to bin sensor pixels 2×2 producing images with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels (each pixel being 24 μm square). Image acquisition was restricted to a region of interest comprising a subset of the full imaging frame.</p><p>During imaging, the cortex was epi-illuminated using a custom built LED light source with a peak wavelength of 520 nm (Agilent Technologies; HSMQ-C150). Local increases in cerebral blood flow, indicative of neural activity, caused a reduction in cortical reflectance and a corresponding reduction in the resulting image intensity. Cortical responses were imaged during presentation of an ensemble of visual stimuli (gratings, described above). For each stimulus presentation images were acquired continuously at a rate of 5 Hz for a period of 10 s, the onset of which was synchronized to the phase (maximum inspiration) of the respirator. Visual stimuli were presented for 5 s beginning 2 s after the beginning of image acquisition. Each stimulus presentation was followed by a recovery period (minimum duration 3 s) during which the stimulus monitor displayed an isoluminant gray screen, the luminance of which was matched to the mean luminance of the gratings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Map generation</title><p>All data processing and analyses were conducted using MATLAB. MATLAB code for map pre-processing, generation and analysis is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nickjhughes/feature-map-stats">https://github.com/nickjhughes/feature-map-stats</ext-link>. Each raw image encompassed both hemispheres, and was cropped to two rectangular regions, one covering the exposed region of areas 17 and 18 in each hemisphere. In cats, both areas 17 and 18 receive direct input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and are therefore both primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Payne and Peters, 2001</xref>). The remaining analyses were performed on each hemisphere separately, hereafter a ‘dataset.’ All of the images in each dataset were then spatially aligned. The first image in the dataset was arbitrarily chosen as the reference frame, and every other image was translated to maximise the linear correlation between it and the reference frame. Trials from opposite directions of stimulus motion were pooled, and then all trials for each stimulus condition for each dataset were pixel-wise averaged, resulting in 50 imaging frames for each of 8 stimulus orientations (0°, 22.5°, …, 157.5°), for both eyes. Each of these frames was then high-pass Gaussian filtered (σ = 20 pixels = 480 μm) to remove large scale changes in illumination across the images, and low-pass Gaussian filtered (σ = 2 pixels = 48 μm) to satisfy the requirement of the extended spatial decorrelation method (see below) that the sources be smooth. Image frames were zero-padded prior to filtering. This had no effect on the map regions subsequently analysed since they were sufficiently far from the edges of the frames. The sign of the values in all images were then reversed, as a decrease in reflectance indicates an increase in neural activity.</p><p>To generate feature maps from the data we initially tried vector-averaging methods typically used for red-light data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hübener et al., 1997</xref>). While these produced OP maps similar to those we subsequently produced using the extended spatial decorrelation (ESD) method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stetter et al.

(2000)</xref>, these maps were generated using each of the 50 imaging frames separately, resulting in maps that consisted of 50 frames. The frames of each map were first decorrelated from each other using principal component analysis (i.e., each frame’s variance was made equal to 1 and the covariance, between frames, was made equal to 0). Single-shift ESD was then performed on each map using a shift of Δr = (5,5) pixels, resulting in 50 sources. The particular shift chosen had no appreciable difference on the resulting maps. The time series of the coefficients of each source were used to choose which of the 50 sources corresponded to the feature map in each case. The source chosen was the one with the coefficient time series that most closely matched that of the typical intrinsic signal optical imaging response (i.e., a rise at the time of stimulus onset, up to a maximal value by the time the stimulus was turned off). The correct source was obvious in most cases (for an example see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4b–d</xref>). In some cases, the correct source was chosen by looking at which source had both a response with the same spatial extent as the corresponding OP map and an appropriate coefficient time series. Each frame of the chosen source was then multiplied by its corresponding coefficient, and the feature map was defined as the average over frames 31 to 35 (i.e., the final 5 stimulus frames). Finally, each map was low-pass Gaussian filtered (σ = 12 pixels = 288 μm). These filter parameters were chosen to remove any remaining high-frequency noise (due to remaining blood vessel artifacts) while minimising spatial distortion of the resulting feature maps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Map analyses</title><p>Only areas inside masks were used in the following analyses.

Each pixel was binned into 22.5° wide orientation preference bins centred on 11.25°, 33.75°, …, 168.75°, according to its preferred orientation. These bins were used to generate a histogram, which we refer to as the orientation distribution. Sine curves were fit to the mean of the histograms for a particular condition (binocular orientation maps from control cats, and left and right monocular orientation maps from cross-reared cats) using least-squares estimation. The period was set to 90° for control maps, and 180° for cross-reared maps, matching the clear and expected periodicity of the data. Fits to the cross-reared maps of sine curves with period 90° were also performed for comparison. The estimated value of the phase of the sine curve was then used to determine the location of the maxima.

The angle was defined as the difference between the orientations of the tangents of the two contours at the intersection point. The distributions of these angles were calculated for all orientation maps.

For eight-connected clusters of such pixels, the cluster's centre of mass was defined as the pinwheel location. Pinwheel density was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaschube et al., 2010</xref>): the number of pinwheels per pixel multiplied by the square of the map wavelength.

The positive and negative values in each OD map were separately binned into 5 equally sized regions, corresponding to values ranging from the centres to the borders of the OD columns, and the bin corresponding to each pinwheel was calculated. The bins corresponding to both the positive and negative sections were pooled, leaving 5 bins corresponding to values from the centre to the border of the OD columns. Thus, the centre of the OD column falls into the bin below the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile and the border region into the bin above the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile. This metric differs slightly from that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hübener et al. (1997)</xref> in that it considers the regions on either side of 0 separately, rather than binning all the values into 10 equal bins. This modification respects OD borders and takes into account contralateral bias in the OD map.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Computational modeling</title><p>Elastic net simulations were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carreira-Perpinan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacomantonio et al., 2010</xref>). A MATLAB implementation of the elastic net algorithm is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/research/EN.html">http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/research/EN.html</ext-link>. Parameters for our simulations were as follows. Feature dimensions: 20×20 spatial positions in a square array in a unit square, 2 OD values of -0.05 and 0.05 and 6 OP values of radius 0.08 for each spatial position, giving 4800 feature points in total. Cortical array: 128×128 with non-periodic boundary conditions, α (weighting of coverage term) = 1 for non-overrepresented orientations, α &gt; 1 for the overrepresented orientation in each eye, and β (weighting of continuity term) = 10. Initial value of annealing parameter K = 0.2, multiplied by 0.9925 at each iteration. Simulations (n = 10 per condition) were terminated at K = 0.0358, shortly after the OD and OP maps had formed. The only difference in parameters between simulations of the control and cross-reared conditions were the values of α.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single unit recording</title><p>After intrinsic signal imaging, extracellular signals from single units were acquired using gold or platinum tipped, lacquer coated tungsten microelectrodes (FHC, Bowdoin, ME USA). The extracellular potential was amplified, band-pass filtered (300 Hz – 5 kHz) and then sampled at 40 kHz using a 1401Plus and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Designs, Cambridge, UK). After isolating a single unit (based on the size and shape of the extracellular spike waveform) the approximate size and location of the receptive fields for the right and left eye were mapped using hand-driven bright or dark bars projected onto a tangent screen. The size and location of the receptive fields together with the unit’s tuning for direction, spatial and temporal frequency, and it’s sensitivity to stimulus contrast were then determined quantitatively using circular patches of sine wave gratings under the control of the stimulus computer. The receptive fields of all recorded units were located within 10° of the area centralis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of single unit responses</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Analysis of orientation tuning</title><p>To quantify the orientation preference and selectivity of each unit we measured responses to 100% contrast drifting sine wave gratings of the preferred spatial and temporal frequency, presented at the optimal size and location, drifting in each of 16 directions equally spaced between 0 and 360°.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports that the relationship between pinwheel position and ocular dominance column boundaries changes in cross-orientation reared cats. Notably, the pinwheels are less concentrated in the centers of the ocular dominance stripes than they are in normal control animals. This result is most clearly documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The experimental findings are novel and it is also of interest that it is predicted by dimension-reduction models of visual cortex development, notably in prior work by Giacomantonio et al. (2010). Overall the paper adds an interesting new finding to the literature on cortical map plasticity; it also adds usefully to the literature on stripe-rearing experiments in cats which is not extensive, though it has a long and somewhat controversial history.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows simulation results with pinwheel positions (black dots) and OD borders (black lines). The positions of the black dots do not seem to correspond at all to the pinwheel locations in panels a), c) or e). There are pinwheels without black dots, and vice versa. I would assume this is a mistake made in preparing the figure. However, in panel e) it is visually very obvious that the pinwheel positions are almost always very close to an OD border. This seems at odds with the histogram in panel f) which shows a rather weak tendency for them to be about halfway between the OD centers and the edges. I might be wrong about this, but it does make me worry that something more serious has gone wrong with the analysis.</p><p>2) The authors acknowledge (Discussion, third paragraph) that the experimental results may reflect either pinwheel movement or OD boundary movement (both is clearly also a possibility). However, the results are generally presented as suggesting that it is the pinwheels that move (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). The authors might try to come up with evidence that pinwheel statistics are different in the cross-reared animals, or some other kind of evidence that might point specifically to pinwheel movement. In the absence of it, I think the paper should be careful to be clear about the ambiguity: it is a slightly less interesting result if it is mainly due to OD border movement. It is also relevant because cross-orientation rearing was thought by Hubel and Wiesel and others to cause selective monocular deprivation rather than to modify orientation preference per se. Arguments against that view might usefully be made in the paper. I presume that the model really does show a shift of pinwheel positions – that might be made clear, if so.</p><p>3) The eyes of cats rotate (cyclotorsion) by a few degrees under anesthesia – (e.g. Cooper and Pettigrew, 1979, J. Comp. Neurol., 184, 1-26) resulting in a roughly 15 deg difference between the two eyes. Though this is fairly small in relation to the effects seen here I think it would be worth correcting for. In particular, it ought to be manifest in the data on inter-ocular orientation differences (referred to in the manuscript but values not given). A figure showing the raw data (perhaps in the Supplementary figures) would be useful as well as some actual numbers on, or around, in the third paragraph of the subsection “2Cross-rearing alters tuning properties of single cells”.</p><p>4) Although the signal is stronger with green imaging, and blood vessels can be removed, I presume the vessels still obscure or distort the optical signals from the tissue underneath in a way that does not happen with red light. So there may still be some disadvantage to green imaging. I was also concerned that the difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and 4F</xref> (green vs. red imaging results) was quite large and especially that many fewer pinwheels were visible with green imaging. This must surely have some effect on the analyses, though what might be hard to say.</p><p>5) Related to the previous point, I was also concerned about the large size of the low pass filter employed (at the end of the subsection “Map generation”: 288 microns, or 12 pixels). This will surely remove real structure from the maps, not just noise. Was such severe smoothing really necessary? What do the results look like if you omit this smoothing? I would strongly suggest re-doing the analyses with much less smoothing – even though I know it would probably be a lot of work.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Buried away here is what seems like an unfortunate finding that intersection angles between OD and OP contours in the experimental animals appear to be random (as well as being the same in the control and experimental groups) inasmuch as the distributions follow the sine function predicted for random curves (Morton, 1966). However, in Hubener et al. (1997) the distribution functions for border intersection angles in unrelated maps were essentially flat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in that paper). Who is wrong, Morton or Hubener et al.? Are the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> actually consistent with those of Hubener et al.?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sensory experience modifies feature map relationships in visual cortex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have corrected this in the revised figure. This applied only to that figure, and the pinwheel positions were correct for all the quantitative analysis.</p><p><italic>However, in panel e) it is visually very obvious that the pinwheel positions are almost always very close to an OD border. This seems at odds with the histogram in panel f) which shows a rather weak tendency for them to be about halfway between the OD centers and the edges. I might be wrong about this, but it does make me worry that something more serious has gone wrong with the analysis.</italic></p><p>The results are correct. The metric we used, following Hübener et al. (1997), is defined functionally (in terms of the overall distribution of OD values) rather than geometrically. This overcomes the problem of trying to define a consistent spatial metric for distance between OD borders, which is hard to do when the borders are irregular. With the Hübener metric it is not possible to determine accurately by eye from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> what the histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> will look like, since the histogram relies on the full distribution of OD values, which is not represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (which shows only the borders, i.e. where OD reverses sign).</p><p><italic>2) The authors acknowledge (Discussion, third paragraph) that the experimental results may reflect either pinwheel movement or OD boundary movement (both is clearly also a possibility). However, the results are generally presented as suggesting that it is the pinwheels that move (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). The authors might try to come up with evidence that pinwheel statistics are different in the cross-reared animals, or some other kind of evidence that might point specifically to pinwheel movement. In the absence of it, I think the paper should be careful to be clear about the ambiguity: it is a slightly less interesting result if it is mainly due to OD border movement.</italic></p><p>We apologize that we were unclear on this point. For the experimental data it is difficult to definitively establish the relative contributions of pinwheel vs. OD border movement to the altered histograms. However, it is possible to show in the model that both pinwheels and OD borders move, and in response to the reviewer’s comment we have now added these results to the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). In particular, we fixed the random seed in the algorithm so that the same map was reproducible, and then gradually increased the strength of over-representation induced by cross-rearing (α) across different simulations. This allowed us to track the positions of both pinwheels and OD borders as a function of α. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>: as α is increased both the pinwheel and the nearest OD border move, but the distance between them is reduced. The average movement of pinwheels away from their initial (α = 1) positions in the map as a function of α is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>. We return to these results in the Discussion: `… In the model, movement of both pinwheels and OD borders contribute to the change in their spatial relationship; however we cannot directly assess whether this is also true in our experimental data.’.</p><p><italic>It is also relevant because cross-orientation rearing was thought by Hubel and Wiesel and others to cause selective monocular deprivation rather than to modify orientation preference per se. Arguments against that view might usefully be made in the paper. I presume that the model really does show a shift of pinwheel positions – that might be made clear, if so.</italic></p><p>We address this in the first paragraph of the Discussion. Specifically, we note that in our cross-reared animals, relatively few cells (only ~10%) were strictly monocular, suggesting that binocular summation was relatively normal in these animals.</p><p><italic>3) The eyes of cats rotate (cyclotorsion) by a few degrees under anesthesia – (e.g. Cooper and Pettigrew, 1979, J. Comp. Neurol., 184, 1-26) resulting in a roughly 15 deg difference between the two eyes. Though this is fairly small in relation to the effects seen here I think it would be worth correcting for. In particular, it ought to be manifest in the data on inter-ocular orientation differences (referred to in the manuscript but values not given). A figure showing the raw data (perhaps in the Supplementary figures) would be useful as well as some actual numbers on, or around, in the third paragraph of the subsection “Cross-rearing alters tuning properties of single cells”.</italic></p><p>The rotation (inward at the top) between pupils, after paralysis, reported by Cooper and Pettigrew was +8.7 ± 4.7° (their Table I). This is comparable to the mean inter-ocular difference in preferred orientations (ΔOP) we see in our data. We have modified the text to reflect this: ‘…we found a torsional disparity in the preferred orientation of the two eyes in both our control (mean ΔOP = 11.7°, p &lt; 0.001, two-tailed t-test) and cross-reared (mean ΔOP = 9.8°, p &lt; 0.001, two-tailed t-test) animals. …’. We have also added a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing the distributions of ΔOP for our control and cross-reared animals.</p><p>To correct for this cyclotorsion, we would have to add a small angle to orientations for the left eye, and subtract a small angle from orientations for the right eye. One way to do this would be to assume a normative difference of 8.7°, as per Cooper and Pettigrew, and apportion the rotation equally between the two eyes. In that case the angle we would need to add/subtract is 4.35°. However, the angular resolution with which we measured, plotted and compared orientation preference was 22.5°, so such a correction would have no substantive effect on the distributions or the fitted sine curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>. Given these considerations, we think it most appropriate if we report the data as it was collected rather than risk introducing correctional errors.</p><p><italic>4) Although the signal is stronger with green imaging, and blood vessels can be removed, I presume the vessels still obscure or distort the optical signals from the tissue underneath in a way that does not happen with red light. So there may still be some disadvantage to green imaging.</italic></p><p>We agree that red light may have some advantages. However, we are confident based on our measurements and analysis that these are outweighed by the far stronger signal offered by green light. In fairness though, we have now deleted our previous strong claim that green light constitutes the best method for cortical intrinsic signal imaging.</p><p><italic>I was also concerned that the difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and 4F</xref> (green vs. red imaging results) was quite large and especially that many fewer pinwheels were visible with green imaging. This must surely have some effect on the analyses, though what might be hard to say.</italic></p><p>Although we agree that there are slightly fewer pinwheels in the example map produced from green light, the overall map structure is very similar. Since we only have n = 1 animal for this comparison it is hard to draw strong conclusions about whether systematic differences exist. However, the key point is that all the imaging in the normal vs. cross-rearing experiment was done with green light, hence we are comparing apples with apples.</p><p><italic>5) Related to the previous point, I was also concerned about the large size of the low pass filter employed (at the end of the subsection “Map generation”: 288 microns, or 12 pixels). This will surely remove real structure from the maps, not just noise. Was such severe smoothing really necessary? What do the results look like if you omit this smoothing? I would strongly suggest re-doing the analyses with much less smoothing – even though I know it would probably be a lot of work.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point, and so we present the data in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref> which we calculated for the maps using low-pass filters with sizes of 4 pixels and 8 pixels. Overall the maps look very similar, as can be seen from the examples shown (same map as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the manuscript). Given that the maps looked very similar, we chose 12 pixels because it most clearly removed the remaining blood vessel artefacts.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13911.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13911.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13911.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13911-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Hübener et al. (1997) calculated their distributions of intersection angles by computing gradient fields for the two maps, and then taking the angular difference between the two gradients at pixels located on the OD borders. For <italic>unrelated</italic> maps this results in a flat distribution, as noted by the reviewer. However, we instead calculated the OD and OP contour lines, and then took the difference between their tangent angles at their points of intersection (as used previously by e.g. Bartfeld and Grinvald (1992) and Swindale (Cerebral Cortex, 2000)). In this case the distribution between <italic>unrelated</italic> maps is a sine curve, as shown analytically by Morton (1966). So both Morton and Hübener et al. are correct with regard to the distributions for <italic>unrelated</italic> maps.</p><p>However, our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, for <italic>related</italic> maps do appear to be different from Hübener et al., in that we did not detect a non-random relationship (i.e. deviating from a sine curve), for either the control or the cross-reared maps. The reasons for this are unclear. However, since our calculation is based on contour lines rather than pixels the n values in this case are relatively low, and it is apparent in the figure that the SEMs are quite large. Thus, we do not feel that our data in this regard constitute a strong challenge to the results of Hübener et al. (1997). We have added a statement to the figure caption to make this point: `… For these data we cannot say in either case that the distributions are non-random. …’.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have responded substantively to my comments.
