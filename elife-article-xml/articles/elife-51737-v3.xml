study of receptor-mediated processes, but such tools are lacking for RNA-controlled systems. In particular, light-activated regulatory RNAs are needed for spatiotemporal control of gene expression. To fill this gap, we used in vitro selection to isolate a novel riboswitch that selectively binds the <italic>trans</italic> isoform of a stiff-stilbene (amino-<italic>t</italic>SS)–a rapidly and reversibly photoisomerizing small molecule. Structural probing revealed that the RNA binds amino-<italic>t</italic>SS about 100-times stronger than the <italic>cis</italic> photoisoform (amino-<italic>c</italic>SS). In vitro and in vivo functional analysis showed that the riboswitch, termed Werewolf-1 (Were-1), inhibits translation of a downstream open reading frame when bound to amino-<italic>t</italic>SS. Photoisomerization of the ligand with a sub-millisecond pulse of light induced the protein expression. In contrast, amino-<italic>c</italic>SS supported protein expression, which was inhibited upon photoisomerization to amino-<italic>t</italic>SS. Reversible photoregulation of gene expression using a genetically encoded RNA will likely facilitate high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of complex RNA processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aptamer</kwd><kwd>riboswitch</kwd><kwd>stilbene</kwd><kwd>photoregulation</kwd><kwd>luciferase</kwd><kwd>translation initiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1804220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luptak</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM094929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luptak</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luptak</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-25897Y</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Míšek</surname><given-names>Jiří</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship T32GM108561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rotstan</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship 99999.013571/2013-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passalacqua</surname><given-names>Luiz FM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008476</institution-id><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Miguel Velez Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passalacqua</surname><given-names>Luiz FM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A synthetic riboswitch binding one isoform of a photoreversible ligand provides a photoregulatory tool for bacterial translation initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Optogenetic techniques have transformed the biomedical sciences by controlling biological events with high spatial and temporal resolution through triggering signal transduction pathways <italic>via</italic> light-sensing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Möglich and Moffat, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Motta-Mena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cambridge et al., 2009</xref>); however, there is a need for photoactive molecules that can quickly and reversibly regulate cellular events at the RNA level. Photolabile ligands have previously been used to regulate RNA activity, but their photo-uncaging reactions are irreversible and relatively slow, requiring long UV light exposures, and resulting in limited temporal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhamodharan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wulffen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walsh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Young et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaulk and MacMillan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, aptamers that bind a blue-light photosensitive protein have recently been developed for light-dependent regulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber et al., 2019</xref>). However, this system requires the expression of a relatively large regulatory protein that inhibits translation of a downstream mRNA when exposed to light and turns translation on only when slowly dark-adapted and dissociated from the RNA, preventing fast activation of protein expression. In contrast, photoreversible molecules, such as azobenzenes, have been employed to create several examples of photo-sensitive RNAs. For example, a light-responsive ribozyme has shown reversible activity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) and aptamers that bind photo-isomerizable ligands have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lotz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Young and Deiters, 2008</xref>), but these RNAs have only been characterized in vitro.</p><p>Riboswitches, cellular ligand-dependent regulatory RNAs that modulate transcription and translation in bacteria, and splicing, translation, and RNA stability in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breaker, 2011</xref>) represent an attractive platform for the development of photosensitive regulatory RNAs. Riboswitches typically consist of an aptamer domain, which bind cellular targets, such as cofactors and metabolites, and an expression platform, which regulates gene expression by forming structures that affect downstream events, such as ribosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breaker, 2012</xref>). Many riboswitches sense their ligands during transcription; therefore, ligand-dependent conformational changes occur on the timescales of synthesis of these RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenleaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uhm et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in many instances the aptamer and the expression platform are distinct domains of a riboswitch, allowing molecular evolution or engineering to convert genomic riboswitches into synthetic ones through replacement of the metabolite-sensing domains with in-vitro–selected aptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etzel and Mörl, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We sought to develop a synthetic riboswitch system that regulates gene expression by binding a photoreversible ligand. We chose stiff-stilbene as the molecular scaffold for the ligand design, because stilbenes are well-characterized and exhibit fast photoswitching between the <italic>trans</italic> and <italic>cis</italic> states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Waldeck, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szymański et al., 2013a</xref>). We used in vitro selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tuerk and Gold, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellington and Szostak, 1990</xref>) to isolate a novel RNA that selectively binds only the <italic>trans</italic> isoform of amino stiff-stilbene (amino-<italic>t</italic>SS). Chemical probing identified amino-<italic>t</italic>SS–induced RNA structural changes in both the aptamer domain and a downstream expression platform derived from a bacterial riboswitch. In vitro and in vivo functional analysis showed that the riboswitch, termed Were-1, can induce or inhibit translation of a downstream open reading frame upon exposure to a sub-millisecond pulse of light, through reversible photoisomerization of the ligand. Our results demonstrate how a genetically encoded light-responsive RNA can reversibly regulate gene expression using light, providing a new optogenetic tool to broaden the analysis of complex RNA processes in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">You and Jaffrey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jäschke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Szymański et al., 2013b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To isolate a new aptamer fused to a functional expression platform, we constructed an RNA pool derived from a bacterial SAM-I riboswitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winkler et al., 2003</xref>) by replacing its ligand-binding domain with a 45-nucleotide random sequence, partially randomizing its anti-terminator and terminator hairpins, and retaining its translation initiation sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We synthesized a photoactive ligand – a <italic>trans</italic> stiff-stilbene with an amino-terminated linker designed to maintain good cell permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The ligand was also designed to have a narrow window for photoregulation of both isomerizations in order to keep the rest of the visible spectrum available for the potential readouts through luminescent or fluorescent reporters. Amino-<italic>t</italic>SS was characterized using UV-Vis and NMR spectroscopy to confirm photoisomerization to the <italic>cis</italic> conformation at 342 nm and back to the <italic>trans</italic> conformation at 372 nm, and to ensure that both isoforms are stable on timescales relevant to pulsed gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

After six rounds of in vitro selection, we cloned the pool into bacterial plasmids and tested individual sequences for amino-<italic>t</italic>SS binding by monitoring RNA–dependent changes in the fluorescence of the amino-<italic>t</italic>SS. One sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) showed markedly increased fluorescence of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The G69C variant showed diminished response to amino-<italic>t</italic>SS, whereas the G69C/C84G double-mutant exhibited partially restored activity, suggesting that these two positions are indeed part of a helix. Other variants, C89G and C91G, designed based on parts of the sequence that showed amino-<italic>t</italic>SS–dependent changes in the structure-probing experiments, both showed decreased sensitivity to the ligand, suggesting that they are essential for ligand binding.

We chose luciferase for the readout because, unlike fluorescent proteins, it does not require excitation light and quantitatively yields photons immediately after the enzyme is synthesized. Based on the toehold assays, we hypothesized that in absence of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS, Were-1 would be transcribed in a conformation promoting the translation of the luciferase enzyme, whereas the presence of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS would stabilize a conformation preventing efficient translation initiation, downregulating the luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Using a purified bacterial in vitro transcription/translation system, luciferase production was measured in the presence and absence of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS. In absence of the ligand, the construct exhibited robust luciferase production, demonstrating that the unbound aptamer promotes protein production from a downstream ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In contrast, when amino-<italic>t</italic>SS was added, protein production decreased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

Bioluminescence was higher in the AUG samples compared to the wild-type UUG construct and showed a similar amino-<italic>t</italic>SS–dependent response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Testing the above-described mutants confirmed the G69/C84 interaction, and the importance of the C89 and C91 positions for ligand binding. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Were-1 controls amino-<italic>t</italic>SS–dependent protein expression in vitro and in vivo, acting as a translational riboswitch.</p><p>We next asked whether Were-1 could regulate gene expression in a light-dependent manner, acting as a photoriboswitch. For this to occur, the <italic>trans</italic> isoform of the stiff stilbene must photoisomerize to its <italic>cis</italic> state, preventing binding of the Were-1 aptamer domain and promoting expression of a downstream ORF.</p><p>Riboswitches are sensitive to co-transcriptional events because they are capable of adopting different RNA conformations as they are transcribed by RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frieda and Block, 2012</xref>). To first monitor changes in RNA folding over time, we used the toehold-fluorophore system to determine whether the DNA duplex was in a bound state (no strand displacement) versus an unbound state (strand displacement releasing the quencher DNA, yielding fluorescence) during transcription. Our results show that when the amino-<italic>t</italic>SS-bound Were-1 structure was irradiated at 342 nm of light, the toehold fluorescence increased, suggesting that the RNA increased the binding to the ribosome mimic present on the DNA toehold. Furthermore, when exciting amino-<italic>c</italic>SS at 372 nm of light to switch the ligand to its <italic>trans</italic> isoform, we observed a decrease in toehold fluorescence growth, indicating that the photo-generated amino-<italic>t</italic>SS was able to re-bind the Were-1 RNA. The irradiation was repeated until all toehold was bound, with each switch showing consistent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This experiment shows reversible, wavelength-dependent binding of the ribosome mimic, emulating light-dependent protein expression from a downstream open reading frame. Furthermore, analysis of the toehold binding as a function of exposure length revealed that even millisecond pulses of light at 340 ± 10 nm (Φ<sub>q</sub> = 1.4*10<sup>−2</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup>) result in a detectable change in toehold fluorescence when compared to unexposed transcription reaction, suggesting that the system has the capacity to act on timescales that are faster than a single nucleotide addition during RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which for <italic>E. coli</italic> is in tens of milliseconds range (at 37°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manor et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bremer and Yuan, 1968</xref>).</p><p>To study the system further, we used the Were-1-luciferase construct and the purified bacterial in vitro transcription/translation system and tested whether luciferase expression could be regulated by our putative photoriboswitch. We found that when the reaction was irradiated at 342 nm of light, luminescence increased, suggesting that Were-1’s conformation changed to expose the RBS, enabling luciferase expression. When the <italic>cis</italic> stilbene was photoisomerized to the <italic>trans</italic> state (amino-<italic>t</italic>SS) at 372 nm of light, luciferase protein production slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data are consistent with an in vitro activity of a photoriboswitch.</p><p>Finally, we used <italic>E. coli</italic> containing the Were-1-Fluc construct to determine whether gene expression can be regulated with a pulse of light. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, bioluminescence was greatly diminished in the presence of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS. Upon exposing the bacteria to 342 nm light, we saw a modest increase in bioluminescence, relative to the unexposed control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that upon photoisomerization of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS to the <italic>cis</italic> isoform with a pulse of light, Were-1 changed its conformation to expose its RBS and support luciferase production. Given that photoisomerization of stiff stilbenes from <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> is not quantitative (meaning, only about 40% of the ligand is photoisomerized; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>), the trend in protein expression at individual amino-<italic>t</italic>SS concentrations can be rationalized in the following way: at low ligand concentrations, translation is weakly inhibited and photoisomerization has little impact on the rate of protein synthesis; at intermediate ligand concentrations (near the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration, that is, at the most concentration-sensitive segment of the ligand-response curve) photoisomerization leads to a change in amino-<italic>t</italic>SS concentration that results in the biggest change in translation initiation; and, at high ligand concentrations, photoisomerization results in little derepression of translation initiation because enough amino-<italic>t</italic>SS remains to continue inhibiting protein synthesis. Thus the incomplete photoisomerization of the stiff stilbene results in the bell-shaped ligand dependence upon light exposure. Additionally, in another experiment, we excited cells with a different wavelength of light (500 nm) that should not impact the isomerization of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both controls showed lower bioluminescence compared to the 342 nm–excited samples, suggesting that the increased protein expression was due to derepression of translation initiation upon photoisomerization of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS to amino-<italic>c</italic>SS, although the amplitude of the effect is variable, perhaps due to variability of Were-1–regulated protein expression at different cell densities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Regulation of luciferase expression by the Were-1 photoriboswitch in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Normalized amino-<italic>t</italic>SS–dependent bioluminescence (± SEM) of the Were-1-Fluc construct after 1 ms exposure of 342 ± 5 nm light (Φ<sub>q</sub> = 1.4*10<sup>−2</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup>).

Relative to unexposed controls at the same ligand concentration, the highest luciferase expression was seen at an exposure time of 500 <italic>µ</italic>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The origin of the decrease in protein expression induction at longer exposures is currently unknown. <italic>E. coli</italic> viability begins to decrease above ~0.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (at 325 nm light exposure, increasing to ~1 J/cm<sup>2</sup> at 390 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vermeulen et al., 2008</xref>) and our photon flux was 0.014 and 0.055 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for the 342 nm and 390 wavelengths of light, respectively. This means that at exposures above ~10 s, the photon flux in our experiments would begin to affect the cell viability. Our experiments were performed at UV exposures well below lethal doses at these wavelengths, even at the longest exposure times; therefore, we do not expect DNA or RNA damage to cause the exposure dependence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. We confirmed the cell viability using cells expressing the Were-1-Fluc construct in absence of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS, showing insensitivity to the UV even at multi-second exposures; therefore, the decrease of protein expression at longer exposures likely results from a cellular activity of the amino-<italic>t</italic>SS that is likely unrelated to the Were-1 riboswitch activity. Nonetheless, Were-1–regulated induction of protein expression using submilisecond pulses of light represents a significant advance in the RNA optogenetics field, even if the amplitude of the responses is rather modest.</p><p>When testing the same system using amino-<italic>c</italic>SS, bioluminescence decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amino-<italic>c</italic>SS concentration after exposure to 390 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This result strongly suggests that by isomerizing amino-<italic>c</italic>SS to its <italic>trans</italic> isoform with a pulse of light, Were-1 was able to sequester its RBS to inhibit luciferase production. Here, higher amino-<italic>c</italic>SS concentrations resulted in greater inhibition of translation, in line with the proportional conversion of amino-<italic>c</italic>SS to amino-<italic>t</italic>SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Testing the temporal response of Were-1–regulated Fluc expression in the presence of amino-<italic>c</italic>SS revealed that Were-1 again regulates protein expression optimally at short exposures, showing the highest inhibition at a millisecond of light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Based on the isomerization data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), the long-exposure effect is likely due to the ligand reaching a semi-photostationary state combined with an unknown effect on the ligand observed for the longer exposures of the <italic>trans</italic> isoform. No difference in cell density was observed among the experiments, implying that neither the ligand, nor the light pulses affect the bacterial growth, and again suggesting negligible photo-damage to the cells.</p><p>We next asked whether Were-1 could reversibly regulate gene expression in vivo, providing an optogenetic tool to reversibly regulate cellular events at the RNA level. Using the same <italic>E. coli</italic> construct, we measured bioluminescence over two hours in samples that were covered during excitations, and therefore unexposed to light, samples that were exposed to a sub-millisecond of 342 nm light, and samples that were first exposed to 342 nm and later excited at 390 nm for a millisecond. Initial values prior to excitation showed no significant difference in bioluminescence twenty-five minutes post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Samples that were then exposed to 342 nm light showed an increase in luciferase expression, compared to the unexposed control. Lastly, bioluminescence of the samples that were subsequently exposed to 390 nm light gradually decreased due to low production of new enzymes post exposure (the existing luciferases presumably continued to yield photons), compared to those that were exposed only to 342 nm, which continued protein production unabated. After ~2.5 hr, samples that were exposed to 342 nm light were 5.5 times more luminescent than unexposed samples and 1.8 times more luminescent than the samples exposed to both 342 nm and 390 nm, suggesting that luciferase expression was regulated reversibly. As an additional control, the G69C mutant was exposed alongside Were-1 and showed no significant difference when G69C excited with 342 nm light, or 342 nm and 390 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results strongly suggest that Were-1 is a photoriboswitch that can reversibly regulate protein expression in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regulation of cellular events with light offers many advantages over other approaches, particularly through ultrafast and spatially resolved deployment of the incident photons in live animals, making optogenetic tools invaluable for the mechanistic dissection of many biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>). Most optogenetic tools have been developed based on optical receptors, such as rhodopsins and flavin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Möglich and Moffat, 2010</xref>), which necessitate their adaptation to the pathways interrogated by the optogenetic tools. Methods based on these receptors are thus limited by the availability of the appropriate protein motifs and their photoactive ligands or prosthetic groups, such as flavin and retinal. Regulatory photoreceptor proteins that bind synthetic ligands have not been, to our knowledge, developed. On the other hand, in vitro selection of RNAs offers a facile approach to identify aptamers that bind a wide variety of molecular targets, including photoactive molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lotz et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, riboswitches, cellular ligand-binding RNAs, have been identified in many bacteria, where they typically regulate transcription and translation, and eukaryotes, where they regulate translation, and RNA splicing and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breaker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Riboswitches therefore offer an attractive mechanism for the development of synthetic regulatory elements, with expression platforms linked to aptamers binding synthetic ligands, although only a few examples of fully de novo selected synthetic riboswitches exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hallberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We show that novel riboswitches, regulated by synthetic ligands, can be evolved from random libraries fused to expression platforms using in vitro selection. Werewolf-1 is the first synthetic riboswitch that binds only one photoisoform of its ligand and reversibly regulates bacterial protein expression at the RNA level. This work provides a new optogenetic tool for probing RNA-level biomolecular processes in living cells, and serves as a platform to evolve new RNAs of similar function. We expect that Were-1 and similar photoriboswitches will allow reversible photoregulation of a variety of RNA-centered cellular events with a high spatiotemporal resolution in bacteria and multicellular organisms alike, advancing the field of optogenetics. In particular, the fast action of the Were-1 photoriboswitch offers new opportunities for mechanistic studies of translational <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements, such as riboswitches, in vitro and in vivo. Short pulses of UV light can be deployed using light sources commonly found on fluorescence microscopes coupled to mechanical shutters used in film cameras, which allow exposures down to ~100 <italic>µ</italic>s. Such excitation systems thus allow triggering of photoswitches on timescales shorter than individual steps in RNA and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manor et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bremer and Yuan, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maaløe and Kjeldgaard, 1966</xref>), and many folding transitions in these macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogel and Jensen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young and Bremer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hashimi and Walter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crothers, 2001</xref>). In contrast to photocaged ligands, the photoreversibility of the Were-1 photoriboswitch is expected to yield short pulses of translation, allowing finely tuned expression of proteins with the potential of triggering the production of a small number of regulatory proteins in single cells, as well as in individual cells in consortia of microorganisms (biofilms) or complex organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">CMC0016</td><td valign="top">Electrocompetent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pBV-Luc-c36 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">IPTG inducible Were-1–controlled firefly luciferase gene with T7 RNA polymerase promoter</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pBV-Luc (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Adgene</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_16539">Addgene_16539</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Parent plasmid for Were-1 construct</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Amino-<italic>t</italic>SS</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Were-1 ligand, <italic>trans</italic> isoform</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Amino-<italic>c</italic>SS</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Cis</italic> isoform of the Were-1 ligand</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top"><italic>t</italic>SS</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Were-1 ligand, <italic>trans</italic> isoform lacking a linker</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top"><italic>t</italic>S</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 139939</td><td valign="top"><italic>Trans</italic> stilbene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top"><italic>t</italic>DHS</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">CAS 659-22-3</td><td valign="top">4,4-<italic>trans</italic>-dihydroxystilbene</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and equipment</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Data were normalized to the unexposed samples, and OD<sub>600</sub> values were obtained to confirm that there was no cell death from UV damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>IC<sub>50</sub> measurements</title><p>A dose-response of the Were-1 riboswitch to the target metabolite (amino-<italic>t</italic>SS) was assessed by measuring bioluminescence inhibition as a function of increasing target concentration in BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.

To achieve this, the authors used a SAM-based library to in vitro select for a riboswitch that can selectively bind the trans but not the cis isomer of a stiff-stillbene, a compound that has a unique chemical property in that it can reversibly switch between the two conformations through irradiation at wavelengths 342 nm and 372 nm.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of mRNA translation by a photoriboswitch&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Fundamentally, both reviewers and I agree that the ability to control riboswitch function by light is an important advance, and that even if the dynamic range of the control is only one log, this could be quite valuable in vitro and in vitro. Thus, we would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript. Both reviewers and I agree that the data in Figure 3 are poorly presented, and in any case, we are surprised that the dynamic range in vivo is less than the log expected from in vitro characterization. The preferred course of action would be to improve the in vivo experiments so that the full dynamic range can be demonstrated, and for these data to form part of a revised figure or figures. Less preferred, but in principle something we will consider, is to expand the in vitro applications, to show that even a log of dynamic range can be productively exploited.</p><p>We are listing below comments collated from both reviewers that cover this and additional points.</p><p>1) The writing is too concise and I felt the authors could do a much better job setting up the reader for their results. The Introduction section is extremely short and reads more like a summary. Similarly, the Conclusion/Discussion section needs to be elaborated on. Finally, the Abstract is too fragmented and could be put together in a more cohesive manner.</p><p>2) While the in vitro data on the utility of the photoriboswitch in regulating translation is convincing, the in vivo data is not. Figure 3 shows little to no change in luminescence as a function of compound addition and/or light. The change appears to be insignificant. To that end, the axis in Figure 3A needs to be changed, it goes from 0 to 1 abruptly, but then it goes to 1.2. At the end, if the authors claim that this new riboswitch can be used to regulate gene expression, the effects have to be larger.

The Introduction section is extremely short and reads more like a summary. Similarly, the Conclusion/Discussion section needs to be elaborated on. Finally, the Abstract is too fragmented and could be put together in a more cohesive manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded and rewritten all three sections to improve the flow and overall narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the in vitro data on the utility of the photoriboswitch in regulating translation is convincing, the in vivo data is not. Figure 3 shows little to no change in luminescence as a function of compound addition and/or light. The change appears to be insignificant. To that end, the axis in Figure 3A needs to be changed, it goes from 0 to 1 abruptly, but then it goes to 1.2. At the end, if the authors claim that this new riboswitch can be used to regulate gene expression, the effects have to be larger. These modest effects on gene expression are nowhere near what studies that used caged ligands reported. These showed light can alter protein levels by orders of magnitude.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the axis in Figure 3A and changed the labeling of all graphs to make the figure less confusing. Furthermore, we show the kinetics of the double switching experiment and provide a more detailed explanation of the observed data. We hope that the edited figure now more clearly conveys the photoswitching behavior of Were-1.</p><p>We wish to address some of the finer points of the manuscript. The riboswitch – the cis-regulatory RNA that binds amino-<italic>t</italic>SS – consistently shows robust translation inhibition in vitro and in vivo. These experiments are presented in Figure 2.We think that this result alone is notable, because there are very few examples of de novo laboratory-evolved (synthetic) riboswitches and no aptamer or riboswitch has been reported for a stilbene. in vivo the riboswitch works in multiple media, including 2YT, LB, and M-9 minimal media enriched with 20% glycerol and ~10% LB, though we have observed, on occasion, some variability in the response curve. Because we have not investigated any effect of the media systematically, we chose not to describe these experiments in the manuscript.</p><p>On the other hand, the photoswiching has been modest. We now include an example of kinetics of the toehold binding in vitroafter exposure to short, intense UV light in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B. Under these conditions, the toehold binding change is similar to what we observed in vivo(under the same photon flux Φ<sub>q</sub> = 1.4*10<sup>-2</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup>): at short exposures, photo switching is observed (shown for 0.5 and 4 ms exposures at 10 and 15 µM amino-<italic>t</italic>SS), but at longer exposures, we do not see a significant difference. In vivo we were able to reproduce the data on the pulse length that are shown in Figure 3B (in terms of change in luciferase activity one hour after exposure), but we have not observed a larger induction. Clearly, there is some variability in photoinduction, e.g. when comparing Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3, but at this stage we do not understand the origin of these differences.</p><p>We expect that the photoswitching presented in Figure 3 may be sufficient to produce a pulse of expression for a regulatory protein, but likely not for a large-scale change in protein production. We also expect that further molecular evolution of the system will yield more robust photoswitches.</p><p>To address the bell-shaped curve for the photoactivation of Were-1 as a function of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS concentration (Figure 3A), we now provide a brief discussion of the expected behavior of an incompletely photoisomerized ligand on the riboswitch. Basically, when the photoisomerization is not quantitative (as is typical for this class of molecules), the effective concentration of the ligand changes by a fraction, leading to a shift in the IC<sub>50</sub> curve, but not its abrogation. This means that at low amino-<italic>t</italic>SS concentrations, photoisomerization is not expected to change the state of Were-1, at intermediate concentrations (near IC<sub>50</sub>), the change is expected to be most pronounced, and at high amino-<italic>t</italic>SS concentrations, partial photoisomerization leads to some conversion to amino-<italic>c</italic>SS, but enough of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS may remain to continue inhibiting the riboswitch. This effect is dramatically different for amino-<italic>c</italic>SS, which typically photoisomerizes to the trans isomer with high efficiency; therefore, photoisomerization of amino-<italic>c</italic>SS at increasingly higher concentrations leads to increasingly higher concentrations of amino-<italic>t</italic>SS and therefore higher inhibition of Were-1. This effect is seen in Figure 3C.</p><p>Finally, a comparison with photo caged ligands of riboswitches is somewhat difficult, due to the fact that many of the papers that describe these ligands do not report the photon flux used to illuminate their samples, the known cytotoxicity effect of the photouncaging products are also not investigated, and in most cases the temporal control of gene expression is marginal due to slow kinetics of photouncaging and the use of GFP reporters. For photo reversible compounds, such as stilbene and diazobenzene, the photo conversion is not quantitative. Furthermore, most riboswitches do not change the expression of their downstream genes quantitatively. For example, the SAM riboswitches, from which our expression platform was derived, show variable transcriptional termination in presence of SAM and only partial ribosome binding in vitro (while exhibiting quantitative SAM binding).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presentation corresponding to Figure 3 is unclear.

The pulses are shorter than the individual steps in RNA and protein synthesis, as well as many folding transitions. We expect that such fast temporal control will allow triggering and monitoring co-transcriptional and translation-initiation steps previously not accessible. Finally, we now mention that no specialized equipment is necessary, other than a UV light source commonly found in fluorescence microscopes (or LED sources now commercially available, such as the AmScope 365 nm gooseneck lamps) and a mechanical shutter on an SLR film camera (which can trigger pulses as short as 1/12000 sec, but more commonly, the lower limit of shutter opening on film cameras is 1/8000 sec). Shorter pulses would require either very fast mechanical shutters, requiring more elaborate optical instrumentation, or pulsed lasers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1C and supplementary figure: It is too difficult to distinguish the dark blue and light blue colors in the secondary structure.

As discussed above, we find the ratios of expression for the photo switched experiments somewhat variable (see Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3). As with all protein expression, the effect likely depends on the media, the exact time and cell density of transcription induction, and the time of photoinduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
