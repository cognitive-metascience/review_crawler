However, mitotic exit was recently shown to be a function of chromosome separation during anaphase, assisted by a midzone Aurora B phosphorylation gradient - the ‘ruler’ model. Here we found that Cdk1 remains active during anaphase due to ongoing APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>- and APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-mediated degradation of B-type Cyclins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells. Failure to degrade B-type Cyclins during anaphase prevented mitotic exit in a Cdk1-dependent manner. Cyclin B1-Cdk1 localized at the spindle midzone in an Aurora B-dependent manner, with incompletely separated chromosomes showing the highest Cdk1 activity. Slowing down anaphase chromosome motion delayed Cyclin B1 degradation and mitotic exit in an Aurora B-dependent manner. Thus, a crosstalk between molecular ‘rulers’ and ‘clocks’ licenses mitotic exit only after proper chromosome separation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>anaphase</kwd><kwd>Aurora B</kwd><kwd>Cyclin B1</kwd><kwd>Cdk1</kwd><kwd>mitotic exit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maiato</surname><given-names>Helder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007472</institution-id><institution>Fundação Luso-Americana para o Desenvolvimento</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FLAD LifeScience2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maiato</surname><given-names>Helder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>746515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheeseman</surname><given-names>Liam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BEX-BCM/0432/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morais-de-Sa</surname><given-names>Eurico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative live-cell microscopy and molecular perturbations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells reveal a crosstalk between molecular 'rulers' (Aurora B) and 'clocks' (Cdk1) that coordinates mitotic exit in space and time.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The decision to enter and exit mitosis is critical for genome stability and the control of tissue homeostasis, perturbation of which has been linked to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evan and Vousden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). While the key universal principles that drive eukaryotic cells into mitosis are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domingo-Sananes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindqvist et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rieder, 2011</xref>), the mechanistic framework that determines mitotic exit remains ill-defined. The prevailing ‘clock’ model conceives that mitotic exit results from APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>-mediated Cyclin B1 degradation when cells enter anaphase, under control of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). This allows the dephosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates by PP1/PP2A phosphatases, setting the time for chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reformation (NER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011</xref>), two hallmarks of mitotic exit. This model is supported by the observation that inhibition of PP1/PP2A or expression of non-degradable Cyclin B1 (and B3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) mutants arrested cells in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry and O'Farrell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sigrist et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wheatley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>). However, because Cyclin B1 is normally degraded during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clute and Pines, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang and Raff, 1999</xref>), the data from non-degradable Cyclin B1 expression could be interpreted as a spurious gain of function due to the artificially high levels of Cyclin B1 that preserve Cdk1 activity during anaphase. Whether Cyclin B1-Cdk1 normally plays a role in the control of anaphase duration and mitotic exit remains unknown.</p><p>We have recently uncovered a spatial control mechanism that operates after SAC satisfaction to delay chromosome decondensation and normal NER in response to incompletely separated chromosomes during anaphase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>). The central player in this mechanism is a constitutive midzone-based Aurora B phosphorylation gradient that was proposed to monitor the position of chromosomes along the spindle axis during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maiato et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, according to this model, mitotic exit in metazoans, as defined as the irreversible transition into G1 after chromosome decondensation and NER, cannot simply be explained by a ‘clock’ that starts ticking at the metaphase-anaphase transition, but must also respond to spatial cues as cells progress through anaphase. The main conceptual implication of this ‘ruler’ model is that mitotic exit is determined during anaphase, and not at the metaphase-anaphase transition under SAC control. In this case, a molecular ‘ruler’ that prevents precocious chromosome decondensation and NER would allow that all separated sister chromatids end up in two individualized daughter nuclei during a normal mitosis. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for the correction and reintegration of lagging chromosomes that may arise due to deficient interchromosomal compaction in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fonseca et al., 2019</xref>) or erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are ‘invisible’ to the SAC (e.g. merotelic attachments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gregan et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Aurora B association with the spindle midzone depends on the kinesin-6/Mklp2/Subito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cesario et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruneberg et al., 2004</xref>) and is negatively regulated by Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hümmer and Mayer, 2009</xref>). Thus, the establishment of a midzone-based Aurora B ‘ruler’ in anaphase is determined by the sudden drop of Cdk1 activity (the ‘clock’) at the metaphase-anaphase transition. In the present work, we investigate whether and how molecular ‘rulers’ also regulate the ‘clocks’ during anaphase to coordinate mitotic exit in space and time in metazoans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cyclin B1 continues to be degraded during anaphase and its disappearance is a strong predictor of mitotic exit in metazoans</title><p>To investigate a possible role of Cdk1 during anaphase, we started by monitoring Cyclin B1-GFP by spinning-disc confocal microscopy in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells in culture.

The reporter was modified to make it amenable to FLIM by replacing the donor (mCerulean) with mTurquoise2, which exhibits a mono-exponential lifetime, and acceptor (YPet) with mVenus. The FRET pairs flank the auto-phosphorylation site of human Cyclin B1 and the Polo Box Domain (PBD) of Polo-like kinase one such that it undergoes a conformational change when it is phosphorylated by Cdk1 that yields increased FRET in mitosis and decreased FRET in interphase.

As so, we investigated whether Aurora B activity is required for Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase and consequently mitotic exit in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells. First, we monitored Cyclin B1-GFP/Venus levels after acute inhibition of Aurora B activity at anaphase onset by treating S2 and hTERT-RPE1 cells with Binucleine-2 or ZM447439, respectively. We found that inhibition of Aurora B activity did not accelerate Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

In addition, these data indicate that PP1/PP2A phosphatase activity is not required to regulate Cyclin B1 degradation, namely its centrosomal-associated pool, during anaphase.</p><p>In light of the results obtained with our chromosome-targeted Cdk1 FRET sensor, we decided to investigate whether Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase is a function of chromosome separation. To do so, we slowed down chromosome separation by allowing S2 cells to enter anaphase after a short exposure (less than 15 min) to 10 nM taxol or after depletion of the kinesin-13 KLP10A by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>).

To test whether the observed delay in Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase was dependent on Aurora B activity, we acutely inhibited Aurora B with Binucleine-2 specifically at anaphase onset in taxol-treated cells.

Most importantly, we show that Cdk1 activity during anaphase is a function of chromosome separation and is spatially regulated by Aurora B localization and activity at the spindle midzone. In concert with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>), our findings unveil an unexpected crosstalk between molecular ‘rulers’ (Aurora B) and ‘clocks’ (B-type Cyclins-Cdk1) that ensures that cells only exit mitosis after proper chromosome separation during anaphase, consistent with the previously proposed chromosome separation checkpoint hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maiato et al., 2015</xref>). An Aurora B-dependent spatial control mechanism regulating normal NER in human cells has been recently confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, nuclear envelope defects associated with incomplete chromosome separation during anaphase (namely, anaphase lagging chromosomes due to mitotic errors) were proposed as an inevitable pathological condition. The present work provides yet additional evidence for a molecular network operating during anaphase that promotes chromosome segregation fidelity by controlling mitotic exit in space and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). According to this model, APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> mediates the initial degradation of Cyclin B1 during metaphase under SAC control. The consequent decrease in Cdk1 activity as cells enter anaphase targets Aurora B to the spindle midzone (via Subito/Mklp2/kinesin-6); Aurora B at the spindle midzone (counteracted by PP1/PP2A phosphatases on chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>]) establishes a phosphorylation gradient that locally delays APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>- and APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-mediated degradation of residual Cyclin B1 (and possibly B3) at the spindle midzone, at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Localization experiments in human cells suggest that Cdk1 itself might be enriched at the spindle midzone. Consequently, as chromosomes separate and move away from the spindle midzone, Cdk1 activity decreases, allowing the PP1/PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and Aurora B substrates (e.g. Lamin B and Condensin I) necessary for mitotic exit. This model is consistent with the recent demonstration that Cdk1 inactivation promotes the recruitment of PP1 phosphatase to chromosomes to locally oppose Aurora B phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qian et al., 2015</xref>) and recent findings in budding yeast demonstrating equivalent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events during mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Touati et al., 2018</xref>). It is also consistent with a premature Greatwall inactivation and PP2A:B55 reactivation that would be predicted after acute Cdk1 inactivation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cundell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cundell et al., 2016</xref>). Most important, this model provides an explanation for the coordinated action of two unrelated protein kinases that likely regulate multiple substrates required for mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petrone et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47646.044</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A crosstalk between molecular ‘rulers’ (Aurora B) and ‘clocks’ (Cdk1) licenses mitotic exit only after proper chromosome separation.</title><p>APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> mediates the initial degradation of Cyclin B1 as chromosome align at the spindle equator and cells enter anaphase under SAC control.

However, we noticed that, consistent with our findings, a small pool of Cyclin B1 continued to be degraded during anaphase in Ptk1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clute and Pines, 1999</xref>). Subsequent work investigating cellular response to anti-mitotic drugs has also shown that human DLD-1 cells undergoing normal mitosis entered anaphase with as much as 32% of Cyclin B1 compared to metaphase levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008</xref>), suggesting that human cells enter anaphase with significant Cdk1 activity. Indeed, quantitative analysis with a FRET biosensor in human HeLa cells also revealed residual Cdk1 activity during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gavet and Pines, 2010</xref>). However, the significance of persistent Cdk1 activity for the control of anaphase duration and mitotic exit was not investigated in these original studies. Previous works also clearly demonstrated that forcing Cdk1 activity during anaphase through expression of non-degradable Cyclin B1 (and Cyclin B3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) prevents chromosome decondensation and NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry and O'Farrell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wheatley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>). However, while these works suggested the existence of different Cyclin B1 thresholds that regulate distinct mitotic transitions, expression of non-degradable Cyclin B1 could be interpreted as an artificial gain of function that preserves Cdk1 activity during anaphase. For example, it was shown that expression of non-degradable Cyclin B1 during anaphase ‘reactivates’ the SAC, inhibiting APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clijsters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rattani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vázquez-Novelle et al., 2014</xref>). Our work demonstrates in five different experimental systems, from flies to humans, including primary tissues, that Cdk1 activity persists during anaphase and is rate-limiting for the control of mitotic exit. Failure to degrade B-type Cyclins during anaphase blocked cells in an anaphase-like state with separated sister chromatids that remained condensed for several hours, whereas complete Cdk1 inactivation in anaphase triggered chromosome decondensation and NER. Importantly, if a positive feedback loop imposed by phosphatases was sufficient to drive mitotic exit simply by reverting the effect of Cdk1 phosphorylation prior to anaphase, cells would exit mitosis regardless of the remaining pool of B-type Cyclins that sustains Cdk1 activity during anaphase. The main conceptual implication of these findings is that, contrary to what was previously assumed, mitotic exit is determined during anaphase and not at the metaphase-anaphase transition under SAC control.</p><p>Our model also implies that persistent Cyclin B1-Cdk1 in anaphase is spatially regulated by a midzone Aurora B gradient. Indeed, we were able to identify a residual pool of Cyclin B1-Cdk1 enriched at the spindle midzone and midbody and showed that this localization was dependent on Aurora B activity and localization at the spindle midzone. Interestingly, human Cyclin B2 (which contains a recognizable KEN box), as well as Cdk1, were identified at the midbody and Cdk1 inactivation during late mitosis was required for the timely completion of cytokinesis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Capalbo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathieu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that in human cells, Cdk1 activity during anaphase is regulated not only by Cyclin B1, but also by Cyclin B2. Importantly, this model predicted the existence of a midzone-centered Cdk1 activity gradient during anaphase, which we confirmed experimentally by targeting a FRET reporter of Cdk1 activity to chromosomes.</p><p>Finally, our experiments indicate that Aurora B activity regulates Cyclin B1 homeostasis and consequently anaphase duration in the presence of incompletely separated chromosomes. One possibility is that direct Cyclin B1 phosphorylation by Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathieu et al., 2013</xref>) spatially regulates Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase, mediated by both APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> and APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>. Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that Aurora B indirectly controls Cyclin B1 during anaphase by regulating APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> and/or APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> activity, as recently shown for Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujimitsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Future work will be necessary to test these hypotheses.</p><p>In conclusion, we uncovered an unexpected level of regulation at the end of mitosis in metazoans and reconciled what were thought to be antagonistic models of mitotic exit relying either on molecular ‘clocks’ or on ‘rulers’. These findings have profound implications to our fundamental understanding of how tissue homeostasis is regulated, perturbation of which is a hallmark of human cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The following primers were used for mutagenesis: Fw: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ggacattgatgccaatgacgcggcgaacctggtactggtctcc</named-content>-3’ and Rv 5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">ggagaccagtaccaggttcgccgcgtcattggcatcaatgtcc</named-content>-3’. To make the chromatin targeted FLIM-FRET sensor, DNA encoding the polo box domain (PBD) of polo like kinase 1 (Plk1), a 15 amino acid linker domain, and 16 amino acid recognition sequence containing the CyclinB1-Cdk1 auto-phosphorylation sites from human CyclinB1 was amplified by PCR from a previously generated CyclinB1-Cdk1 FRET sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gavet and Pines, 2010</xref>), Addgene plasmid #2327) with a 5’ SpeI site and 3’ NotI site. The resulting PCR product was inserted by Gibson cloning between mTurquoise2 (FRET donor) and mVenus (FRET acceptor) in a pMT/V5 His-B vector backbone (Invitrogen) containing the CENP-C promotor inserted between the first XbaI site and the KpnI site and the human histone H2B gene inserted at the KpnI site downstream of the CENP-C promoter. The mTurquoise2 gene was positioned after the human histone H2B gene between KpnI and SpeI, while the mVenus gene with a stop codon was inserted between the NotI and SacII sites. To generate the non-phosphorylatable chromatin-targeted FRET sensor, the same construct was generated but using Addgene plasmid #2328 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gavet and Pines, 2010</xref>) in which the codons for the phospho-serine residues were replaced with codons for alanines. The resulting constructs are well-suited for FLIM analysis due to the fact that mTurquoise2 exhibits a mono-exponential decay in its lifetime.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell lines, transfections, and RNAi</title><p>The H2B-GFP/mCherry-α-tubulin and Lamin B-GFP/mCherry-α-tubulin stable cell lines have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>). The WT-Cyclin B1-GFP/mCherry-α-tubulin, KEN-Cyclin B1-GFP/mCherry-α-tubulin and GFP-Aurora B/WT-Cyclin B1-mCherry stable cell lines were established using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For visualization of WT-Cyclin B1-GFP, WT-Cyclin B1–mCherry and GFP-Aurora B signals 250 μM of CuSO<sub>4</sub> was added to the medium overnight (8–12 hr) to induce expression from a metallothionein promoter. With this copper concentration, we obtained a mild expression of the constructs without any detectable impact on mitotic progression. Aurora B overexpression was achieved by adding 1 mM of CuSO<sub>4</sub> instead of 250 μM for the same incubation period. The chromatin-targeted CyclinB1-Cdk1 FRET reporter was co-transfected with TagRFP-T-α-tubulin and selected with Blasticidin and then Hygromycin (Life Technologies). Some FLIM data were acquired from transiently transfected cells prior to selection and from stable cell lines that had been incubated overnight with 500 μM CuSO4, which still induced moderate expression even with the CENP-C promoter in place. The HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 Cyclin B1-Venus cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collin et al., 2013</xref>) were a kind gift from Jonathon Pines (Institute of Cancer Research, UK). The H2B-mRFP expression construct for human cells was obtained from Addgene (#26001), transfected to 293 T cells to produce viruses and infect HeLa Cyclin B1-Venus expressing cells to generate a stable cell line. The human Cdk1-GFP construct was obtained from Origene (#RG200495) and transiently transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The H2B-GFP/mCherry-α-tubulin U2OS cell line, the KLP10A and the Subito/Mklp2 RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>). Fzr RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells was achieved after two rounds of RNAi treatment for a total of 7 days. The following primers were used for dsRNA synthesis: 5’-taatacgactcactatagggcaccggataatcaatacttggc-3’ and 5’-taatacgactcactatagggattcagaacggacttgttctcc-3’. Mklp2 depletion in hTERT-RPE1 cells was achieved 72 hr after transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide sequence used was: 5’- AACGAACUGCUUUAUGACCUA-3’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Time-lapse microscopy</title><p>Live imaging data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> were obtained from a spinning disc confocal system (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT) equipped with an electron multiplying CCD iXonEM+ camera and a Yokogawa CSU-22 U (Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo) unit based on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (Melville, NY). Two laser lines (488 and 561 nm) were used for near simultaneous excitation of GFP and mCherry/mRFP and the system was driven by Andor IQ software. Time-lapse image stacks of 0.8 μm steps were collected every 30 s, with a Plan- APO 100x/1.4 NA oil objective, with the exception of the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> where image stacks were obtained every 60 s.

Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) was conducted using two HPM-100–40 detectors (Becker and Hickl) and a 50 mHz pulsed 445 nm laser (BDL-445-SMN). Cells were identified by eye under wide-field fluorescence on the RFP channel. To collect FLIM data, the 445 nm pulsed diode laser (Becker and Hickl) was set to 50% laser power, and 40–50 million photons were detected per scan.

Decay matrices were generated to display color images of either fluorescence lifetimes or FRET efficiencies. For quantifying lagging and segregated chromatin, the donor lifetime and FRET efficiencies were quantified by drawing an ROI around chromatin in the vicinity of the midzone for lagging chromatin and compared to the average of the lifetime and FRET efficiencies of the two masses of segregated chromosomes. To assess the contribution of Cdk1, cells were imaged between 5-40 min following the addition of 10 μM RO-3306 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and egg chamber preparation</title><p>Flies homozygous for the eGFP protein trap insertion into <italic>CycB1</italic> loci (CC01846 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>]) and expressing His2Av-mRFP (genotype: <italic>w</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBti0099784.html"><italic>P{PTT-GC}CycB<sup>CC01846</sup></italic>; <italic>P{His2Av-mRFP}</italic></ext-link>/+) were generated to image Cyclin B1 expression at endogenous levels while monitoring mitotic progression. <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chambers were dissected and mounted in the gas-permeable oil 10S VOLTALEF (VWR chemicals) for live imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vitro culture and micro-injection of mouse oocytes</title><p>All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment according to the Portuguese animal welfare authority (Direcção Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária) regulations and the guidelines of the Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde animal facility.

When a nuclear envelope marker was present (ex: Lamin B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) mitotic exit was defined as the first frame of appearance of Lamin B in the nascent nucleus. In experiments where cells expressed mCherry-α-tubulin, NER was determined based on the first frame where soluble mCherry-α-tubulin was excluded from the main nucleus.

This resulted in more robust measurements, which were less prone to fluorescence fluctuations in the cytoplasm. This was essential to detect differences in the Cyclin B1 decay in the different conditions tested. Exceptionally, and to compare Cyclin B1 levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> total Cyclin B1-GFP fluorescence intensity was measured using an ROI defined by the limits of the cell.

Note that with the same ROI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref> both Cyclin B1 and Aurora B intensities were measured.

The background levels were subtracted from the absolute intensity values. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium Cyclin B1 levels were measured in sum-intensity Z projections, using a circular ROI that was manually tracked in an homogeneous cytoplasmic region (free of accumulated Cyclin B1 at microtubules or centrosomes) of dividing cells.

Your article has been reviewed by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Afonso et al., present evidence for a mitotic exit network in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells regulated by crosstalk between Aurora B and Cyclin B-Cdk1 in anaphase. They show that low levels of cyclin B persist in early anaphase and that cyclin B continues to be degraded during anaphase, most likely by APC/C-Cdh1. The timing of chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reformation correlate with the disappearance of cyclin B1 from centrosomes and preventing cyclin B degradation in anaphase using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 arrests cells in early anaphase and delays NER and chromosome decondensation. This arrest depends on Cdk1 activity. They further show that a small amount of cyclin B1-GFP is present on the spindle midzone in anaphase in S2 cells, colocalizing with Aurora B and depending on Subito/Mklp2. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cyclin B1 is a substrate of Aurora B (Mathieu et al., 2013), and Afonso et al. show that the degradation of a phosphomimetic (5E) mutant of cyclin B1 is delayed, and increases anaphase duration. A non-phosphorylatable (5A) cyclin B mutant is degraded faster in anaphase. The authors propose that the initial degradation of cyclin B1 in metaphase drives Aurora B to the spindle midzone via Subito/Mklp2. Subsequently, Aurora B at the spindle midzone establishes a phosphorylation gradient that spatially restricts cyclin B1 localization and delays its degradation via APC/C cdh1.</p><p>This is an interesting model but the reviewers had several major concerns over the generality of the model – notably whether it was <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific – and that some of the key experiments did not directly test the model that cyclin B1 degradation is responsive to physiological perturbation of mitotic exit conditions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should show that AurB inhibition delays Cyclin B degradation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and in endogenously tagged human cells.</p><p>2) The authors should show that endogenous Cyclin B localises to the midzone; moreover, there is no evidence provided that spindle midzone localization of cyclin B requires Aurora B (protein or activity). Subito depletion also affects localization of Polo at the midzone (Cesario et al., 2006), so cyclin B localization might as well depend on this kinase, or simply depend on Subito and not on Aurora B.</p><p>3) Since none of the Aurora B sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cyclin B1 are conserved in human cyclin B1 (Mathieu et al., 2013) the authors should analyse the effects of human AurB phospho-mutants.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) The way the Aurora B and Subito experiments are presented and interpreted are confusing. The model proposed in Figure 10 predicts that a lack of Aurora B at the spindle midzone would accelerate cyclin B degradation due to the absence of a phosphorylation gradient that spatially restricts cyclin B1 on the spindle midzone. However, in Figure 8, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, cyclin B1 degradation is delayed when Aurora B is not on the midzone, and anaphase duration prolonged. This could be due to the fact that after Subito knock-down, Aurora B is retained much longer on the chromatin (Figure 1–figure supplement 3f), similar to what happens after Aurora B overexpression (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Having Aurora B (and cyclin B/cdk1) at the midzone allows the formation of a phosphorylation gradient (due to counteracting activities of PP2A/PP1). Movement of chromosomes away from the heart of the gradient would allow exit. When Aurora B (and cyclin B? – this is unclear) is retained on the chromatin, this spatial separation is obviously not possible. Moreover, it might also explain why degradation of cyclin B at centrosomes is delayed under these conditions as more Aurora B is in closer proximity of these structures. Related to this: does cyclin B colocalize with Aurora B on the chromatin after Subito depletion? Where do the cyclin B 5E and 5A mutants localize (apart from the centrosomes)? Potential localization on chromatin is masked by the H2B-GFP.</p><p>2) It looks as if depletion of Mklp2 affects cyclin B localization on the mitotic spindle before anaphase. Is this consistent? If so, doesn't this impact the cyclin B-GFP intensity measurements?</p><p>3) The lack of effect of acute PP1/PP2A inhibition on cyclin B1 degradation (Figure 9G) is difficult to reconcile with a model in which a phosphorylation gradient concentrates cyclin B/cdk1 activity at the spindle midzone (Figure 10), and with the observation that a cyclin B 5E mutant is more stable and delaying mitotic exit (Figure 9C,D). The latter would suggest that cyclin B needs to be dephosphorylated for timely degradation.</p><p>4) All referees had concerns with Figure 4:</p><p>What is happening to the spindle and chromosomes after MG132 addition and subsequent Cdk1 inhibition in U2OS cells. It looks as if cytokinesis (abscission unclear) is taking place and that in these daughter cells the half spindle (00:10) is forming a new 'metaphase' spindle over time on which the separated sisters try to align (01:00 and 01:30). After Cdk1 inhibition, both spindles undergo an aberrant anaphase/exit. Can this phenotype be regarded as a delay in anaphase, or should it be considered as a reversion into prometaphase? In S2 cells, the anaphase delay is much more clear, because cytokinesis does not appear to take place and the two half spindles rejoin after Cdk1 inhibition.</p><p>If cells only enter anaphase when Cdk1 activity has fallen below the required threshold to maintain metaphase, then how can cells arrested in anaphase by MG132 return to a metaphase-like state? Presumably this state results from blocking degradation events (cyclin B or other targets) normally contributing to disassembly of the spindle poles during anaphase. (And it implies that the central spindle – in contrast – disassembles under these conditions). Without further justification of the 'metaphase' label (e.g. restoration of Cdk activity), it should be avoided.</p><p>Proteasomal inhibition in anaphase blocks mitotic exit. The authors interpret these results in an &quot;anaphase arrest&quot; This is true as far as cohesion cleavage is concerned. However, the spindle appears to reform and from a cytoskeletal and cell cycle control perspective it looks more as if the cells were simply being pushed back into a mitotic state. This experiment shows that if Cdk1 activity is maintained above a threshold mitotic exit is blocked, most likely because phosphatases fail to reactivate. The particular experimental set up (i.e. adding a proteasome inhibitor following anaphase onset) is novel; however, the results are not particularly surprising, given for example the results shown by Potapova et al. that even reactivation of Cdk1 in late telophase reactivates the mitotic state. The movies and images do not really support the notion of accelerated mitotic exit by AurB inhibition. Likewise, in the legend for Figure 4C the authors state: Note that for MG132 and MG132+Aurora B inhibition anaphase duration corresponds to the total duration of the movie as most cells do not exit mitosis until the end of the acquisition. I am not sure how in this case accelerated mitotic exit following AurB inhibition can be supported by the data? Also, it is not clear what the grey, green, purple colour code means.</p><p>5) The videos are not referred to in the text.</p><p>6) Degradation analyses of cyclin B1 usually show that cells enter anaphase with some protein remaining (in contrast to some figures in the original Clute &amp; Pines 1999 study, which is cited to justify the statement at bottom of p8 that cyclin B1 is 'undetectable' at anaphase entry). The thresholding of anaphase entry underpins the phenomenon of mitotic slippage and has been explored at length in more recent literature that is not cited in this study. For example, a study from Stephen Taylor's lab (Gascoigne, 2009) measured a Cyclin B1-GFP threshold for anaphase corresponding to 32% of metaphase levels.</p><p>7) The phrase 'mitotic exit' needs to be used more carefully. It is conventionally used to describe the collective events that occur after anaphase onset and the authors sometimes use the phrase in this sense but in some places they use it to describe the point at which cells have completed these events (e.g. subsection “Cyclin B1 continues to be degraded during anaphase and its disappearance is a strong predictor of mitotic exit in metazoans” 'complete Cyclin B1 disappearance from centrosomes during anaphase strongly correlated with mitotic exit').</p><p>8) No mention is made of the likely presence of cyclin B3 in anaphase cells. B3 is degraded later than B1, and could contribute to Cdk1-dependent delay in mitotic exit.</p><p>9) Figure 5 shows a very small effect of FZR depletion on cyclin B1 degradation at anaphase (especially in (f)) suggesting that Cdh1 may only play a minor role. The authors argue that prolonged Cdc20 activity can compensate for lack of Cdh1 under these conditions, by targeting cyclin B1 through its D-box (whereas Cdh1 targets it through KEN). These arguments do not properly reflect the latest thinking on patterns of APC/C-degron recognition. Cryo-EM structures published over the recent years have established a paradigm of multivalent APC/C-substrate interaction through two or more degrons and Cdc20 and Cdh1 have almost identical KEN and D-box receptor sites. It would be safer to conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cyclin B1 degradation in anaphase is mediated through both KEN and D-box, and can be carried out by either Cdc20 or Cdh1. This could be tested by the combination of KEN-mt/APCin.</p><p>The authors should note that APCin cannot be expected to inhibit a KEN-box dependent event, since it is a D-box competitor, so the discussions at top of p6 and middle p10 are incorrect – the additive effect of APCin and proTAME on anaphase arrest does not support a role for Cdh1 in anaphase cyclin B1 degradation. It supports that additive interactions of Cdc20/Cdh1 and substrate degrons are required for efficient ubiquitination of substrates.</p><p>10) Effects on cyclin B1-GFP degradation look very small in regular degradation plots, and are more convincingly presented as half-life measurements (e.g. Figure 8E, Figure 1—figure supplement 3D). The degradation curve for OA treatment (Figure 9E) also appears to show a very small difference in rate between treated and untreated cells; these data should likewise be presented as half life measurements to provide same level of proof as in other figures.</p><p>11) As far as I am aware, 'anaphase arrest' (Figure 5J) has never been described as a consequence of FZR depletion in mammalian cells. Could additional markers be used to show that this is really an anaphase arrest (as opposed to death in anaphase)?</p><p>12) To my knowledge Cdk1 inhibition after anaphase onset has not been analysed before and it makes sense that this causes a faster reformation of the NE. This can be explained by the Cundell et al., papers due to premature Greatwall inactivation and PP2A:B55 reactivation. These papers should be cited here.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatiotemporal control of mitotic exit during anaphase by an Aurora B-Cdk1 crosstalk&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Accordingly, Aurora B was acutely inhibited at the first signs of sister chromatid separation at anaphase onset, either with Binucleine-2 (S2 cells) or with ZM447439 (hTERT-RPE1 cells). In both cases, Aurora B inhibition did not delay Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase. These results are in agreement with our previous studies (Afonso et al., 2014), which showed that acute Aurora B inhibition at anaphase onset in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Human cells did not accelerate mitotic exit. These data suggest that Aurora B-mediated feedback mechanism is only required to delay Cyclin B1 degradation and consequently mitotic exit in the presence of incompletely separated chromosomes. To directly test this, first we delayed chromosome separation by treating S2 cells with low doses of taxol or by depleting KLP10A, as shown previously (Afonso et al., 2014). Both treatments induced a delay in Cyclin B1-GFP degradation. Remarkably, acute inhibition of Aurora B activity at anaphase onset in taxol treated cells restored normal Cyclin B1 degradation. These results are now included in the manuscript as new Figure 10. Taken together, these data suggest that Aurora B-mediated regulation of Cyclin B1 degradation is only required to extend anaphase duration in the presence of delayed chromosome segregation, consistent with a feedback mechanism that delays mitotic exit in the presence of incompletely separated chromosomes during anaphase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should show that endogenous Cyclin B localises to the midzone; moreover, there is no evidence provided that spindle midzone localization of cyclin B requires Aurora B (protein or activity). Subito depletion also affects localization of Polo at the midzone (Cesario et al., 2006), so cyclin B localization might as well depend on this kinase, or simply depend on Subito and not on Aurora B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried exhaustively to localize endogenous Cyclin B1 either by immunofluorescence or by endogenously tagging Cyclin B1 with a fluorescent reporter in several systems, but we were limited by technical difficulties due to the extremely low signal/noise ratio of Cyclin B1 during anaphase. We have inclusively modified the acquisition routine for live-cell recording of endogenously tagged Cyclin B1Venus in both human HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 cells in order to adjust exposure times to the gradually decreasing signal of Cyclin B1 as cells entered anaphase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). While this unequivocally showed the presence and gradual decrease of Cyclin B1 during anaphase, the signal from mid-anaphase was so low that, with the new adjusted exposure times, the camera started picking auto-fluorescent cytoplasmic granules (confirmed in untagged parental hTERT-RPE1 cells, not shown here).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47646.049</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47646-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To overcome this technical difficulty, we started by forcing S2 cells to prematurely exit mitosis with higher endogenous levels of Cyclin B1 by acute Cdk1 inhibition in metaphase. Under these circumstances, signal/noise ratio improved significantly and we were able to co-localize endogenous Cyclin B1 with spindle midzone microtubules by immunofluorescence (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,B’). Surprisingly, there is no published data that we are aware of regarding Cdk1 localization during mitosis in mammalian cells. As so, we have performed localization experiments of Cdk1-GFP at high spatial and temporal resolution in live human cells. We found that Cdk1-GFP decorated the spindle region at the metaphase-anaphase transition and was clearly enriched at the central spindle region as cells progressed throughout anaphase, accumulating at the midbody during cytokinesis. We also note that Cdk1 has recently been identified by mass-spectrometry on isolated midbodies from human cells (bioRxiv 569459; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/569459). Therefore, although the low signal/noise ratio of endogenous Cyclin B1 did not allow us to unequivocally infer the localization of human Cyclin B1 during anaphase, we now show that human Cdk1 is enriched in the central spindle region during anaphase, and midbody during cytokinesis. These data are now provided in new Figure 7—figure supplement 3A,B).</p><p>In support of our model for spatial control of Cdk1 activity during anaphase, we have now optimized the conditions to monitor Cdk1 activity by adapting a previously reported Cdk1 FRET sensor (Gavet and Pines, 2010) for expression in S2 cells, followed by FLIM-FRET analysis. Strikingly, targeting the Cdk1 FRET sensor to chromatin by fusion with H2B histone revealed a gradient of Cdk1 activity on chromosomes, with lagging chromosomes showing significantly higher FRET than leading chromosomes during anaphase, as predicted by our model. This gradient was abolished by Cdk1 inhibition with RO-3306, and the respective non-phosphorylatable sensors did not report any significant Cdk1 activity. These data are now included in new Figure 9 and Figure 9 –source data 1 and Figure 9—source data 2. We concluded that Cdk1 activity on chromosomes is a function of chromosome separation during anaphase, with incompletely separated chromosomes positioned closer to the spindle midzone showing the highest Cdk1 activity during anaphase.</p><p>Finally, we used our metaphase Cdk1 inhibition essay to force entry into anaphase with higher levels of Cyclin B1 and monitored its localization at the spindle midzone after acute inhibition of Aurora B or Polo at anaphase onset in living S2 cells. Consistent with our previous Subito depletion experiments, these data showed that only Aurora B inhibition prevented Cyclin B1 to accumulate at the spindle midzone. Taken together, these data indicate that Aurora B localization and activity are required for Cyclin B1 accumulation at the spindle midzone in S2 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since none of the Aurora B sites in Drosophila cyclin B1 are conserved in human cyclin B1 (Mathieu et al., 2013) the authors should analyse the effects of human AurB phospho-mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that there are several putative Aurora B phosphorylation sites on human Cyclin B1 and Cyclin B2 that are not conserved with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cyclin B1 (and vice-versa; see below), this is not an easy enterprise to complete within just two months. We have nevertheless focused on two putative sites of human Cyclin B1, one (S310) that is conserved with human Cyclin B2 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cyclin B1, and another (S413) that is conserved between human Cyclin B1 and Cyclin B2 and has been previously identified as an Aurora B phosphorylation site on Cyclin B1 in large scale phospho-proteomic studies of mitosis (Kettenbach et al., 2011). These two sites were simultaneously mutated into Alanine (A) or Aspartic Acid (D) to respectively mimic non-phosphorylatable and constitutively phosphorylated human Cyclin B1 and transiently expressed as fusion proteins with GFP in human HeLa cells.</p><p>The CLUSTAL O(1.2.4) multiple sequence alignment can be found in Supplementary file 1.</p><p>Quantification of Cyclin B1-GFP fluorescence of both WT and respective mutants revealed only minor differences in the degradation kinetics of each version of Cyclin B1 during anaphase, but a clear effect of the phosphomimetic mutant already prior to anaphase (0 min).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47646.050</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47646-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While these experiments, together with existing literature (Kettenbach et al., Science Signal, 2011), do support a role for Aurora B in Cyclin B1 phosphorylation during mitosis in humans, the results were inconclusive about the effects of Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of human Cyclin B1 during anaphase. A more comprehensive and systematic study of these and other putative phosphorylated residues, combined with tools that allow the expression of the mutants in a temporally controlled manner, will be required to establish a conserved mechanistic role of Cyclin B1 phosphorylation during anaphase by Aurora B. For these reasons, we decided to tone down the role of Aurora B on Cyclin B1 phosphorylation and removed all the data on Cyclin B1 phosphorylation by Aurora B from the revised manuscript and will investigate this further in future works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1) The way the Aurora B and Subito experiments are presented and interpreted are confusing.

The latter would suggest that cyclin B needs to be dephosphorylated for timely degradation.</p><p>A phosphorylation event on a protein substrate can be eliminated either by dephosphorylation or substrate degradation. Our data supports a model in which local activity of Aurora B at the spindle midzone stabilizes Cyclin B1, possibly by direct phosphorylation. Since PP1/PP2A inhibition at anaphase onset did not show significant differences in Cyclin B1 half-life (at least the centrosomal-associated pool measured in these assays; see new Figure 10—figure supplement 1C) and, on the contrary, Fzr depletion showed a significant delay in Cyclin B1 degradation (new Figure 5f, g h) our interpretation is that removal of Cyclin B1 phosphorylation is achieved by proteolysis and not by dephosphorylation. In our view, this does not exclude the critical role played by PP1/PP2A in the generation of a phosphorylation gradient that might operate to locally control Cyclin B levels at the spindle midzone.</p><p>4) All referees had concerns with Figure 4:</p><p>What is happening to the spindle and chromosomes after MG132 addition and subsequent Cdk1 inhibition in U2OS cells. It looks as if cytokinesis (abscission unclear) is taking place and that in these daughter cells the half spindle (00:10) is forming a new 'metaphase' spindle over time on which the separated sisters try to align (01:00 and 01:30). After Cdk1 inhibition, both spindles undergo an aberrant anaphase/exit. Can this phenotype be regarded as a delay in anaphase, or should it be considered as a reversion into prometaphase? In S2 cells, the anaphase delay is much more clear, because cytokinesis does not appear to take place and the two half spindles rejoin after Cdk1 inhibition.</p><p>If cells only enter anaphase when Cdk1 activity has fallen below the required threshold to maintain metaphase, then how can cells arrested in anaphase by MG132 return to a metaphase-like state? Presumably this state results from blocking degradation events (cyclin B or other targets) normally contributing to disassembly of the spindle poles during anaphase. (And it implies that the central spindle – in contrast – disassembles under these conditions). Without further justification of the 'metaphase' label (e.g. restoration of Cdk activity), it should be avoided.</p><p>Proteasomal inhibition in anaphase blocks mitotic exit. The authors interpret these results in an &quot;anaphase arrest&quot; This is true as far as cohesion cleavage is concerned. However, the spindle appears to reform and from a cytoskeletal and cell cycle control perspective it looks more as if the cells were simply being pushed back into a mitotic state. This experiment shows that if Cdk1 activity is maintained above a threshold mitotic exit is blocked, most likely because phosphatases fail to reactivate. The particular experimental set up (i.e. adding a proteasome inhibitor following anaphase onset) is novel; however, the results are not particularly surprising, given for example the results shown by Potapova et al. that even reactivation of Cdk1 in late telophase reactivates the mitotic state.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in their perception that cytokinesis is starting to take place after MG132 addition <italic>at anaphase onset</italic>, however abscission is not completed and the two ‘daughters’ remain connected by a thin cytoplasmic bridge. A higher contrast snapshot of the relevant frame in new Figure 4A is now provided to clarify this issue. Subsequent Cdk1 inhibition <italic>during anaphase</italic> induced complete chromosome decondensation and spindle disassembly <italic>in a common cytoplasm</italic> that attempts to complete furrowing (another indication that the two ‘daughters’ were indeed connected by a cytoplasmic bridge), three hallmarks of mitotic exit. The reviewers are also correct in their observations that cells attempt to revert from their anaphase state by forming a new ‘prometaphase-like’ spindle, but only after a significant delay (approximately 1 hour) in an ‘anaphase-like’ state. We also note that each individual sister chromatid set forms their own bipolar spindle, in which most single sister chromatids cannot establish a stable position at the equator due to lack of amphitelic attachments (some do, likely due to merotelic attachments, as shown previously by Khodjakov et al., 1997). This mitotic reversal has indeed been previously observed by Gorbsky and colleagues (Potapova et al., 2006), which we cite, after treating cells with MG132 followed by Cdk1 inhibition <italic>in metaphase</italic> followed by Cdk1 inhibitor washout in anaphase. However, in this case, sister chromatids never fully separated (cut phenotype) and only one spindle formed. The differences between our studies are now clarified in the main text and terminology has been improved to avoid ambiguity (e.g. ‘anaphase arrest’ was replaced by ‘prevented mitotic exit’ or ‘anaphase-like state’). The observation that Cdk1 inhibition after preventing proteasome activity during anaphase resumed mitotic exit, excludes the possibility that the observed delay in mitotic exit after proteasome inhibition was caused by phosphatases that failed to reactivate. This is discussed in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The movies and images do not really support the notion of accelerated mitotic exit by AurB inhibition. Likewise, in the legend for Figure 4C the authors state: Note that for MG132 and MG132+Aurora B inhibition anaphase duration corresponds to the total duration of the movie as most cells do not exit mitosis until the end of the acquisition. I am not sure how in this case accelerated mitotic exit following AurB inhibition can be supported by the data? Also, it is not clear what the grey, green, purple colour code means.</p><p>We based our conclusion on the quantification of the duration between anaphase onset and mitotic exit in MG132-treated cells, with or without Aurora B inhibition. On average, this duration was shorter in cells after Aurora B inhibition, inclusively now some cells exited mitosis before the total duration of the movies, hence our statement. Yet, this is still much longer then Cdk1 inhibition. This is now clarified in the main text and figure legend, and the color code better explained also in the figure legend.</p><p>5) The videos are not referred to in the text.</p><p>This was our mistake, we apologize for the inconvenience. The movies are now referred in the main text.</p><p>6) Degradation analyses of cyclin B1 usually show that cells enter anaphase with some protein remaining (in contrast to some figures in the original Clute &amp; Pines 1999 study, which is cited to justify the statement at bottom of p8 that cyclin B1 is 'undetectable' at anaphase entry). The thresholding of anaphase entry underpins the phenomenon of mitotic slippage and has been explored at length in more recent literature that is not cited in this study. For example, a study from Stephen Taylor's lab (Gascoigne, 2009) measured a Cyclin B1-GFP threshold for anaphase corresponding to 32% of metaphase levels.</p><p>This is an important point that escaped our attention. We thank the reviewers for this remark and we now cite and discuss the work by Taylor and colleagues in the main text.</p><p>7) The phrase 'mitotic exit' needs to be used more carefully. It is conventionally used to describe the collective events that occur after anaphase onset and the authors sometimes use the phrase in this sense but in some places they use it to describe the point at which cells have completed these events (e.g. subsection “Cyclin B1 continues to be degraded during anaphase and its disappearance is a strong predictor of mitotic exit in metazoans” 'complete Cyclin B1 disappearance from centrosomes during anaphase strongly correlated with mitotic exit').</p><p>We agree with this point, but we think that the conventional use of the term ‘mitotic exit’ has been misleading. In our view, mitotic exit is not the collective series of events that occur after anaphase onset, but the irreversible transition from anaphase to telophase. This can be recognized by spindle disassembly, chromosome decondensation and complete nuclear envelope reassembly, but excludes for example the events occurring <italic>during</italic> anaphase, such as poleward chromosome motion and spindle elongation. This view is now clarified in the main text.</p><p>8) No mention is made of the likely presence of cyclin B3 in anaphase cells. B3 is degraded later than B1, and could contribute to Cdk1-dependent delay in mitotic exit.</p><p>This is an excellent point. Although we did mention in the Introduction section that “expression of non-degradable Cyclin B1 (and B3 in Drosophila) mutants arrested cells in anaphase”, now we investigated the importance of Cyclin B3 degradation during anaphase by monitoring mitotic progression in live S2 cells expressing non-degradable Cyclin B3. We found that, similar to expression of non-degradable Cyclin B1, S2 cells expressing non-degradable Cyclin B3 also arrested in anaphase with spindle elongation problems. Thus, both Cyclin B1 and B3 account for residual Cdk1 activity during anaphase in Drosophila S2 cells. These data is now shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E and discussed in the main text. We have also used the terminology ‘B-type Cyclins’ to reflect these results.</p><p>9) Figure 5 shows a very small effect of FZR depletion on cyclin B1 degradation at anaphase (especially in (f)) suggesting that Cdh1 may only play a minor role. The authors argue that prolonged Cdc20 activity can compensate for lack of Cdh1 under these conditions, by targeting cyclin B1 through its D-box (whereas Cdh1 targets it through KEN). These arguments do not properly reflect the latest thinking on patterns of APC/C-degron recognition. Cryo-EM structures published over the recent years have established a paradigm of multivalent APC/C-substrate interaction through two or more degrons and Cdc20 and Cdh1 have almost identical KEN and D-box receptor sites. It would be safer to conclude that Drosophila Cyclin B1 degradation in anaphase is mediated through both KEN and D-box, and can be carried out by either Cdc20 or Cdh1. This could be tested by the combination of KEN-mt/APCin.</p><p>The authors should note that APCin cannot be expected to inhibit a KEN-box dependent event, since it is a D-box competitor, so the discussions at top of p6 and middle p10 are incorrect – the additive effect of APCin and proTAME on anaphase arrest does not support a role for Cdh1 in anaphase cyclin B1 degradation. It supports that additive interactions of Cdc20/Cdh1 and substrate degrons are required for efficient ubiquitination of substrates.</p><p>We agree with this point and have now re-interpreted the conclusions from these experiments alluding to the recent Cryo-EM structures of APC/C. This re-interpretation is also supported by additional experiments where we combined acute Apcin treatment at anaphase onset with our KENbox mutant and found a synergistic effect. This result also suggests the presence of additional recognition sites that mediate Cyclin B1 degradation through APC/C during anaphase. These new data are now included in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-D) and discussed in the main text. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment.</p><p>10) Effects on cyclin B1-GFP degradation look very small in regular degradation plots, and are more convincingly presented as half-life measurements (e.g. Figure 8E, Figure 1—figure supplement 3D). The degradation curve for OA treatment (Figure 9E) also appears to show a very small difference in rate between treated and untreated cells; these data should likewise be presented as half life measurements to provide same level of proof as in other figures.</p><p>We have now measured Cyclin B1-GFP half-life at centrosomes with and without OA but the results revealed no statistically significant differences.</p><p>11) As far as I am aware, 'anaphase arrest' (Figure 5J) has never been described as a consequence of FZR depletion in mammalian cells. Could additional markers be used to show that this is really an anaphase arrest (as opposed to death in anaphase)?</p><p>This is another important point. In fact, the term ‘anaphase arrest’ is not appropriate because we are looking here at fixed cells. Nevertheless, individual sister chromatids that remain condensed are clearly visible by DAPI staining and the inclusion of a kinetochore marker (CENP-C) allowed us to unequivocally classify those cells as ‘anaphases’ due to the presence of individual kinetochores attached to microtubules from two separated half-spindles, as typically observed in anaphase cells expressing non-degradable Cyclin B1 or treated with MG132. We have now clarified this point in the main text.</p><p>12) To my knowledge Cdk1 inhibition after anaphase onset has not been analysed before and it makes sense that this causes a faster reformation of the NE. This can be explained by the Cundell et al., papers due to premature Greatwall inactivation and PP2A:B55 reactivation. These papers should be cited here.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite the works of Cundell at el. in our Discussion.

It now reads as follows:</p><p>“Only the simultaneous addition of both drugs at anaphase onset blocked the continuous degradation of Cyclin B1 during anaphase and prevented mitotic exit for several hours, similar to proteasome inhibition (Figure 6a-f). Although relative inefficiency of these inhibitors cannot be ruled out, it is conceivable that additive interactions of Cdc20/Cdh1 and Cyclin B1 degrons are required for efficient Cyclin B1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human Cyclin B1 degradation during anaphase is mediated through the D-box and KEN-box (when present), and can be carried out either by APC/CCdc20 or APC/CCdh1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Cyclin B1-Cdk1 localization and activity during anaphase are spatially 224 regulated by Aurora B at the spindle midzone”: The caveat to Figure 7 is that the presence of Cdk1 does not imply the presence ofCyclin B1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now re-written the section sub-title to specifically mention that Cyclin B1 was only detected in the spindle midzone in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.

In agreement, Cdk1 was recently found enriched on isolated midbodies from human cells (Capalbo et al., 2019).

Localization experiments in human cells suggest that Cdk1 itself might be enriched at the spindle midzone.
