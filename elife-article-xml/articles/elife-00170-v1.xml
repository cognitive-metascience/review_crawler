transcriptional mechanisms governing cellular differentiation and development of mammalian tissue remains poorly understood. Here we report that TAF7L, a paralogue of TFIID subunit TAF7, is enriched in adipocytes and white fat tissue (WAT) in mouse. Depletion of TAF7L reduced adipocyte-specific gene expression, compromised adipocyte differentiation, and WAT development as well. Ectopic expression of TAF7L in myoblasts reprograms these muscle precursors into adipocytes upon induction. Genome-wide mRNA-seq expression profiling and ChIP-seq binding studies confirmed that TAF7L is required for activating adipocyte-specific genes via a dual mechanism wherein it interacts with PPARγ at enhancers and TBP/Pol II at core promoters. In vitro binding studies confirmed that TAF7L forms complexes with both TBP and PPARγ. These findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPARγ and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00170.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00170.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00170.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The development of a single fertilized egg into a highly complex animal is determined by its genome, with a process called differential gene regulation exerting exquisite control over gene expression to ensure that various specialized cells are generated and that many types of tissue are produced. However, the mechanisms responsible for controlling gene expression and, therefore mammalian development, are poorly understood.</p><p>Researchers have developed a number of in vitro cell culture models to elucidate the details of differential gene regulation, and this approach has been used to characterize adipocytes—cells that store energy in the form of fat—for close to two decades. The formation of adipocytes, a process known as adipogenesis, has been extensively studied, but there remain major gaps in our knowledge: for example, the identities of many of the transcriptional regulators that are responsible for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes remain a mystery. This task is complicated by the fact that some of these regulators are involved in the differentiation of multiple cell lines, and that some of them also have multiple roles in the generation of a single cell type. In addition to being of fundamental interest, improving our knowledge of the properties and behavior of adipocytes is essential for tackling the increasing prevalence of obesity in the developed world.</p><p>Zhou et al. now report that TAF7L—a gene that was previously thought to be involved only in the production of sperm cells—has two roles in the differentiation of stem cells to form adipocytes. Using a combination of cellular, biochemical, genetic and genomic techniques, they show that TAF7L interacts with PPARγ, an important adipocyte transcriptional regulator at enhancer sites on the genome to increase the transcription of genes that are involved in adipogenesis. They also show that TAF7L interacts with a general transcription factor called TBP (short for TATA-binding protein) at promoter sequences, again to increase the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. Moreover, they show that the expression of TAF7L in myoblasts—precursor cells that usually become muscle cells—can induce the formation of fat cells rather than muscle cells. Furthermore, mice lacking TAF7L are lean compared to their normal littermates. A clearer understanding of the underlying causes of fat cell formation could lead to the development of new approaches for the treatment of obesity and associated diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00170.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00170.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ChIP-seq</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>C3H10T½</kwd><kwd>TAF7L</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA25417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of cellular, biochemical, genetic and genomic techniques have revealed a new molecular player in the production of fat cells in mice, which could improve our understanding of obesity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissue plays a central role in energy homeostasis by acting as a major lipid storage site as well as an important endocrine tissue. Excess food intake vs energy expenditure invariably leads to obesity, an increasingly prevalent condition in modern societies. Obesity is, in turn, tightly associated with an elevated risk of type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, posing serious public health issues and rapidly escalating costs of health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Accumulation of adipose tissue mass results from increase in both adipocyte size and number. The size of adipocytes depends on the amount of stored lipids, while an increase in adipocyte number (adipogenesis) generally results from the expansion of adult precursor cells and subsequent differentiation, an underlying cause of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>). Consequently, there is great interest in dissecting the molecular mechanisms regulating adipogenesis and adipose biology.</p><p>During the past 20 years, numerous studies have focused on the formation of adipocytes using well-established in vitro cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tontonoz and Spiegelman, 2008</xref>). The utilization of these model cells identified key adipogenic transcriptional activators such as C/EBPα and PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brun et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2004b</xref>). Other transcription factors and cofactors, such as KLF15, KLF9, MED1, MED14, MED15, MED23 and TAF8, have also been reported to be involved in either adipocyte commitment or differentiation in model cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guermah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grøntved et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pei et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, genome-wide studies using a variety of techniques (microarray, FAIRE-seq, Quanttrx and mRNA-seq) have been utilized to screen for additional putative pro-adipogenic factors based on changes in either mRNA levels or chromatin states during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waki et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, adipocyte-specific expression signatures and genome-wide binding maps of pro-adipogenic activators such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, and RXRα have been primarily determined from 3T3-L1 derived adipocytes. Other factors, including ZFP423, NF1 family proteins, and IRFs have been also implicated in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boergesen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, it has become evident that the full complement of key transcriptional regulators that orchestrate adipogenesis remains to be illucidated. The diversity of factors and the mechanisms driving adipocyte formation and cellular differentiation in general remain a challenge. For example, several tissue-specific components of the core transcriptional machinery were recently found to play essential roles in directing cell type-specific programs of transcription and lineage-specific differentiation. The examples of these include TAF4b which was found to be a key component in the development of the mouse ovary and spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freiman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Voronina et al., 2007</xref>), and TAF3 which was found to be required for mouse germ-layer differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, a TRF3/TAF3 complex was found to be important for mouse myogenesis and zebrafsh hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 2009</xref>). As increasing numbers of cell type- and tissue-specific components of the core machinery become better characterized, a somewhat different notion of how traditional sequence–specific enhancer binding factors cooperate with selective tissue-specific core factors to drive lineage-specific transcription programs has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Alessio et al., 2009</xref>). With respect to adipogenesis, the only hint of such a mechanism came from previous studies of TAF8, which was reported as a component of TFIID implicated in adipocyte formation using 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guermah et al., 2003</xref>). Whether TAF8 operates exclusively as a subunit of TFIID or participates in other molecular transactions, in addition to its in vivo function, remain unknown.</p><p>Here we found TAF7L, a paralogue of TATA binding protein associated factor 7, is highly enriched in differentiated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes and bona fide mouse WAT. We have utilized shRNA knockdown and gene knockout strategies to determine the role of TAF7L in adipocyte formation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have explored the consequences of ectopically expressing TAF7L in C2C12 myoblasts to probe its reprogramming capabilities. Further, we carried out genome-wide mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis to survey its functions in adipocyte differentiation. By using a combination of cellular, biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches, our findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPARγ and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery, therefore providing new molecular insights into fat development that may prove useful for developing therapeutic strategies to treat obesity and its associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elevated levels of TAF7L in differentiated adipocytes and WAT</title><p>To explore the regulatory mechanisms directing adipocyte formation and function, we asked whether there were significant changes to the core promoter recognition components during adipogenesis similar to what had been observed during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>). In particular, we set out to determine whether and which TAF subunits of the prototypic core promoter recognition complex TFIID increase or decrease in expression during adipocyte differentiation. Consistent with the previous observations from 3T3-L1 adipogenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guermah et al., 2003</xref>), our analysis of both protein and mRNA levels revealed that TBP and most of the canonical subunits of TFIID are down-regulated during C3H10T1/2 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Surprisingly however, one subunit (TAF7L) previously reported to be a component of TFIID primarily in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pointud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>) was found to be significantly up-regulated in differentiated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Importantly, this enrichment appears specific for the adipogenesis process since the mRNA abundance of <italic>Taf7l</italic> is downregulated to levels comparable to those of other TAF subunits during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that <italic>Taf7l</italic> enrichment reflects a cell culture artifact of C3H10T1/2 adipogenesis, we compared <italic>Taf7l</italic> mRNA and protein levels in bona fide mouse tissue. In concordance with previous studies, <italic>Taf7l</italic> is most highly expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pointud et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Taf7l</italic> also shows significant expression in WAT and detectable expression in liver, spleen, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and kidney, but not in muscle or brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). By contrast, the expression of canonical TFIID subunits such as TAF4 is low in both WAT and muscle as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that TAF7L is indeed enriched in differentiated C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and bona fide WAT.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00170.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TAF7L is enriched in terminally differentiated adipocytes and bona fide WAT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Expression of TAF7L and TFIID subunits prior to and 5 days (5D) post adipogenic induction of C3H10T1/2 cells as shown by RT-qPCR analysis (<bold>A</bold>) and by Western blot (<bold>B</bold>).

As shown by Western blot, shTAF7L significantly reduced TAF7L protein levels both pre- and more dramatically post-adipogenesis while levels of canonical TFIID subunits remained largely unaltered in control and TAF7L knockdown pre-adipogenesis cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, pre-). Consistent with our previous observation in terminally differentiated cells, the protein levels of the canonical TFIID subunits become largely decreased in control post-adipogenesis cultures while cells that have been depleted of TAF7L and therefore blocked from differentiation show high levels of TFIID subunits. As expected, PPARγ levels increased in control shGFP cells post induction but showed markedly reduced levels in shTAF7L-treated cells suggesting that TAF7L may directly or indirectly regulate this key adipogenic transcription factor. Our results also suggest that shTAF7L efficiently reduced endogenous TAF7L levels and blocked adipogenesis without significantly affecting TFIID complex integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, post-). Next, C3H10T1/2 cells stably treated with shTAF7L and control shGFP were subjected to Oil red O staining to determine the efficiency of adipogenesis. Very few lipid-laden adipocytes formed in TAF7L depleted C3H10T1/2 cells, whereas over 98% of shGFP-treated cells differentiated into mature adipocytes. The few adipocytes that formed in shTAF7L-treated cells appeared smaller and exhibited abnormal morphology compared to untreated or shGFP-treated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>).

Strikingly, 2083 out of 2360 genes (88%) that are highly upregulated during adipocyte differentiation failed to be induced upon adipogenic induction in the absence of TAF7L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

These data suggest that the induction of adipocyte-specific genes is markedly compromised in the absence of TAF7L. Moreover, the overall transcriptional profile of differentiated shTAF7L-treated C3H10T1/2 cells (shTAF7L-post) largely matched the expression levels of pre-differentiated C3H10T1/2 cells (10T1/2-pre) (R = 0.98) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); while mature adipocytes (10T1/2-post) is distinct (R = 0.84) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

For instance, transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into adipocytes by ectopic expression of PPARγ and/or C/EBPa under adipogenic permissive conditions helped establish these sequence-specific enhancer binding factors as key regulators of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tontonoz et al., 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kajimura et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we tested the adipogenic function of TAF7L by an analogous ‘gain of function’ approach with forced introduction of TAF7L or control vector into C2C12 myoblasts. First, we generated TAF7L-expressing (C2C12.TAF7L) or control C2C12 (C2C12.CNTL) stable cell lines by transfecting either FLAG-TAF7L or empty vector followed by neomycin selection. As detected by FLAG antibody through Western blot analysis, C2C12.TAF7L stable cells achieved modestly elevated expression levels of FLAG-TAF7L protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, C2C12.TAF7L cells express roughly eightfold higher <italic>Taf7l</italic> mRNA levels than C2C12.CNTL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we treated both C2C12.TAF7L and C2C12.CNTL stable cell lines with the four standard adipogenic inducers for 5 days and then applied Oil red O staining. A large proportion of C2C12.TAF7L cells developed into lipid-laden cells while no detectable C2C12.CNTL cells produced lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR confirmed that C2C12.TAF7L cells have markedly increased mRNA levels of a subset of adipocyte-specific genes including <italic>Adipsin</italic>, <italic>Resistin</italic>, <italic>Pparγ</italic>, <italic>C</italic>/<italic>EBPα</italic>, <italic>Adipoq</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> relative to C2C12.CNTL cells post differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C,E,F</xref>).

Furthermore, we performed mRNA-seq on differentiated C2C12.TAF7L and C2C12.CNTL cells and these genome-wide expression studies revealed that indeed, a number of adipocyte-specific genes become highly upregulated in C2C12.TAF7L cells compared to C2C12.CNTL cells post adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of genes upregulated fivefold or more in differentiated C2C12.TAF7L cells vs C2C12.CNTL cells indicated that ∼32% of these genes are involved in either adipocyte differentiation or function.

Analysis of our ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq data suggests that among all active genes in adipocytes, TAF7L binds to &gt;65% of adipocyte-specific genes that are highly upregulated (&gt;50×) during adipogenesis while binding much less frequently at both core promoters (&lt;500 bp from TSS) and proximal enhancer regions (500 bp to 5 kb from TSS) near genes unaltered or downregulated during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next we compared the expression levels of genes in adipocytes to the binding intensity of TAF7L and found a strong positive correlation in the three expression groups. For instance, examination of 3,468 TAF7L peaks, representing 20% of the total peaks located at proximal enhancers revealed that the average TAF7L binding strength on genes upregulated &gt;50× is twice as strong as on genes induced between 5–50× in adipocytes relative to C3H10T1/2 cells, and eight times stronger than on genes down-regulated following adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that TAF7L binding frequency and strength is highly correlated with upregulated genes during adipogenesis.</p><p>By mapping the genomic binding sites, we found that both TBP and Pol II display greater than 63% occupancy at transcriptional start sites (TSS) of highly expressed genes in both undifferentiated C3H10T1/2 cells and adipocytes, consistent with their roles in mediating global and general transcription functions. Interestingly, comparing the binding regions of TAF7L, TBP and Pol II in adipocytes revealed that TAF7L only partially (30%) colocalizes with TBP and Pol II at a subset of promoters, while a greater proportion (45%) of TAF7L peaks localizes to enhancer regions where TBP and Pol II are generally not found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). This surprising finding suggests that TAF7L may function via additional mechanisms other than as a subunit of canonical TFIID in regulating adipocyte differentiation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00170.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>TAF7L colocalizes and associates with PPARγ and TBP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two top motifs (motif 1 and motif 2) were found in TAF7L binding sites.

First, we applied an unbiased genome-wide approach to identify sequence-specific transcription factors that could interact with TAF7L. We analyzed the sequences surrounding TAF7L binding sites and identified several DNA consensus sequence motifs enriched in TAF7L peaks. Next, we compared these motifs with all known sequence-specific recognition elements of transcription factors, which led to the identification of several binding motifs of well-known adipogenic transcription factors including PPARγ and C/EBPγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>We then used ChIP-seq to directly map the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARγ and detected 4,121 and 12,893 significant peaks for PPARγ in C3H10T1/2 cells pre- and post-differentiation, respectively. We then validated our ChIP-seq data by comparing our new data with published ChIP-seq data for PPARγ, C/EBPα, and RXRα in 3T3-L1 derived adipocytes 6 days post-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waki et al., 2011</xref>). This extensive analysis revealed that the majority of PPARγ binding sites we mapped overlap with those previously reported although some differences in specific binding sites were observed, likely due to inherent differences between 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 cells. A direct comparison of TAF7L and PPARγ genome-wide binding profiles revealed that 26% of TAF7L peaks were co-occupied by PPARγ and reciprocally, 37% of PPARγ peaks were co-bound by TAF7L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>). Similarly, TAF7L binds to 20% of RXRα bound loci genome-wide. Moreover, TAF7L also co-localizes with 25% of C/EBPα binding and vice versa. Collectively, these findings provide indirect evidence for a functional association between TAF7L and adipogenic activators PPARγ, RXRα and C/EBPα in adipocytes. Indeed, the relationship between TAF7L, PPARγ, C/EBPα and TBP/Pol II at a genome-wide scale suggests that TAF7L might also functions as an enhancer-associated co-activator that connects adipogenic activators with the core promoter recognition machinery to potentiate adipocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>TAF7L interacts with PPARγ and TBP/TFIID</title><p>Prompted by the extensive co-localization between TAF7L, TBP and PPARγ, we set out to examine the potential physical association between these factors. First, we constructed TAF7L, TBP and PPARγ with either FLAG or HA Tags for expression in 293T cells in pair-wise combinations. Next, we performed co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) between PPARγ, TAF7L and TBP with either FLAG or HA antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis to detect the FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins. Intriguingly, these co-IP assays showed that PPARγ can efficiently pull down TAF7L and vice versa with (data not shown) or without the addition of PPARγ ligand rosiglitozone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>); by contrast, PPARγ was unable to co-IP TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). As expected, TAF7L and TBP can pull down each other reciprocally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), which is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pointud et al., 2003</xref>). To confirm that the association between TAF7L and PPARγ or TBP is direct and not mediated via DNA/chromatin interactions, we included benzonase treatment in our co-IP assays. Eliminating DNA in these co-IP experiments did not alter the binding interactions we observed between TAF7L and PPARγ or TBP (data now shown). As expected, over-expression of TAF7L in C3H10T1/2 cells and adipocytes allows co-IP of other endogenous TFIID subunits including TBP and TAF4 (data not shown), suggesting that some tagged-TAF7L can integrate into native TFIID complexes. Taken together, these protein:protein binding assays suggest that TAF7L can physically associate with both PPARγ and TBP/TFIID either directly or indirectly via presently unidentified protein factors. These studies provide a potential mechanism by which TAF7L may serve as a cofactor linking specific adipogenic activators, proximal enhancers and the core transcription apparatus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well-documented that the adult human body contains cells residing in the adipose tissue, referred to as Adipose-derived Stem Cells (ASCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLany et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feve, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerlach et al., 2012</xref>). ASCs resemble mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in terms of their ability to differentiate into multiple lineages including adipocytes, myotubes, osteocytes, and cartilage under appropriate developmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gornostaeva et al., 2006</xref>). Given that increased numbers of adipocytes, a major underlying cause of obesity, are primarily derived from MSCs and/or ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowers and Lane, 2008</xref>), we chose C3H10T1/2 MSCs as our cell culture model system for studying adipogenesis in large measure because MSCs efficiently recapitulate aspects of adipocyte differentiation and in vivo fat development. Using this MSC culture model as well as <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO mouse model for our in vitro and in vivo studies, we unexpectedly identified <italic>Taf7l</italic> as a key regulator of adipogenesis; adding a new piece of the molecular puzzle to the critically important regulators of fat development in mammalian organisms. We found the effect of <italic>Taf7l</italic> in adipogenesis to be quite robust wherein its loss led to extensive down-regulation of genome-wide adipocyte-specific gene expression in cell culture and defects in WAT development in vivo. We are particularly intrigued by the manner in which TAF7L seems to operate–serving both as an integral component of TFIID at the core promoter and as a key co-activator interacting directly with PPARγ or other adipocyte-specific transcriptional factors (ATFs) at proximal enhancers of adipocyte-specific genes on genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, a hitherto unrecognized cell-type selective core regulator with an apparent dual mechanism of action has been identified that influences the pro-adipogenic transcriptional control network. It is conceivable that TAF7L and associated regulatory factors in this newly discovered pathway may reveal potentially useful therapeutic drug targets to combat obesity and its related diseases.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00170.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Dual functions of TAF7L in adipocyte differentiation.</title><p>TAF7L expression is enriched during C3H10T1/2 MSCs adipocyte differentiation while other TFIID subunits (TAFs) decrease in expression.

General highly-expressed genes are those with high expression before and after adipocyte differentiation include a portion of housekeeping genes; adipocyte-specific genes are those required for adipocyte differentiation and highly upregulated during adipocyte differentiation.

Indeed, even after being clued into the potential contribution of <italic>Taf7l</italic> in fat tissue development, our analysis of <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO mice mainly revealed defects in WAT formation at certain stages of development and there were no gross, easily-observable morphological abnormalities in young animals except when the underlying fat pads were dissected for direct inspection to reveal the partial penetrance of the lean phenotype. Also, previous studies had no reason to examine the expression of <italic>Taf7l</italic> in adipose tissue because <italic>Taf7l</italic> mRNA and protein levels are relatively low in adipose tissue compared with testis. We also note that although TAF7L protein levels become highly elevated when MSCs differentiate into adipocytes, its mRNA levels increase only modestly (∼2×) compared to typical adipocyte marker genes such as <italic>Fabp4</italic> and <italic>Glut4</italic> during adipogensis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kajimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seale et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that a role for <italic>Taf7l</italic> in adipocytes could have been overlooked in previous studies. This cautionary tale also suggests that other key transcriptional regulators could likewise go undetected; suggesting that more studies will likely be required to take a fuller accounting of the multiple factor combinations that have evolved to orchestrate the diversity of gene regulatory pathways during differentiation and development of metazoans.</p><p>Although spermatogenesis and adipogenesis represent two biologically distinct differentiation processes, their common dependence on <italic>Taf7l</italic> may imply some underlying and perhaps hidden commonality. For example, one can speculate that energy storage and metabolic homeostasis are tightly related/linked to reproductive abilities since both are highly sensitive to and dependent on nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vernon et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashmi et al., 2011</xref>). Another possible link involved steroid hormones (i.e. testosterone), which are essential for spermatogenesis, are derived from cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury and Mukherjee, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahmoud et al., 1985</xref>). In any case, our genome-wide mRNA-seq expression analysis unambiguously identified <italic>Taf7l</italic>-mediated enrichment of genes involved in both adipogenesis and reproductive processes. However, further investigation will be required to assess whether there are more direct links between adipogenesis and spermatogenesis and whether mutant <italic>Taf7l</italic> involved in male infertility also disturbs normal fat development and metabolism.</p><p>Our data clearly showed that TAF7L binds to and regulates the expression of a subset of white adipose genes, interestingly we also observed downregulation of some brown adipocyte genes (<italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Elovl3</italic>) caused by TAF7L knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kajimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kajimura et al., 2010</xref>).

This method and the following immunohistochemistry by haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining were performed using the method described previously by Steven Ruzin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schichnes et al., 1998</xref>), and FABP4 immunostaining method was modified from the one described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kajimura et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>ChIP, ChIP libraries preparation, and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq)</title><p>Fix C3H10T1/2 cells and differentiated adipocytes with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature then use 0.125 M glycine to stop the crosslinking for an additional 5 min. Collect cells and extract nuclei with extraction buffer. The chromatin obtained from C3H10T1/2 cells and adipocytes was fragmented to sizes ranging from 175 to 225 bp using a Covaris-S2 sonicator (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA) for a total processing time of 40 min (20 s on, 20 s off). 900 µg of the sonicated chromatin was used in each immunoprecipitation reaction as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) with the Pol II, TBP, PPARγ, and TAF7L antibodies, mouse and rabbit IgG were used as negative controls respectively. Preparation of the sequencing libraries on the DNA samples of the immunoprecipitation from antibodies and IgGs precisely followed the instructions from Illumina (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), qualities of the libraries were assessed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Functional Genomics Laboratory, Berkeley,CA) and then subjected to ultra-high throughput sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (GSL core facility, Berkeley, CA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), each sample yielded ∼50–200 million reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mapping sequencing reads to the genome</title><p>Sequenced reads were mapped to the July 2007 assembly of the mouse genome (UCSC version mm9, NCBI37) using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with the command-line options ‘-c -q -n 2 -l 48 -m 1’, thereby keeping for further analyses only reads that mapped uniquely to the genome with at most two mismatches at the first 48 bases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Peak calling methods</title><p>To accurately identify significant binding positions across the genome, we incorporated two peak calling methods, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">May et al., 2012</xref>). First, we used MACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) (version 1.4, with default settings except: --nomodel --shiftsize = 110 --pvalue=1e-2 --mfold = 10,10,000 --slocal = 2000 --llocal = 20,000), with an FDR significant threshold of 0.05 (using IgG ChIP as a control). Second, we applied the Grizzly peak fitting algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>), which uses a model-based iterative approach to accurately identify multiple binding loci at every enriched region. Peaks were then associated with the nearest TSS (using gene annotation from UCSC, version mm9), and classified as promoter peaks (up to 500 bp from start site), proximal enhancer peaks (larger than 500 bp and less than 5 kb), distal enhancer peaks (less than 50 kb from TSS), or none (further away than any start site).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Motif identification</title><p>The DNA sequence associated with each of the peaks is a 250 bp fragment that is centered on the highest point peak within the TAF7L binding region as defined by Grizzly Peak. Weeder (version 1.4.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pavesi et al., 2004</xref>) searches the inputted sequences for enriched motifs. The Weeder output is then passed through STAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahony and Benos, 2007</xref>) to compare the identified motif's frequency matrix against the JASPAR v2010 database and identify which transcription factors have that DNA binding motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>mRNA-seq libraries preparation and deep sequencing</title><p>Total RNAs were extracted from C3H10T1/2 cells and adipocytes, differentiated shTAF7L-C3H10T1/2 cells, differentiated C2C12.CNTL and C2C12.TAF7L cells by RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), 8 μg of each sample was used to purify mRNA and subsequently converted into to mRNA-seq library using mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. 50 bp paired-end were used for the C3H10T1/2 samples and 100 bp single-end were used for the C2C12 samples, both resulting in over 175 million reads yield per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Digital gene expression of mRNA-seq</title><p>The reads were than mapped to the mouse transcriptome (created using UCSC table browser, version mm9, on February 2012), using TopHat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>), version v1.4.0., using default parameters. We then applied cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>), version v1.3.0, using the default parameters except: --max-mle-iterations 1, to estimate the digital expression levels at each transcript.
