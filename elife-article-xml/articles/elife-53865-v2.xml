functional annotation of genomes. In the context of multicellular organisms, interrogation of gene function is greatly facilitated by methods that allow spatial and temporal control of gene abrogation. Here, we describe a large-scale transgenic short guide (sg) RNA library for efficient CRISPR-based disruption of specific target genes in a constitutive or conditional manner. The library consists currently of more than 2600 plasmids and 1700 fly lines with a focus on targeting kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors, each expressing two sgRNAs under control of the Gal4/UAS system. We show that conditional CRISPR mutagenesis is robust across many target genes and can be efficiently employed in various somatic tissues, as well as the germline. In order to prevent artefacts commonly associated with excessive amounts of Cas9 protein, we have developed a series of novel UAS-Cas9 transgenes, which allow fine tuning of Cas9 expression to achieve high gene editing activity without detectable toxicity. Functional assays, as well as direct sequencing of genomic sgRNA target sites, indicates that the vast majority of transgenic sgRNA lines mediate efficient gene disruption. Furthermore, we conducted the so far largest fully transgenic CRISPR screen in any metazoan organism, which further supported the high efficiency and accuracy of our library and revealed many so far uncharacterized genes essential for development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Twenty years after the release of the sequence of the human genome, the role of many genes is still unknown.

Forward genetic screens utilize random mutagenesis to introduce novel genetic variants, but are limited by the large number of individuals required to probe many or all genetic loci and difficulties in identifying causal variants. In contrast, reverse genetic approaches, such as RNA interference (RNAi), are gene-centric designed and allow to probe the function of a large number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutros and Ahringer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heigwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mohr et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, RNAi reagents can be genetically encoded and used to screen for gene function with spatial and temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaya-Çopur and Schnorrer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ni et al., 2009</xref>). However, RNAi is often limited by incomplete penetrance due to residual gene expression and can suffer from off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Echeverri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While genetic screens have contributed enormously to our understanding of gene function, large parts of eukaryotic genomes remain not or only poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2013</xref>). For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> only 20% of genes have associated mutant alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman, 2017</xref>). Therefore, there exists an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to gain a more complete understanding of the functions encoded by the various elements of the genome.</p><p>Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) - CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems are adaptive prokaryotic immune systems that have been adopted for genome engineering applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Cas9 complexed with a single chimeric guide RNA (sgRNA) mediates site-specific DNA double strand breaks and subsequent DNA repair can result in small insertions and deletions (indels) at the break point. However, not all Cas9-mediated indel mutations abrogate gene function. To compensate for that, strategies have been developed to introduce simultaneously several mutations in the same gene. The efficiency of such multiplexing strategies has been demonstrated in flies, mice, fish and plants, and several sgRNAs are often required to generate bi-allelic loss-of function mutations in all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the often multifaceted functions genetic elements have in multicellular organisms requires methods that enable spatial or temporal control of gene disruption. To restrict CRISPR mutagenesis to defined cells, tissues or developmental stages, specific regulatory regions are commonly employed to drive Cas9 expression. However, Cas9 expression vectors with tissue-specific enhancers often display ‘leaky’ Cas9 expression in other tissues and poor control of CRISPR mutagenesis has been observed in multiple systems, including flies, mice and patient derived xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that expressing both Cas9 and sgRNA from conditional regulatory elements can result in tightly controlled genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>), but the robustness of such a strategy across many genomic target sites has so far not been explored.</p><p>Here, we describe a large-scale resource for spatially restricted mutagenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The system mediates robust mutagenesis across target genes, giving rise to a large fraction of cells containing gene knock-outs and displays tight spatial and temporal control. We developed a series of tunable Cas9 lines that allow gene editing with high efficiency and low toxicity independent of enhancer strength. These can be used with a growing library of sgRNA transgenes, which currently comprise over 1700 <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains, for systematic mutagenesis in any somatic tissue or the germline. Furthermore, we present the first large-scale transgenic CRISPR screen using this resource, which confirms its high efficiency and specificity and reveals multiple uncharacterized genes with essential, but unknown function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis</title><p>We set out to develop a large-scale resource that would allow systematic CRISPR-mediated gene disruption with tight spatial and temporal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, tissue-specific expression of transgenes is most commonly performed via the binary Gal4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) and thousands of Gal4 lines with specific temporal and spatial expression patterns are publicly available. To harness this resource for tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis we aimed to utilize <italic>UAS-Cas9</italic> transgenes and combine them with the sgRNA expression vector <italic>pCFD6</italic>, which enables Gal4-dependent expression of sgRNA arrays. We have previously shown that conditional expression of both Cas9 and sgRNAs is necessary to achieve tight control of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>). Since this previous proof-of principle study was restricted to testing <italic>pCFD6</italic> with two sgRNAs targeting the Wnt secretion factor <italic>Evenness interrupted</italic> (<italic>Evi</italic>, also known as <italic>Wntless</italic> or <italic>Sprinter</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bänziger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>), we first tested whether this system is robust across target genes and tissues, a prerequisite to generate large-scale libraries of sgRNA strains targeting many or all <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes. To this end, we created various transgenic fly lines harbouring a <italic>pCFD6</italic> transgene encoding two sgRNAs targeting a single gene at two independent positions. These were crossed to flies containing a <italic>UAS-cas9.P2</italic> transgene and a tissue-specific Gal4 driver. We then analysed if mutations were efficiently induced, restricted to the appropriate cells and caused the expected phenotypes. We observed efficient and specific gene disruption in wing imaginal discs with <italic>pCFD6</italic> sgRNA transgenes targeting the <italic>Drosophila</italic> beta-Catenin homolog <italic>armadillo</italic> (<italic>arm</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as the transcription factor <italic>senseless</italic> (<italic>sens</italic>) or the transmembrane protein <italic>smoothened</italic> (<italic>smo</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To test tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis in a different tissue context, we targeted <italic>Notch</italic> (<italic>N</italic>) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut, which is derived from the endoderm. We observed a strong increase in stem cell proliferation and an accumulation of cells with small nuclei, which matches the described phenotype of <italic>N</italic> mutant clones in the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">; Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a qualitative difference between perturbation of <italic>N</italic> expression by RNAi, which only induces hyperplasia in female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hudry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siudeja et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>N</italic> mutagenesis by CRISPR, which induces strong overgrowth in both male and female midguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also tested conditional mutagenesis of <italic>neuralized</italic> (<italic>neur</italic>) and <italic>yellow</italic> (<italic>y</italic>) along the dorsal midline and of <italic>sepia</italic> (<italic>se</italic>) in the developing eye and observed in each case the described null mutant phenotype in the expected domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conditional CRISPR mutagenesis with pCFD6 is robust across target genes and tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the workflow.

We employed a method that uses upstream open reading frames (uORF) of different length to predictably reduce translation of the main, downstream ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Southall et al., 2013</xref>).

However, CRISPR mutagenesis with <italic>ptc-Gal4</italic> frequently leads to mutations throughout the entire anterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E’</xref>), likely reflecting broader expression of <italic>ptc-Gal4</italic> in early development or expression at low level in this domain. Similar effects were observed with <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Therefore, additional regulatory mechanisms to temporally control Cas9 expression are highly desirable when using Gal4 lines with dynamic expression patterns during development.

We used CRISPR library designer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heigwer et al., 2016</xref>) to compile a list of all sgRNAs that do not have predicted off-target sites elsewhere in the genome. We then selected sgRNAs depending on the position of their target site within the target gene. We chose sgRNAs targeting coding exons shared by all mRNA isoforms and target sites that were located in the 5’ half of the open reading frame, where indel mutations often have the largest functional impact. We then grouped sgRNAs in pairs, with each pair targeting sites typically separated by approximately 500 bp of protein coding DNA (see Materials and methods). Next, we devised an efficient cloning protocol to insert defined sgRNA pairs into <italic>pCFD6</italic>. This utilized synthesized oligonucleotide pools, which allow cloning of hundreds to thousands of sgRNA plasmids in parallel in a single tube, followed by clonal selection of individual pCFD6-sgRNA<sup>2x</sup> plasmids and sequence validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, see Materials and methods). We also generated a derivative of <italic>pCFD6</italic>, <italic>pCFD6.FRT</italic>, which harbors incompatible FRT2 and FRT5 sites before and after the sgRNA cassette, respectively. These recombination sites can be used to exchange sequences either side of the sgRNA cassette, for example the promoter, or to add additional sgRNAs to the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We crossed HD_CFD animals to <italic>act-cas9;;tub-Gal4/TM3</italic> to induce mutations ubiquitously in the offspring and determined viability at five to seven days after eclosion. 290/639 (45%) of all crosses did not yield any viable offspring, while 269 (42%) lines produced viable adults and 53 (8%) of the lines resulted in lethality with incomplete penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In order to benchmark the performance of the screen, we manually curated viability information based on genetic alleles stored in the Flybase database to determine which HD_CFD lines target genes known to be essential or non-essential during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. This resulted in a list of 210 lines that target known essential genes. Of those, 167 (79%) resulted in lethality, 20 (10%) were scored as semi-lethal, and 23 (11%) gave rise to viable adult offspring. Interestingly, among the targets of sgRNA lines that produced false-negative results there was a strong enrichment of genes known to play important roles, and to be highly expressed, during early embryonic development. Furthermore, sequencing the sgRNA target sites in randomly selected false-negative lines revealed efficient gene editing on one or both sites in 3/3 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that false-negative results often arise due to mRNA perdurance, not inactive sgRNAs. Next, we analysed our data set for the occurrence of false-positives, that is lines that target non-essential genes, but result in lethality. Among the 639 lines present in our screen, 54 target genes are currently annotated as viable. Of those, 48 (89%) gave rise to viable adult offspring, one resulted in semi-lethal offspring and 5 (9%) produced no viable offspring. False-positive results might arise due to off-target mutagenesis, mutations that affect neighbouring genes or cis-elements located at the target-locus, or reflect incorrect annotations in the database. Of the five lines giving rise to false-positive results in our screen two target the same gene (<italic>Blos1</italic>), arguing against sgRNA-mediated off-target mutagenesis in this case.</p><p>Screening for lethality not only allowed us to benchmark our sgRNA library, but also revealed multiple lines targeting uncharacterized genes with putative essential functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For example, sgRNA line HD_CFD558 targets CG9890, an evolutionary conserved (55% amino acid similarity to the human ortholog) zinc finger protein of unknown function. Another interesting example is CG6470, which is targeted by HD_CFD557 and HD_CFD599 with independent sgRNAs. CG6470 encodes an uncharacterized zinc finger protein that despite its essential role during development is evolutionary restricted to the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These examples highlight the value of our lethality screen beyond benchmarking our technology. To further characterize genes of interest sgRNA lines can then be used for tissue-specific mutagenesis, where genes performing similar cellular functions often give rise to phenotypes with high similarity. To demonstrate this application, we crossed several lines targeting genes associated with <italic>dpp</italic>/TGFb signalling with <italic>nub-Gal4 UAS-u<sup>M</sup>Cas9</italic> flies, which drive CRISPR mutagenesis in selected tissues, including cells giving rise to the adult wing. All these lines result in lethality in combination with a ubiquitous CRISPR system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), but gave rise to viable adults in combination with <italic>nub-Gal4 UAS-u<sup>M</sup>Cas9</italic>, highlighting again the tight control of mutagenesis. Moreover, all lines resulted in offspring that had wings of abnormal size and morphology and faithfully recapitulated the known phenotypes of loss-of function mutations of their target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together these results show that lines of the HD_CFD library can be used for systematic CRISPR screens <italic>in vivo</italic> and mediate relevant phenotypes with very high penetrance and specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present a large-scale collection of transgenic sgRNA strains for conditional CRISPR mutagenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In combination with the associated toolbox of novel Cas9 constructs, the sgRNA lines mediate efficient mutagenesis with precise temporal and spatial control. This allows the rapid targeted disruption of genes in various contexts in the intact organism. The high performance of this resource relies on a) use of conditional sgRNA constructs to achieve strong dependency of CRISPR mutagenesis on Gal4, b) tunable Cas9 expression to achieve high on-target activity with low toxicity, c) the use of two sgRNAs targeting independent positions in the same gene to increase the fraction of cells that harbor non-functional mutations in both alleles. We validate our library by conducting a fully transgenic CRISPR mutagenesis screen, to our knowledge the so far largest in any multicellular animal, which revealed 259 putative essential genes, of which 56 are poorly characterized.</p><p>To date RNAi is the most commonly used method to disrupt gene expression in defined cell types or developmental stages in vivo. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, transgenic RNAi libraries that cover most protein coding genes have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heigwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>). However, a significant number of these lines do not mediate efficient gene knock-down and the majority reduces mRNA levels by less than 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>). Residual gene expression can therefore mask phenotypes in RNAi experiments, which loss-of function alleles induced by CRISPR mutagenesis might reveal. In support of this notion three recent studies demonstrate that CRISPR mutagenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> can cause phenotypes that are significantly more penetrant than RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meltzer et al., 2019</xref>) or are missed altogether in RNAi experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delventhal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schlichting et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, our molecular analysis of mutations induced by the CRISPR library described here, as well as the phenotypes arising from them, suggest that the fraction of lines that produce no or only insufficient on-target mutations is less than 10%, which compares favorably to current <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi libraries. Together these observations strongly suggest that screening biological processes of interest by conditional CRISPR mutagenesis can reveal novel gene functions that have so far been missed in RNAi based experiments.</p><p>For conditional CRISPR mutagenesis to be broadly applicable, it needs to be effective in a wide range of tissues and cell types. We show here that our system works effectively in a number of important tissues in the fly, such as imaginal discs, the adult midgut and the germline. Furthermore, others have shown that CRISPR with transgenic components is also effective in postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delventhal et al., 2019</xref>) or in cells of the prothoracic gland, which are endoreplicating and contain multiple copies of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, our finding that sequencing of PCR amplicons generated from genomic DNA of entire flies frequently indicates mutations in over 90% of the amplicons suggests that CRISPR is effective in most cells of the animal.</p><p>In parallel to the CRISPR library described here, the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) in Japan, the Transgenic RNAi Project (TRIP) at Harvard University and the Schuldiner group at the Weizmann Institute are generating collections of transgenic sgRNA lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meltzer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zirin et al., 2020</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/">https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/</ext-link>). These projects follow different strategies to prioritise target genes and hence the overlap between different collections is currently limited. Furthermore, there exist significant differences in design between these resources and the library described here. First, the NIG and the majority of TRIP and Weizmann libraries encode a single sgRNAs per transgene, while all HD_CFD lines encode two sgRNAs. Co-expression of more than one sgRNA against the same target leads to more penetrant phenotypes and reduces the number of inactive lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the HD_CFD sgRNAs are encoded in <italic>pCFD6</italic> or <italic>pCFD6.FRT</italic>, which are conditional UAS vectors, while all other libraries so far used plasmids expressing sgRNAs from ubiquitous U6 promoters. We have previously shown that expression of U6-sgRNA in combination with UAS-Cas9 alone is not sufficient to efficiently restrict mutagenesis to Gal4 expressing cells and that expression of sgRNAs from a UAS vector, such as <italic>pCFD6,</italic> results in a significant improvement in spatial and temporal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>). The use of transgenes of the UAS-uCas9 series can reduce, but not prevent, unwanted mutagenesis in combination with U6-sgRNAs, as leaky (i.e. Gal4 independent) Cas9 expression is reduced in the presence of a uORF. An advantage of U6-sgRNA vectors is the consistent high sgRNA expression, whereas the level of sgRNAs expressed from UAS promoters depends on the strength of the Gal4 line and can become limiting with weak Gal4 drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meltzer et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, <italic>pCFD6.FRT</italic> can alleviate this problem, as users can easily swap the UAS promoter for a U6:3 promoter in cases where high sgRNA expression is a higher priority than tight conditional mutagenesis. The different sgRNA libraries that are currently being developed are therefore complementary resources for CRISPR mutagenesis. Large-scale screens in different contexts using lines from different libraries will be informative about the optimal use of each resource.</p><p>Two decades after the publication of the genome sequence of humans, mice, flies, worms and many other organisms, the functional annotation of these genomes are still far from complete. CRISPR-Cas genome editing is accelerating the rate at which new gene functions are described. The resources described here will facilitate context-dependent functional genomics in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. New insights into the function of the fly genome will inform the functional annotation of the human genome, reveal conserved principles of metazoan biology and suggest control strategies for insect disease vectors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>PCRs were performed with the Q5 Hot-start 2x master mix (New England Biolabs (NEB)) and cloning was performed using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio) or restriction/ligation dependent cloning.

CLD excludes sgRNA sequences that have predicted off-target sites elsewhere in the genome. The resulting pool of sequences was further filtered according to additional criteria. Specifically, sequences with BbsI and BsaI restriction sites were excluded. In addition, sequences containing stretches of 4 or more identical nucleotides were removed from the pool. Two pairs of sgRNAs targeting each gene were then selected using a random sampling approach. For each gene, up to 10,000 pairs of sgRNA sequences were selected at random from the pool of available sequences. Each sequence pair was then evaluated according to a custom scoring function. In order to preferentially select sgRNA pairs that target constitutive exons, the scoring function awarded bonus points for each transcript targeted by either of the sgRNAs. Bonus points were further given to sgRNAs targeting the first half of the gene and small distances to the gene’s transcription start site were awarded additionally. To avoid selecting pairs of overlapping sgRNAs that could potentially interfere with each other’s activity, sgRNA pairs that were less than 75 bp apart from each other were strongly penalized. Further, sgRNAs targeting the gene within 500 bp of each other were penalized. This was done to avoid functional protein products in cases where the second sgRNA might correct an out-of-frame mutation introduced by the first sgRNA. Finally, we penalized sgRNA with predicted off-target effects according to CLD.

Each oligonucleotide contained two sgRNA protospacer sequences targeting the same gene separated by a BsaI restriction cassette. Furthermore, oligos contained sequences at either end for PCR amplification and BbsI sites at the 5’ end of the first and 3’ end of the second protospacer. An annotated example oligo is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

In cases where this was not possible, for example due to the presence of a large intron between the target sites, each site was analysed on a separate PCR amplicon. To account for deletions in these cases additional PCR reactions containing the distal fwd and rev primers were included.

the tools to determine when and where genes, particularly essential genes, are functioning in vivo.

For example, one might imagine that the mutation frequency at a given target site could vary between cell types or states depending on, for example, chromatin accessibility or differences in the expression of DNA repair enzymes. Systematic studies of such effects within an organism are currently lacking in any system and it will be important to perform such studies in the future. Another aspect is that the same mutation frequency will have different practical consequences in different assays. For example, a sgRNA lines with relatively low efficiency might cause bi-allelic gene disruption in only a small fraction of cells and this might not cause detectable phenotypes in one assay (e.g. viability), but easily detectable phenotypes in another (e.g. morphology of the appendages). We therefore believe that the false-positive and false-negative rate in conditional CRISPR experiments is likely going to be context dependent and are looking forward to more scientists adopting this technology and sharing their experience. Within this study we have tested conditional CRISPR mutagenesis in a range of different tissues (Figure 1) and have now added a paragraph in the Discussion highlighting work from other labs showing that is also works in postmitotic and endoreplicating cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
