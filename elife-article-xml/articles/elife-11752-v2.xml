splicing variations remains a challenge. Here, we propose a new approach to define and quantify mRNA splicing in units of local splicing variations (LSVs). LSVs capture previously defined types of alternative splicing as well as more complex transcript variations. Building the first genome wide map of LSVs from twelve mouse tissues, we find complex LSVs constitute over 30% of tissue dependent transcript variations and affect specific protein families. We show the prevalence of complex LSVs is conserved in humans and identify hundreds of LSVs that are specific to brain subregions or altered in Alzheimer's patients. Amongst those are novel isoforms in the Camk2 family and a novel poison exon in Ptbp1, a key splice factor in neurogenesis. We anticipate the approach presented here will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype, and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11752.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11752.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11752.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes contain coded instructions to build other molecules that are collectively referred to as gene products. Building these products requires the gene’s instructions to be copied into a molecule of RNA in a process called transcription. Over 90% of human genes undergo a process by which different segments of the transcribed RNA molecule are either removed or retained. This process, termed alternative splicing, results in a single gene encoding different gene products that can perform in different ways.</p><p>Alternative splicing can also mean that gene products vary between different cells, tissues and individuals. Some of these variations can be harmful and lead to disease. However, it is difficult with current methods to accurately identify variations in gene products that are due to alternative splicing and see how these products differ between groups of people, such as patients and healthy controls.</p><p>Vaquero-Garcia, Barrera, Gazzara et al. have now developed new methods to define, measure and visualize the variations in RNA gene products. First, splicing variations were catalogued across a range of species from lizards to humans, which revealed that some fairly complicated variations were much more common than previously appreciated. These complex variations had not been studied much before, but the new methods showed that they make up a third of the variations in the RNA products copied from human genes.</p><p>Vaquero-Garcia, Barrera, Gazzara et al. then showed that the new methods are more accurate and sensitive than previous methods, and can be used to discover splicing variations that were previously unknown. For example, applying the new methods to data collected in other studies revealed variations in genes that are important for brain development and activity. Further analysis then showed that these variations were also altered in brain samples from patients with Alzheimer disease.</p><p>The new methods developed by Vaquero-Garcia, Barrera, Gazzara et al. can now shed new light on gene product variations, especially the more complex ones that have not been studied before. The next challenge is to use these tools to better understand the regulation and purpose of splicing variants and how they can contribute to diseases in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11752.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11752.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>transcriptomic</kwd><kwd>alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>camk2</kwd><kwd>ptb1</kwd><kwd>statistical modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG046544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barash</surname><given-names>Yoseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>Kristen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Penn Medicine Neuroscience Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barash</surname><given-names>Yoseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New methods reveal that complex local splicing variations are more prevalent in animals than previously appreciated, and demonstrate that local splicing variations are relevant for studies of development, gene regulation and neurodegenerative diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Production of distinct mRNA isoforms from the same locus has been shown to be common phenomena across metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>). Different isoforms may arise through the use of alternative transcription start and end sites, or through alternative processing of pre-mRNA. A key process is alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA, where different subsets of pre-mRNA segments are removed while others are joined, or spliced together. The resulting differences between the mature mRNA isoforms can, in turn, encode different protein products, or affect mRNA stability, localization, and translation. Over 95% of human multiexon genes undergo AS, and disease associated genetic variants have been shown to frequently lead to splicing defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). These observations emphasize the need to accurately map and quantify splice variations.</p><p>RNA-Seq technology has advanced the detection and quantitation of splice variants by producing millions of short sequence reads derived from the transcriptome. Despite constant technological advancement, the combination of limited coverage depth, experimental biases, and reads spanning only a small fraction of the variable parts of transcripts has left accurate mapping of transcriptome variations an open challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamancos et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptome variations have been traditionally studied either at the level of full gene isoforms or through the specification of alternative splicing 'events'. The latter have been categorized into several common types, such as intron retention, alternative 3’/5’ splice sites, or cassette exons. Importantly, while exact isoforms and their quantifications cannot be directly inferred from the short RNA-Seq reads, AS events can be detected via reads that span across spliced exons (junction reads). Both AS events and full isoforms can be captured by a gene schematic or a splice graph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heber et al., 2002</xref>), where edges (lines) connect pre-mRNA segments spliced together in different transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11752.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LSV formulation and prevalence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LSVs can be represented as splice graph splits from a single source exon (yellow) or into a single target exon (pink).

Specifically, AS types represent spliceosome decisions as strictly binary, involving only two exons or two splice sites in the same exon. The bottom panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates a few possible splicing variations that do not fit the previously defined AS types and can involve more than two alternative junctions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> serves as a visual summary for both the potential and challenges in analyzing splicing variations. Combining known transcripts and RNA-Seq data results in the <italic>Camk2g</italic> splice graph shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). This splice graph includes novel, unannotated, splice junctions detected from junction spanning RNA-Seq reads (green), as well as a complex case where exon 14 can be spliced to exons 15, 16, or 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle). Quantification by RT-PCR in several mouse tissues validate the existence of these variations and also points to isoforms that are predominantly produced in brain subregions and in muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom). In order to achieve such results we need to have a computational framework that efficiently combines RNA-Seq with existing gene annotation and enables us to accurately detect, quantify, and visualize diverse splicing variations across different experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formulation of local splicing variations (LSVs)</title><p>To address the shortcomings of previously defined AS types we suggest the formulation of local splicing variations, or LSVs. LSVs are defined and easily visualized as splits (multiple edges) in a splice graph where several edges either come into or from a single exon, termed the reference exon. A Single Source (SS) LSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, yellow) corresponds to a reference exon spliced to several downstream RNA segments while single target (ST) LSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, pink) corresponds to a reference exon spliced to upstream segments. The full specification of an LSV also includes the relative location of the exons and junctions (see Material and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates how this formulation captures previously defined AS types (top panel) as well as more complex cases (bottom panel). Specifically, previously defined 'classical' AS events appear as special cases of binary graph splits (e.g., include or skip a cassette exon), while LSVs capture non-classical binary splits and splits involving more than two junctions. Such non-binary splits are termed complex LSVs. LSVs can also involve intron retention (intronic LSVs) or be comprised of only exons (exonic LSVs). Moreover, the transcriptome variability captured by LSVs may be the result of not only spliceosome decisions but also of alternative transcription start or end positions. For example, the gene in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom panel involves two alternative first exons so a relative change in the transcription start site usage can result in changes in downstream LSVs quantification. Importantly, LSV formulation allows the probing of transcriptome structure and complexity yet, unlike full transcripts, can still be quantified directly from junction spanning reads.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LSV detection, quantification and visualization using MAJIQ</title><p>In order to address the challenges involved in detection, quantification and visualization of LSVs we developed a new computational framework that we have termed Modeling Alternative Junction Inclusion Quantification (MAJIQ). MAJIQ’s first step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top) is to parse a known database of transcripts, given as a GFF3 annotation file, along with a set of mapped and aligned RNA-Seq experiments (indexed BAM files). Unlike many methods that only analyze known isoforms, MAJIQ supplements known transcripts with 'reliable' edges derived from <italic>de novo</italic> junction spanning reads. Several filters can be applied to define which edges are considered reliable and which LSVs have enough reads to be later quantified (see Material and methods). Similarly, LSVs whose edges are a subset of other LSVs, such as those denoted with dashed rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, are removed to avoid redundancy (see Material and methods). Next, MAJIQ can be executed to quantify LSVs either in a specific condition or to compare two experimental conditions, with or without replicates. LSV quantification in a specific condition is based on the marginal <underline>p</underline>ercent <underline>s</underline>elected <underline>i</underline>ndex (PSI, denoted Ψ) for each junction involved in the LSV, while comparison of experimental conditions is based on relative changes in PSI (dPSI, ΔΨ). MAJIQ uses a combination of read rate modeling, Bayesian Ψ modeling, and bootstrapping to report posterior Ψ and ΔΨ distributions for each quantified LSV. The results of MAJIQ’s LSV detection and quantification can be interactively visualized with the package VOILA in a standard web browser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> bottom).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11752.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>LSV analysis using MAJIQ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MAJIQ’s analysis pipeline.

These experiments included two mouse tissues (cerebellum and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>]), and a human Jurkat T cell line (unstimulated and stimulated, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2015</xref>]). While accuracy depended on the dataset used, MAJIQ achieved an overall correlation of R = 0.8 and R = 0.95 for PSI and dPSI quantification by RT-PCR, comparing favorably to alternative methods on all datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we used biological replicates from the Mouse Genome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keane et al., 2011</xref>) to assess reproducibility of differential splicing detection from RNA-Seq when comparing two experimental conditions. The reproducibility ratio (RR, see Material and methods) captures the fraction of top ranked differentially spliced LSVs that maintain their top ranking when analyzing another set of replicate experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows MAJIQ compares favorably to other methods, including MISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2010</xref>), rMATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2014</xref>), and a bootstrapping approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>) adopted for LSV. While MISO and rMATS achieved a reproducibility ratio of 61–67% we found the bootstrapping approach (N.B.) suffered from particularly high variance, which degraded reproducibility of LSVs ranking. In comparison, MAJIQ achieved a mean RR=77% when comparing two pairs of experiments and improving to RR=86% when the experiments compared had replicates. Notably, detection power was also improved. Defining differentially spliced LSVs as those for which P(|ΔΨ|&gt;0.2) &gt; 0.95, the number of detected LSVs (N), after removing LSVs overlap (see Materials and methods), was on average 400 for pairwise and 447 for group comparisons, compared to 240 and 260 respectively by rMATS. The improvement in both detection and reproducibility of differentially spliced LSVs (N, RR) was robust to the statistical threshold used to define <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and when we removed MAJIQ’s de-novo junction detection the number of LSVs dropped as expected but reproducibility remained high (N = 337, RR= 87%, data not shown). Importantly, this result also indicated that including de-novo junctions increased the number of differentially spliced LSVs that could be detected by over 30% (337 vs. 447), while retaining equivalent reproducibility. Defining differential splicing reproducibility by RT-PCR as LSVs for which |ΔΨ<sup>RT</sup>|&gt;20% resulted in 95% reproducibility. The higher reproducibility by RT-PCR can be expected given the lower experimental variability compared to RNA-Seq. Notably, the LSVs tested by RT-PCR were selected to cover a wide spectrum of read depth. We found that while higher coverage allowed more differential LSVs to be detected and steadily increased reproducibility by RNA-Seq, MAJIQ’s reproducibility by RT-PCR was stable across read coverage depth, pointing to the robustness of the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, we note that the above RT-PCR evaluation concentrated on binary LSVs to allow comparison to currently available methods, but we observed similar accuracy for the quantification of complex LSVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Complex LSV are prevalent in diverse metazoa</title><p>To assess the significance of LSVs formulation we estimated LSVs prevalence in several metazoans, ranging from lizard to human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Naturally, this analysis is affected by how well a species transcriptome is annotated, and how permissive the database used is. In human for example, complex LSVs constitute 20.6% to 33.7% of the LSVs in annotated transcripts by RefSeq and Ensembl respectively, but only 1.86% in opossum’s Ensembl annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Next, we expanded the set of annotated transcripts with novel junctions detected from RNA-Seq junction spanning reads. Limiting our analysis to only 5–6 similar tissues in all species and conservative junction detection still increased the total number of LSVs in human by 11% and the fraction of complex LSVs from 33.7% to 37.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In species not as well annotated the effect of adding RNA-Seq data was more dramatic, jumping in opossum for example from 1,610 to 10,228 LSVs, of which 10% were complex. In summary, while LSV analysis across species was confounded by read coverage and transcriptome annotation we find that non-classical and complex LSVs make up a substantial fraction of observed transcriptome variations. Such complex LSVs are likely to be removed, undetected, or mislabeled by algorithms that only quantify binary AS events from previously annotated transcripts.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11752.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>LSV prevalence across diverse metazoans.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Number of LSVs (top) and fraction of complex LSVs (bottom) when using Ensembl annotated transcripts only (grey) or combining it with RNA-Seq from 5–6 similar tissues (red).

This allowed us to analyze 12 tissues with an average of over 120M reads per sample, produced by a single lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This data included three brain subregions, eight samples per tissue, and matching RNA for RT-PCR validations, leading to a total of 100,512 LSVs detected. First, we used this data to assess the usage of LSVs across tissues. In order to minimize LSVs that result from false junctions identified by the mapper we only included junctions with multiple uniquely mapped staggered reads across multiple biological replicates (see Material and methods). Next, we tested the maximal inclusion level of the second, third, or the least used junction in an LSV across twelve mouse tissues. We detected a switch behavior where a different junction becomes dominant at 50% inclusion or more in approximately 5% of the classical binary LSVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, grey), compared to 12% for the second most used junction in complex LSVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, light green). Setting a conservative threshold of Ψ &gt; 10% to denote splice junctions that are less likely to be splicing noise or database errors we find that for the classical binary LSVs approximately 32%, or 9,516 pass that threshold, compared to 57% and 19% of the complex LSVs that pass that threshold for the second and third most used junction respectively. These correspond to a total of 6,338 and 2,112 LSVs in our datasets, pointing to the importance of complex LSVs in transcriptome analysis. Even when testing for the least used junction in complex LSVs (e.g. the ninth in a nine junction LSV), we still find almost 10% pass the 10% inclusion threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, dark green). Finally, for intronic LSVs we find almost 11,000 cases where an intron is retained at least 50% in one tissue, and 3,844 cases where the intron is almost always retained with Ψ &gt; 99% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Gene splice graphs can also be thought of as networks with exons as nodes and spliced junctions as edges. In this interpretation, LSVs can be thought of as small network motifs and used to shed light on the transcriptome complexity and commonly reoccurring sub-structure. Comparing the frequency of exonic LSV types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) we find that the more common non classical LSVs involve 3 to 5 exons, combine exon skipping with an alternative 3’/5’ splice site, or involve alternative transcript start/end at the LSV’s reference exon. In contrast, intronic LSVs are much less diverse, with classical intron retention making 68% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows that for exonic LSVs 14% involve more than 2 exons, 30% of the single source and 20% and of the single target LSVs involve a reference exon with two or more 5’/3’ splice sites, respectively. Overall, complex (non-binary) LSVs comprise 36.2% of the transcriptome variations detected in the data and 27.5% of the variations deemed quantifiable (see Materials and methods), yet spliceosome decisions still appear localized, with few LSVs involving more than 6 exons or junctions. When analyzing LSVs usage, we found that the biochemical 'proximity rule', by which the splice site nearest to the reference exon is preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reed and Maniatis, 1986</xref>), is commonly not reflected at the genomic level. Defining 'dominant' junctions as those included at least 60%, we found proximal junctions appear dominant in approximately two thirds of the cases involving binary LSVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) while more complex LSV tend to have more evenly distributed inclusion levels with no dominant junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left bars).

Brain regions have a higher average of 927 (Cerebellum) to 840 (brainstem) changing LSVs compared to non-brain tissues. The number of LSVs changing between brain subregions varies between 36% and 57% of those changing between CNS and non-CNS tissues, with hypothalamus standing out as more similar to the two other CNS tissues (average of 937 and 343 changing LSVs when compared to non brain and other brain sub-regions, respectively).

Inline with previous reports, we found tissue regulated splicing involves significantly higher conservation in the intron proximal to the variable exonic segments, a region known to include <italic>cis</italic> elements to which tissue specific splice factors bind. However, we also found that differentially spliced complex LSVs exhibited significantly higher conservation levels in these regions compared to their binary counterparts. This finding may be the result of the more complex splicing changes that need to be controlled or tighter control associated with complex LSVs specific function. In summary, these different lines of evidence all support the functional relevance and utility of accurately mapping and quantifying complex splicing variations in genome wide studies.</p><p>The observed evolutionary pressure to conserve intronic segments around tissue dependent LSV raises the questions what are the functional consequences of LSVs and whether complex LSVs are functionally distinct from classical binary ones. To probe possible function we mapped exons in LSVs into their matching protein domains (see Material and methods). We then grouped LSV junctions based on whether they were part of binary or complex LSVs and whether they were differentially included across tissues. In line with previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>), we find that binary LSVs, such as cassette exons, which are also differentially included across tissues, more frequently affect low-complexity, disordered regions when compared to non-changing binary LSVs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;1x10<sup>-4</sup>, corrected Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly, differentially included complex LSVs are similarly enriched for such low-complexity regions (<italic>p&lt;1</italic>x10<sup>-4</sup>), but also show enrichment for specific protein families (<italic>e.g.</italic> spectrin/filamin) and domains (e.g. RNA recognition motifs) when compared to non-changing complex LSVs. These families and domains are largely distinct from those enriched in binary LSVs (e.g. WW domains or coiled coils). The complete list of enriched protein features can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Overall, this analysis suggests that regulated alternative splicing of both binary and complex LSVs can affect protein interactions via unstructured protein regions, or affect the inclusion of distinct protein domains in specific families.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MAJIQ detects a novel, brain-specific, PTC-introducing, developmentally- regulated exon in <italic>Ptbp1</italic></title><p>To further demonstrate the power of MAJIQ and our LSV based approach we validated a set of complex LSVs that exhibit tissue and brain region dependent splicing patterns.

These include near 100% skipping of exons 21 through 23 in all non brain or muscle tissues (known in the literature as isoform C or Camk2δC, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2005</xref>)), high relative inclusion of NLS containing exon 21 in heart (isoform B or Camk2δB), and high levels of isoform A (Camk2δA), which includes exons 22 and 23, in the brain regions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This result is consistent with previous reports of <italic>Camk2d</italic> splicing patterns and isoform A being neuronal-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly though, MAJIQ also detects isolated inclusion of exon 23 in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, green junction), which is supported by both the RT-PCR experiment and analysis of an independent dataset across heart development (see below). Previous studies focused on splicing regulation of <italic>Camk2d</italic> in the heart used junction spanning primers that preclude detection of this highly utilized splicing choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ye et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because CAMK2 has been implicated in neurodevelopment and is proposed to be critical for postnatal heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2005</xref>), we next looked for developmental changes in LSVs by analyzing RNA-seq data derived from mouse cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yan et al., 2015</xref>) and hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>) at different time points. In the brain there is a switch in the splicing of <italic>Camk2d</italic> between the C and the A isoforms, reaching over 80% use of the A isoform by postnatal day 15, corresponding to a time of intense synaptogenesis and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, top). In the heart we see a more modest decrease in isoform C and increase in exon 23 only during postnatal heart development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom, compare purple with green), consistent with results from RT-PCR from eight week old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Finally, we validated that the observed CAMK2 splicing changes in AD brains can be reproduced in a second independent study. We used data from the AMP-AD Target Discovery Consortium (doi:10.7303/syn2580853) involving a larger cohort of 157 samples from AD patient’s brains and 128 control samples, across three different brain sub regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Overall, we detected approximately 200 LSVs that are reproducibly differentially spliced between AD and normal brains (see Methods) and enriched in GO terms such as cytoskeleton, GTPase regulator activity, and synapse organization (data not shown). This set constitutes approximately 12% of the changing LSVs detected in the original dataset, a fraction that grows to 21% but only 164 LSVs if stricter filtering is applied to both datasets (data not shown). This relatively low percentage of reproducible changes across the two datasets can be at least partially attributed to the small number of samples in the original study combined with an average of 1.8 fold lower coverage in the second, larger dataset. Notably though, among the reproducible set of differentially spliced LSVs 79 are complex, a significant, 1.2-fold enrichment compared to their relative proportion among all LSVs detected (p=0.04, binomial test). While the validation and experimental follow up on these LSVs is beyond the scope of this paper these results and the related CAMK2 analysis demonstrate the usefulness of our combined approach for LSV detection, quantification, and visualization for disease studies.</p><p>Overall, our analysis of CAMK2 is in line with previous studies but also detects additional isoforms and exons that are conserved, developmentally regulated, and dysregulated in AD, making for a more accurate picture of CAMK2 splicing patterns. Additional complex LSVs we validated and analyzed include brain specific isoforms of the kinesin light chain <italic>Klc1</italic>, recently shown to be an amyloid-beta accumulation modifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morihara et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>); the clathrin light chain <italic>Clta</italic>, which displays developmental dynamics and dysregulation in both Alzheimer's disease cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>); and the translation initiation factor scaffold <italic>Eif4g3,</italic> which has high inclusion of a cassette microexon specifically in cerebellum and a novel, muscle-specific exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The work presented here spans a wide spectrum of topics from a new formulation of transcriptome variations in units of local splicing variations (LSVs); through algorithms for detecting, quantification and visualization of LSVs; a genome wide map of LSVs; analysis of the prevalence and functional significance of complex LSVs; to validation of several complex LSVs that affect protein domains in developmentally regulated genes with key roles in neurogenesis or other brain functions. For the latter, we also demonstrated dysregulation in Alzheimer’s disease using two independent datasets.</p><p>The new formulation of LSVs sheds light on what has thus far been mostly a 'dark side' of the transcriptome and RNA-Seq based studies, <italic>i.e.</italic> complex splicing variations. Several previous works aimed to address the apparent representational gap between full transcripts and the classical binary AS events. For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagasaki et al., 2006</xref>) developed an efficient bit array representation for the various exonic segments that make up different gene isoforms, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sammeth et al., 2008</xref>) suggested an elaborate notational system that allowed them to catalogue all the splicing variations in a given transcriptome, comparing the frequencies of different AS types across 12 metazoa. More recently, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pervouchine et al., 2013</xref>) developed bam2ssj, a package implementing a general intron centric approach to estimate AS from RNA-Seq data that can capture non classical AS variations. bam2ssj gives a BAM-file–processing pipeline that counts junction reads to compute the ratio of inclusion levels either from the 5’ or the 3’ end of an intron, denoted <italic>Ψ<sub>5</sub></italic>and <italic>Ψ<sub>3</sub>.</italic>A different, graph based, approach was taken by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2013</xref>) where a splice graph is divided into subunits termed alternative splicing modules (ASMs). ASMs are hierarchically structured, each capturing all the possible paths along a splice graph between specific start (<italic>‘single entry’</italic>) and end (<italic>‘single exit’</italic>) points. The matching algorithm, DiffSplice, then aims to identify cases of differential transcription of ASMs between two experimental conditions. All of these works differ substantially in the formulation of splicing variation, the underlying algorithms, and visualization approach, yet all share the effort to capture non classical AS types. In comparison, MAJIQ offers a unique approach that spans formulation, detection, quantification and visualization of splicing variations. Unlike ASMs, LSVs can be inferred directly from junction spanning reads and result in quantitative PSI and dPSI estimates, while MAJIQ’s probabilistic model offers significant accuracy boost for PSI and dPSI estimates compared to alternative methods.</p><p>The importance of LSVs formulation is manifested in how common complex LSVs are in diverse metazoans, making up at least a third of observed LSVs in human and mouse. Complex LSVs are also enriched for regulated splicing when analyzing over thirty datasets across different tissues, developmental stages, splice factor knockdowns and neurodegenerative disease. In addition, LSV formulation can be used to investigate substructures of the transcriptome. We found that the biochemically-based proximity rule is commonly overcome at the genomic level and that complex LSVs are less likely to have a dominant splice junction. As for LSVs possible function, our results indicate that tissue dependent binary and complex LSVs both tend to occur in unstructured regions known to affect protein-protein interactions, as well as in specific yet distinct protein domains and families.</p><p>In order to benefit from the new LSV formulation matching software is needed. The software we developed, MAJIQ, is LSV focused and compares favorably with available tools on AS quantification based both on RNA-Seq from biological replicates and on a compendium of over 200 RT-PCR experiments. Unlike many tools, MAJIQ supplements annotated transcriptomes with novel splice junctions, while VOILA allows the resulting LSVs to be interactively visualized within standard web browsers. Thus, MAJIQ and VOILA offer a compelling LSV centered addition to tools such as MISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2010</xref>), rMATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) and cuffdiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>) that allow users to quantify whole isoforms relative abundance, alternative polyadenylation, or differential expression.</p><p>Immediate applications of the novel LSV framework and the MAJIQ software cover a wide spectrum. Examples include improved disease studies where transcriptome variations play a role, enhancing predictive models for splicing and for the effect of genetic variants, studying the regulatory underpinning of complex LSVs, and examining their evolutionary history. At the most basic level, our results illustrate the potential for novel discoveries in reanalyzing previously published data with the new LSV based methods. We anticipate the framework and resources provided here will form the basis of many additional new discoveries in diverse fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA-Seq read mapping</title><p>All RNA-Seq was mapped using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). STAR was run with alignSJoverhangMin 8. We created the STAR genome based on mm10 or hg19, with an in-house junction DB containing all possible junctions within each gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>LSV definition</title><p>An LSV (local splice variation) is defined as a split in a splice graph into or from a single exon, termed the reference exon. Single Source LSV (SS-LSV) correspond to splits from a reference exon to multiple 3’ splice sites in downstream exons, single target LSV (ST-LSV) correspond to multiple 5’ splice sites spliced to an upstream reference exon. The reference exon may include multiple 3’ splice sites (ST-LSV) or 5’ splice sites (SS-LSV). An LSV type is defined by the reference exon type (SS, ST) and the set of junctions it includes. Each junction is defined by the splice site ID in the reference exon, and the splice site ID in its target/source exon.</p><p>Under the above formulation some SS-LSV and ST-LSV may include exactly the same set of edges or one LSV may contain a subset of another LSV’s edges. For example the SS-LSV from exon 4 and the ST-LSV into exon 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom are comprised of exactly the same edges, while the ST-LSV into exon 2 is a subset of the SS-LSV from exon 1. Such cases are easily detected and removed from further analysis to avoid redundancy.</p><p>It is important to note that under the LSV formulation classical cassette exons correspond to two distinct LSVs, a single source and a single target. These LSVs are not redundant as they correspond to different lines of experimental evidence; one from junction reads connecting the alternative middle exon with the upstream exon (SS-LSV) and one connecting the middle exon to the downstream exon (ST-LSV). The separate quantification for such LSVs, combined with the joint visualization using VOILA (see below), help distinguish between cases where the two LSVs give similar PSI or dPSI quantifications and cases where they disagree. A case of possible disagreement is illustrated in the last three exons of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, where an alternative transcription start site and a third junction going into the last exon may lead to different PSI values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>LSV as structural network motifs</title><p>The above definition gives a one-to-one mapping between a local splice graph split and an LSV type. Given a set of LSVs we can compute a distribution over their types or group several types together to detect a distribution over specific LSV features. We note that unlike the analysis of network motifs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milo et al. (2002)</xref>, we do not compare LSVs to random connections in a network as the null hypothesis, but rather to a sequential network where all exons are connected via a single path. Thus, we compute a distribution over relevant statistics such as the number of junctions in the reference exon, the total number of junctions or the total number of exons in the LSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MAJIQ</title><p>MAJIQ is comprised of two main components, a builder and a quantifier. The builder analyzes a given set of RNA-Seq experiments and a transcriptome database to detect LSVs (either known or de-novo) and create a splice graph for each gene in the database. The quantifier subsequently estimates PSI or dPSI for LSVs detected by the builder.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>MAJIQ Builder</title><p>The builder accepts as input a list of RNA-Seq indexed BAM files and a transcriptome database. For each gene defined in the database it determines all its known exons, associated 3’/5’ splice sites, and the splice graph edges (i.e. splice sites spliced together). It then scans the BAM files to find which of those edges are supported by RNA-Seq reads, and which de-novo splice sites and edges should be added based on junction reads. A user-controlled filter defines which edge is considered 'reliable' to be included in the splice graph. The default is set to “appears in the database or has at least two reads from two different positions”. In order to create the splice graph, MAJIQ combines the known transcriptome with the reliable de-novo junctions. If de-novo 3’ or 5’ splice sites are found outside the boundaries of any annotated exons, they are connected to the proximal upstream or downstream exon, respectively. If such a de-novo 3’ splice site is followed by a de-novo 5’ splice site then the area in between is denoted as a putative de-novo exon. However, de-novo exonic regions added to the splice graph are not allowed to exceed a user-defined threshold. The default threshold is set to 500bp, which corresponds to approximately the 95 percentile of known exons length in the mouse genome. In cases where a de-novo exonic extension might have exceeded this threshold it is instead used to create an 'open ended' putative de-novo exonic region with its boundaries marked accordingly. All the de-novo junctions and exonic regions are marked in green in VOILA’s output (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, for retained introns, an additional filter is added for the average coverage in consecutive windows across the intron. The default is set to 1.5 (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) but it is important to adjust this threshold depending on the coverage depth and how permissive one wants to be when calling retained introns.</p><p>In the next step, the builder creates a list of LSVs that are considered to 'exist in the data' based on a second user defined filter. The default for this filter is 'all the LSV junctions are reliable and at least one junction has at least two reads from at least two positions'. Intuitively this setting retains only LSVs for which there is evidence for expression of at least some gene isoforms involved in that LSV though not all edges involved in the LSV will necessarily be found in the data. The MAJIQ Builder outputs two types of binary files, the first including the LSVs to be quantified by the MAJIQ quantifier, the second including the splice graphs to be visualized by VOILA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>MAJIQ quantifier</title><p>The quantifier estimates the fraction each LSV junction is selected, denoted <underline>p</underline>ercent <underline>s</underline>elected <underline>i</underline>ndex (PSI or Ψ), or the changes in each junction’s PSI between two experimental conditions with or without replicates (dPSI or ∆Ψ). These fractions are inferred from short sequence reads that span across junctions (junction reads), whose distribution can be affected by many factors. Consequently, MAJIQ quantifies PSI and dPSI not as a point estimate but as a posterior distribution over possible fractions in the range [0,1]. Importantly, the quantifier screens the builder’s list of LSVs for those that are deemed 'quantifiable' by a user-defined filter. Intuitively, the sparsity of RNA-Seq data results in many LSVs being reliably detected by RNA-Seq yet lacking sufficient read coverage to accurately quantify PSI or to confidently infer significant changes in PSI across conditions. By filtering those from downstream analysis by the quantifier significant computational resources can be saved. The default for the quantifiable filter is at least 10 reads from at least 3 positions.</p><p>The first step in MAJIQ’s quantification is estimating the read rate per position in each junction, after correcting for GC content bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Risso et al., 2011</xref>). Note that here the position’s read rate corresponds to reads that start/end at that position, not reads that overlap it. The estimation of each junction’s read rate involves three components: A global parametric model per experiment for read count variability; a stack removal procedure; and a local estimator for read rate derived from bootstrapping over each junction’s relevant positions. For the global parametric model MAJIQ uses the zero truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) distribution. The dispersion parameter <italic>r<sub>t</sub></italic> is optimized per experiment <italic>t</italic> by bootstrapping over non-zero positions in a randomly selected set of up to 10,000 quantifiable junctions. Next, given the derived negative binomial model with dispersion <italic>r</italic>, MAJIQ performs a screening step to detect possible read stacks. A read stack is defined as a position i in junction j with an observed read rate x<sub>j,i</sub> which is highly unlikely given <italic>r</italic> and the average read rate in other non zero positions in the junction. After experimentation with the effect on reproducibility, a conservative threshold of p-val ≤ 10<sup>−7</sup> was set as the default to flag possible read stacks. Flagged positions and their respective reads are then removed from further consideration. Finally, we noticed that even after fitting a global dispersion parameter per experiment <italic>r<sub>t</sub></italic> and discarding read stacks the data still exhibits variability not fully accounted for by this model (data not shown). Therefore, and in order to account for local dispersion (i.e. at a specific junction) we bootstrap N positions from the relevant set of positions to get an estimate for the read rate in junction <italic>j</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msup><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo/><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo/></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the observed number of reads that start in the <italic>i<sub>n</sub></italic> sampled position and <italic>W<sub>j</sub></italic> is the number of relevant positions in junction <italic>j</italic>.

These M samples are then used for computing posterior distributions over PSI and ∆PSI.</p><p>Estimating the percent selected index (PSI, or Ψ) per junction <italic>j</italic> in a given LSV <italic>e</italic> in experiment <italic>t</italic> requires to derive a posterior distribution over multinomial distributions <italic>Ψ<sub>e</sub> = {Ψ<sub>e,j</sub>}<sup>J</sup></italic>, s.t. <italic>∑ Ψ<sub>e,j</sub> = 1, ∀e,j 0 ≤ Ψ<sub>e,j</sub> ≤ 1.</italic> Previous works concentrated on common cases involving two junctions such as cassette exons, where the posterior for Ψ can be computed in closed form using for example a Beta prior. For more complex cases where J &gt; 2 the PSI posterior was commonly computed either as a point estimate (e.g., ML estimator using EM) or using MCMC sampling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2010</xref>). In general, sampling based estimation for <italic>Ψ<sub>e,j</sub></italic> or <italic>∆Ψ<sub>e,j</sub></italic> (below) scales exponentially in the number of junctions J and is also hard to visualize beyond <italic>J = 2</italic>. However, noting that in most cases researchers are interested in relative abundance of specific variants rather than a complete distribution over all isoforms, MAJIQ side steps these issues by computing only the posterior marginal distributions per variant. This computation scales linearly with <italic>J</italic> and simplifies both downstream analysis and visualization of the results. It has been previously observed that alternative junctions in a given experimental condition generally tend to be either highly included or highly excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). In line with these observations and based on fitting empirical distributions of observed PSI (data not shown) MAJIQ uses the following prior: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>.

MAJIQ then uses the M read samples per junction (see above) to get a posterior <italic>Ψ<sub>e,j</sub></italic> as an average over those posterior distributions.</p><p>PSI and ∆PSI are modeled as continuous random variables confined to the intervals [0, 1] and [−1, 1] respectively. In practice though, the required precision for these quantities is limited by both the problem being studied and the experimental techniques used to validate results (e.g., RT-PCR). This observation motivates MAJIQ’s discretized representation of possible PSI and ∆PSI. The discretization level, controlled by a tunable resolution parameter V, allows explicit tradeoff between accuracy and computation cost. Setting V = 40 (default) results in 2.5% PSI resolution. This discretization allows MAJIQ’s implementation to maintain and visualize a full distribution over PSI and ∆PSI, exploit efficient matrix operations for the entire range of <italic>Ψ </italic>values and avoid costly sampling procedures.</p><p>MAJIQ’s estimation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for LSV <italic>e</italic> between experiments <italic>t,t′</italic> is based on a joint prior <italic>P<sub>0</sub>(Ψ<sub>t</sub>,Ψ<sub>t′</sub>)</italic>.

First, MAJIQ Builder was executed to detect the union set of LSVs in a set of biological replicates of hippocampus and liver from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keane et al. (2011)</xref>. To avoid redundancy and enable comparison to other methods only a single junction from binary LSVs were included in downstream analysis. Next, for each replicate pair the difference in LSV quantification for each LSV was computed as R(Ψ<sup>MAJIQ</sup>) = E[Ψ<sub>r1</sub>]-E[Ψ<sub>r1</sub>]. LSVs that were only detected in one of the replicates were discarded. The same set of LSVs were fed into MISO using the MAJIQ Builder GFF3 output file and the same procedure was executed to compute R(Ψ<sup>MISO</sup>). This procedure was repeated 6 times to compute the mean and standard errors for the empirical R(Ψ) PDF shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. The empirical PDF and standard error for the difference in reproducibility ΔR = R<sup>MISO</sup>- R<sup>MAJIQ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> inset graph) were computed by a similar procedure.</p><p>PSI reproducibility by RT-PCR was evaluated using the following procedure. For the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al. (2014)</xref>, we first selected LSVs that were estimated by MAJIQ to be differentially spliced with high confidence (P( ΔΨ &gt;0.2) &gt; 0.95)) when using three samples from cerebellum and liver. This allowed us to also assess dPSI reproducibility for a wide range of dPSI values (see below). Next, for each LSV the total number of reads starting at positions within all the LSV’s junctions in each replicate were summed together for each tissue. Then, the LSVs were binned by the average total read coverage in the two tissues. Bins were defined to be: 10–30, 30–40, 40–80, 80–200, and above 200 reads. From each such bin, a set of LSVs was randomly selected for RT-PCR validation. Each RT-PCR was executed in triplicates (see below). Finally, the average PSI by RT-PCR and the expected PSI by either MAJIQ or MISO were used to produce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. MISO was executed with default parameters. For the stimulated and unstimulated T-Cell dataset, we collected a compendium of historical RT-PCR quantifications for previously annotated cassette exons. These experiments were executed by different Lynch lab members across several years and pre selected for specific studies regardless of dPSI or RNA-Seq coverage level. The vast majority of these cassette exons did not exhibit differential splicing between stimulated and unstimulated cells and some lacked triplicates. This set of previously annotated cassette exons was mapped to MAJIQ’s LVS and then quantified using RNA-Seq from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al.

First, the MAJIQ Builder was executed for all replicates of hippocampus and liver experiments from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keane et al.

Next, for each liver and hippocampus pair of experiments, all quantifiable LSVs were ranked according to their E[ΔΨ] and the set of <italic>N</italic> LSVs with significant splicing changes at high confidence was defined as LSVs for which P( ΔΨ &gt;0.2) &gt; 0.95. This threshold was selected to be conservative, but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> for more relaxed thresholds. This process was then repeated in another pair of experiments and the relative rank of the original set of N LSVs was recorded. The reproducibility ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of any ranked LSVs subset <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was defined as the fraction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>n*</italic> is the subset of the first n ranked LSVs that were in the N best ranked LSVs by the replicate experiments. Similar to the IRD statistic used to assess reproducibility of Chip-Seq peak calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>), a perfect RR(n) graph follows the diagonal line. Unlike IRD though, the RR statistic is invariant to small or even complete perturbations in the relative rank of the top ranked LSVs. Intuitively, this means that the RR will remain the same as long as the same subset <italic>n*</italic> makes the best <italic>N</italic> cutoff. It is important to note that the RR value can vary greatly, affected by biological, experimental, and technical factors. Nonetheless, one can use the RR to assess reproducibility in specific settings, or compare dPSI reproducibility by different algorithms under the same experimental setup.</p><p>An inherent challenge in comparing MAJIQ to other methods is that MAJIQ quantifies LSVs while other methods quantify the classical AS event types. One complication as a result of that is that while redundant LSVs are removed (see above) different LSVs may still partially overlap. A good example for that are cassette exons. In the LSV formulation a differentially included cassette exon may have two LSVs that support it, corresponding to different lines of experimental evidence (junction reads from the up and downstream exons) but other methods/tools will only count this exon as a single event. This in turn may bias both the reproducibility ratio (RR) and detection power (N) in favor of MAJIQ. In our experiments, when we ignored such possible overlap of LSVs the reproducibility ratio remained the same but the number of differentially spliced LSVs detected was significantly higher (RR=86%, N = 752, data not shown). In order to avoid such a bias in favor of MAJIQ we implemented a conservative approach where the ranked LSVs are filtered so that no LSV contained overlapping exons with another LSV. We note this is a conservative filter as there may be complex LSVs that involve multiple differentially spliced exons, or cases where the same exone involves different variations (<italic>e.g.</italic> skipping the exon but also alternative 3’ or 5’ splice sites). In such cases only a single LSV would pass that filter while the methods we compared to would still be able to retain separate AS events for those.</p><p>dPSI reproducibility for MISO was evaluated by the following procedure. First, we followed MISO’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2010</xref>) guidelines for performing exon-centeric analysis (i.e. AS events) rather than whole transcripts analysis. For this, we used the set of alternative events for the mm10 mouse genome provided by MISO. We indexed the GFF3 file and ran MISO with default parameters on the same data pairs of experiments described above to compute expected dPSI (E[ΔΨ<sup>MISO</sup>]). Finally, we ranked LSVs by decreasing expected dPSI and computed the reproducibility ratio (RR) as described above. As MISO does not supply a statistical criteria for selecting the number of events (N) from its ranked list, we used the number produced by rMATS. Changing N to the higher number of LSVs detected by MAJIQ degraded MISO’s performance (data not shown).</p><p>dPSI reproducibility for rMATS was evaluated by the following procedure. We ran rMATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) with replicates (groups) and without them (pairs), using ENSEMBL annotation file in GTF format. rMATS estimates differential expression for each one of the classic alternative splicing events it identifies from the annotation file (exon skipping, 5 and 3 prime splice site donor/acceptor, mutually exclusive exons and intron retention). We used the default parameters except for the cutoff employed to compute the FDR associated to each AS event quantification, which was set to 0.2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> for the impact in reproducibility of different cutoffs). Lastly, we extracted the RR for confident changing AS events identified by rMATS (FDR &lt; 0.05, P( ΔΨ &gt;0.2) as reported in the rMATS output file).</p><p>dPSI reproducibility for the Naive Bootstrapping approach used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al. (2015)</xref> for cassette exons was adopted for LSVs using the following procedure. First, we implemented the bootstrapping over junction positions described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al. (2015)</xref>, with the same beta prior to avoid zero read counts. These samples gave an empirical distribution over possible PSI values and these were subsequently used to estimate the expected PSI. Similar to MISO, the Naive Bootstrapping approach does not assume a joint prior so that the expected dPSI estimates are simply the difference in the expected PSI in each experiment. The resulting expected dPSI was then used to rank the LSVs, filter them for possible overlap of exons, and compute RR as described above.</p><p>dPSI accuracy by RT-PCR was evaluated by the same procedure as that described above for PSI. ΔΨ<sup>RT</sup> was then computed as the difference between the average of each triplicate set of experiments in cerebellum and liver or the difference between previously recorded measurements in the Lynch Lab for the stimulated vs. unstimulated T-Cells. dPSI reproducibility by RT-PCR was defined as cases for which ΔΨ<sup>RT</sup> &gt;20%. This definition allowed assessing false positives and false negatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein feature enrichment</title><p>In order to construct the LSV junctions and protein features (PF) table we first built the union set of LSVs detected from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al.

We used ENSEMBL RESTful services [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236461">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236461</ext-link>] to retrieve PF along with their genomic coordinates associated with transcripts containing LSVs. Next, we annotated each LSV junction by PF that overlap its reference exon and its target/source exon, discarding junctions in non-coding regions. Because the overlap of a LSV junction region and a protein feature can be partial, we considered a PF to be associated with a junction when there was at least a 20% overlap. Lastly, we labeled as changing junctions those that had an estimated delta psi greater than 20% in any two tissues.</p><p>We assessed relative enrichment of PFs using the following procedure when comparing groups of LSV junctions such as changing vs. unchanging, or binary vs. complex. For each PF we computed the p-value by Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) for its distribution between the two junction groups compared. To correct for multiple hypotheses testing while accounting for the high correlation between some PF we applied a permutation based testing procedure (Column M). Specifically, we shuffled the labels (e.g. changing, unchanging) but controlled for the LSV origin of each junction. Thus, junctions from the same LSV were randomly switched with junctions from an LSV with the same number of junctions. This procedure guarantees that the number of labeled junctions remains the same, helps control for correlation between PF of junctions in the same LSV and for the distribution of LSV types. We repeated this process 10000 times and then calculate an empirical corrected FET p-value.

Because overall coverage was lower in these datasets compared to the original cohort, which affects the ability to detect intron retention (data not shown), we ran MAJIQ Builder on both datasets with a high threshold for IR detection (--min_intronic_cov 1000) in order to only compare exonic LSVs. Additionally, to account for heterogeneity in the data and to save computational time we considered PSI values for each patient separately, as opposed to running all possible pairwise dPSI comparisons.</p><p>An LSV that was changing in the first cohort was considered validated if in the MSBB cohort the distribution of PSI values for the most changing junction was significantly different between healthy and AD individuals in at least one brain subregion (p&lt;0.05, two-tailed rank sum test) with a difference in the median PSI of <underline>&gt;</underline> 10% in the same direction as the original cohort.

To partially correct for the possible bias for high scores that the max operation may introduce we also applied it to the binary LSVs and to randomly selected sets of K constitutive exons, where the size K is sampled based on the distribution of number of exons in LSVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Juan Valcárcel (Reviewing Editor) and James Manley as the Senior Editor. One of the other two reviewers, Roderic Guigo, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work described in the manuscript by Vaquero-Garcia et al. has four main components:</p><p>1) A method to identify and categorize Alternative Splicing (AS) events-to which the authors refer as to Local Splicing Variations (LSV).</p><p>2) A method (MAJIQ) to quantify these events using RNASeq data and a visualization component (VOILA).</p><p>3) The application of the method to produce a catalogue of LSVs in mouse.</p><p>4) The detailed investigation of some of the complex LSVs identified that affect protein domains in developmentally regulated genes and have roles in neurogenesis and other brain functions. The authors illustrate the usefulness of their technique by reporting novel tissue-specific transcript variants of Camk2d and a poison exon in Ptbp1, as well as the apparent enrichment of certain transcript variants in brain samples from Alzheimer disease patients.</p><p>The major advances of these tools are 1) that they are not restricted to being able to analyze the standard types of splicing events (skipped exons, retained introns, alternative 5' splice sites, etc.) but can also identify and quantify much more complex local splicing variations, 2) can analyze both annotated and novel splicing events identified using RNA-seq data, and 3) can compare samples using replicates. There is indeed a need to understand the full complexity of transcript variants in most biological/pathological settings, and therefore sensitive methods for their detection and quantification, particularly using standard sequencing depth datasets, can be very valuable. The performance of the package, which combines various softwares into a single pipeline, appears to be excellent and all tools are available.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript would benefit from presenting the work in framework of previous developments in the field, comparing with them, and emphasizing the relative merits of the current contribution. The authors seem to imply that theirs is the first method that attempts to systematically classify and categorize AS events, beyond merely, exon skipping, alternative usage of splicing sites or intron retention. But, in my opinion, this is incorrect. The authors appear to ignore a large body of previous literature that actually attempts to address exactly this problem. Worth mentioning in this regard is the work of Nagasaki et al. (2005, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/10/1211.full">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/10/1211.full</ext-link>) or Sammeth et al. (2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000147">http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000147</ext-link>). In the latter work, in particular, analysis similar to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Vaquero-Garcia et al., regarding the frequency of complex LSVs depending on the annotation used and the species considered, are presented. Moreover the methods developed by Sammeth et al. have actually been used to categorize AS events in a number of publications (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scholar.google.es/scholar?cites=8586199022962348855&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.es/scholar?cites=8586199022962348855&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en</ext-link>). Also single source and single target LSVs are quantified in their recent work by Pervouchine et al. (2013, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long</ext-link>). The authors also claim that they obtain splicing information by combining the annotation and RNA-seq evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is not clear if they use only splice junctions, or also exons and transcript models. The latter is important for the definition of LSV. Indeed, if &quot;the reference exon may include multiple 3' splice sites (ST-LSV) or 5' splice sites (SS-LSV)&quot;, as it is said in Materials and methods, it would be necessary to know novel exons as continuous units. If this is the case, a lot more has to be explained in Materials and methods regarding the procedure of exon discovery from RNA-seq. In summary, in contrast to the claims by Vaquero-Garcia et al., complex LSVs have received wide attention within the field.</p><p>2) Another potential caveat is whether the results reported will persuade the general reader of the genuine potential of the approach to get biological insight.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>A) The authors argue that complex LSVs represent over 30% of all transcripts variants. The general reader may wonder whether the switches in transcript isoforms within this category generally represent significantly large differences between tissues or biological conditions as to have biological impact. In other words, is biologically-relevant LSV likely to be limited to exceptional cases, or are the majority of complex variants likely to be functionally relevant? It would be useful, in this regard, to analyze the range and frequency distribution of ΔPSI values associated with complex LSVs compared to more standard alternative splicing events. Analysis of the conservation level of the predictably more relevant events could also be helpful.</p><p>B) The authors predict that their method &quot;will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype and disease&quot;. They illustrate this by the identification of transcript variants possibly related to Alzheimer Disease, but the results are essentially descriptive and, considering the number of samples tested and the absence of validation in different cohorts, of limited value to extract rigorous biomedical conclusions. The manuscript would greatly benefit from additional efforts to more broadly illustrate the utility of the tool, for example to show how the approach is advantageous for explaining the impact of genetic variation using publicly available data from the GTEx project (e.g. pilot samples), ENCODE, modENCODE, etc.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A new view of transcriptome complexity and regulation through the lens of local splicing variations&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and a Reviewing editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have significantly expanded and improved their manuscript, which can now provide a generally useful tool for exploring transcriptome diversity in RNA-seq data and, on these basis, would be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The authors have done a good job discussing previous efforts by other scientists to identify complex alternative splicing decisions (main point #1 of the referees' report) and to illustrate the range and frequency distribution of complex LSVs compared to more standard alternative splicing events (point #2A). It would be helpful if the authors could more clearly state what was the validation rate of their disease-associated LSV changes in a second cohort of Alzheimer Disease patients (point #2B) (unless I have missed it, they only provide the number of LSVs reproducibly differentially spliced – p20 – but not what is the fraction of predictions validated in the two datasets). Another point: it is not clearly stated in the text/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> legend that the data corresponds to LSVs consistently differentially spliced between brain samples from patients and controls in the two datasets (as stated in the rebuttal).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11752.080</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript would</italic> benefit <italic>from presenting the work in framework of previous developments in the field, comparing with them, and emphasizing the relative merits of the current contribution.

(2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000147">http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000147</ext-link>). In the latter work, in particular, analysis similar to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Vaquero-Garcia et al., regarding the frequency of complex LSVs depending on the annotation used and the species considered, are presented. Moreover the methods developed by Sammeth et al. have actually been used to categorize AS events in a number of publications (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scholar.google.es/scholar?cites=8586199022962348855&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.es/scholar?cites=8586199022962348855&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en</ext-link>). Also single source and single target LSVs are quantified in their recent work by Pervouchine et al. (2013, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long</ext-link>). The authors also claim that they obtain splicing information by combining the annotation and RNA-seq evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is not clear if they use only splice junctions, or also exons and transcript models. The latter is important for the definition of LSV. Indeed, if &quot;the reference exon may include multiple 3' splice sites (ST-LSV) or 5' splice sites (SS-LSV)&quot;, as it is said in Materials and methods, it would be necessary to know novel exons as continuous units. If this is the case, a lot more has to be explained in Materials and methods regarding the procedure of exon discovery from RNA-seq. In summary, in contrast to the claims by Vaquero-Garcia et al., complex LSVs have received wide attention within the field.</italic> </p><p>The original manuscript lacked a section describing related work, which was mistakenly removed before submission. We apologize for this mistake and have now re introduced an extended section for this in the revised Discussion. We also added text in the Methods section to answer the question regarding how MAJIQ combines known annotation and de-novo junction to annotate putative de-novo exonic regions.</p><p><italic>2) Another potential caveat is whether the results reported will persuade the general reader of the genuine potential of the approach to get biological insight.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specifically:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The authors argue that complex LSVs represent over 30% of all transcripts variants. The general reader may wonder whether the switches in transcript isoforms within this category generally represent significantly large differences between tissues or biological conditions as to have biological impact. In other words, is biologically-relevant LSV likely to be limited to exceptional cases, or are the majority of complex variants likely to be functionally relevant? It would be useful, in this regard, to analyze the range and frequency distribution of ΔPSI values associated with complex LSVs compared to more standard alternative splicing events. Analysis of the conservation level of the predictably more relevant events could also be helpful.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise here an excellent point, which is also related to the concern raised below about disease relevance. To address the concern about significance of complex LSVs we followed the reviewers’ suggestion and created a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> is a meta analysis of over 30 datasets and 243 RNA-Seq experiments that shows the significant enrichment of complex LSVs in datasets that cover developmental stages, key splice factors, and human disease (AD) across diverse tissues and cell lines. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows the changes in LSV inclusion levels (dPSI) across these conditions, just as suggested by the reviewers. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows the suggested conservation analysis with a significant increase in intronic conservation for differentially spliced complex LSVs compared to their binary LSVs counterparts.</p><p> <italic>B) The authors predict that their method &quot;will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype and disease&quot;. They illustrate this by the identification of transcript variants possibly related to Alzheimer Disease, but the results are essentially descriptive and, considering the number of samples tested and the absence of validation in different cohorts, of limited value to extract rigorous biomedical conclusions. The manuscript would greatly benefit from additional efforts to more broadly illustrate the utility of the tool, for example to show how the approach is advantageous for explaining the impact of genetic variation using publicly available data from the GTEx project (e.g. pilot samples), ENCODE, modENCODE, etc.</italic></p><p>To address the concern about the anecdotal nature of the disease related results in the original submission we performed the following: First, we followed the reviewers’ suggestion and validated these results on an independent data set (syn3157743 from the AMP-AD Target Discovery Consortium data portal) which is much larger: 157 samples from AS patient’s brains and 128 control samples, across three different brain sub regions. Second, we added a genome wide analysis of LSVs that are consistently differentially spliced between brain samples from patients and controls in the two datasets (included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> described above). We very much agree this work is still just the tip of the iceberg and we believe much more can be done with the AD datasets and many others. Specifically, the suggested analysis of genetic variations with MAJIQ is a great direction to pursue in future work. However, we are very much aware that a careful analysis of this sort is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] The authors have done a good job discussing previous efforts by other scientists to identify complex alternative splicing decisions (main point #1 of the referees' report) and to illustrate the range and frequency distribution of complex LSVs compared to more standard alternative splicing events (point #2A). It would be helpful if the authors could more clearly state what was the validation rate of their disease-associated LSV changes in a second cohort of Alzheimer Disease patients (point #2B) (unless I have missed it, they only provide the number of LSVs reproducibly differentially spliced</italic> – <italic>p20</italic> – <italic>but not what is the fraction of predictions validated in the two datasets). Another point: it is not clearly stated in the text/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> legend that the data corresponds to LSVs consistently differentially spliced between brain samples from patients and controls in the two datasets (as stated in the rebuttal).</italic></p><p>We have worked hard to address the reviewers’ concerns and suggestions. In particular, to address the reviewers’ concern about the significance of complex LSVs we performed a whole new meta analysis of LSVs across 32 datasets covering diverse tissues, cell lines, developmental stages and splice factors knockdown. We added this to a conservation analysis as suggested by the reviewers, creating a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, to address the concern regarding the relevance of our findings to disease studies we added a genome wide analysis of differentially spliced LSVs in independent datasets of 285 samples from AD patients and controls, which validated our initial findings for the CAMK2 family and other genes. We also added a section detailing previous related work, which was erroneously omitted in the original submission, a mistake we apologize for. Finally, we made sure to add details in all sections indicated by the reviewers as unclear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
