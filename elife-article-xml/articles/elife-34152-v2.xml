remains elusive. Here, we identify Map3k14 (also known as NIK) and its substrate Chuk (also called IKKα) as unrecognized suppressors of hepatocyte replication. Chronic liver disease is associated with aberrant activation of hepatic NIK pathways. We found that hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Map3k14</italic> or <italic>Chuk</italic> substantially accelerated mouse hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration following partial-hepatectomy. Hepatotoxin treatment or high fat diet feeding inhibited the ability of partial-hepatectomy to stimulate hepatocyte replication; remarkably, inactivation of hepatic NIK markedly increased reparative hepatocyte proliferation under these liver disease conditions. Mechanistically, NIK and IKKα suppressed the mitogenic JAK2/STAT3 pathway, thereby inhibiting cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that hepatic NIK and IKKα act as rheostats for liver regeneration by restraining overgrowth. Pathological activation of hepatic NIK or IKKα likely blocks hepatocyte replication, contributing to liver disease progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>liver regeneration</kwd><kwd>liver injury</kwd><kwd>liver inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK091591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rui</surname><given-names>Liangyou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK114220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rui</surname><given-names>Liangyou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK115646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rui</surname><given-names>Liangyou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK47918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Omary</surname><given-names>M Bishr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81420108006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#2013/07313–4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic mouse models show that hepatic NIK and IKKα inhibit hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in part by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The liver is an essential metabolic organ that experiences metabolic stress during fasting, refeeding, and overnutrition states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rui, 2014</xref>). The liver is also responsible for detoxifications of endogenous and exogenous toxic substances, thus being frequently exposed to harmful insults. Dietary hepatotoxins and gut microbiota-derived toxic substances are transported to the liver through the enterohepatic circulation, further increasing risk for liver injury. To compensate for hepatocyte loss, the liver evolves a powerful regenerative ability to maintain its homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Michalopoulos, 2017</xref>). After 70% of partial hepatectomy (PHx), rodents are able to regain normal liver mass within a week via reparative hepatocyte replications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Miyaoka et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, hepatocyte proliferation is severely inhibited in chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, and chronic exposures to hepatotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Richardson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sancho-Bru et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Michalopoulos, 2013</xref>). Impairment in hepatocyte replications considerably precipitates liver disease progression; however, the underlying mechanism responsible for defective hepatocyte replications remains poorly understood.</p><p>In response to liver injury induced by PHx, numerous growth factors and cytokines are secreted and delivered to hepatocytes where they stimulate hepatocyte proliferation by activating multiple mitogenic pathways, including the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3, MAPK, PI 3-kinase, and NF-kB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Michalopoulos, 2017</xref>). In contrast, TGFβ1 and interferon-γ inhibit hepatocyte proliferation, thereby preventing liver from overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Michalopoulos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sato et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Liver regeneration is fine-tuned by a balance between positive and negative regulators. We postulated that in chronic liver disease, the negative branch might be predominant and overcome the positive branch, leading to pathological suppression of hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. However, intracellular pathways conferring hepatocyte proliferation inhibition remain elusive. In search for inhibitory pathways, we identified Map3k14, also called NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK), and its substrate Chuck, also referred to as IkB kinase α (IKKα).</p><p>NIK is a Ser/Thr kinase known to activate the noncanonical NF-kB2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sun, 2012</xref>). It phosphorylates and activates IKKα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>). IKKα in turn phosphorylates the precursor of NF-kB2 p100, resulting in generation of the p52 form of NF-kB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>). Mature p52 is translocated into the nucleus to activate target genes. We previously reported that metabolic stress, oxidative stress, hepatotoxins, and cytokines stimulate hepatic NIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, hepatic NIK is aberrantly activated in both mice and humans with NAFLD or alcoholic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Hepatocellular stress and liver inflammation, which are associated with chronic liver disease, likely activate hepatic NIK. These observations prompted us to test the hypothesis that hepatic NIK/IKKα pathways cell-autonomously inhibit hepatocyte proliferation. In this work, we characterized hepatocyte-specific NIK (NIK<sup>Δhep</sup>) and IKKα (IKKα<sup>Δhep</sup>) knockout mice, and examined reparative hepatocyte replications using PHx models. We found that the NIK/IKKα pathway suppresses reparative hepatocyte proliferation at least in part by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This work unveils unrecognized crosstalk between the NIK/IKKα and the JAK2/STAT3 pathways involved in regulating liver regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hepatocyte-specific ablation of NIK accelerates liver regeneration</title><p>To assess the role of hepatic NIK in reparative hepatocyte proliferation, we performed 70% of PHx on mice at 8 weeks of age following the established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mitchell and Willenbring, 2008</xref>).

HNF4α<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes accounted for 96% of Ki67<sup>+</sup> proliferating cells in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> mice at 48 hr post-PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>) while F4/80<sup>+</sup> Kupffer cells/macrophages for &lt;4% of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). These data indicate that hepatic NIK is an intrinsic suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation.</p><p>We also examined the effect of NIK deficiency on hepatocyte death using TUNEL assays. The number of liver TUNEL<sup>+</sup> apoptotic cells was slightly lower in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> relative to NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice, but the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, a liver injury index, was comparable between NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> and NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice either under basal conditions or after PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, accelerated hepatocyte proliferation cannot be explained by changes in liver injury in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> mice.</p><p>To further confirm the role of hepatic NIK in liver regeneration, we assessed liver to body weight ratios at 2 and 4 days post-PHx. Consistently, liver/body weight ratios were significantly higher in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> than in NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice at 4 days following PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Of note, liver/body weight ratios were similar between these two groups at 2 days post-PHx. One possible explanation is that a 2 day period may be too short for newly-generated hepatocytes to grow in size large enough to increase liver weight.</p><p>To determine whether NIK inhibits hepatocyte cell cycle progression, we measured the levels of cyclin D1, which is believed to drive hepatocyte proliferation following PHx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Michalopoulos, 2013</xref>). Hepatic cyclin D1 levels were undetectable in both NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> and NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice under basal conditions, and were markedly increased by PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, hepatic cyclin D1 levels were significantly higher in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> than in NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

Baseline STAT3 phosphorylation levels in the resected liver were similar between NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> and NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice fed HFD; however, liver STAT3 phosphorylation increased to a considerably higher level in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> relative to NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice at 48 hr post-PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Hepatic cyclin D1 levels were also higher in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> than in NIK<sup>f/f</sup> mice post-PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

Liver regeneration impairment is likely involved in chronic liver disease. In this work, we identified hepatic NIK and IKKα as unrecognized suppressors of liver regeneration; moreover, NIK inhibits hepatocyte proliferation at least in part by activating IKKα. We previously demonstrated that hepatic NIK is aberrantly activated in mice and humans with chronic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Our current results show that elevated activation of hepatic NIK pathways impairs liver regeneration, likely contributing to liver disease progression.</p><p>We found that hepatocyte-specific ablation of NIK or IKKα substantially increases hepatocyte proliferation in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> or IKKα<sup>Δhep</sup> mice following PHx. Accordingly, liver regeneration rates were higher both in NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> relative to NIK<sup>f/f</sup> littermates and in IKKα<sup>Δhep</sup> relative to IKKα<sup>f/f</sup> mice. We observed that both NIK and IKKα bound to JAK2 and substantially inhibited the ability of JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT3. Consistently, hepatocyte-specific ablation of either NIK or IKKα substantially increased phosphorylation of hepatic JAK2 and STAT3 in mice post-PHx. IKKα deficiency decreased the ability of NIK to suppress the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in hepatocytes, confirming that IKKα acts downstream of NIK. However, NIK overexpression still inhibited the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in IKKα-deficient hepatocytes, suggesting that hepatic NIK is able to suppress the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by an additional IKKα-independent mechanism. The JAK2/STAT3 pathway is known to drive hepatocyte proliferation, which is indispensable for liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Riehle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cressman et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, hepatic NIK and IKKα inhibit liver regeneration at least in part by suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.</p><p>Mounting evidence shows that hepatic NIK is aberrantly activated in chronic liver disease, likely due to liver inflammation and hepatocellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). We modeled chronic liver disease by chronically treating mice with hepatotoxin AAF or placing them on HFD. We found that hepatocyte-specific inactivation of NIK substantially increases the ability of PHx to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation in both AAF-treated mice and HFD-fed NIK<sup>Δhep</sup> mice. Consistently, in mice pretreated with AAF or HFD, ablation of hepatic NIK increased phosphorylation of both hepatic JAK2 and STAT3 post-PHx. It is worth mentioning that NIK in nonparenchymal cells (e.g. immune cells) also contributes to obesity-associated liver steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that in chronic liver disease, NIK in Kupffer cells/macrophages, and possibly other nonparenchymal cells, may indirectly inhibit reparative hepatocyte replication by a paracrine mechanism. Collectively, our results provide proof of concept evidence supporting the notion that aberrant hepatic NIK impairs reparative hepatocyte replication, thereby contributing to liver disease progression.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified hepatic NIK and IKKα as unrecognized suppressors of reparative hepatocyte replication. NIK and IKKα suppress liver regeneration at least in part by inhibiting the hepatic JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Our findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of hepatic NIK or IKKα may provide a new therapeutic strategy for liver disease treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Hao Zhu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>It is thought that NF-κB promotes inflammation and hepatocyte survival secondary to liver insults. That said, the effects of NF-κB on liver biology can depend on the cell type and the degree of NF-κB activation or inhibition, thus this is a complex but important area of study. It is somewhat surprising but clearly demonstrated in this manuscript that NIK, a kinase that is known to activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, is a suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation in both acute and chronic settings. The results presented in this manuscript are generally well performed and clearly presented, but additional experiments are needed to more rigorously support the conclusions of the paper. The genetic models support the notion that NIK-IKKα are negative regulators of hepatocyte proliferation in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and other injuries. However, some of the regeneration assays need to be more thoroughly performed and the epistatic relationships between NIK, IKKα, and JAK-Stat should be further elucidated. If these can be added to further support the conclusions of the paper, this story would add additional insight and nuance into traditional perspectives on the influence of NF-κB in liver disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers 1 and 2 asked about the expression pattern of NIK in liver regeneration. Authors should provide a more detailed analysis of NIK before and after PHx (1 day, 2 day, 3 day, 5 day, 7 day) in wild-type mice. This would tell us whether or not expression of this gene is dynamically regulated during regeneration. It would also be nice if NIK expression before and after chronic injury in human livers could be more clearly shown or referenced.</p><p>2) The analysis of how loss of NIK affects liver regeneration should be more carefully performed. Authors should show a more detailed time course analysis on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 to establish how NIK accelerates liver regeneration after PHx. Liver/body ratios should be reported for each time point. An analysis of Ki-67 at different time points would also provide a more complete picture of how and when NIK loss induces hepatocyte proliferation. In Figure 1 and in Figure 6, 7, The liver mass to body mass ratios should be reported for the pre-surgery mice, the resected liver pieces, and for the post-resection livers. This would represent the standard and more comprehensive way for how PHx liver regeneration phenotypes are generally characterized.</p><p>3) A more thorough protein expression analysis along the regeneration time course would help to illustrate how the major targets of NIK (JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3, IKKα) are affected in control and NIK KO mice. These expression studies should be performed in the same liver samples and multiple time points so as to help clarify the epistatic relationships in this signaling cascade.</p><p>4) The authors clearly show that IKKα deletion phenocopies NIK deletion, which suggests that IKKα is downstream of NIK. However in Figure 2, the authors claimed that phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IkBα, and p65 is not affected in NIK knockout mice compared to NIK floxed mice, therefore concluding that NF-κB pathway does not mediate the suppression of liver regeneration by hepatic NIK. Thus, two reviewers where not confident that the epistatic relationships between NIK, IKK, and Jak/Stat were conclusively established. Although liver-specific KO of NIK and IKKα show similar regeneration phenotypes, there is no data to directly assess the signaling cascade. This could be done by including NIK, p-IKKα and total-IKKα, together with p-STAT3/t-STAT3 and p-JAK/JAK in Western blot analyses in NIK KO, IKKα KO, and WT livers.</p><p>Along the same lines, the effect of NIK overexpression in IKKα-/- hepatocytes on JAK-STAT3 signaling should be examined to determine whether IKKα is a downstream effector of NIK. To limit the amount of work, this can be done in hepatocytes in vitro only and p-STAT3 can be used as a readout. If the time course signaling analysis within WT mice (comment 3) and these over-expression experiments clearly support the hypothesis that NIK is upstream of IKKα and Jak-stat, then the authors do not need to provide the signaling analysis in each of the different mutant mouse models.</p><p>5) The authors have published a paper in Endocrinology 2017 that states in the Abstract: &quot;deletion of NIK in the liver, including both hepatocytes and immune cells, protected against HFD-induced liver steatosis and attenuated hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, deletion of liver NIK suppressed liver inflammation and lipogenic programs, thus contributing to protection against liver steatosis.&quot; Can the authors discuss potential non-cell-autonomous effects that might accelerate hepatocyte regeneration? No experiments are necessary here, but a clarifying discussion about known cell-type dependent effects of NIK would be helpful to frame the findings in this paper in the context of past studies.</p><p>6) It was noted by reviewer 3 that the authors' claim that the described pathway regulates a quality control mechanism to block proliferation of damage hepatocytes is not supported by direct evidence. In fact, serum ALT, the only measurement that indirectly determines liver integrity, did not differ between control and liver NIK-/- mice.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>There have been some substantial improvements made during the revisions, especially in regards to the mechanistic relationships within the NIK IKK signalling axis. However, there are some significant concerns about the liver regeneration phenotypes that we would like you to clarify before we make a decision on this manuscript.</p><p>The liver regeneration data are heavily dependent on precise liver mass measurements in large numbers of mice at different time points. Liver mass recovery is ultimately the most important physiological readout (not necessarily proliferation) when assessing liver regeneration. With this in mind, the revision reveals significant uncertainty about the central phenotypic findings of the paper.</p><p>You present a method of calculation of &quot;liver growth rates&quot; during regeneration that is not accurate. You calculate liver growth rate as follows: &quot;Estimation of total liver weight before PHx: resected liver weight ÷ 70%. Calculation of the remnant liver weight after PHx: total liver weight – resected liver weight. Liver weight gains: terminal liver weight – the remnant liver weight. Liver growth rates: liver weight gains normalized to the remnant liver weight after PHx.&quot;</p><p>The 70% number is theoretical, not measured, and each surgery can be different in terms of amount of liver resected and probably ranges from 50-75%. If in actuality less than 70% is resected, then the total liver mass will be substantially mis-calculated and under-estimated. This would be compounded when &quot;liver growth rates&quot; are calculated because the formulation stated above uses several non-measured numbers to calculate the remnant liver weight. This is likely why there is a significant increase in liver growth rates in Figure 1I, while there is no actual difference in liver/body weight ratio at 2 or 4 days as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The day 4 data does not contain enough mice and the p value does not reach significance. The negative data in this figure supplement is in opposition to Figure 1I, and suggests that there is not a significant effect on liver mass recovery after partial hepatectomy for NIK deleted mice.</p><p>The IKK data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 is also confusing, with a significant differences in Ki67 but no strong changes in liver mass until day 7, when liver regeneration is mostly completed. The most rigorous data here are the liver/body weight ratios at days 2 and 4 for both NIK and IKK mice, and both of these sets of data are essentially negative.</p><p>Again in Figure 6E the same type of data discrepancy exists. In Figure 6E, there is a significant increase in liver growth rates, but then in the supplement there is no significant difference in liver/body weight ratios. All of these points raise the possibility that the phenotyping was not completely solid, and the revision experiments further bring those points to light. We would like to give you another opportunity to clarify the data and to resolve the questions raised above, if you are able to do so. An adequate number of mice to answer the questions would be important in this case. If the key data are indeed negative, or if the conclusions are not strongly supported by a rigorous way of assessing liver mass, then we would encourage you to resubmit this manuscript elsewhere.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34152.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers 1 and 2 asked about the expression pattern of NIK in liver regeneration. Authors should provide a more detailed analysis of NIK before and after PHx (1 day, 2 day, 3 day, 5 day, 7 day) in wild-type mice. This would tell us whether or not expression of this gene is dynamically regulated during regeneration. It would also be nice if NIK expression before and after chronic injury in human livers could be more clearly shown or referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the requested experiments and added the new results in the revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Indeed, we observed a transient increase in NIK expression, likely due to increased cytokine secretion and/or hepatocellular stress in response to PHx-induced liver injury. We tried to measure NIK protein levels using commercial anti-NIK antibodies from 3 sources (Santa Cruz sc-8417; Abcom ab191591, CST #4994), but failed to detect hepatic NIK protein. Notably, it is widely known that endogenous NIK levels in most animal tissues are below the detection thresholds of commercial antibodies.</p><p>We previously reported that liver NIK pathways are aberrantly activated in humans with chronic liver injury induced by alcoholic consumption or autoimmune attack (Hepatology, 60:2065-76, 2014).
