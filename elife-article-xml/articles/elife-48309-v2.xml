In mouse malaria models, clearance of uninfected erythrocytes is promoted by autoimmune anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) antibodies produced by T-bet<sup>+</sup>B-cells, which bind to exposed PS in erythrocytes, but the mechanism in patients is still unclear. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> patients with anemia, we show that atypical memory FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells are expanded and associate both with higher levels of anti-PS antibodies in plasma and with the development of anemia in these patients. No association of anti-PS antibodies or anemia with other B-cell subsets and no association of other antibody specificities with FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells is observed, revealing high specificity in this response. We also identify FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells as producers of anti-PS antibodies in ex vivo cultures of naïve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocyte lysates. These data define a crucial role for atypical memory B-cells and anti-PS autoantibodies in human malarial anemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>atypical memory B-cells</kwd><kwd>autoantibodies</kwd><kwd>anti-phosphatidylserine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI100853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivera-Correa</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI007180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivera-Correa</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009139</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TI07.001_Rolling</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rolling</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The association of atypical memory B-cells and autoimmune antibodies (anti-phosphatidylserine) with hemoglobin levels in malaria patients uncovers a novel mechanism for the human malaria-induced anemia previously identified in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is still a major global health threat with over 200 million new infections and around 400,000 deaths in 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). Anemia is a common complication associated with malaria that contributes significantly to the great morbidity and mortality associated with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White, 2018</xref>). Despite its high clinical relevance, the mechanisms underlying malarial anemia in patients remain largely unknown. The difficulty in studying this syndrome arises at least in part from its multi-factorial etiology, as malaria causes both the clearance (through complement-mediated lysis or phagocytosis) of infected and uninfected erythrocytes and bone marrow dyserythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lamikanra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White, 2018</xref>). The clearance of uninfected erythrocytes is thought to contribute significantly to anemia, because for each erythrocyte lysed directly due to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, about eight uninfected erythrocytes are killed in <italic>P. falciparum </italic>infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jakeman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Price et al., 2001</xref>) and about 34 erythrocytes are killed in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The anti-parasite B-cell antibody response that is generated during the malaria blood stage represents an essential component of the protective immune response against this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doolan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>). However, an important autoimmune response is also generated during malaria, in which autoantibodies mediate some of the associated pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rivera-Correa and Rodriguez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rivera-Correa, 2016</xref>). Specifically, autoantibodies that target membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) on uninfected erythrocytes promote anemia during malaria in mouse models, and these autoantibodies correlate with low hemoglobin levels in a cohort of <italic>P.-falciparum-</italic> and <italic>P.-vivax-</italic>infected patients with malarial anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fernandez-Arias et al., 2016</xref>), establishing an autoimmune component to malarial anemia. An atypical group of B-cells that express the transcription factor T-bet secrete autoantibodies in different autoimmune mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rubtsova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>) and were found to be major producers of anti-PS antibodies in mouse malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rivera-Correa et al., 2017</xref>). The relation of these atypical T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells to autoantibodies and their role in malarial anemia has not been assessed in malaria patients.</p><p>B-cells expressing the transcription factor T-bet have been identified in the circulation of individuals from malaria-endemic areas and implicated in the memory response against <italic>Plasmodium </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guthmiller et al., 2017</xref>), being considered atypical memory B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>). These cells are characterized as secreting low levels of antibodies and by inhibitory phenotypic markers such as FcRL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). The secreted-antibody specificity of these atypical memory B-cells has not been characterized because of their reduced effector function and minimal antibody secretion in-vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Portugal et al., 2015</xref>). Hence studying these FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells during acute stage malaria in a population from a non-endemic area, such as European travelers, represents a unique opportunity to study the antibody specificity that results from recent primary activation.</p><p>In this study, we focused on measuring the levels of atypical FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells in the circulation of <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected returned travelers and its relation to autoantibodies and anemia development. Our results show that atypical FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells are greatly expanded in acute malaria in <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected patients and correlate with both anemia development and plasma anti-PS antibody levels in these patients. In vitro studies confirmed that the activation of FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells by <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes induces the secretion of anti-PS autoantibodies. All together, these findings attribute a role to atypical FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells and anti-PS antibodies in the pathogenesis of human malarial anemia. Targeting these cells could have a therapeutic benefit in treating anemia during malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specific autoantibodies correlate with malarial anemia and erythrocyte lysis capacity in <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected patients</title><p>In this study, we focused on samples (24 patients, 31 unique samples) from a cohort of <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected returned travelers from Germany, who acquired malaria while visiting Africa.

This is in agreement with our results from PBMC stimulated in vitro, in which FcRL5-enriched cells show reactivity against both PS and the PfEBA antigen.</p><p>Atypical MBCs have also been described in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected mice, where they were characterized as short-lived, and therefore not contributing to the long-lived anti malaria immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pérez-Mazliah et al., 2018</xref>), but where they were able to limit the protective anti-parasite antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guthmiller et al., 2017</xref>). In our previous study in mice, we characterized T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells as the main producers of anti-PS IgG antibodies during malarial anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rivera-Correa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although several studies have described atypical MBCs in individuals living in malaria endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Portugal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sundling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>), few studies had previously focused on these cells during the acute infection of individuals from non-endemic areas, where primary infections can be observed. It is likely that atypical MBCs have frequently been characterized as exhausted memory B-cells secreting minimal antibodies because the studies were performed in individuals from endemic areas who had previously suffered numerous malaria infections. Our cohort offers a differential advantage in enabling the study of atypical MBCs during primary <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections (in the group of tourists), allowing the characterization of these cells during their first response to malaria in a unique setting and thus dissecting their contribution in patients without other endemic site bystander infections. We also observed that the VFR group, whose members reported previous malaria infections, presents levels of atypical MBCs that are similar to those seen in first-infection patients. Although the time after their last malaria infection is variable in this group, these patients are very different from individuals suffering continuous reinfections in endemic areas.</p><p>The correlation of expansion of atypical MBCs with anemia in patients suggests that these cells have a role in malaria pathogenesis, providing clinical significance to our findings. In addition, the lack of correlation between the prevalence of these cells and other clinical parameters, such as parasitemia, gender, patient background and thrombocyte count, points to the specificity of the pathological effect.</p><p>In mice, T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells are major producers of anti-PS antibodies during malaria and promote anemia by inducing the clearance of uninfected erythrocytes that bind to these antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fernandez-Arias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rivera-Correa et al., 2017</xref>). T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells in these mice are activated directly by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> DNA through TLR-9 alongside IFN-γ to produce anti-PS antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rivera-Correa et al., 2017</xref>). Our observations suggest that a similar mechanism contributes to human malarial anemia, as we observed specific direct correlations between the three key elements of this process: anti-PS antibodies, atypical MBCs and anemia. Our results in human samples also provide evidence that FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells correlate with anemia. These cells are observed circulating in high levels in individuals living in malaria-endemic areas and present low antibody secretion ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Portugal et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that at least some of these atypical MBCs may be derived from the T-bet<sup>+</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup> B-cells observed in our study, which are generated during primary acute malaria but would lose their antibody-secreting capacity over time.</p><p>To complement the studies with patient samples, we took a direct approach to determine whether atypical MBCs can secrete anti-PS antibodies upon activation. The detection of anti-PS-secreting FcRL5<sup>+</sup> B-cells, but not of anti-PS-secreting CD27<sup>+</sup> B-cells, after stimulation with <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocyte lysates, directly links FcRL5<sup>+</sup> B-cells with autoimmune antibody secretion in response to parasite stimulation.</p><p>Collectively, results from the analysis of patient samples and from in vitro stimulation of healthy PBMC, suggest that atypical T-bet<sup>+</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup> memory B-cells contribute to malarial anemia in <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected patients through anti-PS antibody secretion. They also strengthen the dichotomy within memory B-cells, where the atypical subset correlates with autoimmune anemia while the classical subset correlates with hematological health. As there were no significant correlations between anti-PS IgG antibodies and the other B-cell subsets (naïve, immature, classical memory or plasma cells), or of other antibodies (DNA, PfEBA) with anemia or with atypical memory B-cells, these results suggest specificity and support the hypothesis that atypical T-bet<sup>+</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup> memory B-cells secrete anti-PS IgG antibodies that contribute to malarial anemia in <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infected patients.</p><p>In summary, our results provide the first mechanistic evidence of autoimmune-mediated malaria anemia in patients, and suggest that atypical T-bet<sup>+</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup> B-cells are major promoters of this pathology in <italic>P.-falciparum</italic>-infections. Given the need for novel targeted treatments for malarial anemia, which still presents high prevalence and mortality, the unique phenotype and specificity of these cells secreting anti-PS antibodies could enable biomarker identification and the development of targeted therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CPD backed cells</td><td>Interstate Blood bank</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD20 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>302304</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti- T-bet (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>644810</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD11c (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>301604</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD27 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>302806</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD21 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>354910 (FITC) <break/>354906 (APC)</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human FcRL5 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>340306</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD10 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>312210</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD19 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>30228</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human IgM- HRP (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>AP114P</td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human IgG-HRP (goat polyclonal)</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>NA933</td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human FcRL5-biotin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Miltenyi Biotec</td><td>130-105-993</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human IgM unlabeled (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>314–502</td><td>15 μg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human IgM-biotin(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>EMD Millipore</td><td>411543</td><td>1 μg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td><italic>P. falciparum</italic> Erythrocyte Binding Antigen</td><td>BEI Resources <break/>MR-4</td><td>#MRA-1162</td><td>15 μg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>424401</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit</td><td>Lonza</td><td>LT07-118</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>TMB substrate</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>555214</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>CD27 Microbeads human</td><td>Miltenyi Biotec</td><td>130-051-601</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ionomycin</td><td>Life technologies</td><td>I24222</td><td>2.5 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ficoll-Paquee Plus</td><td>GE Life Sciences</td><td>17144002</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad PRISM</td><td>GraphPad PRISM</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Phosphatidylserine</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>P7769</td><td>20 μg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Calf Thymus DNA</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>D4522</td><td>10 μg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Stop buffer</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>423001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Annexin V</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>640902</td><td>0.5 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>X- VIVO 15 media</td><td>Lonza</td><td>04-418Q</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Human AB healthy plasma</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>H4522</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and sample collection</title><p>Patients were recruited at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.

The sample size was limited by the number of German patients reporting with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf during one year. We obtained samples from 24 patients (at two different times after infection for seven of them) and four uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Spearman analysis of the seven pairs of repeated samples showed no significant correlation in the levels of atypical MBCs between repeated measurements. All patients received anti-malaria treatment on the day of presentation, which is considered day 0. Patients were classified as tourists or VRF.

On the basis of data obtained from a group of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected subjects who returned from African countries, the authors constructed correlations about the increased frequency of atypical memory B cells expressing FcRL5 and producing anti phosphatidylserine (PS) antibodies that are ultimately involved in the lysis of uninfected red blood cells, hence anemia.</p><p>The authors have previously published similar work on malaria inducing anemia via the anti-PS antibodies in a mouse model and now they extend this investigation to human subjects, which is an important aspect of malaria-associated pathology and thus it adds significant value to the study.

Such omission makes it rather difficult to understand and properly interpret the results. For example, what level of certainty can the authors provide that this was only &quot;one time malaria infection&quot; and that the subjects did not suffer from malaria previously? In Table 1, the data show the days since treatment. Is it also the time when the PBMCs were sampled? If not, when and how many times were the PBMC drawn and sera obtained? According to the data provided in the Table, there is a rather high variation as to the time since the subjects received treatment. It is imperative to provide this explanation somewhere in the text, as the days vary considerably. i.e., day 1 – 31. Is it possible that because of these variations, the results presented in Figure 1A, could be interpreted as showing two separate groups? Although, one does expect a certain level of variation in the level of any lymphocyte subsets in human populations, do the results showing T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells levels in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infected persons reflect this expected variation, or do they reflect the time of treatment, the level of parasitemia, etc? These issues do need to be addressed to properly interpret the results. Also, it is not clear what the percentages in Figure 2B indicate. Are these percentages of T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells based on the number of CD19<sup>+</sup>B cells? Please clarify.</p><p>The key observation in this study is that the atypical FcRL5<sup>+</sup>B cells correlate with the production of anti-PS IgG antibodies, which in turn correlates with anemia. I would presume that the sera from which these antibodies were derived are still available. Additional (in vitro) experiments should be considered to demonstrate that the anti-PS IgG containing sera or isolated anti-PS antibodies derived from the Pf infected subjects lyse red blood cells. Results from these experiments would solidly confirm the correlative data presented by the authors.</p><p>As concerns experiments shown in Figure 6B, it is not entirely clear how the experiments were done and how the percentage of ELISPOTs were calculated?

In summary, the authors show that anemia (low hemoglobin) in patients with malaria is correlated with anti-PS antibodies and frequencies of FCRL5<sup>+</sup> and T-bet B cells. Anemia does not correlate with parasitemia or levels of anti-parasite antibodies (anti-EBA), and is inversely correlated with classical MBC frequency. T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells expand in patients with malaria, then contract after drug treatment. FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells from healthy donor PBMCs, when incubated with Pf erythrocyte lysate, will secrete anti-PS antibodies (to a significantly greater extent than CD27<sup>+</sup> cells); both populations secrete roughly equal levels of anti-Pf antibodies.</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) The key contribution of this manuscript is providing a potential autoimmune mechanism for malaria-associated anemia, as well as a potential function of T-bet<sup>+</sup> atypical MBCs (but see objections to their interpretations on this below).</p><p>2) There needs to be a better effort to incorporate recent developments in our understanding of what atypical / T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells are. If atypical/T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells are recently activated, optimally derived cells, then it follows that they are the main cells contributing to the circulating antibody pool for a recent infection (presumably after having to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells, which the study doesn't really mention). It makes sense that they're not going to have a lot of anti-DNA antibody because presumably this hasn't been elicited recently (at least is not the dominant recent stimulus).</p><p>What's more interesting about their data is that the T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells correlate with anti-PS, but not anti-EBA (a parasite antigen). It would be nice to know if this correlation holds for anti-parasite antibodies in general (e.g., ELISA against whole parasite lysate). We know from published work in both human and mouse that atypical MBCs include cells with anti-Pf specificity (Muellenbeck et al., Krishnamurthy et al., Perez-Mazliah et al., Kim et al) and they also are enriched for anti-HIV antibodies in chronic HIV patients. So it doesn't seem to be universally true that T-bet<sup>+</sup> atypicals are autoreactive B cells. But it may be the case that during malaria, the active Ab response is skewed toward PS rather than parasite antigens, and if so this could be a potentially very interesting immune evasion mechanism.</p><p>3) It's hard to know what to take home from Figure 6 (in vitro stim of healthy donor PBMCs with infected RBC lysate). First of all, FCRL5 and CD27 aren't mutually exclusive markers for atMBCs and cMBCs; a decent fraction (5-45%) of CD27<sup>+</sup> cells also express FCRL5 (Sullivan 2015, Kim 2019). So it's not clear what populations are being sorted in this expt-there is probably some overlap between the two. Also, since FCRL5 appears to be upregulated transiently on activated B cells (e.g. Dement-Brown et al. 2012), it's possible that this population just includes most or all of the activated B cells (which would be consistent with the greater # of ASCs observed in the FCRL5<sup>+</sup> compared to CD27<sup>+</sup> wells).</p><p>4) Because of the authors' focus on the nature of the T-bet<sup>+</sup> FCRL5<sup>+</sup> cells as producers of autoreactive (anti-PS) antibodies but not anti-parasite antibodies, a key question is whether the FCRL5<sup>+</sup> subset selectively produces anti-PS. No stats are included in Figure 6B to compare the number of FCRL5<sup>+</sup> ASCs producing anti-PS versus anti-PfEBA (gray bars)- are these numbers significantly different? It might be informative to try stimulating PBMCs with another, unrelated antigen (or even look at additional self and Pf antigens with the same stimulus) and see if this pattern holds true (i.e. that most ASCs are found in the FCRL5<sup>+</sup> pool). This would be consistent with recent literature demonstrating that FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells are responsive, recently activated cells (Perez-Mazliah et al., Kim et al.) but would weaken the authors' interpretation of this subset as a uniquely autoreactive subset.</p><p>5) The authors don't find a correlation between anti-EBA antibodies and any B cell subsets assessed (Figure 5, subsection “Anti-parasite antibodies do not correlate with FcRL5<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> atypical B-cells during malarial anemia in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected patients”). But we know that some anti-parasite antibodies are made. So… where are those antibodies coming from? Is EBA a good representative Ag? Are multiple B cell subsets contributing those Ab levels? Is it all coming from plasma cells in bone marrow and cannot be measured from PBMCs? If so, then is the fact that most B cell subsets (including plasma cells) don't correlate with anti-PS antibodies meaningful? Maybe the antibodies come from plasma cells in BM, and in fact T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells are an indirect marker of recency since infection, or immune status; and these things might also correlate with anemia severity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper by Rivera-Correa and colleagues, the authors report an intriguing association between anti-phosphotidyl serine antibodies, FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>B cells, and hemoglobin levels among patients presenting with symptomatic malaria. The authors further describe in vitro experiments detailing that FCRL5<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells expand after coculture of naïve PBMC with Pf lysate, and that these expanded cells appear to produce anti-PS antibodies, which strengthens the observations reported and suggest that malarial anemia may be mediated in part by auto-immune antibody production by this B cell subset. The manuscript is clearly written and easy to follow. My major concern with the data presented in this manuscript is that the main results (Figures 1-5) are mainly correlations, and that the correlation results were reported with linear regression. With the small patient numbers (n=19) several of the &quot;significant&quot; correlations may have been driven by 1 or 2 &quot;outliers&quot; with lower hemoglobin, for example. Given the small numbers, nonparametric assessments would have been more appropriate (i.e. Spearman's correlation coefficients as opposed to linear regression). Importantly, in many of the figures, there appears to be 27 data points, but in the Materials and methods, the authors state that there were 19 patients (7 with convalescent samples). Thus, one would surmise that the figures reflect 1 data point from 12 individuals, and two data points from 7 individuals. Assuming that these repeated measurements are correlated, the authors should have performed some analysis to account for repeated measures within individuals (e.g. generalized estimating equations or mixed effects linear regression) since autocorrelation could also be driving these associations.</p><p>One possible way to strengthen the authors' claims would be to obtain and analyze samples from a secondary cohort (e.g., an endemic cohort, if obtaining samples from a traveler's clinic is too time consuming.) The authors defend the choice of using a traveler's cohort in the discussion, since in many instances this might represent a primary infection, although I think it would also be very interesting to see if frequencies of FCRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells correlate with anti-PS antibodies in endemic settings as well.</p><p>Materials and methods: 19 patients and 4 controls</p><p>Results section – 27 samples? This is misleading. Would state X patients, 27 unique samples. (but isn't it actually 20 patients? Your numbering is from 100-119, so you would also count patient 0?)</p><p>Concern in Figure 1A: 2 patients with Hb &lt;5 but not in table? What are these 2 measurements? Assuming this reflects Hb measured in all patients at the time that parasitemia was assessed (?Day 0) This data should be included in Table 1.</p><p>Table 1 generally is difficult to follow and should be clarified (potentially in legend or with updated column headers)</p><p>– Days since treatment start – needs clarification that this is the day of PBMC/plasma/Hb sampling.</p><p>– Also – for 7 individuals, the 2nd visit is also detailed in the table. I would argue that this information should be on the same &quot;row&quot; in columns to the right rather than a separate row.</p><p>– Hb measurement is at the date of sampling – do you also have hemoglobin at date parasitemia measured? (as above)</p><p>– Why does parasite count in Table 1 oscillate between% and parasites/μl? Not easy to interpret this in the table. Presumably these were all converted to parasites/µl for use in Figure 1A. Would use one standard metric here.</p><p>Results section the authors state that hemoglobin does not correlate with parasitemia, but this is an incorrect statement – they are not &quot;significantly&quot; correlated, although, visually, a positive correlation is suggested.</p><p>Results section: – &quot;expression of T-bet in CD27<sup>-</sup>CD21<sup>-</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup> B-cells is directly correlated&quot;. Assuming that you assessed co-expression of T-bet in FCRL5<sup>+</sup> cells? Would be a more direct analysis vs. showing the correlation.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Paragraph one: you didn't actually test the hypothesis that malaria-associated anemia is mediated by an autoimmune anti-PS response – you tested the correlation per se, which would be consistent with a causal relationship. Would be a little more judicious in your discussion/conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Atypical memory B-cells are associated with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> anemia through anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Satyajit Rath (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, Juan Rivera-Correa and colleagues describe an interesting observations concerning the cause of anemia that accompanies malaria in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> exposed persons. It appears that <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infected red blood cells activate B cells that express phenotypic markers indicative of atypical B cell population (FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>) and such induced B cells produce antibodies that are autoreactive against phosphatidylserine that cause lysis of uninfected red blood cells. The authors found that the population of these atypical B cells did increase in European travels, who suffered from malaria episode(s) while visiting African countries. The authors demonstrate that atypical FcRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells are greatly expanded in acute malaria in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected patients and correlate with both anemia and plasma anti-PS antibody levels in these patients. The authors have also confirmed these observations in vitro conducted experiments. These are novel observations showing that human atypical B cells produce anti-PS autoantibodies that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of human malaria anemia.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but a few remaining issues, mainly editorial in nature, need to be addressed before acceptance. The issues to consider for revision are outlined below:</p><p>1) The introduction to each section fails to capture and integrate narratively the flow of the results. Please make a few editorial edits to better highlight this flow and integration. For example, the first sentence of the second section of the Results reads &quot;Our first aim was..&quot;. However, the first section of the Results section seems to be the first aim, which is to establish that autoantibodies correlate with anemia and erythrocyte lysis in malaria patients. Similarly, the first sentence of the third section reads, &quot;Our main goal&quot;.. Please reword to simply state, &quot;We next sought to determine whether B cell subsets described above correlate with hemoglobin levels.</p><p>2) Gating plots and analysis of Figure 3 and Figure 4. AS written, it seems as though the analysis reported in section 2 (Figure 3) and section 3 (Figure 4) use different gating strategies to define populations of atypical memory B cells. Hopefully this is not the case. For example, in section 2, it states that AtMBC were defined as CD19<sup>+</sup>, FCRL5<sup>+</sup>, T-bet<sup>+</sup>. However, in Section 3, it states that AtMBC were defined as CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup>FCRL5<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>. Please 1) integrate the two &quot;definitions&quot; into one and present these in section 2 of the results, with one integrated gating plot included (not separated into one in Figure 3 and one in Figure 4 —figure supplement.</p><p>Relatedly- gating figure (Figure 4—figure supplement). Not a very convincing plot of atypical memory B cells as cd27<sup>-</sup>cd21<sup>-</sup> cells (2.9%?). Do you have a more representative gating figure that can be included instead? (especially if your median in tourists is close to 9%., and given the beautiful plot shown in Figure 3?).</p><p>3) Results subsection “Anti-parasite antibodies do not correlate with FcRL5<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> atypical memory B-cells in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected patients” header.

On the basis of data obtained from a group of Plasmodium falciparum-infected subjects who returned from African countries, the authors constructed correlations about the increased frequency of atypical memory B cells expressing FcRL5 and producing anti phosphatidylserine (PS) antibodies that are ultimately involved in the lysis of uninfected red blood cells, hence anemia.</p><p>The authors have previously published similar work on malaria inducing anemia via the anti-PS antibodies in a mouse model and now they extend this investigation to human subjects, which is an important aspect of malaria-associated pathology and thus it adds significant value to the study.

It is imperative to provide this explanation somewhere in the text, as the days vary considerably. i.e., day 1 – 31. Is it possible that because of these variations, the results presented in Figure 1A, could be interpreted as showing two separate groups? Although, one does expect a certain level of variation in the level of any lymphocyte subsets in human populations, do the results showing T-bet<sup>+</sup>B cells levels in P. falciparum infected persons reflect this expected variation, or do they reflect the time of treatment, the level of parasitemia, etc? These issues do need to be addressed to properly interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have performed the analysis of ‘days after treatment’ and hemoglobin, which showed no significant correlation, indicating that the variations on hemoglobin levels are not just a consequence of time after parasite clearance.</p><p>We also observed a significant direct correlation between the levels of atypical MBCs and the days after treatment, which suggests that the levels of aMBCs keep increasing after treatment.

The erythrocyte lysis capacity is partially inhibited by annexin V, which specifically binds to PS, and inhibits the binding of anti-PS antibodies. This experiment was performed with the samples from 6 patients and 3 healthy controls from which there was enough volume remaining. We have also observed that levels of anti-PS antibodies correlate with the levels of LDH in patients.

In summary, the authors show that anemia (low hemoglobin) in patients with malaria is correlated with anti-PS antibodies and frequencies of FCRL5<sup>+</sup> and T-bet B cells. Anemia does not correlate with parasitemia or levels of anti-parasite antibodies (anti-EBA), and is inversely correlated with classical MBC frequency. T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells expand in patients with malaria, then contract after drug treatment. FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells from healthy donor PBMCs, when incubated with Pf erythrocyte lysate, will secrete anti-PS antibodies (to a significantly greater extent than CD27<sup>+</sup> cells); both populations secrete roughly equal levels of anti-Pf antibodies.</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) The key contribution of this manuscript is providing a potential autoimmune mechanism for malaria-associated anemia, as well as a potential function of Tbet+ atypical MBCs (but see objections to their interpretations on this below).</p><p>2) There needs to be a better effort to incorporate recent developments in our understanding of what atypical / T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells are. If atypical/T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells are recently activated, optimally derived cells, then it follows that they are the main cells contributing to the circulating antibody pool for a recent infection (presumably after having to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells, which the study doesn't really mention). It makes sense that they're not going to have a lot of anti-DNA antibody because presumably this hasn't been elicited recently (at least is not the dominant recent stimulus).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for all insightful comments that have improved significantly the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>The recent literature in atypical / T-bet<sup>+</sup> B-cells has provided insights of the heterogenic population that the T-bet marker alone can indicate. Double expression of T-bet and FcRL5 was used in our study to better define the population of atypical memory B-cells, as has been described in malaria patients (Sullivan et al. 2015). This point has been explained in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What's more interesting about their data is that the T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells correlate with anti-PS, but not anti-EBA (a parasite antigen). It would be nice to know if this correlation holds for anti-parasite antibodies in general (e.g., ELISA against whole parasite lysate).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to see the correlation with whole anti-parasite antibodies, but we would predict that testing for this correlation with whole parasite lysates (either using lysates of infected RBCs or lysates of purified merozoites), will not be conclusive since the parasite (and infected RBC) lysates contain large amounts of PS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We know from published work in both human and mouse that atypical MBCs include cells with anti-Pf specificity (Muellenbeck et al., Krishnamurthy et al., Perez-Mazliah et al., Kim et al) and they also are enriched for anti-HIV antibodies in chronic HIV patients. So it doesn't seem to be universally true that T-bet<sup>+</sup> atypicals are autoreactive B cells. But it may be the case that during malaria, the active Ab response is skewed toward PS rather than parasite antigens, and if so this could be a potentially very interesting immune evasion mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a sentence and the references in the Discussion section to clarify that atypical MBCs include cells with specificity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens, as previously described. This is in agreement with our results in Figure 6, where a population of FcRL5-enriched cells shows reactivity against PfEBA antigen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's hard to know what to take home from Figure 6 (in vitro stim of healthy donor PBMCs with infected RBC lysate). First of all, FCRL5 and CD27 aren't mutually exclusive markers for atMBCs and cMBCs; a decent fraction (5-45%) of CD27<sup>+</sup> cells also express FCRL5 (Sullivan 2015, Kim 2019). So it's not clear what populations are being sorted in this expt-there is probably some overlap between the two. Also, since FCRL5 appears to be upregulated transiently on activated B cells (e.g. Dement-Brown et al. 2012), it's possible that this population just includes most or all of the activated B cells (which would be consistent with the greater # of ASCs observed in the FCRL5<sup>+</sup> compared to CD27<sup>+</sup> wells).</p></disp-quote><p>The main purpose of Figure 6 is to link directly atypical FcRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells with the secretion of autoimmune anti-PS antibodies. For this purpose, we compared FcRL5<sup>+</sup> cells and CD27<sup>+</sup> cells, which will differentially include plasmablasts/plasma cells as well as classical Memory B-cells. As the reviewer points out, these markers are not mutually exclusive and both enriched populations will include recently activated cells. In fact, CD27<sup>+</sup> enriched cells had higher numbers of total antibody secreting cells (ASCs) than FcRL5<sup>+</sup> when analyzed by total IgM spots (now included as Figure 7—figure supplement 1), which indicates that activated ASCs are found in both populations (CD27<sup>+</sup> and FcRL5<sup>+</sup>) and that FcRL5<sup>+</sup> population does not include most or all of the activated B cells.</p><p>Distinctly, quantification of PS-specific ASCs show that these cells are more frequent among FcRL5<sup>+</sup> cells compared to CD27<sup>+</sup> cells, despite having similar number of PfEBA-specific ASCs. These results indicate that even if CD27<sup>+</sup> cells have a higher proportion of ASCs in general, FcRL5<sup>+</sup> cells contain more anti-PS secreting cells. A sentence explaining these results is now included in Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Because of the authors' focus on the nature of the T-bet<sup>+</sup> FCRL5<sup>+</sup> cells as producers of autoreactive (anti-PS) antibodies but not anti-parasite antibodies, a key question is whether the FCRL5<sup>+</sup> subset selectively produces anti-PS. No stats are included in Figure 6B to compare the number of FCRL5<sup>+</sup> ASCs producing anti-PS versus anti-PfEBA (gray bars)- are these numbers significantly different?</p></disp-quote><p>No significant difference is observed between the number of FCRL5<sup>+</sup> ASCs producing anti-PS versus anti-PfEBA (now included in the graph). This suggests that the FcLR5 subset can efficiently produce both autoimmune and anti-parasite antibodies. This is now explained in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It might be informative to try stimulating PBMCs with another, unrelated antigen (or even look at additional self and Pf antigens with the same stimulus) and see if this pattern holds true (i.e. that most ASCs are found in the FCRL5<sup>+</sup> pool). This would be consistent with recent literature demonstrating that FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells are responsive, recently activated cells (Perez-Mazliah et al., Kim et al.) but would weaken the authors' interpretation of this subset as a uniquely autoreactive subset.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have attempted the stimulation of PBMC with a specific <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigen, HRPII, and with uninfected erythrocyte lysate. We did not observe a significant expansion of T-bet<sup>+</sup> FCRL5<sup>+</sup> cells in these cultures (now included as Figure 7—figure supplement 2). This may be explained by the observation that three different signals are needed for optimal expansion of these cells in vitro: B-cell stimulation, specific inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ) and Plasmodium DNA (Rivera-Correa et al. 2017 Nat. Comm.) These three stimuli are present when PBMCs are incubated with whole <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocyte lysates, hence providing all the signals needed for expansion of T-bet<sup>+</sup> FCRL5<sup>+</sup> and production of anti-PS antibodies. However, no parasite DNA is present when the stimulus is a purified protein or uninfected erythrocyte lysates. This is now explained in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors don't find a correlation between anti-EBA antibodies and any B cell subsets assessed (Figure 5, subsection “Anti-parasite antibodies do not correlate with FCRL5<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> atypical B-cells during malarial anemia in P. falciparum-infected patients”). But we know that some anti-parasite antibodies are made. So… where are those antibodies coming from? Is EBA a good representative Ag? Are multiple B cell subsets contributing those Ab levels?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer indicates, anti-Plasmodium antibodies are produced by at least two different subsets of B cells: atypical and classical (Muellenbeck et al., 2013), which may explain the lack of significant correlation with any of them in our study, which has a limited number of samples, and therefore is only able to detect strong correlations.</p><p>The differential correlation of anti-PS antibodies with atypical B cells versus other B cell subsets should be interpreted as these other subsets may contribute to a lesser extent (or do not contribute at all) to the production of anti-PS antibodies when compared to atypical B cells. We have worded the conclusions carefully to avoid over-interpretation of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it all coming from plasma cells in bone marrow and cannot be measured from PBMCs? If so, then is the fact that most B cell subsets (including plasma cells) don't correlate with anti-PS antibodies meaningful? Maybe the antibodies come from plasma cells in BM, and in fact T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells are an indirect marker of recency since infection, or immune status; and these things might also correlate with anemia severity.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that, although atypical MBCs increase with time after treatment, suggesting that they could be a marker of recency, hemoglobin levels do not correlate with time after treatment (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), indicating that the time at which samples were collected is not the cause of the correlation between atypical MBC and hemoglobin levels.</p><p>Previous studies have established that malaria patients present antibody-secreting classical and atypical MBCs in the circulation (Muellenbeck et al., 2013), indicating that at least a fraction of the total antibodies are not produced by plasma cells in the bone marrow. Bone-marrow plasma cells are normally long-lived and produce low levels of high affinity antibodies against foreign antigens, but they are not considered producers of autoimmune antibodies in healthy adults (Lightman et al. 2019). Additionally, data from Plasmodium infections in mice (Fernandez-Arias et al., 2016 and Rivera-Correa et al. 2017) shows that anti-PS antibody levels decrease rapidly after infection, which would be unusual for bone marrow resident plasma cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper by Rivera-Correa and colleagues, the authors report an intriguing association between anti-phosphotidyl serine antibodies, FcRL5<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup>B cells, and hemoglobin levels among patients presenting with symptomatic malaria. The authors further describe in vitro experiments detailing that FCRL5<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells expand after coculture of naïve PBMC with Pf lysate, and that these expanded cells appear to produce anti-PS antibodies, which strengthens the observations reported and suggest that malarial anemia may be mediated in part by auto-immune antibody production by this B cell subset. The manuscript is clearly written and easy to follow. My major concern with the data presented in this manuscript is that the main results (Figures 1-5) are mainly correlations, and that the correlation results were reported with linear regression. With the small patient numbers (n=19) several of the &quot;significant&quot; correlations may have been driven by 1 or 2 &quot;outliers&quot; with lower hemoglobin, for example. Given the small numbers, nonparametric assessments would have been more appropriate (i.e. Spearman's correlation coefficients as opposed to linear regression).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and detailed review.

Assuming that these repeated measurements are correlated, the authors should have performed some analysis to account for repeated measures within individuals (e.g. generalized estimating equations or mixed effects linear regression) since autocorrelation could also be driving these associations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to clarify that the analysis was performed with 31 unique samples from 24 patients (Results section).
