There are also specialized blood vessels and cells called ‘stromal cells’ within the bone marrow that provide these stem cells with oxygen, nutrients, and other molecules. This local environment, or ‘niche’, plays an important role in regulating the maintenance of these stem cells. But it has not been known whether stem cells can reciprocally regulate their niches.</p><p>Unfortunately, radiation used to treat cancer obliterates the stem cells and their niche; both must recover after such a treatment before the patient can produce blood cells normally again. A protein called Angpt1 is thought to play a role in this post-treatment recovery. Angpt1 is known to regulate blood vessels in the bone marrow, and one influential study had previously suggested that bone cells produce Angpt1, which promotes and regulates the maintenance of the stem cells within the niche. However, this previous study did not directly test this. Thus, it was not clear whether Angpt1 promotes the regeneration of the stem cells themselves or if it regulates the rebuilding of the niche.</p><p>Now, Zhou, Ding and Morrison have genetically engineered mice to make a ‘reporter’ molecule—which glows green when viewed under a microscope—wherever and whenever the gene for Angpt1 is active. These experiments showed where the protein is produced, and unexpectedly revealed that the bone cells do not make Angpt1. Instead, it is the stem cells and the stromal cells in the niche that made the protein. Further experiments showed that deleting the gene for Angpt1 from mice, or just from their bone cells, did not affect blood cell production; nor did it affect the maintenance or regulation of the stem cells.</p><p>Next, Zhou, Ding and Morrison looked at whether Angpt1 might be involved in rebuilding the niche after being exposed to radiation. Some of these irradiated mice had been genetically engineered to lack Angpt1; and, in these mice, blood stem cells and blood cell production recovered more quickly than in mice with Angpt1. The blood vessels in the niche also grew back more quickly in the irradiated mice that lacked Angpt1. However, these regenerated blood vessels were leaky. This suggests that blood stem cells produce Angpt1 to slow the recovery of the niche and reduce leakage from the blood vessels. Thus, blood stem cells can regulate the regeneration of the niches that maintain them.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05521.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05521.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Angiopoietin-1</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>vascular</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL097760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Bo O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation (HHWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells slow the regeneration of their niche after injury to minimize leakage from the niche vasculature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in a specialized bone marrow niche in which Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) perivascular stromal cells and endothelial cells secrete factors that promote their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding and Morrison, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenbaum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morrison and Scadden, 2014</xref>).

Moreover, it has not been tested whether <italic>Angpt1</italic> deficiency affects HSC function in vivo. Thus, the physiological function and sources of Angpt1 in the bone marrow remain uncertain.</p><p>Angpt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suri et al., 1996</xref>), and its receptor Tie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumont et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Puri et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1996</xref>), are necessary for embryonic vascular development. Tie2 is mainly expressed by endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schnurch and Risau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kopp et al., 2005</xref>) but also by HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iwama et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Angpt1</italic> over-expression promotes the development of larger, more numerous, more highly branched, and less leaky blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suri et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thurston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression by primitive hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs) promotes angiogenesis during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takakura et al., 2000</xref>).

Nonetheless, Angpt1 does regulate angiogenesis in response to a variety of injuries in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kopp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeansson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), promoting angiogenesis in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thurston et al., 1999</xref>) while negatively regulating angiogenesis in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Visconti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeansson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). A key function of Angpt1 is to reduce the leakiness of blood vessels, perhaps by tightening junctions between endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thurston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brindle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2014</xref>).</p><p>Irradiation and chemotherapy not only deplete HSCs but also disrupt their niche in the bone marrow, particularly the sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knospe et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kopp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooper et al., 2009</xref>) around which most HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiel et al., 2005</xref>) as well as <italic>Scf-</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12-</italic>, and LepR-expressing stromal cells reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding and Morrison, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Omatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 4 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see, all of your reviewers felt the work has merit and is in principle suited for <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, the reviewers commented favorably on the rigorous quality of the study and the clarity of the writing. However, each of the reviewers raised some concerns, which you will want to address in revising the work. Here, I point to reviewer #1's major points, as resolving them does seem to be important to make the conclusions that you do. In fact, as pointed out by both reviewers 1 and 2, most effects do seem to be mediated by LepR+ stromal cells, rather than HSCs/progenitors. To unequivocally resolve this point, it seems reasonable to address whether the Ang1 knockout affects stromal cells in the bone marrow directly or indirectly, and in particular whether any of the cellular changes in the Mx1-Cre Ang1fl/fl bone marrow, when transplanted into LepR+ stromal Ang1 knockout recipients can promote HSC and vasculature regeneration that is HSC/HSC progeny independent. As pointed out by reviewers 1 and 3, it is important to determine whether Ang1, Ang2 or Tie2 expression change upon irradiation and upon transplantation during recovery. As the reviewers suggest, a transplantation experiment with just HSCs and their downstream lineages is needed to assess whether these proteins from HSCs/progenitors have an effect on their niche or whether the effects come solely from LepR+ stromal cells. Reviewer 3 also notes the sometimes opposing roles of Ang1 and Ang2, making this all the more important to investigate and resolve.</p><p>Reviewer 3 also raises some valid points regarding regression of vessels. Again, along the lines of reviewer 1 with regards to concern, the reviewer questions whether the loss of Ang-1 itself has a direct effect on BM recovery or whether the effect on BM recovery is secondary to vascular leakiness. The reviewer suggests that introducing exogenous Ang-1 into WT irradiated recipient, or injecting an unrelated anti-permeability agent in Mx-1→ Lepr irradiated recipients would help resolve this issue. The experiment seems straightforward and useful to solidify the claims made.</p><p>Finally, reviewer 4 raises two important issues regarding the claim that the Ang1/Tie2 axis has a role in regeneration of vasculature after irradiation. In particular, he/she raises 3 simple but important points, which merit addressing in your revised manuscript. The first issue, that of % of cells expressing Ang1 seems straightforward to correct. The issue of whether you've completely knocked out Ang1 in the osteoblasts is critical to resolve. The issue of the vasculature is one that has haunted all of your reviewers in different ways, and here it seems essential to shore up the additional issues raised by reviewer 4 in this regard.</p><p>If you can satisfactorily address the issues delineated above, <italic>eLife</italic> would welcome revised text and figures (and possibly a revised title, pending the outcome of the study).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Zhou et al. examined the cellular source and functional importance of a secreted molecule Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) in the HSC niche. Previous studies have identified HSCs and the perivascular stromal cells as potential source(s) for Ang1. Here, Bo et al. took one step forward and systematically knocked out Ang1 from a wide variety of cell types in the bone marrow to examine its function during homeostasis and upon irradiation. They demonstrated that although Ang1 is dispensable for HSC maintenance under steady condition, Ang1 delays HSC regeneration and bone marrow vasculature recovery after irradiation. Overall, this study represents a comprehensive analysis of Ang1's function in the HSC niche. The analysis is rigorous, and the manuscript is well written. How niche recovery is regulated after injury is an important topic which remains poorly understood. This study by Zhou et al. provides an interesting example, and will be of great interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, a few major points, if unresolved, can influence the authors' conclusions and interpretations.</p><p>The title states that “Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells regulate the regeneration of their niche by secreting Angiopoietin-1”, which strongly implies that HSCs play a major and active role repairing their niche. However, from the presented data, most effects seem to be mediated by LepR+ stromal cells, while the evidence supporting the role of HSCs/progenitors is fairly weak. For example, transplanting wild-type bone marrow cells into Lepr-cre; Ang1fl/gfp recipients accelerate the regeneration of HSC and bone marrow vasculature, but transplanting Ang1 knockout bone marrow cells into irradiated wild type recipients does not have an effect. Although transplanting Ang1 bone marrow cells into Lepr-cre; Ang1fl/gfp recipients seem to have a greater effect, this data by itself does not unequivocally prove that the difference is mediated by HSCs and their progenitors due to the following reasons:</p><p>A) The expression of Mx1 promoter is fairly complex and dynamics, which includes HSCs, progenitors, and many different stroma cells in the bone marrow. In a bone marrow transplant, in addition to HSCs and progenitors, a wide variety of other cell types in the bone marrow are also transplanted together into the recipients. While many of these cells do not sustain in the recipient for long-term, short-term effects from these transplanted mesenchymal cells cannot be excluded. Does Ang1 knockout affect additional stroma cells in the bone marrow directly or indirectly? Can any of these cellular changes in the Mx1-Cre Ang1fl/fl bone marrow, when transplanted into recipients that has Ang1 knockout in the LepR+ stroma, promote HSC and vasculature regeneration that is HSC/HSC progeny independent? These possibilities cannot be formally ruled out with the experimental data presented.</p><p>B) Although the authors did a thorough analysis regarding Ang1 expression during steady state, does Ang1 expression change upon irradiation and upon transplantation (i.e., is it persistent in HSC lineages and the LepR+ cells? Do other cells which normally do not express high levels of Ang1 start to express Ang1? )</p><p>These issues will be difficult to resolve with merely negative data. Hence, the authors should do a transplantation experiment with just HSCs and their downstream lineages (e.g., isolate hematopoietic lineages from the Mx1-Cre; Ang1fl/fl mice and transplant into recipient mice). This will be an unambiguous support that Ang1 from Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells truly has an effect on their niche. Otherwise it will be the HSC niche itself, and specifically the LepR+ cells, mediate niche recovery, with minor help from HSCs at the very best. This will still be an interesting discovery, but the authors will need to revise their Title and manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Angiopoietin-1/Tie2 signaling has been shown to regulate adult hematopoiesis and hematopoietic recovery. Contradictory reports have been published on the source of Ang-1 in the hematopoietic stem cell niche and the role of osteoblasts in the niche. In this manuscript, the authors systematically evaluate Ang-1 expression in various BM HSC niche compartments by using state-of-art lineage analysis and excellent quality imaging. The role of Ang-1 in steady state hematopoiesis and HSC regeneration is studied by using various genetic models. It is quite clear from the BM transplantation experiments that Ang-1 can decrease hematopoietic recovery and deletion of Ang-1 improves the BM sinusoidal recovery. Ang-1 from LepR-expressing stromal cells seems to be a key player in regulating the niche regeneration.</p><p>This is an interesting study that settles a paradox in the field. The data are very convincing and thorough. Publication is recommended with high priority.</p><p>1) Col2.3-Cre;Ang-1fl/fl mice had normal WBC counts and normal HSC frequencies. However, in the transplanted mice, the T cell levels seemed to be affected during recovery. Could the authors comment on CLP levels in these mice and about their thymus?</p><p>2) The authors show that Ang-1 from endothelial or hematopoietic cells is not required for hematopoiesis by generating Tie2-cre;Ang-1fl/fl mice. Does it affect the angioblast differentiation? How does the endothelium look like? It would be good to check the deletion efficiency in these mice.</p><p>3) After irradiation, hematopoietic regeneration was accelerated in LepR+cell specific Ang-1 deleted mice at day 8 and day 12, although the CD150+CD48- HSCs frequency was not affected in Mx-1cre; ang1 mice. Could the authors comment on ST-HSCs?</p><p>4) Technical question: Methycellulose medum *M3434 may not be optimized for detecting CFU-Mk and it could be difficult to distinguish based on morphology. Did the authors stain the CFU-Mk or simply based on morphology?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Zhou et al. entitled “Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells regulate the regeneration of their niche by secreting Angiopoietin-1”, the authors sought to determine the role of Ang-1 in the BM niche during irradiation recovery. The authors describe in detail that while Ang-1 is broadly expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors, that neither global loss of Ang-1, nor Ang-1 deletions from various compartments of the BM using different conditional knockouts affected hematopoiesis. Interestingly, deletion of Ang-1 from hematopoietic cells and LepR+ stromal cells accelerated vascular and hematopoietic recovery after radiation. While the work presented here is quite extensive and emphasizes the contribution of the vascular niche integrity during BM recovery, some revisions remain to be addressed in order for it to appeal to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) What is the expression pattern change of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie2 in the BM after irradiation and during recovery?

It seems that vascular permeability was the most different on day 28 in Mx-1→ Lepr, AFTER vessel regression has caught up and normalized with concomitant LSK recovery.

However, from the presented data, most effects seem to be mediated by LepR+ stromal cells, while the evidence supporting the role of HSCs/progenitors is fairly weak. For example, transplanting wild-type bone marrow cells into Lepr-cre; Ang1fl/gfp recipients accelerate the regeneration of HSC and bone marrow vasculature, but transplanting Ang1 knockout bone marrow cells into irradiated wild type recipients does not have an effect. Although transplanting Ang1 bone marrow cells into Lepr-cre; Ang1fl/gfp recipients seem to have a greater effect, this data by itself does not unequivocally prove that the difference is mediated by HSCs and their progenitors due to the following reasons</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) The expression of Mx1 promoter is fairly complex and dynamics, which includes HSCs, progenitors, and many different stroma cells in the bone marrow. In a bone marrow transplant, in addition to HSCs and progenitors, a wide variety of other cell types in the bone marrow are also transplanted together into the recipients. While many of these cells do not sustain in the recipient for long-term, short-term effects from these transplanted mesenchymal cells cannot be excluded. Does Ang1 knockout affect additional stroma cells in the bone marrow directly or indirectly? Can any of these cellular changes in the Mx1-Cre Ang1fl/fl bone marrow, when transplanted into recipients that has Ang1 knockout in the LepR+ stroma, promote HSC and vasculature regeneration that is HSC/HSC progeny independent? These possibilities cannot be formally ruled out with the experimental data presented</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that Angpt1 synthesized by LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells appears to have a greater effect on the phenotypes we studied as compared to Angpt1 synthesized by hematopoietic cells. This is likely because in the early days (day 8 and 12) after irradiation and bone marrow transplantation, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are more rare than LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells. However, <italic>Lepr</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>; Angpt1</italic><sup><italic>GFP/fl</italic></sup> mice transplanted with <italic>Angpt1</italic> deficient bone marrow cells always had significantly faster vascular and bone marrow regeneration than <italic>Lepr</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>; Ang1</italic><sup><italic>GFP/fl</italic></sup> mice transplanted with control bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figure 6A, 6B, 6D and 7J</xref>) as well as significantly greater vessel leakiness in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and 8D</xref>). Therefore, the data are consistent with our conclusions.</p><p><italic>Mx1</italic>-Cre does recombine in a variety of stromal cells other than hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, including endothelial cells, perivascular stromal cells and osteoblasts.

Enzymatic dissociation is required to obtain significant numbers of stromal cells from the bone marrow (Cell Stem Cell 15:154). Without enzymatic dissociation, the frequency of VE-Cadherin<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells or LepR<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells was less than one cell per million whole bone marrow cells (data not shown). Consistent with this, no CFU-F colonies could be detected when one million non-enzymatically dissociated bone marrow cells were cultured for 2 weeks (data not shown).</p><p><italic>B) Although the authors did a thorough analysis regarding Ang1 expression during steady state, does Ang1 expression change upon irradiation and upon transplantation (i.e., is it persistent in HSC lineages and the LepR+ cells? Do other cells which normally do not express high levels of Ang1 start to express Ang1? )</italic></p><p>We have not detected any changes in <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression after irradiation and transplantation. We have added new data to the manuscript in which we analyzed <italic>Angpt1</italic>-GFP expression in the bone marrow at days 8, 12, 16, and 28 after irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Among hematopoietic cells, <italic>Angpt1</italic>-GFP expression was still highly restricted to c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors and megakaryocytes at all time points analyzed after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Among stromal cells, <italic>Angpt1</italic>-GFP expression was still highly restricted to LepR<sup>+</sup> perivascular stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B</xref> and 2C). Even after irradiation we did not detect <italic>Angpt1</italic>-GFP expression by endothelial cells or osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2D and 2H</xref>). Therefore, we did not observe any changes in <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression after irradiation and transplantation.</p><p><italic>These issues will be difficult to resolve with merely negative data. Hence, the authors should do a transplantation experiment with just HSCs and their downstream lineages (e.g., isolate hematopoietic lineages from the Mx1-Cre; Ang1fl/fl mice and transplant into recipient mice). This will be an unambiguous support that Ang1 from Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells truly has an effect on their niche. Otherwise it will be the HSC niche itself, and specifically the LepR+ cells, mediate niche recovery, with minor help from HSCs at the very best. This will still be an interesting discovery, but the authors will need to revise their Title and manuscript accordingly</italic>.</p><p>We have performed two new experiments to address this issue directly. First, we transplanted 4000 LSK (Lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>) cells from control and <italic>Mx1-cre; Angpt1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice into <italic>Lepr</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>; Angpt1</italic><sup><italic>GFP/fl</italic></sup> mice to test the effects of hematopoietic progenitors uncontaminated by stromal cells on vascular and hematopoietic regeneration after irradiation. We found that the mice transplanted with <italic>Angpt1</italic> deficient LSK cells had significantly higher bone marrow cellularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), LSK cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and better vascular morphology in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L and 7M</xref>) than mice transplanted with control LSK cells at 14 days after irradiation. The mice transplanted with <italic>Angpt1</italic> deficient, but not control, LSK cells also exhibited vascular leakage in bone marrow at 28 days after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and 8E</xref>). These data demonstrate that <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression by hematopoietic cells regulates hematopoietic and vascular recovery after irradiation.</p><p>The only hematopoietic cells other than c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that express Angpt1 are megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-1F and 1J-1L</xref>). To test whether Angpt1 expression by megakaryocytes contributes to the regulation of hematopoietic and vascular recovery we conditionally deleted <italic>Angpt1</italic> from megakaryocyte lineage cells using <italic>Pf4-</italic>Cre and transplanted whole bone marrow cells from control and <italic>Pf4-cre; Angpt1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice into <italic>Lepr</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>; Angpt1</italic><sup><italic>GFP/fl</italic></sup> recipients.

Regressed sinusoids are dilated and have fewer surrounding hematopoietic cells as compared to normal sinusoids. We analyzed sinusoid morphology in thin optical sections through a segment of the femurs of mice. The sections were transverse sections through the longitudinal axis of the femurs, such that we would observe cross-sections through most sinusoids. In these thin optical sections, we first counted the total number of sinusoids in the section. Sinusoids were identified in these sections based on vessel morphology and bright VE-cadherin staining (VE-cadherin staining was dimmer in arterioles and capillaries). We then counted the number of regressed sinusoids in the same sections to arrive at the percentage of regressed sinusoids, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>. Regressed sinusoids were distinguished from non-regressed sinusoids by being larger in diameter and having few hematopoietic cells around them. This is illustrated in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> (showing normal sinusoids) versus 7D (showing regressed sinusoids) that we have added to the manuscript.
