disease. However, little is known about how blood glucose impacts heart formation. Using a chemically defined human pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation system, we found that high glucose inhibits the maturation of cardiomyocytes at genetic, structural, metabolic, electrophysiological, and biomechanical levels by promoting nucleotide biosynthesis through the pentose phosphate pathway. Blood glucose level in embryos is stable in utero during normal pregnancy, but glucose uptake by fetal cardiac tissue is drastically reduced in late gestational stages. In a murine model of diabetic pregnancy, fetal hearts showed cardiomyopathy with increased mitotic activity and decreased maturity. These data suggest that high glucose suppresses cardiac maturation, providing a possible mechanistic basis for congenital heart disease in diabetic pregnancy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29330.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, affecting nearly 1 in 100 children born. It can involve a weak heart, narrowed arteries, narrowed heart valves, or the main arteries of the heart switching places. These conditions can be fatal if untreated and often need surgery to correct.</p><p>The mother’s blood sugar levels during pregnancy can have a large effect on how likely the baby is to have congenital heart disease. If a pregnant woman has poorly controlled diabetes with rapidly fluctuating sugar levels, she may be at a higher risk of having a child with the condition. High sugar levels in the mother’s blood make the baby up to five times more likely to have congenital heart disease. It has been difficult to find out exactly how sugar levels interfere with heart development because diabetes can affect the fetus in many ways.</p><p>Nakano et al. used stem cells and experiments in pregnant mice with diabetes to hone in on how high sugar levels affect the fetus’s heart development. First, heart cells were grown from human stem cells, and exposed to high levels of glucose in a dish. This revealed a new mechanism for how high sugar levels affect heart formation: the cells created too many nucleotides, the building blocks of molecules such as DNA. It turns out that high glucose levels boosted a chemical process in the cell known as the pentose phosphate pathway. Some of the products of this pathway are nucleotides. This made the cells divide rapidly, but did not allow them to mature well compared with cells exposed to normal levels of sugar. In another experiment, Nakano et al. found similar results in pregnant diabetic mice. The heart cells in mouse fetuses also divided quickly but matured slowly when exposed to high sugar levels.</p><p>An estimated 60 million women at an age to have children have diabetes. These new findings help us to understand why and how these women are more likely to have children with congenital heart disease, and further study will hopefully lead to a better way to prevent this condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human pluripotent stem cell</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>cardiac</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

the most common type of birth defect affecting 0.8% of human live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fahed et al., 2013</xref>). Although genetic factors play a significant role in the development of CHD, current genomic technologies, including exome sequencing and SNP arrays, have provided a genetic diagnosis for only 11% of the probands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelb et al., 2013</xref>), highlighting the crucial role of non-genetic contributors.</p><p>Among the non-genetic factors that influence the fetal heart, maternal hyperglycemia is the most common medical condition, associated with a 2–5-fold increase in CHD independent of genetic contributors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centers for Disease Control, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simeone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yogev and Visser, 2009</xref>). Diabetic pregnancy is often accompanied by maternal complications including vasculopathy, neuropathy, and insulin resistance, which potentially affect fetal cardiac formation indirectly. These systemic complications are often subclinical, hindering the dissection of the pathomechanism of CHD in diabetic pregnancy. Thus, despite the established association between maternal hyperglycemia and malformation of the fetal heart, little is known about how glucose levels impact cardiomyocyte development and how hyperglycemia affects heart formation in diabetic pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaspar et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The metabolic environment is one potential non-genetic determinant of cell proliferation and differentiation. Cells display distinct metabolic characteristics depending on their differentiation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tohyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), and the fuel type used by the cells serves not merely as a source of energy but also as a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentiation of stem or progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oburoglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiraki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shyh-Chang et al., 2013</xref>). However, little is known about the mechanism. Cardiomyocytes shift their energy substrate during late embryonic and neonatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Makinde et al., 1998</xref>). Glucose is the major energy source during the early developmental stages. Oxidative phosphorylation is low until E10.5 of developing rodent hearts and rapidly increases between E10.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox and Gunberg, 1972</xref>). This coincides with the rapid maturation of the mitochondrial structure in embryonic cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackler et al., 1971</xref>). Shortly after birth, fatty acid oxidation becomes the predominant source of ATP production to meet the high energy demand of the maturing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Warshaw and Terry, 1970</xref>). These metabolic changes occur as a consequence of changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters. However, it remains unclear whether and how these metabolic changes, in turn, regulate the cardiac differentiation program.</p><p>Here, we describe the use of in vitro human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and an in vivo murine diabetic model to show that glucose not only induces cardiomyocyte proliferation but also inhibits cardiomyocyte maturation. Glucose can be metabolized in multiple catabolic and anabolic pathways, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Our chemical screening revealed that the pro-mitotic and anti-maturation effect of high glucose is regulated by glucose-derived deoxynucleotide biosynthesis through PPP. In vivo measurement of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG accumulation revealed that glucose uptake is drastically suppressed during the late gestational and early postnatal stages. Exposure to high blood glucose in a murine model of diabetic pregnancy resulted in higher mitosis and delayed maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in vivo.

After glucose deprivation, the Laconic construct was introduced into hESC-CMs via adenovirus as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">John et al., 2008</xref>). In hESC-CMs differentiated in standard 25 mM glucose, bath-applied lactate (4 mM) caused a rapid increase in intracellular lactate (measured as a decrease FRET ratio), demonstrating the efficacy of the probe. Subsequent addition of pyruvate evoked a similar but smaller elevation of intracellular lactate. Under these conditions, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with sodium cyanide (NaCN) had only a minor effect on the intracellular lactate level. This result suggests that hESC-CMs that are differentiated in standard 25 mM glucose do not actively metabolize pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper panel). By contrast, addition of 4 mM pyruvate to glucose-reduced hESC-CMs did not cause intracellular lactate accumulation, and addition of NaCN in the presence of pyruvate resulted in a substantial increase in lactate level. This result is consistent with pyruvate utilization by mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel). Together, these data suggest that mitochondria metabolize pyruvate in hESC-CMs that are cultured in glucose-reduced conditions, but not in the presence of glucose.</p><p>Third, we assessed cellular respiration of hESC-CM using the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience), in which oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured in real time in a basal state and in response to oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor), FCCP (carbonilcyanide <italic>p</italic>-triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a mitochondrial uncoupler), and rotenone or myxothiazol (complex I or III inhibitors, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although base-line mitochondrial respiration was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), ATP-linked respiration was elevated in the no glucose condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Glucose-reduced hESC-CMs also demonstrated substantially larger maximum respiration capacity, as indicated by the response to FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Although the peak amplitude of the transient (ΔF/F0) did not show a significant difference, the maximum upstroke (V<sub>max</sub>) was significantly faster and the time to 50% decay was significantly shorter in the glucose-reduced group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). This pattern is consistent with the previous report demonstrating the role of thyroid hormone on hiPSC-CM maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and suggestive of an inhibitory role of high glucose on hESC-CM maturation.</p><p>Fifth, taking advantage of our monolayer culture system, we examined electrophysiological properties, using a multi-electrode array (MEA) culture plate as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).

Both average maximum contraction speed and average maximum relaxation speed were higher in those hESC-CMs cultured in 0 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

This metabolic switch has long been believed to be an adaptation of cardiomyocytes to facilitate more efficient production of ATP. However, our study has revealed that a drastic suppression of glucose uptake occurs during gestational stages, long before the metabolic switch after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our in vitro hESC-CM glucose-deprivation experiments mimic this in vivo glucose starvation. The results suggest that glucose deprivation induces cardiac maturation at genetic, morphological, metabolic, electrophysiological and biomechanical levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), suggesting that glucose is a negative regulator of the maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo, as well as a positive regulator of the mitotic activity of these cells. Perturbation of the natural glucose starvation results in higher mitotic activity and lower maturity of cardiomyocytes in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together, our results suggest that the metabolic switch during perinatal stages is necessary not only to meet the energy demand but also to induce the genetic program that facilitates the maturation of the cardiomyocytes in vivo. An important question that is yet to be answered is how the drastic suppression of intracellular glucose uptake is achieved in the fetal heart. As the fetal glucose environment is primarily determined by maternal metabolism and kept relatively constant in utero, one possibility is that the glucose uptake is limited at the glucose transporter level in fetal cardiomyocytes. In fact, fetal heart switches its glucose transporter isoform at around this stage. Understanding how glucose regulates the genetic program and how the glucose uptake is regulated at the genetic level will be key to further dissecting the cross-talk between the genetic and non-genetic factors governing heart formation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP as a key mechanism in balancing proliferation and maturation</title><p>Glucose is the most fundamental and commonly available nutrient for the cells. Hence, the activity of the glucose metabolic pathways is tightly regulated in cells. Glucose is broken down to extract energy through the glycolysis pathway and also shunts to supply 5-carbon sugars and NADPH through the PPP. In our study, chemical inhibition of glucose metabolic pathways in hESC-CMs revealed that it is not the catabolic breakdown of glucose to extract energy but rather the anabolic use of glucose to build nucleotides that is responsible for the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac maturation. Most of the proliferating cells synthesize nucleotides de novo from glucose, glutamine, and CO<sub>2</sub>. In our hESC-CM experiments, blocking the PPP and nucleotide biosynthesis inhibited the glucose-mediated induction of mitosis and suppression of maturation, and supplementation of nucleotides was sufficient to recapitulate the effect of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). These data suggest that nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP is the key regulator of the pro-mitotic/anti-maturation effect of glucose. Interestingly, cardiomyocyte maturation was not fully induced by blocking of the cell cycle with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or paclitaxel, neither of which directly impact the nucleotide kinetics. Therefore, it is not the cell cycle in general but the nucleotides themselves that blocks the maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is well-documented that there is generally an inverse correlation between cell proliferation and differentiation during developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2016</xref>).

To our knowledge, our in vitro study is the first to demonstrate that environmental glucose itself, if excessive, directly impacts cardiac differentiation. The formation of the heart is regulated by both genetic and non-genetic factors, with the latter playing important roles particularly during late-stage cardiogenesis. An interesting aspect of the interaction between genetic and non-genetic mechanisms is that they seem to reinforce each other mutually.

Libraries for RNA-Seq shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref> were prepared with the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit. The workflow consists of mRNA enrichment, cDNA generation, end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, strand selection and PCR amplification. Different adaptors were used for multiplexing samples in one lane. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 for a paired end 2 × 150 run (GSE84815). A data quality check was done on an Illumina SAV. De-multiplexing was performed with the Illumina Bcl2fastq2 v 2.17 program. Short read sequences generated from an Illumina Sequencer were aligned to the UCSC human reference genome hg19 downloaded from support.Illumina.com (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html">http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html</ext-link>) using TopHat from the Tuxedo Tools. The average overall read mapping rate reached over 82 percent (average = 82.43 percent). The output was in the form of BAM (Binary Sequence Alignment/Map format) files. These outputs contain information for assigning location and quantifying the short-read alignments obtained from the RNA-seq samples. This is necessary for downstream analyses such as annotation, transcript abundance comparison and polymorphism detection. Counts or gene expression matrices were generated using HTSeq, which quantified the reads per transcript. The expression matrices were log transformed and normalized using the rlog function in the Deseq2 package. The normalized gene expression matrices were used as input for SaVanT (Signature Visualization Tools), which allowed for the visualization of molecular signatures directly related to heart development as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>hESC-CMs and mouse embryonic hearts were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37°C in a dissociation enzyme solution with occasional pipetting to a single-cell suspension. The enzyme solution contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, 15140–122), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), collagenase 2 mg/ml (Worthington, CLS-2), dispase 0.25 mg/ml (Gibco, 17105–041), and DNAase I (ThermoFisher) in PBS. The cells were analyzed with the following antibodies: MF20 (mouse, 1:100, Hybridoma Bank), Tnnt2 (rabbit, 1:250, Sigma-Aldrich), MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (ThermoFisher), JC-1 (Abcam), and EdU (100 μl of 10 mM EdU solution per 10 g of mouse, ThermoFisher). For MF20 and Tnnt2, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (BD Biosciences) was used. Stained cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (LSRII, BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunocytochemistry and morphological analysis</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked for an hour with 5% normal goat serum, and incubated with mouse alpha actinin antibody (Sigma) followed by Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (ThermoFisher).

The videos were converted from .mts to .avi format at native resolution using commercially available software and loaded into the MotionGUI program. The conversion between pixels and real distance was performed within the MotionGUI program using a reference image with unit divisions of 100 um, taken under the same objective and video zoom settings as the cell videos, to yield a pixel size of 0.681125. This pixel size was used for all contractility assessments. Motion vectors were calculated and the data were evaluated upon completion. All samples were subjected to the same post-processing procedures in order to ensure consistency during comparative analysis. Each video sample was post-processed using neighbor-based cleaning with the vector-based cleaning criterion within the program. The threshold for this post-processing method was set to two for all samples and was adequate for improving the signal-to-noise ratio enough to identify peaks clearly corresponding to beating events in most samples. A small number of videos suffering from significant noise issues were separately subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency domain cleaning with a cut-off frequency of 1 Hz. Only one post-processing method was applied to one video at one time. All other parameters of the MotionGUI program not outlined here were set to their respective default values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of intracellular lactate level by Laconic</title><p>The lactate biosensor Laconic was a gift from Dr. Barros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">San Martín et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of Laconic in hESC-CM was achieved using engineered adenoviruses encoding the construct. Expression of the construct was sufficiently high after 36–48 hr for FRET experiments or microscopy imaging. All cells were imaged live without fixation. Images (16 bit) were acquired using a microscope (Eclipse TE300; Nikon) fitted with a 60× (1.4 NA) oil immersion lens (Nikon) and equipped with a filter cube comprising a CFP bandpass excitation filter, 436/20b, together with a longpass dichroic mirror (455DCLP; Chroma Technology Corp). Two LEDs (Philips Lumileds), one emitting at 455 ± 20 nm (royal blue) and the other emitting at 505 ± 15 nm (cyan) were used as light sources. Ratiometric FRET measurements were obtained from the YFP and CFP images acquired simultaneously using a Dual View image splitter (Optical Insights) equipped with a 505 nm longpass dichroic filter to separate the CFP and YFP signals, a CFP emission filter (480/30), and a YFP emission filter (535/40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">John et al., 2008</xref>). Images were captured with a Cascade 512B digital camera (Photometrics).

Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyser (Seahorse Bioscience) in unbuffered DMEM assay medium supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and with or without 25 mM glucose. OCR was measured before and after the sequential addition of 0.75 µM oligomycin, 0.5 µM FCCP and 0.75 µM of rotenone/myxothiazol. OCR was normalized to protein concentration using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Mitochondrial respiration was calculated as the difference between total and rotenone/myxothiazol rates. Maximal respiration was the response to FCCP. ATP-linked respiration was represented by the oligomycin-sensitive respiration rate, whereas uncoupled respiration was represented by the difference between oligomycin and rotenone/myxothiazol rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Multi-electrode array</title><p>hESC-CMs at the stage of hCM14 were plated on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) containing 120 integrated TiN electrodes (30 µm diameter, 200 µm interelectrode spacing). The MEAs were placed in an incubator with a temperature of 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Two days were given to allow the cardiomyocytes to well attach the MEAs before recording started. Local field potentials at each electrode were collected over a period of 5 min every day in total with a sampling rate of 1 KHz using the MEA2100-HS120 system (Multichannel systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Data analysis was carried out using the MC_DataTool (Multichannel Systems), Origin (OriginLab Corporation) and Matlab (MathWorks). Data shown are based on three independent hESC-CM preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mass spectrometry-based metabolic measurements</title><p>The experiments were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krall et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates, so that the final cell count at the time of metabolite extraction was about 7*10<sup>5</sup> and this was even across all cell lines. To extract intracellular metabolites, cells were briefly rinsed with cold 150 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.3), followed by the addition of 1 ml cold 80% MeOH on dry ice. Cell scrapers were used to detach cells, and the cell suspension was transferred into Eppendorf tubes. Extracted metabolites were transferred into glass vials and dried down under vacuum. For the LC-MS-based analysis, the samples were resuspended in 70% acetonitrile and 50 μl were injected onto a Luna NH2 column (150 mm x 2 mm, Phenomenex). Separation was achieved using A) 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>AcO (pH 9.9) and B) ACN. The gradient started with 15% A) going to 90% A) over 18 min, followed by an isocratic step for 9 min and reversal to the initial 15% A) for 7 min. Metabolites were quantified with TraceFinder 3.3 using accurate mass measurements (≤3 ppm) and retention times of pure standards. Data analysis was performed using the statistical language R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Gene expression analysis by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted from the tissue or the cells cultured with a specific concentration of glucose together with or without titrated metabolic pathway inhibitors using the Direct-zol RNA mini prep kit (Zymo research).

Warmed pregnant mice or pups were injected intravenously or intraperitoneally, respectively, with ~90 microCi (~3.33 MBq) of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG. After 2 hr, the mice were sacrificed. Preliminary experiments suggested that 2 hr was sufficiently long for <sup>18</sup>F-FDG to reach maximum accumulation in each organ and embryo. Fetal or neonatal hearts were separated from the other tissue (carcass), and the mass and radioactivity in both the hearts and the carcasses were measured using a standard balance and a Wizard 3’ automatic gamma counter (Perkin Elmer), respectively. The radioactivity levels in the pup carcasses were higher than the detection limit of the gamma counter, so the expected gamma counter values for the pup carcasses were calculated on the basis of the decay-corrected injected dose of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG and known conversion values between microCi and CPM on the gamma counter. To calculate the ‘Normalized FDG accumulation’, radioactive accumulation in each heart was divided by heart weight and then further divided by the total radioactivity in each embryo or pup. This last normalization is to account for differences in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG injected dose and accessibility to the embryos and pups. Averages and standard errors of the mean (SEM) were calculated, and the values were normalized such that E10.5 embryo FDG accumulation was set to 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Mouse embryos were isolated in cold PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 1~2 hr, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose in PBS solution overnight.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chuck Murry (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Nakano et al. study the role that glucose metabolism plays in cardiomyocyte maturation. They report that glucose starvation enhances multiple indices of maturity in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes, and they identify the PPP and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways as key components of the glucose effect. They demonstrate that glucose uptake in the heart diminishes markedly prenatally, prior to the conversion to fatty acid metabolism, and they provide evidence that maternal hyperglycemia delays cardiomyocyte maturation in utero. They therefore conclude that the control of nucleotide bioavailability is a key regulator of cardiomyocyte maturation that may play a role in congenital heart disease associated with maternal diabetes.</p><p>The maturation of stem cell derivatives such as cardiomyocytes is under intense study, and metabolism has emerged as an important regulator. The identification of nucleotide biosynthesis as a key regulator of maturation was surprising and significantly advances our understanding. Overall, this manuscript is significant, and the experiments appear to have been performed carefully. A few key additions and adjustments (as described below) will strengthen the message of the manuscript and enhance its impact.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors used three different types of parameters to evaluate cardiomyocyte maturation: mRNA expression of cardiac markers, mitochondrial function, and calcium transients. Thus, maturation is well described at the molecular and metabolic levels, but less well at the structural and physiological level. While it is possible that this is an intervention that advances maturation on all fronts, it seems equally possible that different subnetworks might be regulated differently. The authors' conclusions regarding cardiomyocyte maturation will be better supported with a more comprehensive evaluation of additional indices of maturity. Structurally, it would be helpful to see assessment of cell size and myofibril content/maturity. Physiologically, it would be helpful to evaluate spontaneous beating rate, measurements of contractile strength (e.g. via traction force microscopy, although other ways would work also), and action potential. Finally, since the authors' RNAseq studies should have yielded data on ssTnI to cTnI isoform switching, down-regulation of HCN4, and up-regulation of KCNJ2, it would be of interest to present these data as additional indices of maturation.</p><p>2) The authors argue that nucleotide deprivation is a key mechanism in driving cardiac maturation. This conclusion would be more convincing if, rather than using chemical inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis, the authors used siRNA knock down of rate limiting enzymes (or even CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the relevant enzymes, unless such deletions are lethal) to further solidify their model.</p><p>3) The maximum OCRs in the high glucose cells are unusually low. Other groups, using 25mM glucose conditions, have seen much greater induction of O<sub>2</sub> consumption after uncoupling mitochondria. In the experiments presented here, OCR does not increase above the basal rate. This reduces confidence in the veracity of the flux measurements. Can the authors address this discrepancy?</p><p>4) It is possible that the glucose-starved cells are energy-starved or otherwise stressed. Did the authors measure ATP levels? Is there cell death? Are various stress pathways or autophagic pathways activated?</p><p>5) Increased PGC1a expression level and the MitoTracker staining assay suggest that the 0mM glucose condition stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis. Could the authors perform a mtDNA to nDNA ratio assay to see whether 0mM glucose stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>: It seems that the beating rate was 1 per 10 sec.

All the parameters confirmed the enhancement of the maturity by glucose restriction.</p><p>Structural maturity: Cell size was measured by the forward scatter (FSC) from flow cytometry, which is more accurate and unbiased than 2D cell area analysis. Total of 30,000 cell measurements in each group clearly showed a significant increase in the average cell size. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> is a representative histogram and the average of the mode FSC from biological triplicates. This result is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>. As another parameter, we measured sarcomere length by a-actinin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Unfortunately, sarcomere length did not show a significant difference between glucose 25 vs 0mM culture. This result is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29330.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29330-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>Physiological maturity: Contractility was assessed by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. Cell video clips were loaded onto MotionGUI program (Huebsch et al., 2015) to acquire contraction/relaxation speed. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, both contraction speed and relaxation speed were significantly faster in hESC-CMs cultured without glucose, suggesting an increase in functional maturity of hESC-CMs in glucose-restricted condition. Although not statistically significant, beating rate tends to be decreased in hESC-CMs under glucose-restricted condition. This result is consistent with the developmental observation that the spontaneous beating rate of cardiomyocytes decreases as the immature pacemaker-like (primitive) cardiomyocytes maturate into working myocardium-like cardiomyocyte with less automaticity (Christoffel et al., 2004, Review; many other reviews). Together, these data suggest that glucose restriction enhances cardiomyocyte contractility, thereby promoting the differentiation of immature pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes maturate into working myocyte-like cells.</p><p>Genetical maturity: We extracted the data of several cardiac markers from our RNA-seq data. The TNNI2 level was decreased while TNNT2 and IRX4 levels were increased in glucose-restricted condition, indicating the maturation of hESC-CMs. However, levels of TNNI3, HCN4, and KCNJ2 did not change. These data suggest that, even though glucose-restriction induces the hESC-CM maturity, it does not achieve the maturity level of postnatal cardiomyocytes. This result is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors argue that nucleotide deprivation is a key mechanism in driving cardiac maturation.

The results indicate that inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis significantly increased the level of TNNT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting the results of chemical inhibitor experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The reason why the level of TNNT2 is not as impressive as that of chemical inhibitor assays is possibly because the knockdown efficiency never exceeds 90%: the cells that escaped from knockdown, even though a minority at the beginning, can selectively grow and blunt the outcome after 7-10 days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The maximum OCRs in the high glucose cells are unusually low. Other groups, using 25mM glucose conditions, have seen much greater induction of O2 consumption after uncoupling mitochondria. In the experiments presented here, OCR does not increase above the basal rate. This reduces confidence in the veracity of the flux measurements. Can the authors address this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the careful review of the manuscript. The OCR presented in the original manuscript was too small, which we did not notice at the initial submission. Therefore, we repeated the same experiment and obtained a reasonable level of OCR. To understand why the original data showed small OCR, we thoroughly checked the raw data and realized a miscalculation of the protein concentration by 10-fold in the original data. Thus, the original data and the repeated experiments are both consistent with the published data. We are sorry for the confusion. The data shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-H</xref> include all the OCR measurements including new results and the initial results with corrected calculation. Note that the base-line mitochondrial respiration is not significantly different any longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, this does not affect our main conclusion that glucose restriction enhances the maturity of hESC-CMs, because ATP-linked resp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and max mito resp capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) are still significantly higher in glucose-restricted condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is possible that the glucose-starved cells are energy-starved or otherwise stressed. Did the authors measure ATP levels? Is there cell death? Are various stress pathways or autophagic pathways activated?</p></disp-quote><p>No, they are not energy-starved. ATP level is not significantly decreased in glucose-restricted condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, gene ontology analyses from our RNA-seq data identified no significant enrichment of genes associated with stress pathways. No other data including immunostaining, flow cytometry, and video clips suggest an increase in cell death when glucose depletion was started at day 14 or later. Glucose depletion did slow down the cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but the cells still grow and differentiate. Thus, glucose is not critical for ATP production, and glucose-derived ATP does not seem to be the limiting factor for the cell growth or differentiation in hESC-CMs. As discussed in the manuscript, glucose is perhaps not about the energy but about the supply of building blocks to the cardiomyocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Increased PGC1a expression level and the MitoTracker staining assay suggest that the 0mM glucose condition stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis. Could the authors perform a mtDNA to nDNA ratio assay to see whether 0mM glucose stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we performed mtDNA/nDNA ratio assay, and found that mtDNA content is significantly higher in glucose-restricted condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), supporting the data of PGC1 expression and MitoTracker staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>: It seems that the beating rate was 1 per 10 sec.

The original Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient assay was performed in non-temperature-controlled condition, and the beating rate became slower by the time they were transferred to the confocal microscope. In the revised manuscript, we present the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient assay data under temperature-controlled environment, in which the spontaneous beating rate was ~0.5Hz in both G25 and G0 conditions. Under this condition, the V<sub>max</sub> (ΔF/F0/sec) was still significantly higher in glucose-restricted hESC-CMs, supporting our main claim that glucose inhibits cardiac maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>: Examples of membrane voltage traces should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find the representative voltage traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: A hallmark of infants of diabetic mothers is cardiac hypertrophy.

As suggested, we conducted the phenotypic analyses of the P1 neonatal hearts from diabetic Akita mouse. Our new data suggest that the average heart weight/body weight was not significantly higher in pups from diabetic mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). However, the heart from diabetic mothers often showed asymmetric hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The LV and RV free wall thicknesses (defined as the maximal wall thickness at the level of maximal heart diameter) were significantly higher in pups from diabetic mothers. In addition, the size of the neonatal cardiomyocytes from diabetic mothers was significantly smaller by flow cytometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This observation is consistent with our in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting that hyperproliferation underlies the congenital heart disease associated with diabetic pregnancy.
