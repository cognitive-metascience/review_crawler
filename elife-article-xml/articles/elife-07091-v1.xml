Wnt ligands trigger signaling by activating Frizzled receptors (FZDRs), which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. However, the mechanisms of G protein activation in Wnt signaling remain controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that FZDRs activate G proteins and trigger non-canonical Wnt signaling via the Dishevelled-binding protein, Daple. Daple contains a Gα-binding and activating (GBA) motif, which activates Gαi proteins and an adjacent domain that directly binds FZDRs, thereby linking Wnt stimulation to G protein activation. This triggers non-canonical Wnt responses, that is, suppresses the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway and tumorigenesis, but enhances PI3K-Akt and Rac1 signals and tumor cell invasiveness. In colorectal cancers, Daple is suppressed during adenoma-to-carcinoma transformation and expressed later in metastasized tumor cells. Thus, Daple activates Gαi and enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling by FZDRs, and its dysregulation can impact both tumor initiation and progression to metastasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07091.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07091.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07091.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our cells need to be able to communicate with each other to coordinate many processes in the body, including the formation and maintenance of our organs. A system called Wnt signaling allows cells in different tissues to communicate. During Wnt signaling, one cell releases a protein called Wnt that then binds to a receptor protein known as Frizzled on the surface of another cell. This triggers a cascade of signaling events in the second cell, which leads to changes in the activity of particular genes. Wnt signaling is vital to many processes in cells, and any defects can cause cancer and other severe diseases.</p><p>Frizzled is a member of a large family of receptor proteins known as the G protein-coupled receptors (or GPCRs for short). These proteins can bind to other proteins called G proteins. When a GPCR is active, it can activate the G protein, which can then interact with several other signal proteins to amplify the signal from the GPCR.</p><p>However, there is currently no firm evidence that Frizzled can directly bind to G proteins. Some researchers have suggested that it may interact with G proteins via another ‘linker’ protein, but no such protein has yet been identified. Here, Aznar et al. investigated how Frizzled can activate G proteins in human cells. The experiments revealed that a protein called Daple can bind to both Frizzled and the G proteins when the cells are exposed to Wnt to activate the G proteins.</p><p>Aznar et al. show that Daple can act as a ‘tumor suppressor’ that reduces the risk of healthy cells becoming cancerous and can inhibit the growth of tumors. However, the amount of Daple increases in some tumor cells in the later stages of cancer, which makes it easier for these cells to spread around the body. Aznar et al. also observed that Daple was present at different levels in the late-stage tumor cells taken from a variety of cancer patients. Patients with higher levels of Daple were less likely to have a positive outcome from their cancer treatment, and their illness progressed more rapidly than patients with lower levels of Daple.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand what causes Daple to switch from its tumor suppressor role to one that promotes the spread of tumors in the later stages of disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07091.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07091.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>G protein</kwd><kwd>GEF</kwd><kwd>PI3K/Akt</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>Rac1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA160911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK099226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(RSG-13-362-01-TBE)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Marcos</surname><given-names>Mikel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AHA #14POST20050025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez-Sanchez</surname><given-names>Inmaculada</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society (American Cancer Society, Inc.)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(ACS-IRG 70-002)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Marcos</surname><given-names>Mikel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Daple is a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) for trimeric G proteins that enables Wnt/Frizzled receptors to transactivate G proteins during non-canonical Wnt signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in embryonic development, in tissue regeneration, and in many other cellular processes including cell fate, adhesion, polarity, migration, and proliferation. Dysregulated expression of components within the Wnt pathway triggers many diseases, and most importantly, heralds cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Of the multiple known Wnt proteins, some preferentially trigger the well-characterized canonical pathway, which enhances the stability, nuclear localization and activity of β-catenin, and the downstream activation of genes targeted by the TCF/LEF transcription machinery. Other Wnts, for example, Wnt5a deviate from this canonical paradigm, and trigger so-called non-canonical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kühl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Niehrs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Winklbauer et al., 2001</xref>). Among other events, these non-canonical pathways induce the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activation of the small G proteins RhoA and Rac1, which regulate polarized cell movements and the planar polarity of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sheldahl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kühl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mayor and Theveneau, 2014</xref>). Of critical importance, non-canonical Wnt signaling antagonizes the canonical Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Torres et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Olson and Gibo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ishitani et al., 2003</xref>), although it is unclear how this occurs. Despite the lack of molecular mechanisms, dysregulation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway is widely believed to drive cancer via a two-faceted mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">McDonald and Silver, 2009</xref>)—(1) Non-canonical Wnt signaling suppresses tumorigenesis by antagonizing the canonical β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway, and inhibition of non-canonical Wnt signaling heralds neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ishitani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Medrek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>); (2) Hyperactivation of non-canonical Wnt signaling enhances cancer invasion/metastasis by activation of Rac1 and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>) and by upregulating CamKII and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Weeraratna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dissanayake et al., 2007</xref>). Little is known as to how such dysregulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling, that is, early inhibition and late hyperactivation is orchestrated during cancer progression.</p><p>Non-canonical Wnt signaling is initiated by the binding of Wnt ligands to receptors of the Frizzled (FZDR) family. These receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which classically activate trimeric G proteins. However, the interplay between FZDR and G proteins in Wnt signaling is very controversial—on one hand, there is a wealth of evidence indicating that trimeric G proteins regulate Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Malbon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katanaev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Koval et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, definitive evidence for the direct activation of trimeric G proteins by FZDR's is elusive. The experimental difficulties and controversies in the field have led to provocative speculations that FZDRs may not bind G proteins directly, but do so indirectly via other intermediates within the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>), but such intermediate ‘linker’ molecules have not been identified. Recent advances in the field of trimeric G protein signaling have important implications in this regard. It has become increasingly clear that the activity of trimeric G proteins is regulated by a plethora of accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Siderovski and Willard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blumer and Lanier, 2014</xref>) beyond classical activation by GPCRs. Among these accessory proteins, a subset of proteins called non-receptor Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are uniquely positioned to fulfill the role of an intermediate to trigger G protein signaling upon Wnt stimulation because they are cytoplasmic factors capable of activating G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lanier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Natochin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee and Dohlman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Oner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identified Daple, a previously described binding partner of the Wnt signaling protein Dishevelled (Dvl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Oshita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>), as a non-receptor GEF for trimeric G proteins. We demonstrate that a novel G protein regulatory motif enables Daple to couple G protein activation to FZDRs, which in turn initiates non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. We also demonstrate how bimodal dysregulation in Daple expression modulates non-canonical Wnt signaling during cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Daple possesses a GBA motif and binds to Gαi subunits</title><p>We recently discovered the first GEF motif for trimeric G proteins, that is, the Gα-binding and activating (GBA) motif, in the C-terminal region of the non-receptor protein GIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>). We showed that GIV binds and activates Gα subunits of the Gi subfamily via its GBA motif and regulates signal transduction. GIV is one of the 3 members of the CCDC88 family, which have in common an N-terminal HOOK domain followed by a long coiled-coil region but are highly divergent in their C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enomoto et al., 2006</xref>): CCDC88b (aka GIPIE) completely lacks this C-terminal region, whereas the C-terminal region of CCDC88c (aka Daple) shows significant divergence (15% identity, 26% similarity) compared to CCDC88a's (i.e., GIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The divergence in the C-terminal sequence allows CCDC88 proteins to associate with different proteins and regulate diverse biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enomoto et al., 2006</xref>), for example, a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) is found exclusively in Daple, at its extreme C-terminus, which binds the PDZ domain of Dvl and regulates Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Oshita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>). Despite these apparent sequence differences among CCDC88 family members, a more detailed analysis of the C-terminal sequences of GIV and Daple from different vertebrate species revealed a cryptic GBA motif in Daple localized within the otherwise highly divergent C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This putative GBA motif (aa 1668–1683) in Daple shares a high degree of similarity to previously reported GBA motifs found in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011b</xref>) and synthetic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin et al., 2008</xref>) with GEF activity towards Gαi proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a first step to investigate the functionality of this GBA motif, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments, which revealed that full-length endogenous Daple in HEK293 cells interacts with the trimeric G protein Gαi3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next investigated if the interaction between Daple and G proteins presents the biochemical properties previously reported for other GBA motif sequences, that is, they bind directly to the G protein with submicromolar to low-micromolar affinity when it is in the inactive but not active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>).

We used this structure as a template to build a homology model of the complex between the GBA motif of Daple and Gαi3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our first prediction based on this model was that Daple would bind to a hydrophobic cleft on the G protein located between the switch II (SwII) region and the α3 helix. This seemed to be the case because two molecules known to bind onto the SwII/α3 cleft, that is, the synthetic GEF peptide KB-752 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and His-GIV-CT (aa 1660–1870, containing its GEF motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), competed with His-Daple-CT for binding to GST-Gαi3. We further substantiated the identity of the binding pocket using site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of our homology model suggested that a major molecular contact is established by the hydrophobic interaction between the aromatic residues W211 and F215 located in the SwII region of Gαi3 and Daple's F1675 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Binding of His-Daple-CT to GST-Gαi3 was dramatically impaired upon mutation of W211 or F215 to Alanine (Ala; A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that these hydrophobic residues of the SwII/α3 cleft serve as a docking site for Daple. Importantly, W211A and F215A mutations have been previously shown not to disturb the native biochemical properties of Gαi proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>), and therefore, their inability to bind Daple is not a consequence of an overall defect in G protein folding or function. Furthermore, mutation of Daple's F1675, the residue in its GBA motif predicted to interact with W211 and F215 of the G protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to Ala abolished GST-Gαi3 binding to either recombinant His-Daple-CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or full-length myc-Daple expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We found that the C-terminal ∼380 aa of Daple (aa 1650–2028) was sufficient to interact with GST-FZD7R-CT as efficiently as the full-length Daple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Pulldown assays with the purified, recombinant His-tagged identical segment (aa 1650–2028) of Daple revealed that the binding is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). A shorter C-terminal fragment of Daple (aa 1650–1880), which lacks the ∼150 aa at the extreme C-terminus does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the GEF-deficient (FA) and the ΔPBM-deficient mutants bound GST-FZD7R-CT as efficiently as Daple WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These findings demonstrate that—(1) the FZD7R-Daple interaction is direct; (2) that the aa 1650–2028 in the C-terminus of Daple is sufficient to mediate the interaction; (3) that the extreme C-terminal ∼150 aa within the C-terminus (1881–2029) is essential for the interaction, whereas both the GBA and PBM motifs are dispensable.</p><p>Because Gαi3 co-immunoprecipitated with ligand-activated FZD7R-Daple complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we asked if the interaction observed is direct or mediated by Daple. We first carried out GST pulldown assays with recombinant His-Gαi3 and the GST-tagged cytoplasmic tail of FZD7R. We found that Gαi3 bound weakly to GST-FZD7R-CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; lane 2); however, binding was increased ∼fivefold in the presence of recombinant Daple-CT WT, but not the FA mutant. This raised the possibility that the ligand-dependent interaction between Gαi and FZD7 we see in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) is indirect and mediated by the GBA motif in Daple. Indeed, ligand-dependent recruitment of Gαi3 to FZD7R occurred exclusively in cells expressing full-length Daple-WT (where GBA motif is intact), but not the FA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Next, the spatiotemporal dynamics of ligand-dependent complex formation between FZD7R and Gαi3 was analyzed in HEK293 cells by FRET imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We found that the probe-pair FZD7R-CFP and Gαi3-YFP interact at the PM within 5 min after ligand stimulation (FRET efficiency = 0.25 ± 0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). No such interaction was observed in starved cells (FRET efficiency = 0.04 ± 0.01), demonstrating that Wnt5a triggers the assembly of complexes between ligand-activated FZD7R and Gαi3 at the PM. Furthermore, ligand-dependent assembly of such complexes occurred in cells expressing Daple-WT, but not the FA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), further confirming that Daple serves as in intermediate protein that couples FZD7R to Gαi3. Although the interaction between ligand-activated FZD7R and Daple does not require the GBA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), the recruitment of Gαi into the complex requires a functionally intact GBA to trigger the formation of FZD7R(active)-Daple-Gαi complexes. Thus, two non-overlapping modules in-tandem within Daple's C-terminus cooperate to facilitate the assembly of FZD7R(active)-Daple-Gαi ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>)—(1) a GBA motif that binds Gαi and (2) a stretch of C-terminus (aa 1681–2024) is essential for binding to FZD7R.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Daple competes with Dvl for binding to FZDRs and antagonizes Wnt signaling via the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Dvl, a key scaffold protein in the Wnt signaling pathway, interacts with both FZDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>) and Daple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Oshita et al., 2003</xref>) and shapes both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals. Furthermore, Dvl interferes with the engagement of Gi proteins with ligand-activated FZDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kilander et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a possible interplay between Dvl and the FZDR-Daple-Gi signaling axis we define here. First, we investigated how the ligand-dependent Daple-FZD7R interaction affects Dvl's ability to bind Daple. We found that Daple co-immunoprecipitated with Dvl exclusively in starved cells and that such complexes were undetectable after stimulation with Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that the dissociation of Daple-Dvl complexes coincides with the assembly of Daple-FZD7R complexes we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Next, we investigated how Daple affects the interaction between Dvl and FZDR. We found that expression of Daple in HEK293 cells reduces Dvl association with FZD7R in pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and co-IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that Daple and Dvl may compete with each other for binding to FZD7R. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies confirmed that localization of Dvl at the PM in cells expressing FZD7R was reduced within 5 min after Wnt5a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which coincides with the ligand-dependent recruitment of Daple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that Daple and Dvl actually compete for binding to FZD7R because increasing amounts of purified His-Daple-CT (1650–2028), but not a shorter fragment (His-Daple 1650–1880, which lacks the FZD7R-binding region) increased the formation of Daple-FZDR complexes and reduced DvlFZD7R complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies revealed, that in cells without Daple, stimulation with Wnt5a does not trigger the loss of Dvl from the PM observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that the competition we observe in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) may occur also in cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Daple determines the relocalization of Dvl upon Wnt5a stimulation by displacing the latter from FZDRs.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07091.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Daple competes with Dvl for binding to FZD7R and inhibits the canonical β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling pathway via the GBA motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dishevelled (Dvl)–Daple complexes are disrupted upon Wnt5a stimulation.

(From left to right) In the absence of Wnt5a ligand, Dvl remains at the PM complexed to inactive FZD7Rs, whereas Daple remains in the cytosol in complex with cytosolic Dvl, and Gαi/βγ trimers at the PM are largely inactive. Upon ligand stimulation, Dvl-Daple complexes dissociate and Daple is recruited to the cytoplasmic tails of activated receptors, Dvl is displaced from the receptor tail by Daple, Daple favors the assembly of receptor-Gαi complexes and triggers the activation of Gαi within these complexes. Activated Gαi and Gβγ subunits trigger signaling via their respective downstream intermediates (Rac1, PI3K, and cAMP). Another major consequence of these signaling events is suppression of the canonical β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling pathway, which regulates the transcription of Wnt target genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07091.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07091.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07091-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07091.012</object-id><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Daple competes with Dvl for binding to FZD7R and inhibits the canonical β-caenin/TCF/LEF signaling pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Equal aliquots of lysates from Cos7 cells expressing Dvl1 alone (lane 2), myc-Daple alone (lane 3), or coexpressing both (lanes 1, 4) were used as source of Daple and Dvl in GST pulldown assays with recombinant, immobilized GST or GST-FZD7-CT.

In in vitro competition assays with recombinant proteins, we found that binding between Daple and Dvl was reduced with increasing amounts of His-Gαi3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). No such reduction was noted when the Daple-CT-WT was replaced by the GBA-deficient FA mutant (that cannot bind G proteins) in the above assays. These findings indicate that Gαi3 competes with Dvl for binding to Daple-CT, and that an intact GBA motif is essential for such competition. Together, these results suggest that the Gαi-Daple and Daple-FZD7R interactions we describe here have at least two major effects on the interplay between Daple, Dvl, and FZD7R: (1) Daple and Dvl compete for binding to the C-terminus of FZD7R and (2) Gαi and Dvl compete for binding to the C-terminus of Daple. Consequently, stimulation with Wnt5a triggers the dissociation of Daple-Dvl and FZD7R-Dvl complexes and favors the assembly of FZD7R-Daple-Gαi signaling complexes at the PM in detriment of FZD7R-Dvl complexes.</p><p>Next, we asked what might be the consequences of replacing Dvl with Daple and activation of G proteins in the vicinity of ligand-activated FZD7R on β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling. Prior studies have demonstrated that activation of G proteins downstream of FZDRs is sufficient for antagonistic suppression of β-catenin-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Slusarski et al., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">1997b</xref>). Others have implicated binding of Dvl to FZDRs is required for the enhancement of the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway of signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao and Chen, 2010</xref>). We asked if activation of G proteins via Daple's GBA motif may antagonize β-catenin stability/signaling. We found that HeLa cells without Daple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>) or those expressing the GEF-deficient Daple FA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>) had increased levels of β-catenin protein compared to respective controls, indicating that Daple and its GBA motif are required for maintenance of low levels of β-catenin, and that in their absence β-catenin is stabilized. Consistently, increased stability of β-catenin was also associated with enhanced transcription of downstream target genes SFRP-1, Osteopontin, and Axin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–L</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway in DLD1 colon cancer cells stably expressing Daple-WT or FA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) using 7-TGP, an eGFP expressing Wnt activity reporter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuerer and Nusse, 2010</xref>). Wnt activity was enhanced in cells expressing Daple-FA, but not Daple-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with our prior findings in HeLa cells. Finally, we found that Daple specifically functions within the non-canonical Wnt signaling cascade and not within the canonical Wnt pathway, for example, stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway with Wnt3a did not require Daple to activate Gi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), did not trigger the recruitment of Daple to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>), and did not affect the stabilization of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>). These results suggest that the repressive effects of Daple we observe on the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–L</xref>) are likely due to enhancement of the antagonistic non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway.</p><p>Taken together, these results support an overall model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) in which Daple orchestrates non-canonical Wnt signaling by favoring the recruitment and activation of G proteins and displacement of Dvl from activated FZDRs upon Wnt5a stimulation. This leads to enhancement of Akt and Rac1 signaling (via ‘free’ Gβγ) and suppression of cellular cAMP (via Gαi:GTP), which is accompanied by diminished activity of the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The GBA motif in Daple triggers tumor cell migration but suppresses growth and proliferation</title><p>Next, we investigated how non-canonical Wnt signaling via the Wnt5a/FZDR-Daple-Gαi axis impacts cancer cell behavior.

Consistent with the role of Daple's GBA motif in enhancement of Akt and Rac1 activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we found that monolayers of Daple-depleted HeLa cells stably expressing Daple-WT, but not Daple FA efficiently closed wounds and generated actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and migrated efficiently along a gradient of Wnt5a in chemotaxis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Non-invasive NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albini et al., 1987</xref>) stably expressing Daple-WT, Daple-FA, or vector control were grown into tumor spheroids and subsequently analyzed for cell invasion through matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Enhanced invasion (as determined by the area of invasion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) was detected exclusively in the presence of Daple-WT, but not in cells expressing control vector or Daple-FA, indicating that Daple is sufficient to trigger cell invasion, and that a functionally intact GBA motif is essential.

For this, we used three cell lines: HeLa cell lines, the constitutively active Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, and the DLD1 colorectal cancer cells in which transformation is driven by hyperactive β-catenin signaling in addition to active Ras mutations. We chose to study DLD1 colorectal cancer cells because Daple is virtually undetectable in these cells compared to normal colon (data not shown), thereby allowing us to reconstitute expression exogenously and analyze the effect of WT and mutant Daple constructs without significant interference due to the endogenous protein. Expression of Daple-WT reduced the number of colonies formed by Ras-transformed NIH3T3 in soft-agar by ∼65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that Daple's GBA motif is required for suppressing neoplastic transformation. The mitotic index, as determined by the presence of phosphorylated Histone H3 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</xref>), was higher in HeLa cells expressing Daple-FA compared to those expressing Daple-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that Daple's GBA motif suppresses mitosis. When we assessed the tumor-suppressive effect of Wnt5a on HeLa cells in anchorage-dependent tumor growth assays, we found that tumor growth was suppressed in the control cells, but such suppression was lost in cells depleted of endogenous Daple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This loss of tumor-suppressive effect of Wnt5a was restored by expressing Daple-WT but not by expressing the Daple-FA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that a functionally intact GBA motif in Daple is essential for Wnt5a to exert its tumor suppressive effects. Daple-WT also inhibited anchorage-independent tumor growth of DLD1 cells by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>), and inhibited anchorage-dependent tumor growth of DLD1 cells by ∼90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>), demonstrating that Daple suppresses cellular transformation and growth across all assays. This tumor suppressive effect was mediated via the GBA motif because, compared to Daple-WT, expression of Daple-FA not only failed to inhibit cell transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,H</xref>) but also enhanced oncogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Noteworthy, expression of a Daple mutant that cannot bind Dvl (Daple-ΔPBM) but has an intact GBA motif retained the tumor suppressive properties of Daple-WT across all assays, whereas a mutant that lacks both the GBA and the Dvl-binding PBM motifs (Daple-2M) mirrored the phenotype of the FA mutant, indicating that the G protein regulatory GBA motif, and not the Dvl-binding PBM motif is essential for the tumor suppressive function of Daple. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Daple inhibits cell transformation and proliferation during tumor growth, but enhances cell motility and cytoskeletal remodeling during invasion; both require the GBA motif, which regulates G protein activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07091.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Daple suppresses proliferation and tumorigenesis via its GBA motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Daple's GBA motif is required for inhibition of cell transformation induced by oncogenic KRas.

Modulation of G protein activity by Daple's GBA motif is a key determinant of cellular phenotype(s) triggered by Wnt5a. In cells expressing Daple-WT, a functionally intact GBA motif (+) can activate Gαi, enhance PM-based motogenic signals (PI3K-Akt and Rac1 activation), trigger EMT and cell migration/invasion. In cells expression Daple-FA, without the functional GBA motif (−) G protein remains inactive, non-canonical Wnt signaling is suppressed, which increases stability of β-catenin and upregulation of Wnt target genes, resulting in increased transformation, proliferation, and tumor cell growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07091.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07091.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07091-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07091.017</object-id><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Daple suppresses cell proliferation via its GBA motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Compared to cells expressing Daple-WT, those expressing Daple-FA have higher mitotic index, as determined by nuclear localization of phosphorylated histone H3.

Daple's ability to modulate G proteins via its GBA motif exerts a potent tumor suppressive effect in the normal mucosa. Early during oncogenesis (top, from left to right), downregulation of Daple (marked by ‘X’) occurs at the step of adenoma to cancer conversion, in part by DNA copy loss (bottom) due to focal deletion affecting the long arm of Chr 14. Consequently, low expression of Daple mRNA and protein triggers transformation and tumor growth/progression. Later during cancer invasion, expression of Daple is triggered via unknown mechanisms, which favors (green arrow) tumor recurrence and prognosticates poor survival.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07091.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07091.018</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07091.019</object-id><label>Figure 8—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Meta-analysis of Daple mRNA expression in colorectal cancer vs matched normal controls.</title><p>The publicly available GSE database, a system to store, retrieve, and analyze all types of high-throughput microarray data was used to compare the levels of expression of Daple mRNA in colorectal cancer vs matched normal controls.

We provide biochemical and in-cellulo evidence for the presence of a GBA motif that activates Gαi and an independent domain within the C-terminal region of Daple, which directly binds the cytoplasmic tail of FZDRs. Such a coexistence allows Daple to link G protein activation to ligand-activated FZDRs within ternary FZDR-Daple-Gαi complexes at the PM. We also demonstrate that FZDRs and Gαi come within close proximity of each other (∼10 nm based on FRET imaging studies) within these complexes, suggesting a direct interaction between them on the Daple platform. In cells without Daple, or in cells expressing a mutant in which the GBA motif is selectively disrupted, FZDRs and G proteins do not approach each other and G protein is not activated, demonstrating an obligatory role for Daple's GBA motif in the assembly of FZDR-Gαi complexes. These findings provide a new perspective on the role of G proteins in Wnt signaling because previous work has widely debated the fundamental question whether the 7-TM FZDRs can directly bind and activate G proteins. Arguments that have favored the classification of FZDRs as GPCRs are supported by experimental evidence that FZDRs indeed signal via G proteins, for example, structure-based bioinformatic prediction, pertussis toxin sensitive signaling pathways, genetic linkage with G proteins, and ability to bind β-arrestin for subsequent internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Slusarski et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liu et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahumada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katanaev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ma and Wang, 2006</xref>). Arguments that refute such classification highlight the lack of direct experimental proof of G-protein interaction with FZDRs, and that most studies use experimental models (overexpressed receptors or gain-of-function), which do not necessarily implicate necessity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>). Our work breaks the impasse in the field by the discovery of an alternative mechanism of G protein activation by FZDRs: we propose that the C-terminus of Daple is the long sought molecular linker that couples FZDRs to efficient G protein activation by virtue of its ability to simultaneously bind receptors and activate G proteins. However, that some FZDRs may directly couple with other G proteins under certain circumstances cannot be ruled out (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Daple is a new member in the family of non-receptor GEFs that function via GBA-motif</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that Daple is a new member of a family of non-receptor activators of G protein, thereby adding to the growing evidence that trimeric G proteins can be activated by mechanisms differing from classical GPCR-mediated activation. We demonstrated that Daple activates Gi via a signature sequence, that is, the GBA motif that allows proteins and synthetic peptides to exert GEF activity on G proteins and provides a structural basis for non-receptor mediated activation of G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011b</xref>). Daple shares overall homology with GIV, the prototype GBA motif-containing protein, and both of them are classified as members of the CCDC88 family. Interestingly, the C-terminal domains of these two proteins, in which their conserved GBA motifs are located, share very little overall similarity. These observations suggest that Daple and GIV arose from a common ancestor protein and that the GBA function was selectively preserved, while the rest of the C-terminal domain diverged in evolution.</p><p>Daple has the biochemical features of a GEF: it binds preferentially to inactive, GDP-bound Gαi subunits and accelerates the rate of nucleotide exchange. The GEF activity of Daple, that is, its ability to accelerate the exchange of nucleotide, is more robust than that previously reported for FZDRs in similar in vitro assays (∼2.5–3-fold activation compared to ∼1.5-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Koval and Katanaev, 2011</xref>). Inefficient activation of G proteins by FZDRs (∼5–20% efficacy compared to that observed for a ‘classical’ GPCR, i.e., Adenosine 2B receptor) has also been documented in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nichols et al., 2013</xref>), which lack homologues of Daple. Our studies measuring G protein activation in Daple-depleted cells or in cells without a functional GBA motif in Daple help establish an obligatory role of Daple as a <italic>bona fide</italic> G protein activator, which enables FZDRs to indirectly activate Gi to robust levels. These findings cannot rule out other possibilities, for example, that FZDRs may directly activate Gi to a lesser extent under certain circumstances, or that Daple and FZDRs may activate different subsets of G proteins. The latter possibility is exemplified by Gαo, which has been most widely reported as a target for FZDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Liu et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katanaev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bikkavilli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Katanaev and Buestorf, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egger-Adam and Katanaev, 2010</xref>) but not for Daple (this work). The marked preference of Daple for α-subunits of the Gi family is a common feature shared with previously described GBA proteins; Daple, GIV, Calnuc, NUCB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011b</xref>), or the synthetic peptides KB-752 and GSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin et al., 2008</xref>) can exquisitely distinguish between Gαi and Gαo proteins, despite their being closely related and sharing 75% sequence homology.</p><p>Although the biochemical properties of Daple as a G protein regulator are similar to those of other proteins with a GBA motif, we provide evidence that the coupling between Daple and Gαi-subunits has unique structural determinants. Daple can bind to two Gαi3 mutants, W258F and K248M, that abolish binding to GIV and Calnuc, respectively. Moreover, we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011b</xref>) that these mutants are able to discriminate between GIV and Calnuc (K248M binds GIV, but not Calnuc, and W258F binds Calnuc, but not GIV), which further suggest that different GBA-Gαi interactions have unique properties that impart a high degree of specificity. The validated homology models of these GBA-Gαi interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011b</xref>) offer some clues into the origin of such specificity: despite docking onto the SwII/α3 hydrophobic cleft of Gαi, all GBA-motif containing proteins make additional and unique contacts with Gαi, which generate specificity for each GBA motif. We conclude that the Daple:Gαi interface has unique features that distinguish it from GIV:Gαi or Calnuc:Gαi interfaces, and exploiting such structural specificity may help devise strategies to selectively target the Daple:Gαi interface, and thereby, modulate Wnt signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>G protein regulatory function of Daple is essential for enhancement of non-canonical Wnt signaling</title><p>We demonstrate that recruitment of Daple-Gαi complexes to the cytoplasmic tail of ligand activated FZDRs dictates several closely intertwined spatial and temporal aspects of post-receptor signaling events within the non-canonical Wnt pathway. At the immediate post-receptor level, Daple competes with Dvl, the major signaling scaffold for Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao and Chen, 2010</xref>), for binding to FZDR, and recruits and activates Gαi in close proximity to activated receptors at the PM. That Dvl and Daple/Gαi complexes may compete for binding to FZDR is in keeping with others' findings that overexpression of Dvl interferes with the engagement of Gi proteins with ligand-activated FZDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kilander et al., 2014</xref>), and that Dvl is unlikely to directly link G proteins to FZDRs, as proposed by some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>). Once recruited, Daple's GEF activity triggers Gi activation, which leads to inhibition of cellular cAMP via Gαi:GTP and activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways involved in cell motility (e.g., PI3K and Rac1) via ‘free’ Gβγ. The consequences of these signaling mechanism are enhanced formation of actin stress fibers, 2D-cell migration after wounding, 3D-invasion through basement membrane proteins, and upregulation of genes that trigger EMT; all phenotypes that have been previously attributed to enhancement of non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Minami et al., 2010</xref>). We also show that the FZD7R-Daple-Gi axis suppresses responses associated with tumorigenesis, for example, β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling, oncogenic transformation, anchorage independent growth, and anchorage-dependent colony formation; all attributable to its ability to activate G proteins via its GBA motif. Because the FZDR-Daple-Gi axis specifically modulates non-canonical Wnt signals, but has no effect on canonical Wnt responses, we conclude that Daple suppresses the canonical β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway primarily by enhancing the antagonistic non-canonical Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Torres et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">MacLeod et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Ying et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chien et al., 2009</xref>). Although the mechanism(s) by which the non-canonical Wnt pathway inhibits the canonical β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway remains unclear, and some have proposed that such decisions are made at the level of the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>), how Daple-dependent G protein signaling in the vicinity of the receptors may affect this process remains unclear. Our finding that Daple binds preferentially to some FZDRs, and not others, could influence the decision of canonical vs non-canonical Wnt signaling, or alternatively, activation of Gαi and inhibition of cellular cAMP by Daple could directly antagonize a previously described role of the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathway in phosphorylating and stabilizing β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hino et al., 2005</xref>). Regardless of the mechanism(s) involved, activation of Gi and enhancement of non-canonical Wnt signaling are accompanied by the suppression of the canonical β-catenin pathway in cells expressing Daple-WT, which correlates with all the key anti-growth and anti-transformation phenotypes that define a tumor suppressor/anti-oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper, 2000</xref>). Although it is possible that some of the effects of the FZDR-Daple-Gi axis in tumor suppression are mediated by the destabilization of β-catenin, further investigations are required to clarify this point. We conclude that the G protein regulatory function of Daple is essential for enhancing at least two major cellular phenotypes previously attributed to non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">McDonald and Silver, 2009</xref>), suppression of cell transformation and growth, and enhancement of cell invasion. As for potential implications in other key cellular processes that are deregulated during cancer progression, it is noteworthy that non-canonical Wnt signaling has also been demonstrated to play a crucial role in planar cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bentzinger et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2013</xref>). Several studies have shown that the Wnt7A/FZD7 pathway establishes front-rear cell polarity and directional migration of human myogenic progenitors and facilitate the extension of satellite stem cells, all by activating PI3K/Akt pathway and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bentzinger et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2013</xref>). Because one of the major roles of the FZDR-Daple-Gi axis is enhancement of PI3K and Rac1 activities, it is possible that this axis also aids in the establishment of cell polarity and/or the maintenance of stem-ness via enhancement of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Further studies are required to determine if such is the case.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Daple expression and non-canonical Wnt signaling are similarly dysregulated during oncogenesis</title><p>We showed here that Daple is downregulated during oncogenesis at the step of conversion from adenoma to carcinoma, and that lower expression of Daple in the primary tumor is associated with higher frequency of cancer recurrence. We describe that expression of Daple in CTCs correlated with an increased EMT signature, disease progression (growth of current metastasis or formation of new metastasis), and poorer survival. This bimodal dysregulation (suppressed first, expressed later) and bi-faceted role (tumor suppressor in the normal epithelium, but enhancer of tumor invasion in cancer cells) during cancer progression mirrors what was previously unequivocally documented for the non-canonical Wnt5a signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">McDonald and Silver, 2009</xref>)—Wnt5a signaling is suppressed earlier to allow cellular transformation and tumor growth, and enhanced later during tumor invasion. However, molecular mechanisms for such bimodal deregulation of the bi-faceted non-canonical Wnt pathway remain poorly understood. Such phenomenon is not restricted to Daple or the Wnt pathway, because major signaling programs like the TGFβ-SMAD pathway have also been shown to display similar bimodal deregulation and a bi-faceted role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhurst and Derynck, 2001</xref>), and a similar phenomenon is observed in the case of Daple's closely related orthologue, GIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>): downregulation of GIV by alternative splicing triggered proliferation early during tumor growth, whereas an increase in GIV by transcriptional upregulation enhanced cell invasion later during oncogenesis. Because Daple serves as a <italic>bona fide</italic> enhancer of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, we conclude that upregulation or downregulation in Daple expression contributes, at least in part, to the bimodal deregulation of the Wnt5a signaling pathway observed in cancers.</p><p>We also demonstrate that the mechanism for downregulation of Daple in cancers follows typical tumor suppressor genetics during neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Payne and Kemp, 2005</xref>). Downregulation of Daple mRNA coincided with adenoma-to-carcinoma transition, and the frequency of such downregulation in the primary tumor directly correlated with the degree of CIN. A loss of copy number of Daple DNA, and consequent downregulation of gene expression and function was noted in the primary tumors, predominantly among the tumors with CIN. This pattern is in keeping with the well-documented role of CIN in generating loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and haploinsufficiency of other tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sotillo et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of Daple, such insufficiency is likely to increase the fitness of cells that have undergone such a LOH because depletion of Daple suppresses non-canonical Wnt signaling and allows unrestricted propagation of canonical Wnt pathways. Consequently, proliferation/growth is triggered, which enables these cells to rapidly outcompete the remaining population. Based on the location of ccdc88c (Daple gene) at a site on the long arm of Chr 14, which is known to be frequently deleted in a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Suzuki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rouault et al., 2012</xref>), we conclude that tumors harboring a focal deletion at that site are in part driven by insufficient expression of the tumor suppressor Daple. Additional mechanisms, for example, alternative splicing may further contribute to oncogenesis via dysregulation of Daple expression, as described in a rare and fatal human developmental anomaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ekici et al., 2010</xref>). This anomaly was attributed to deregulation of Wnt signaling due to a loss of Daple's 29th exon, which contains the G protein regulatory GBA motif. Although many other mechanisms may be involved, loss of Daple expression, or a selective loss of its G protein regulatory function has emerged as a final common pathway, which disrupts Daple-Gαi axis of Wnt signaling and derails tissue homeostasis.</p><p>The precise molecular mechanism(s) that enhances Daple expression or function and consequently triggers an EMT signature and cell invasion during cancer progression remains unclear. Transcriptional compensation for loss of an allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guidi et al., 2004</xref>) or gain-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">van Oijen and Slootweg, 2000</xref>) is possible mechanisms, as shown previously in the case of other tumors suppressors. In this regard, it is noteworthy that although Daple bound the cytoplasmic tails of several FZDRs to varying extent, the preference for FZD7R was striking and may provide some clues as to why/how Daple may enhance tumor progression. Although all FZDRs promiscuously interact with more than one of the many Wnt isoforms to activate canonical and/or non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">King et al., 2012</xref>), FZD7 stands out as a receptor that functions at the cross-roads of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in a unique way. FZD7R is a downstream target of β-catenin in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barker and Clevers, 2006</xref>), and consequently, enhanced canonical Wnt signaling upregulates FZD7R expression during cancer progression. It has been proposed that such increased FZD7R expression due to aberrant canonical Wnt signals may serve as a positive forward-feedback mechanism to perpetuate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thus, facilitating colorectal cancer progression and metastasis. Because Daple appears to be upregulated during cancer invasion and in circulating cancer cells (and such upregulation is associated with worse prognosis) and enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling downstream of FZD7R, it is possible that Daple's functional interaction with this receptor further enhances prometastatic signaling via amplification of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, which synergizes with the previously proposed forward-feedback canonical Wnt signaling loop during cancer progression. We conclude that such preferential signaling downstream of FZD7R and the temporal profile of expression of Daple are well-poised to suppress or enhance non-canonical Wnt signaling and aid in different steps of tumor progression (see legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have defined Daple as a novel regulator of G protein activity, which directly binds FZDRs and enables these 7-TM receptors to recruit and activate Gi, and trigger non-canonical Wnt signaling to suppress tumorigenesis and enhance tumor invasion. These findings set a new paradigm for the long-debated mechanisms by which FZDRs are coupled to G protein activation. As a potent tumor suppressor with multiple intriguing domains, for example, the newly identified GBA and the Frizzled-binding domain, Daple presents many signaling interfaces that could be developed as targets for modulating Wnt signaling. Because its levels of expression in primary tumors, circulating cell-free transcripts and in CTCs may indicate tumor characteristics, Daple presents many avenues for further development as clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

The rationale for their use in invasion assay lies in the fact that non-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts are poorly invasive in vitro and non-tumorigenic and non-metastatic in animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bondy et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chambers et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Tuck et al., 1991</xref>).
