essential for the consolidation of salient experiences into long-term memory. However, whether inducible transcription relays information about the identity and affective attributes of the experience being encoded, has not been explored. To this end, we analyzed transcription induced by a variety of rewarding and aversive experiences, across multiple brain regions. Our results describe the existence of robust transcriptional signatures uniquely representing distinct experiences, enabling near-perfect decoding of recent experiences. Furthermore, experiences with shared attributes display commonalities in their transcriptional signatures, exemplified in the representation of valence, habituation and reinforcement. This study introduces the concept of a neural transcriptional code, which represents the encoding of experiences in the mouse brain. This code is comprised of distinct transcriptional signatures that correlate to attributes of the experiences that are being committed to long-term memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31220.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Can we tell what important event a mouse â or even a person â has recently experienced? The current experience of an individual can be inferred from brain imaging experiments. However, along with changing brain activity, such an experience also switches on gene activity throughout the brain. This enables neurons to produce the proteins required to form a long-term memory of the experience.</p><p>Do distinct, memorable experiences trigger unique signatures of gene activity? To answer this question, Mukherjee, Ignatowska-Jankowska, Itskovits et al. exposed mice to a variety of experiences. Some were unpleasant and induced aversion; for example, the mouse may have felt nauseous or experienced brief pain and fear. Other experiences, such as when the mouse drank sugary water, received food or was injected with cocaine, were rewarding.</p><p>Each of the experiences led to the activation of unique combinations of genes in different regions of the brain. Analysing a subset of the activated genes in various brain regions led to the identification of unique and reliable gene expression signatures of experience. These signatures allowed the recent experience of mice to be decoded with nearly 100% accuracy. While these unique signatures can distinguish between recent experiences, experiences that share common features do trigger overlapping patterns of gene activation. For example, negative experiences â but not positive or neutral ones â activated similar patterns of genes in a brain region called the amygdala. In contrast, repeated rewarding experiences induced a distinct gene activity pattern that was most pronounced as increased activity in part of the brain called the frontal cortex.</p><p>These findings increase our understanding of how the brain represents information. The approach described in the paper provides a strategy to measure the changes in the brain that occur when information is encoded for long-term storage. This measure could also be useful during drug development, revealing how new drug compounds affect the brain, as well as providing an objective measure of the subjective experience of an individual. For example, substances that trigger similar patterns of gene activation to addictive drugs may themselves be addictive. On the other hand, substances that induce similar activity patterns to known medications could also have similar therapeutic properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>experience-dependent plasticity</kwd><kwd>inducible transcription</kwd><kwd>prospective coding</kwd><kwd>immediate-early genes</kwd><kwd>limbic system</kwd><kwd>valence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shimon Peres Postdoctoral Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral stipend</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ignatowska-Jankowska</surname><given-names>Bogna Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ELSC Postdoctoral Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral stipend</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ignatowska-Jankowska</surname><given-names>Bogna Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001737</institution-id><institution>Lady Davis Fellowship Trust, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral stipend</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ignatowska-Jankowska</surname><given-names>Bogna Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Personal Grant 393/12 &amp;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</xref>). This neuroplasticity, induced by salient experiences, has been shown to depend on the induction of temporally-defined waves of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McClung and Nestler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>). The earliest of these waves consists of the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs). IEGs have been conventionally treated as molecular markers for labeling neuronal populations that undergo plastic changes during the formation of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Minatohara et al., 2015</xref>). However, the literature indicates a much more significant contribution of IEGs to synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lanahan and Worley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okuno, 2011</xref>). It has been proposed that IEG transcription may represent the molecular signatures of long-term plastic changes underlying the formation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberini, 2009</xref>). Thus, induced IEG transcription could represent an experience-specific neural code for long-term storage of information. The existence of a neural code embedded in transcription implies that it should be possible to decode the identity of recent experiences, and potentially derive information regarding the nature of the experience, from its transcriptional representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stanley, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To address the existence of a neural transcriptional code, we performed a detailed analysis of IEG transcription for 13 different experiences: cocaine (acute, repeated and challenge), volitional sucrose drinking (acute and repeated), reinstatement of feeding following food deprivation, lithium chloride administration (LiCl; acute and repeated), saline (acute injection without habituation, acute injection after habituation and repeated administration), acute administration of a mild foot shock, and exposure to a novel chamber with no foot shock. The experiences were selected to enable the identification of the transcriptional representations of affective attributes, such as salience and valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Russell, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Posner et al., 2005</xref>). As such, we chose to investigate experiences that drive robust positive or negative reinforcement. Repetition of rewarding and aversive experiences provided insight into the transcriptional representation of habituation to negative stimuli and positive reinforcement of rewarding experiences.</p><p>Experiences included in this study have been previously studied using electrophysiological measures, and plasticity has been observed within individual limbic and mesolimbic brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo and Nestler, 2013</xref>). In contrast to classic electrophysiological measurements of plasticity, which focus on measurements with synapse specificity, transcriptional analysis enables parallel investigation of the representation of experience across multiple brain structures. Assuming that the encoding of complex reinforced experiences involves coordinated neural plasticity in multiple brain regions, we analyzed transcription across structures associated with the limbic and mesolimbic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo and Nestler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>). The brain structures that were analyzed include limbic cortex (LCtx; including medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum (DS), amygdala (Amy), lateral hypothalamus (LH), dorsal hippocampus (Hipp) and ventral tegmental area (VTA).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the transcriptional representations of experience are robust, reliable and consistent, enabling the decoding of the recent experience of mice with high levels of accuracy from a minimal transcriptional signature. We identify transcriptional hallmarks of affective attributes of experience, prominently demonstrated in the encoding of valence. Moreover, we report opposing patterns of transcriptional modulation underlying the development of habituation to experiences of negative valence, in comparison to repeated rewarding experiences associated with positive reinforcement. We conclude with a discussion of the potential implications of a neural transcriptional code.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of transcriptional signatures of experience</title><p>We initiated our study with the investigation of gene expression programs induced during the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Cocaine sensitization is one of the most widely applied paradigms for studying mechanisms of neural plasticity, due to the robustness of the behavioral model and the detailed insight acquired into the underlying mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McClung and Nestler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robbins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nestler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robison and Nestler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LÃ¼scher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piechota et al., 2010</xref>).

Our results suggest that a hallmark of increasing salience of positively reinforcing experiences may be increased transcriptional representation, specifically in the LCtx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson and Berridge, 2008</xref>). This transcriptional representation of positively reinforcing experiences contrasts with the diminished transcriptional representation associated with habituation to anticipated and unavoidable aversive experiences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Decoding recent experiences of individual mice from minimal transcription</title><p>Finally, we tested our capacity to decode the recent experience of mice on the full complement of experiences studied in this project. The transcriptional induction of five genes (<italic>Arc, Egr2, Egr4, Fos and Fosb</italic>) across five structures (LCtx, NAc, DS, Amy, LH) forms 25 gene-structure 'featuresâ, which were used for the decoding with the KNN algorithm.

In real time, the representation of information has been shown to be correlated with neural activity in distinct brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bialek et al., 1991</xref>). Powerful demonstrations of the potential to decode sensory experiences and correlates of emotional state have been made in both rodents and humans from neural activation patterns using in-vivo electrophysiology, fMRI, and other imaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horikawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santoro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kragel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reber et al., 2002</xref>). In this study we demonstrate that multiplexed IEG expression data from multiple regions of the mouse brain enables the decoding of recent salient experiences with high precision. We show that beyond mere âactivity markersâ for labeling neurons activated during an experience, IEG expression provides a quantitative and scalable metric, representing a neural transcriptional code for recent experience. This neural transcriptional code is defined by the combinatorial expression of marker transcripts across brain regions. Interestingly, we find components of induced transcriptional signatures that are associated with affective attributes of the experiences that are being encoded. Moreover, these IEG expression patterns are modulated following repeated administration of a stimulus of positive or negative value, suggesting a role for inducible transcription in sustaining long-term plasticity underlying the development of adaptive behavior. As this code is comprised of molecular components, it also provides a rich resource for biological insight into the processes underlying the long-term encoding of experience-dependent plasticity.</p><p>Transcriptional markers have been successfully utilized for the classification of developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>), diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lamb, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKinney et al., 2010</xref>), and many other aspects of contemporary biomedical science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins and Varmus, 2015</xref>). Here we describe the utility of transcriptional markers for classification of salient experiences characterized by diverse affective properties. While the information embedded in the expression pattern of a single gene is not sufficient, a minimal subset of transcriptional markers enable the decoding of recent experience with high accuracy. Importantly, the principles we identify likely generalize to a broader set of experiences. Furthermore, it is likely that markers we utilize in our study could be substituted by other markers genes, providing similar classification accuracy.</p><p>According to the Russell circumplex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Russell, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Posner et al., 2005</xref>), affect can be defined in two dimensions â valence and salience. Valence has been suggested to be encoded in the Amy, PFC, NAc and VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Namburi et al., 2016</xref>). Our results demonstrate that experiences of negative valence are represented by a distinct transcriptional induction in the Amy. In contrast, experiences of positive valence induce transcription in the LCtx, NAc, DS and VTA. Moreover, we report that upon repetition, the transcriptional representation within these structures is dynamically modulated, potentially underlying long-term adaptations following positive and negative reinforcement. Taken together, our results suggest that inducible transcription is a rich resource for the identification of brain regions that encode properties of an experience, providing biological insight into the molecular processes underlying experience-dependent plasticity. It should be noted that in this study we focused our analysis on structures associated with limbic and mesolimbic system. It is highly likely that transcriptional signatures across other brain areas (as well as for other experiences) would be related to different attributes of the experience, besides affect or valence.</p><p>To explain how changes in transcription could affect future behavior, we introduce the concept of âpredictive transcriptional codingâ. Predictive transcriptional coding frames inducible transcription not as a reporter of a recent event, but rather as encoding the valuation of the experience. This experience-dependent plasticity, mediated by transcription, sets the state of the network in the context of a particular experience, priming it for prospective network plasticity, and adjusting the response of the individual to the occurrence of a similar event in the future. This notion is conceptually similar to the âreward prediction errorâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultz, 2010</xref>), but is established on prolonged time scales. In this respect, transcription also serves as a âsalience filterâ â defining whether an experience is significant enough to induce plasticity and worthy of encoding for long-term storage. Thus, the valuation of an experience that passes the âsalience filterâ is encoded by the identity of the neural circuits recruited by the experience and the magnitude of transcription induced within them. A crucial question arising from this concept is: how is the threshold to commit to induction of transcription determined in neurons and neural networks? One possibility, worthy of future investigation, was proposed in a landmark treatise, in which the analogy of a âgenomic action potentialâ was drawn for mechanisms underlying inducible transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clayton, 2000</xref>). According to this hypothesis, the threshold for commitment to transcription depends on the coincidence of glutamatergic and neuromodulatory inputs.</p><p>Our work provides a numerical definition of the imprint of recent experience, demonstrating a quantitative and predictive approach for the analysis of neural plasticity underlying adaptive behavior. Quantitative definitions of interoceptive states are expected to have implications for drug development - providing objective metrics for comprehensive characterization of the perception and valuation ascribed to an experience by individual subjects. For example, in the context of abuse liability, an objective quantitative interoceptive metric of the hedonic potential of a compound could increase standardization, reducing the reliance on variable behavioral outcomes.</p><p>While there is substantial investment being made in the development of methodologies for transcriptional profiling with deeper coverage and increasing spatial resolution, our study demonstrates that fundamental phenomena can be identified by applying simple methods with low spatial resolution and coverage. Future work, applying tools of higher resolution, could build on our observations to address additional questions â such as the spatial distribution of neuronal ensembles recruited by experience and the identity of cell types recruited by distinct experiences.</p><p>Approaches for non-invasive quantitative measurement of the encoding of experience can be envisioned, utilizing fluorescent markers of inducible transcription in combination with whole-brain imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eguchi and Yamaguchi, 2009</xref>). New technologies are rapidly emerging for whole-brain analyses of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Renier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sylwestrak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ye et al., 2016</xref>), as are strategies for comprehensive profiling of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Citri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lacar et al., 2016</xref>). These technological developments, together with the novel concept we develop here, are expected to provide the foundation for a new area of neuroscience research. This discipline, of âBehavioral Transcriptomicsâ, will apply transcriptional analysis for investigation of intricate mechanisms of neural circuit plasticity underlying cognition. We propose that the approach of behavioral transcriptomics will provide a systems-level view of the encoding of experiences to long-term memory. One could speculate that different attributes of an experience may be mediated by activation of defined signaling pathways at different cellular locations, each inducing a component of the transcriptional program. If so, taken to its extreme, deciphering this transcriptional code will enable precise decoding of synapse-specific plasticity from quantitative analysis of inducible transcriptional markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice aged 6â8 weeks (Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) served as subjects for the study.

Mice were subjected to three days of intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline injections (250 microliter/injection), prior to exposure to cocaine (20 mg/kg freshly dissolved in physiological saline to 2 mg/ml and injected at a volume of 10 ml/kg; cocaine was obtained from the pharmacy at Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem).

The initial list of candidate IEGs was compiled from a whole-genome microarray analysis of transcriptional dynamics induced by cocaine experiences in the nucleus accumbens (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip microarrays; data not shown), as well as a survey of literature and databases pertaining to IEG expression. qPCR primer probes were developed for 212 genes and primer efficiency was tested, resulting in selection of 152 optimal primer pairs. Differential expression of the shortlisted IEGs was then tested on samples from multiple brain structures, dissected from mice following cocaine and LiCl experiences, utilizing microfluidic qPCR arrays. Genes that displayed at least 1.25-fold induction in any measurement were shortlisted, resulting in a list of 78 genes. The next round of feature selection involved ranking genes based on their frequency of induction and variance. For ranking based on frequency of induction, we counted the number of times each gene was induced above a threshold of two-fold induction across the different brain structures (LCtx, NAc, DS, Amy, LH and Hipp) in the cocaine (acute, repeated and challenge) and LiCl (acute and repeated) conditions (i.e. induction in six structures*five experiences = #/30). In addition, we ranked genes in inverse order of average variance (<italic>S<sup>2</sup></italic>) of their induction across structures. The five genes that were induced most consistently (combined highest ranking in frequency and lowest in variance) were selected for further investigation.

Samples were then loaded onto a primed dynamic array for qPCR in a specialized thermal cycler [Fluidigm Biomark; Thermal mixing: 70Â°C for 40 min, 60Â°C for 30 s, 95Â°C denaturation for 60 s, followed by 40 cycles of PCR (96Â°C for 5 s, 60Â°C for 20 s)]. For data analysis, a reference set of genes was identified, whose expression remained constant across all experimental conditions (<italic>Dkk3, Tagln3, Gars, Scrn1, Rpl36al, Mcfd2, Psma7 and Hpcla4</italic>). In order to reduce the potential for introduction of experimental error by normalization to a single gene, a 'global-normalization' Ct value was created for each sample from the average Ct values of the genes within the reference set. Fold induction was calculated using the ÎÎCt method, normalizing each gene in a sample to the global-normalization value (ÎCt), followed by normalization of the experimental groups to the average of their relevant control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All data are presented as meanÂ Â±Â standard error (s.e.m.). Data were analyzed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate. Tukey or Dunnett test was used for post hoc analyses of significant ANOVAs to correct for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at the level of p&lt;0.05. Statistical analysis was performed, and bar graphs and line graphs were created, with Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Heat maps were created in MATLAB R2012a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Radar plots were created in Origin 6.0 (Originlab, Northampton, MA). Codes were written in MATLAB R2015b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and confusion matrices, randomization plots were created in Python using the Matplotlib library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://matplotlib.org">http://matplotlib.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Computational analyses</title><p>The analysis was performed on data obtained from 54 mice, each of which experienced one of the experiences (acute, repeated or challenge cocaine, acute and repeated sucrose, reinstatement of feeding, acute and repeated LiCl and foot shock and no-shock controls exposed to the same environment). Each mouse was represented by a vector of twenty-five features [corresponding to the induction of five genes (<italic>Arc, Egr2, Egr4, Fos</italic> and <italic>Fosb</italic>) across five structures [limbic cortex (LCtx), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum (DS), amygdala (Amy) and lateral hypothalamus (LH)]. Each gene-structure combination was defined as a âfeatureâ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Supervised classification</title><p>The classifier used was k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), with kÂ =Â 1 over the Euclidean space, unless otherwise stated. This approach was selected based on the observation that the transcriptional response of mice within an experience group formed unique clusters. We evaluated the performance of our classification by a leave-one-out method. In this approach, we iterated over each sample in our training set and classification was performed given the rest of the training set. Visualization of the accuracy of classification was performed using a confusion matrix, which conveys both mean precision and mean recall of each condition classified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Feature selection</title><p>Feature selections were performed using Random k-Nearest Neighbors (RKNN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2011</xref>)Â or Breiman Random Forest (RF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breiman, 2001</xref>) algorithm. For RKNN, the contribution of each feature for classification of individual experiences was called <italic>support.</italic> We chose large (nÂ =Â 1e<sup>6</sup>), random subsets of the twenty five available features in varying sizes (between one and twenty five). For each such subset we trained a classifier. Each feature <italic>f</italic> appeared in some KNN classifiers, for example, set C(<italic>f</italic>) of size <italic>M</italic>, where <italic>M</italic> is the multiplicity of <italic>f</italic>. In turn, each classifier <italic>c</italic> â C(<italic>f</italic>) is an evaluator of its <italic>m</italic> features. We defined the <italic>support</italic> of a feature <italic>f</italic> as the mean accuracy of all the classifiers in C(f).

Bifurcations were chosen according to modified Gini gain. For each feature, we averaged over the decrease in the Gini gain (MDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2016</xref>) over the ensemble of decision trees. The selected features were then evaluated using a regularized (pruned) decision tree with a maximal depth of 4, using a k-cross validation process with kÂ =Â 10, with the constraint of a minimum categorization of 3 animals per group. The decision tree was constructed using the CART decision tree construction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breiman et al., 1984</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2EâH</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Decision tree</title><p>To provide an example of a descriptive classifier, we created a decision tree using the CART algorithm with Information Gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-David and Shalev-Shwartz, 2014</xref>). No constraints were applied while building this tree.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Randomization</title><p>Considering the limited size of our dataset, we wanted to ensure that the classifier was not over fitted to our training set S. For this purpose, we produced a large number N (NÂ =Â 1e<sup>5</sup>) of permuted versions of our training set (s<sub>i</sub>, ...s<sub>N</sub>), and created KNN or decision tree as the classifiers in the same way as for the original data. The permutation was performed by shuffling the association of individual mice with experiences. For each such permuted training set we trained a classifier and evaluated its classification accuracy (leave-one-out, see previous description). We calculated the empirical p value (p&lt;1e<sup>â5</sup> for both conditions) for the classification accuracy on our original training set in the following manner:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">â</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="double-struck">ð</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>The data sets generated during the current study, as well as the code used for analysis have all been uploaded as supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">source code 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode11">11</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by grants to AC from the Israel Science Foundation (393/12 and 2341/15), ISF Center of Research Excellence on âChromatin and RNA in Gene Regulationâ (1796/12), EU Marie Curie (PCIG13-GA-2013â618201), the Brain and Behavior Foundation (NARSAD 18795), the German-Israel Foundation (2299â2291.1/2011), the Binational Israel-USA Foundation (2011266), the Milton Rosenbaum Endowment Fund for Research in Psychiatry, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and contributions from Mr. Jaime Cohen (Mexico City) and the Stewart Resnick Foundation (Los Angeles).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Salient Experiences are Represented by Unique Transcriptional Signatures in the Brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pavel Osten (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use real-time PCR from dissected brain regions to assess the immediate early gene (IEG) transcriptional responses to a variety of rewarding and aversive experiences including drugs of abuse, feeding, foot shock and gastric distress. Results show specific transcriptional signatures for each experience, enabling decoding of the experience. Moreover, transcriptional codes appeared to primarily reflect the valence of the event, with experiences of neutral or negative valence showing opposing patterns of transcriptional activity. This is an interesting and novel approach akin to efforts to decode experience from brain imaging and neural recordings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Increasing the rigor of Feature Selection: There is a fundamental issue with the number of features considered in the analyses and how they were selected from what was measured. Initially, 152 IEGs are measured in 7 brain areas (=1064 features). Then, the number of IEGs is reduced to 78 (&gt;1.25-fold induction). From these, 5 are selected (<italic>Arc, Egr2, Egr4, Fos</italic> and <italic>Fosb</italic>), but this step is not well described or justified. Potentially, some of the reduction could be attributed to a priori assumptions based on the literature, but these should be orthogonal to the tested hypotheses (see below) and need to be justified.</p><p>In addition, some analyses only consider a smaller number of brain areas, without clear justification. All of these choices can be extremely impactful and may strongly affect the results and ultimately the conclusions drawn from the data. Most importantly, criteria for these choices need to be orthogonal to the tested hypothesis (they cannot depend on differences in IEGs between experiences). If feature selection is non-independent, subsequent analyses will be biased and produce invalid results. The authors need to describe what criteria were used for feature selection (regions and IEGs) and whether these criteria were orthogonal to comparisons among individual experiences. For example, the formal feature selection procedure conducted for results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is non-independent, resulting in biased (invalid) classification accuracies. The problem is that the same data were used to select features (estimate &quot;support&quot;) and also to evaluate classifier performance, which is circular. Feature selection must be based on nested cross-validation within the training data only. For instance, the algorithm should start with all 1064 features (or 78 x 7 = 546 features) and use nested cross-validation to select a feature set that is then used to determine classifier accuracy in the left-out test data.</p><p>2) Controlling for multiple comparisons â this is required for all tests.</p><p>3) Statistical testing is needed for many results presented in the manuscript. No statistical tests are reported for any of the results summarized in the sentence &quot;The representation of rewarding experiences are characterized by robust transcriptional induction in the LCtx, NAc, DS, and VTA, while the representations of aversive experiences are dominated by transcriptional induction in the Amy&quot;. There are also no tests for whether transcriptional signatures of different experiences with the same or different valence are positively or negatively correlated. All descriptive statements should be backed by appropriate statistical tests within the manuscript.</p><p>4) The authors contrast the idea of a &quot;transcriptional code&quot; with the idea of IEG expression as simply &quot;molecular markers for labelling neuronal populations that undergo plastic changes.&quot; The issue of the degree to which differences in which genes are transcribed vs. where in the brain they are transcribed is not satisfyingly analyzed. Encoding that matches different experiences to different transcripts would be a transcriptional code in the sense that many might assume from use of the term. On the other hand, encoding that matches different experiences to different brain regions would be quite akin to the &quot;molecular marker&quot; model the authors wish to reject. In between these two extremes, and probably closer to the data is the view that different experiences activate different brain regions, but that different brain regions also have different preferred mixtures of IEGs to activate. Gene-structure pairs are treated as features, but the relative degree to which this is a &quot;spatial&quot; code across brain regions vs. a genetic code across genes is unclear. The authors should attempt to separate these two contributing factors to more precisely specify what kind of &quot;neural code embedded in transcription&quot; they are talking about. It looks from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, for example, like there is a strong &quot;shape similarity&quot; across experiences within a region. This would seem to imply that relative activation of the 4 genes tested is more a function of the region than of the experience (e.g. LH and VTA have relatively little activation of <italic>Arc</italic>). On the other hand, overall magnitude is more related to the interaction between the experience and the structure (cocaine for VTA and DS; foot shock for hipp).</p><p>5) The current findings suggest that transcriptional signatures for individual experiences are primarily driven by salience and valence. However, this could simply be a consequence of the (reward-related) brain regions considered here. It is possible that transcriptional signatures in other brain areas are not related to valence, and this should be discussed.</p><p>6) Title: it is convention for <italic>eLife</italic> papers to include some reference to the preparation used. This could be achieved by including the word &quot;rodent&quot; or at least &quot;mammalian&quot; before the word &quot;brain&quot; in the title.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31220.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Increasing the rigor of Feature Selection: There is a fundamental issue with the number of features considered in the analyses and how they were selected from what was measured.

Three separate issues arise, to which we relate: (1) The basis for selection of the 5 genes used for analyses throughout the paper. (2) The basis for selection of brain structures. (3) Feature selection vs classifier performance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> â ensuring that there was no circular logic.</p><p>1) Clarification for the selection of 5 genes:</p><p>We have now clarified and elaborated on the process of marker gene selection in the text (see below). In order to assist this clarification, we have also reordered the figures, and now include the analysis of LiCl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>, and add a comparison of genes induced by cocaine and LiCl, which assists in clarifying the process of feature selection. Furthermore, the text describing the process of selection of 5 genes for analyses is elaborated both in the Results as well as in the Materials and methods sections. Importantly, the criteria for selection of the 5 marker genes were orthogonal to, and independent of, the tested hypothesis, supporting unbiased analysis.</p><p>In the body of the Results section, we define the process as follows: âWe analyzed the transcription induced at 0, 1, 2, 4 hours following each of these cocaine experiences across 6 brain structures (LCtx, NAc, DS, Amy, LH, and Hipp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).[â¦] The 5 genes with combined highest ranking in frequency of appearance and lowest variance in expression were selected) for further analysis (<italic>Arc, Egr2, Egr4, Fos</italic> and <italic>Fosb</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).â</p><p>Within the Materials and methods section, we further elaborate on the process of marker selection, as follows: âThe strategy for marker selection consisted of three steps.[â¦] Thus, criteria for marker selection were orthogonal to the tested hypothesis, supporting unbiased analysis.â</p><p>2) Selection of 5 brain structures:</p><p>We chose to focus on 5 brain structures for analysis (LCtx, NAc, DS, Amy and LH). The primary reason for utilizing these structures for analysis was that these were the structures for which we obtained samples across all experiences. Furthermore, hippocampal samples demonstrated very little transcriptional induction, and samples from the VTA were the most difficult to reliably obtain, due to the small size and irregular shape of this structure. In the original manuscript we performed a classification of cocaine experiences based on 3 structures (LCtx, NAc and DS; originally <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This analysis has been removed from the revised version of the manuscript, and replaced with a decoding of the recent experience of mice following cocaine and LiCl experiences, using the data from all 25 features (5 structures * 5 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>3) Feature Selection vs. classifier performance:</p><p>Regarding the feature selection described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> â âsupportâ was calculated with the primary objective of identifying the features contributing most to the classification, but the classifier does not depend on feature selection. We have now clarified this in the revised manuscript, in which we present the decoding based on all 25 features (with no selection) in the main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The analysis of support and the identification of the most indicative features have been moved to the supplementary information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we have utilized an independent approach to feature selection (Breiman Random Forest), which provided a largely overlapping set of the most informative features (both approaches identify the same top 12 features, and overlap in 6 of the top 8 features). It is important to stress that the issue of feature selection is not cardinal in any way for the theme of this paper. The KNN classifier does not require feature selection to enable powerful classification of the experiences, and it is our conviction, as we have written in the Discussion, that the marker genes we have utilized could largely be substituted for a different set, without a significant loss in classification efficiency: âFurthermore, it is likely that markers we utilize in our study could be substituted by other markers genes, providing similar classification accuracy.â.</p><p>This text now reads: âFinally, we tested our capacity to decode the recent experience of mice on the full complement of experiences studied in this project. [â¦] An independent approach for feature selection (Breiman Random Forest<sup>25</sup>) identified a largely overlapping set of features, with the top 10 features supporting a classification accuracy of 94.4% (p&lt;1e<sup>-5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2E-H</xref>).â</p><p>Finally, the reviewers propose that we perform feature selection based on nested cross-validation within the training data using 1064 or 546 features. This would be wonderful to implement, but is not possible in our data â as we have not acquired the full dataset of 152 genes for all the experiences studied. We acquired the 78 gene dataset for a <italic>subset</italic> of the mice that underwent cocaine, LiCl and saline experiences, while the majority of mice and experiences were analyzed with the 5 gene set defined based on the results of the analysis of LiCl and cocaine experiences. Therefore, the process we developed for selecting genes for analysis was the least biased process we could perform. This process, of selecting features based on high fold induction and low variance, is orthogonal to the hypothesis that recent experiences can be decoded from a transcriptional signature and enables unbiased analysis. Furthermore, the results of our study do not depend, to any significant extent, on feature selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Controlling for multiple comparisons â this is required for all tests.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we have controlled for multiple comparisons, as defined in the Materials and methods section: âData analysis. All data are presented as mean Â± standard error (s.e.m.). [â¦] Codes were written in MATLAB R2015b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and confusion matrices, randomization plots were created in Python using the Matplotlib library (http://matplotlib.org).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistical testing is needed for many results presented in the manuscript. No statistical tests are reported for any of the results summarized in the sentence &quot;The representation of rewarding experiences are characterized by robust transcriptional induction in the LCtx, NAc, DS, and VTA, while the representations of aversive experiences are dominated by transcriptional induction in the Amy&quot;. There are also no tests for whether transcriptional signatures of different experiences with the same or different valence are positively or negatively correlated. All descriptive statements should be backed by appropriate statistical tests within the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a thorough statistical analysis of our data, and include a supplementary table describing this analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> â Statistics), to which we refer throughout the manuscript. We have also included a much more detailed description of statistical significance throughout the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors contrast the idea of a &quot;transcriptional code&quot; with the idea of IEG expression as simply &quot;molecular markers for labelling neuronal populations that undergo plastic changes.&quot; The issue of the degree to which differences in which genes are transcribed vs. where in the brain they are transcribed is not satisfyingly analyzed. Encoding that matches different experiences to different transcripts would be a transcriptional code in the sense that many might assume from use of the term. On the other hand, encoding that matches different experiences to different brain regions would be quite akin to the &quot;molecular marker&quot; model the authors wish to reject. In between these two extremes, and probably closer to the data is the view that different experiences activate different brain regions, but that different brain regions also have different preferred mixtures of IEGs to activate.

We have performed additional analysis, addressing the decoding capacity when we relate to each structure independently (5 genes in each individual structure), genes alone (losing the reference to structures by averaging across structures) or individual genes (relating to each gene separately). This analysis reveals that while individual genes (specifically <italic>Egr2</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic>) are strong classifiers on their own (correctly classifying 67-70% of the mice) the predictive power improves substantially when relating to multiple features, comprising of both genes and structures.</p><p>As defined in the text: âTo further test this hypothesis, we ran a number of permutations. [â¦]. Taken together, while we find that measurement of the expression of individual genes, such as <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Egr2</italic>, across the 5 brain structures can support classification (67%, 70% respectively), the prediction is significantly improved by the measurement of multiple features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The current findings suggest that transcriptional signatures for individual experiences are primarily driven by salience and valence.
