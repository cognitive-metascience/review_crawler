structures in bacteria. A prominent candidate revealed by our initial search efforts was called the ‘<italic>thiS</italic> motif’ because of its frequent association with a gene coding for the ThiS protein, which delivers sulfur to form the thiazole moiety of the thiamin precursor HET-P. In the current report, we describe biochemical and genetic data demonstrating that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs function as sensors of the thiamin precursor HMP-PP, which is fused with HET-P ultimately to form the final active coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). HMP-PP riboswitches exhibit a distinctive architecture wherein an unusually small ligand-sensing aptamer is almost entirely embedded within an otherwise classic intrinsic transcription terminator stem. This arrangement yields remarkably compact genetic switches that bacteria use to tune the levels of thiamin precursors during the biosynthesis of this universally distributed coenzyme.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45210.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria use small genetic devices called riboswitches to sense molecules that are essential for life and regulate the genes necessary to make, break or move these molecules. Riboswitches are made of molecules of RNA and appear to have ancient origins that predate the evolution of bacteria and other lifeforms made of cells. Inside modern bacteria, chunks of DNA in the genome provide the instructions to make riboswitches and around 40 different types of riboswitch have been identified so far. However, it has been proposed that the instructions for thousands more riboswitches may remain hidden in the DNA of bacteria.</p><p>All of the currently known riboswitches contain a region called an aptamer that binds to a target molecule. This binding causes another structure in the riboswitch RNA to switch a specific gene on or off. For example, the aptamer binding might cause a hairpin-like structure called a terminator to form, which stops a gene being used to make new RNA molecules.</p><p>In 2019 a team of researchers reported using a computational approach to identify new riboswitches in bacteria. This approach identified many different chunks of DNA that might code for a riboswitch, including one known as the <italic>thiS</italic> motif. This potential new riboswitch appeared to be associated with a gene that encodes a protein required to make a vitamin called thiamin (also known as vitamin B<sub>1</sub>).</p><p>To test the new computational approach, Atilho et al. including several of the researchers involved in the earlier work used genetic and biochemical techniques to study the <italic>thiS</italic> motif. The experiments revealed that the motif binds to a molecule called HMP-PP, which bacteria use to make thiamin. Unexpectedly, the aptamer of the riboswitch was nested within a terminator, rather than being a separate entity.</p><p>The findings of Atilho et al. reveal that riboswitches can be even more compact than previously thought. Furthermore, these findings reveal new insights into how bacteria use riboswitches to manage their vitamin levels. In the future it may be possible to develop drugs that target such riboswitches to starve bacteria of these essential molecules.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>pseudoknot</kwd><kwd>RNA transcription</kwd><kwd>thiamin pyrophosphate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 GM022778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breaker</surname><given-names>Ronald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atilho</surname><given-names>Ruben M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breaker</surname><given-names>Ronald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many bacteria use a tiny riboswitch aptamer to sense the thiamin precursor HMP-PP to regulate the production of another thiamin precursor HET-P to efficiently biosynthesize this essential coenzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 40 distinct riboswitch classes that regulate gene expression in various bacterial species have been experimentally validated to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Serganov and Nudler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sherwood and Henkin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breaker, 2011</xref>). Based on the abundances and distributions of these known riboswitch classes, it has been proposed that many thousands of additional riboswitch classes remain to be discovered in the eubacterial domain of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames and Breaker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breaker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCown et al., 2017</xref>). The collection of known riboswitch classes largely sense compounds or ions that are of fundamental importance to organisms from all three domains of life, and these ligands also exhibit a bias in favor of compounds (enzyme cofactors, RNA nucleotides and their precursors or derivatives) that are predicted to be of ancient origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breaker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson and Breaker, 2017</xref>). If these trends hold, it seems likely that numerous additional riboswitch classes that regulate fundamental biological processes remain to be discovered. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these undiscovered riboswitch classes are predicted to be exceedingly rare, and this characteristic is likely to cause difficulties for researchers who seek to identify them.</p><p>To address this challenge, we developed a computational pipeline that first identifies the regions of bacterial genomes that are most likely to serve as transcription templates for structured noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and then uses comparative sequence and structural analyses to identify novel candidate RNA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, this approach examines only the putative noncoding regions of a given sequenced bacterial genome, and evaluates each intergenic region (IGR) based on two parameters: (<italic>i</italic>) percent guanosine and cytidine (GC) nucleotide content and (<italic>ii</italic>) length in nucleotides. For many bacteria, structured ncRNAs are GC-rich compared to other regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schattner, 2002</xref>), and the IGRs that serve as synthesis templates for these ncRNAs tend to be much longer than typical bacterial IGRs that contain only an RNA polymerase promoter and/or a protein-specific regulatory domain. Our current bioinformatics pipeline is based on earlier implementations of this search strategy that were used to discover several novel structured ncRNA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>), including the SAM-V riboswitch class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poiata et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our updated computational pipeline was employed to comprehensively examine the genomes of five bacterial species, which revealed the existence of as many as 70 novel genetic elements, including 30 candidate ncRNA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>). Of the eight candidate riboswitch classes uncovered in this search, the most promising was called the ‘<italic>thiS</italic> motif’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) because representatives most commonly reside immediately upstream of <italic>thiS</italic> genes, which code for a protein that delivers sulfur to the pathway for the production of the thiamin biosynthetic intermediate 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)−4-methylthiazole phosphate (HET-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begley et al., 2012</xref>). Other genes associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs appear to code for proteins that participate in the production of HET-P or its fusion to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine diphosphate (HMP-PP), to ultimately produce the bioactive coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jurgenson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45210.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>thiS</italic> motif consensus models and gene associations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conserved nucleotide sequences and two possible secondary structure models based on 400 representatives of <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs.

(Right) Another secondary structure model (‘ON’ state) for <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs, consistent with the pattern of conserved base-pairing potential, involves the formation of a distinct P1 stem and a possible pseudoknot, whereas the base-pairing of P2 is identical to the tip of the terminator stem configuration.

Genes coding for the enzymes involved in HET transport and catalysis of various biosynthetic steps are annotated with colors that reflect their association with <italic>thiS</italic> motif representatives. Note that a carboxylated derivative of HET-P, called cHET-P, has been proposed to be the main thiazole-based biosynthetic intermediate for TPP in some bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begley et al., 2012</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45210-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>An additional clue regarding the function of <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs was derived from the fact that this novel RNA structure occasionally resides in tandem with TPP riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>). Tandem arrangements of other riboswitch classes have been shown to function as two-input Boolean logic gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sudarsan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoddard and Batey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sherlock et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the genes associated with tandem arrangements of TPP riboswitches and <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs likely respond to concentration changes of two distinct ligands. Together, these observations strongly indicate that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs function as riboswitches that respond to a biochemical intermediate of the TPP biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>), we created a riboswitch-reporter fusion construct by joining a <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNA representative to a β-galactosidase gene. Using this construct, we observed robust gene expression in host <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells with a deleted <italic>thiS</italic> gene (Δ<italic>thiS</italic>). This same reporter-fusion construct yields no reporter gene expression in host <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells that naturally carry a <italic>thiS</italic> gene. These findings were consistent with our hypothesis that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs function as riboswitches, but the precise ligand sensed by the unusual architecture of this RNA remained unknown.</p><p>In the current report, we describe a series of bioinformatic, genetic and biochemical analyses that provide conclusive evidence that the ligand for <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs is the TPP biosynthetic intermediate HMP-PP. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that this unusually small riboswitch employs a distinct architecture to regulate RNA transcription termination. This regulatory RNA provides cells with an efficient mechanism to balance the production of two key biosynthetic intermediates, HMP-PP and HET-P, which are then fused to make the essential coenzyme TPP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The unusual architecture and genetic distribution of the <italic>thiS</italic> riboswitch candidate</title><p>Most experimentally validated riboswitch classes are composed of distinct, but partially overlapping aptamer and expression platform domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrick and Breaker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breaker, 2012</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>thiS</italic> motif exhibits an unusual arrangement wherein the predominant secondary structure, derived by thermodynamic modeling, is an extended hairpin structure that maximizes conventional Watson/Crick base pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). This structure exhibits all the features characteristic of bacterial intrinsic terminator stems, including an uninterrupted and strong base-paired stem followed by a run of six or more uridine (U) residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson and von Hippel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yarnell and Roberts, 1999</xref>). As a result, we concluded that transcription termination was certain to be a major function of <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs.</p><p>We frequently encounter simple terminator stems when using bioinformatics search algorithms to identify novel ncRNA candidates, and we have now begun to assign predicted terminator function to such motifs and then quickly move on to examine other more promising ncRNA candidates. When evaluating the <italic>thiS</italic> candidate, however, we noted four features that suggested this terminator stem was peculiar. First, the loop of the terminator hairpin is abnormally well conserved compared to the loop sequences of more typical terminator stems, which are usually irrelevant to the mechanism of transcription termination. This unique terminator element is found in species from two phyla and from several classes within Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Second, another consensus structural model was also consistent with the comparative sequence analysis data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). This architecture, including a possible pseudoknot and two major base-paired stems, disrupts the contiguous terminator stem near the run of U residues, suggesting that mutually exclusive and competing structures and functions might exist for <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs. Third, these apparently specialized terminator stems associate exclusively with genes related to the biosynthesis and utilization of HET-P, which is a precursor of the coenzyme TPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These sequence, structure, and genomic distribution characteristics suggested to us that each <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNA might function as a compact ligand sensor and regulator of TPP coenzyme biosynthesis.</p><p>A fourth feature of <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs is that approximately 30% of the known representatives reside immediately downstream of riboswitches that sense and respond to TPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>). Each associated TPP riboswitch appears to use a terminator stem as an expression platform. The tandem arrangement of two terminator stems for a single riboswitch aptamer would be unprecedented, and so this observation also supported our hypothesis that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs represent an unusual form of riboswitch. Due to these tandem arrangements, we speculated that the natural ligand for this riboswitch candidate would not be TPP. Rather, it seemed more likely that the ligand would be a major precursor of TPP (either HET-P or HMP-PP), and that each tandem TPP-<italic>thiS</italic> motif system would function as a two-input Boolean logic gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sudarsan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoddard and Batey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sherlock et al., 2018</xref>) to regulate HET-P production in response to the cellular concentrations of both TPP and one of its biosynthetic precursors.</p><p>Furthermore, if the two secondary structure states called the ‘terminator configuration’ and the ‘aptamer configuration’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) represent the riboswitch ‘OFF’ and ‘ON’ configurations, respectively, then ligand binding by the aptamer in <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs is expected to activate gene expression. The vast majority of riboswitches that sense metabolites and control biosynthetic pathways are OFF switches, and thus the accumulation of the metabolite ligand results in reduced expression of the protein products that otherwise would make (or import) more of the desired metabolite. Although <italic>thiS</italic> motif representatives associate with genes for the production of HET-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), it does not make sense that HET-P would turn on its own production when it is already abundant. Finally, we recognized that the <italic>thiE</italic> gene (coding for thiamin-phosphate synthase) is occasionally associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif representatives, suggesting that the RNA motif determines if cellular conditions are suitable to couple the two key precursors of thiamin monophosphate (TMP) to eventually yield TPP. Taken together, all these bioinformatic observations are consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs function as ON riboswitches for the TPP precursor HMP-PP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A <italic>thiS</italic> riboswitch-reporter fusion construct is activated by the addition of HMP to cells</title><p>As an initial test of our hypothesis that HMP-PP is the ligand for <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs, we employed a chromosomally-integrated reporter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>) carrying a β-galactosidase gene fused downstream of nucleotides encompassing the <italic>thiS</italic> motif from <italic>Clostridium</italic> species Maddingley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosewarne et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Perhaps the natural suppression of TPP biosynthesis when cells have sufficient amounts of this coenzyme precludes the formation of excess HMP-PP in this surrogate organism. Specifically, if translation of the <italic>thiD</italic> gene coding for HMP/HMP-P kinase is largely suppressed under normal cellular conditions, the externally supplied HMP cannot be phosphorylated to generate HMP-PP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45210.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HMP-PP triggers reporter gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence and predicted secondary structure of the WT <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNA associated with the <italic>thiS</italic> gene of <italic>C.</italic> sp.

Although the main base-paired regions P1 and P2 remain unchanged by HMP-PP addition, nucleotides involved in forming the putative pseudoknot (sites 1 and 2), and other nucleotides in the loop of P2 (site 3) appear to become more structured. Additional mutations were introduced into construct 52 <italic>thiS</italic> M3 to evaluate the effects of mutations known or expected to disrupt gene control function. Specifically, previous mutations M1 or M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), or M6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were introduced to create constructs, termed M7, M8 and M9, which carry alterations to highly-conserved nucleotides that presumably disrupt pseudoknot formation. These additional mutations eliminate structural modulation by HMP-PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as would be expected if these highly-conserved sequence and structural features are critical for riboswitch aptamer function.</p><p>We suspect that the ligand concentration is insufficient to saturate all RNAs in the sample.

However, if we assume that all HMP was enzymatically converted into HMP-PP, this product was fully recovered after removal of protein by filtration, and that there was no degradation over the time frame of the assays, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value cannot be greater than 500 μM for this variant aptamer construct.</p><p>A series of shortened constructs carrying the M3 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) recapitulate the transition between the terminator and aptamer configurations as originally observed for the series of WT truncated RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, the 53 <italic>thiS</italic> M3 construct exhibits evidence of both binding to HMP-PP and of structural switching to favor the aptamer configuration (‘ON’ state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This finding suggests that it is necessary to prevent the formation of G-U wobble base-pairs between nucleotide positions 25–27 and positions 46–48 for ligand binding to be observed by using in-line probing assays. The time scale of in-line probing reactions (24 to 48 hr) is much longer than the time scale for the natural genetic decision to take place (probably a few seconds). Therefore our biochemical assays permit the RNAs to reach thermodynamic equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wickiser et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wickiser et al., 2005b</xref>), which should favor the terminator configuration. By mutating the U nucleotides at positions 46–48, we prevent constructs from becoming thermodynamically trapped in the terminator configuration during in-line probing, which permits HMP-PP binding to be observed. This same effect could be achieved with natural <italic>thiS</italic> motif sequences by having the U nucleotides at positions 46–48 remain sequestered in the RNA-exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vassylyev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hein et al., 2014</xref>) of an RNA polymerase that is paused within the run of U nucleotides of the intrinsic terminator stem. We speculate that momentary ligand binding during this paused state will be sufficient to prevent terminator formation on the vastly shorter time scale that is relevant to the genetic decision process in cells.</p><p>Overall, our biochemical data are strongly consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs function as riboswitches that directly bind to HMP-PP. As a result, we favor renaming <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs as HMP-PP riboswitches. The pursuit of more precise biochemical and biophysical characteristics, and further evidence for the mechanism proposed above, will require both the judicious use of RNA constructs that form the aptamer configuration, and either the preparation of pure samples of HMP-PP with consideration for its relative instability or the use of more stable analogs that can trigger riboswitch function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tandem TPP and HMP-PP riboswitches function as Boolean genetic logic gates</title><p>As noted above, approximately 30% of the representatives of HMP-PP riboswitches reside in tandem with TPP riboswitches. In these tandem systems, the TPP riboswitch always occurs first, and the TPP aptamer is always associated with its own expression platform, which is routinely a readily recognizable intrinsic terminator stem. The HMP-PP riboswitch follows each complete TPP riboswitch, and by its unique architecture, carries its own intrinsic terminator expression platform.</p><p>This arrangement, as observed in a representative from the bacterium <italic>Clostridium lundense</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), makes apparent the genetic decisions made by the host. Specifically, abundant TPP should repress expression of the associated gene, which usually codes for a protein needed to biosynthesize HET-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This repression, regardless of the concentration of HMP-PP, makes sense because cells do not need to make more TPP when this enzyme cofactor is already abundant. However, when TPP is in short supply, transcripts should read through the first intrinsic terminator stem to begin transcription of the HMP-PP riboswitch. The HMP-PP aptamer only permits transcription read-through of its co-resident intrinsic terminator stem if the relative abundance of its ligand is high. If HMP-PP is abundant, then the resulting full-length mRNAs will produce proteins that biosynthesize more HET-P.

Unfortunately, we cannot easily create cellular conditions to fully examine all four possible ligand states represented in the truth table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Most obviously, TPP is an essential cofactor, and thus we cannot deplete its concentration to zero while maintaining cell viability. Also, the various TPP biosynthetic intermediates are likely to be present in low concentrations if the cell is continuously making more TPP, even at low flux. As a result, a cell might experience conditions where an individual nascent RNA transcript of the tandem riboswitch system could respond to any of the four possible states, but these responses when summed over multiple nascent transcripts will yield a hybrid gene expression response that generally reflects the state of ligands in the cell.</p><p>To fully examine the gene expression outputs for all four possible states, despite the complications described above, we only partially manipulated the state of ligands, while also creating artificial representations of the missing states by using riboswitch aptamer mutations. Specifically, by adding HMP to the culture medium, we could change the ligand state from state 2 (+TPP, ‒ HMP-PP) to state 4 (+TPP,+HMP-PP). As predicted by the truth table, ligand states 2 and 4 do not yield expression of the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We also artificially created states 1 (‒ TPP, ‒ HMP-PP) and 3 (‒ TPP,+HMP-PP) by employing disruptive mutations in the aptamers for TPP (M10), HMP-PP (M1), or both (M11). Only the artificial state 3 condition, as created by mutating the TPP aptamer and growing cells in the presence of HMP, yields robust reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, M10</xref>). This gene expression effect is lost when disabling mutations are placed in both aptamers (M11) to simulate state 1. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that each tandem TPP and HMP-PP riboswitch system functions as a Boolean converse nonimplication logic gate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>All of our findings derived from bioinformatic, genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs represent an unusual class of riboswitches that sense and respond to the thiamin pyrophosphate biosynthetic intermediate HMP-PP. Its architecture is unusual because the majority of the nucleotides and structures required for ligand recognition appear to be encompassed by an intrinsic transcription terminator, which forms in a mutually-exclusive manner to regulate gene expression. All other riboswitch classes reported to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCown et al., 2017</xref>) that employ an intrinsic terminator structure as an expression platform carry the most-highly conserved nucleotides and structural features largely upstream of, and sometimes only partly overlapping, the terminator structure. This unique overlapping architecture of HMP-PP riboswitches provides bacteria with a highly-compact, yet effective RNA-based gene control system for measuring HMP-PP concentrations and tuning the production of HET-P to more efficiently produce TPP.</p><p>The embedded nature of the aptamer and expression platform domains, however, complicated the pursuit of experiments typically used to biochemically validate a newly discovered riboswitch class. Most importantly, our experiments required the use of non-native constructs to successfully reveal HMP-PP binding in vitro. Therefore, it is notable that modifications to certain key constructs maintain function in vitro or in vivo. For example, the trimming of nucleotides at the 3′ region of the terminator stem to create RNA construct 52 <italic>thiS</italic> yields a molecule that is expected to represent the exposed portion of a polymerase-paused nascent RNA transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This truncated construct adopts the predicted P1 stem of the aptamer configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Also, the addition of nucleotide changes to create the M3 variant of 52 <italic>thiS</italic> yields a construct that binds HMP-PP, whereas this same M3 mutation in a related construct retains ligand-dependent gene-control function in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Our results also reveal a mechanism for gene control involving the stalling of RNA polymerase at a precise location to yield an exposed nascent RNA transcript that is transiently capable of forming an HMP-PP binding pocket. The 52 <italic>thiS</italic> construct predominantly exists in the aptamer configuration, which is distinct from even modestly longer forms that partially (53 <italic>thiS</italic>) or exclusively (54 <italic>thiS</italic>) adopt the terminator configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If HMP-PP is present and docks in the aptamer when the nascent mRNA transcript is exposed up to nucleotide position 52, terminator stem formation is precluded and transcription proceeds to generate the full-length RNA. Forward movement of RNA polymerase by even a single nucleotide yields a construct that begins to commit to the terminator stem structure, and at this point transcription would be terminated regardless of the presence of HMP-PP.</p><p>The <italic>thiS</italic> motif was originally identified as a riboswitch candidate by using an updated computational pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stav et al., 2019</xref>) that focuses attention on relatively long, GC-rich IGRs. This method of riboswitch discovery was developed to improve our ability to uncover rare and/or small riboswitch candidates. Thousands of riboswitch classes are predicted to remain undiscovered in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames and Breaker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCown et al., 2017</xref>), and many of these are likely to be exceedingly rare and/or difficult to find because of their structural simplicity. Experimental demonstration that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs are representatives of a compact riboswitch class that responds to HMP-PP provides initial confirmation that the updated computational pipeline can uncover riboswitch classes that have resisted discovery by other bioinformatic or genetic methods. We are hopeful that many more riboswitch classes will be revealed by employing such bioinformatics search algorithms on additional sequenced bacterial genomes.</p><p>Finally, we note that the discovery of an HMP-PP riboswitch provides yet another example of a modern RNA class that selectively binds a molecule that was likely present in an RNA World (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gilbert, 1986</xref>). Many of the common enzyme cofactors are derived from RNA nucleotides or their precursors, including TPP and its precursor HMP-PP, which is a characteristic previously used to support the hypothesis that these molecules predate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">White, 1976</xref>). TPP and many other RNA-derived coenzymes might have participated in a complex metabolic state run entirely by RNA enzymes and receptors, and therefore many riboswitches for coenzymes likewise might be molecular descendants from RNAs that utilized these coenzymes long ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breaker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCown et al., 2017</xref>). If true, HMP-PP riboswitches provide another opportunity to learn how simple RNA sequences and structures could have selectively bound important nucleotide-derived metabolites in primitive organisms of the RNA World.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>)</td><td><italic>thiD</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: AZI82914.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td><italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain 168</td><td>Bacillus Genetic <break/>Stock Center</td><td>1A1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21 (DE3)</td><td>New England <break/>Biolabs</td><td>C2527I</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td><italic>ΔthiS</italic></td><td>Bacillus Genetic <break/>Stock Center</td><td>11680</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td><italic>ΔthiD</italic></td><td>Bacillus Genetic <break/>Stock Center</td><td>11710</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td><italic>ΔthiE</italic></td><td>Bacillus Genetic <break/>Stock Center</td><td>38290</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pDG1661-<italic>thiS-lacZ</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>HMP-PP riboswitch <break/>β-galactosidase <break/>reporter construct</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pDG1661-tandem-lacZ</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Tandem TPP and <break/>HMP-PP riboswitch <break/>β-galactosidase <break/>reporter construct</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pDG148-Stu-<italic>thiD</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>pDG148-Stu expression <break/>vector for ThiD protein</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pETDuet:His-ThiD</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>pETDuet expression <break/>vector for N-terminal <break/>HisX6 tagged ThiD <break/>protein</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase <break/>holoenzyme</td><td>New England <break/>Biolabs</td><td>M0551S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>(4-amino-2-methylpyrimidin- <break/>5-yl)methanol</td><td>Enamine Ltd</td><td>EN300-135390</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>X-Gal</td><td>MilliporeSigma</td><td>3117073001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>4-Methylumbelliferyl <break/>β-D-galactopyranoside</td><td>MilliporeSigma</td><td>M1633</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>[γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP</td><td>PerkinElmer</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>[α-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP</td><td>PerkinElmer</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism <break/>(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>)</td><td>GraphPad Prism <break/>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com">https://graphpad.com</ext-link>)</td><td/><td>Version 7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals, oligonucleotides and bacterial strains</title><p>Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the exception of 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine, also known as (4-amino-2-methylpyrimidin-5-yl) methanol, which was purchased from Enamine Ltd.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bacterial riboswitch class for the thiamin precursor HMP-PP employs a terminator-embedded aptamer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jinwei Zhang (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Atilho et al. presents a new twist in the riboswitch field: an unexpected finding of a ligand-sensing domain embedded in the expression platform, a transcriptional terminator. It begs the question: how many of these mini-systems are hidden out there? The authors did excellent work proving that <italic>thiS</italic> motif is a functional riboswitch that responds to an important precursor of thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of vitamin B1. The size of this riboswitch is remarkably small, and yet not only can this riboswitch recognizes the ligand very specifically, it can also function in conjunction with another riboswitch to precisely balance the expression of relevant genes. Undoubtedly, this work will attract attention of many researchers in different fields and will force researchers to re-think composition and role of one of the most widely-spread molecular elements – transcription terminator. The results will be of great interest to broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Collectively, the reviewers have a few major points for clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(The authors do not necessarily need to address every question raised here, however, an effort to provide a more completely picture of the <italic>thiS-thiM</italic> regulated bacterial physiology would certainly further improve the impact of the work.)</p><p>1) There is a lack of sufficient information on the distribution and genetic arrangements of <italic>thiS</italic> riboswitches. The authors cited an unpublished paper by Stav et al., 2019 but did not provide this manuscript and did not reveal details relevant to the current work. It is unclear when the Stav et al. work will be published and it is recommended to give a better summary of the findings and perhaps a supplementary figure with genetic arrangements, which would nicely complement a supplementary figure with riboswitch sequences. What are &quot;uncommon&quot; genes that reside downstream of <italic>thiS</italic> motif? Are all of them mentioned in the third paragraph of the Introduction? Can the assigned specificity of this motif explain regulation of these uncommon genes? If no, could it be possible for the riboswitch to recognize more than one ligand, especially given the fact that HMP-PP binding may be weak? Can this motif be a family of distinct riboswitches? Were there any attempts made to separate the motif on submotifs based on the genetic association? What are transporter genes controlled by the motif? <italic>ThiW</italic> appears to be an essential thiazole transporter and although the presence of the <italic>thiS</italic> motif controlling this protein suggests the regulation of coupling of the two TPP moieties, one can imagine direct regulation of a subtype of this motif by precursors of HET-P (Figure 1B). Figure 1B shows several genes associated with this motif and it would be helpful to identify and discuss these genes. Is each of these genes preceded by its own copy of the <italic>thiS</italic> motif? Are these genes controlled by a single thiS motif and not by a tandem <italic>this-thiM</italic> motif? The third paragraph of the subsection “The unusual architecture and genetic distribution of the <italic>thiS</italic> riboswitch candidate”, says that 30% of the known representatives reside near TPP riboswitches. Is there a genetic bias for the tandem riboswitch arrangement? Why the consensus motif (Figure 1A) is presented differently in the terminator and aptamer configurations? In the aptamer configuration, the loop in P1 is shown as variable while no extra nts are indicated for this region in the terminator configuration. The variable loop size contradicts the statement: &quot;This structure exhibits all the features characteristic of bacterial intrinsic terminator stems, including an uninterrupted and strong base-paired stem&quot;. Actually the entire 5' end is different in the two configurations. Answers to these questions will help to convince this reviewer that the <italic>thiS</italic> motif is indeed a HMP-PP binder and will also help microbiologists to better understanding regulatory networks associated with vitamin production in bacteria.</p><p>2) The novel computational pipeline the authors describe is from unpublished work. Though not the subject of this manuscript, it is hard to see how this new approach differs from approaches used by this lab in the past. What makes this new approach more sensitive to rare riboswitch elements? Does this sensitivity arise from looking at smaller groups of bacteria (5 species) instead of across numerous species? The novelty of the approach is touted throughout, but not well explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45210.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is a lack of sufficient information on the distribution and genetic arrangements of thiS riboswitches.

Unfortunately, this manuscript had experienced a remarkably long delay in the initial review process (~9 months). On March 7, 2019 we received notice that this original discovery manuscript has been accepted for publication by BMC Microbiology. Regardless, we have also decided to include an updated and detailed bioinformatics dataset as a Supplementary file 1 to the current revised manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>. The original two supplementary files have been renamed accordingly. See also our response to Major Point 2 below.</p><p>Point 1B: The reviewers encourage us to comment on uncommon gene associations for the <italic>thiS</italic> motif and to discuss the possibility that the riboswitch aptamer might recognize different ligands to regulate these uncommon genes.</p><p>This question from the reviewers is an important one, particularly given the recent and striking examples of variant “<italic>ykkC</italic> orphan riboswitch” RNAs that have adapted to respond to at least five distinct ligands. However, nearly all the genes associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs appear to code for proteins that participate in the production of HET-P or its coupling to HMP-PP. In some instances, associated genes from organisms whose genomes have not been annotated appear as ‘proteins of unknown function’. However, we have examined these genes and nearly all of these can easily be classified as <italic>thiS</italic>. Therefore, we do not have any indication that <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs have changed their specificity to regulate genes unrelated to thiamin pyrophosphate biosynthesis in general, or HET-P biosynthesis in particular. Also, the sequence alignments are quite uniform (matching the consensus), and so we do not believe that the RNAs have specialized based on any particular gene association. To clarify these consistent characteristics, we have edited the following text to the paragraph noted by the reviewers:</p><p>“Most other genes associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs appear to code for proteins that participate in the production of HET-P or its fusion to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine diphosphate (HMP-PP), to ultimately produce the bioactive coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) (Jurgenson et al., 2009).”</p><p>Point 1C: The reviewers ask for specific clarification on the <italic>thiS</italic> motif association with a putative thiazole transporter.</p><p>We have found that transporter annotations can be uncertain (and are frequently incorrect) and so we must speculate with considerable caution. However, the transporter genes associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs would make most sense if they import molecules related to HET-P production. Specifically, we believe that the <italic>thiW</italic> gene association is a logical association for an HMP-PP “ON” switch because excess HMP-PP would trigger the import of the thiazole derivative HET, which can be used to biosynthesize more HET-P. In other words, we see no reason to doubt the current annotation of this transporter gene, and thus we have no evidence of a ligand specificity switch based on the current transporter gene annotations associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif representatives.</p><p>Point 1D: The reviewers encourage us to discuss each of the genes associated with <italic>thiS</italic> motif RNAs and to describe the arrangements of their associated riboswitches.</p><p>Generally, the <italic>thiS</italic> gene is the gene most proximal to the RNA motif, whereas the other genes appear to be part of an operon regulated by HMP-PP riboswitches. Based on these gene names, and these operon arrangements, we believe the gene products catalyze the reaction steps for HET-P or TPP biosynthesis as depicted in Figure 1B. This list of gene functions has now been included in the new Supplementary file 1 that reports the various <italic>thiS</italic> representatives and their associated genes. Unfortunately we do not have a basis for discussing these predicted functions beyond that implied by the figure.</p><p>Point 1E: The reviewers ask if there is any special bias in the distribution of tandem TPP and HMP-PP (<italic>thiS</italic>) riboswitch systems.</p><p>We do not observe any special bias in the distribution of single versus tandem riboswitches, and therefore we cannot make any profound conclusions regarding the use of these arrangements. Presumably some species are exploiting the advantage of using tandem TPP and HMP-PP riboswitches, whereas others fail to take advantage of this arrangement. Such imperfect exploitations of tandem riboswitch arrangements have been observed for other riboswitch classes in the past.</p><p>Point 1F: The reviewers ask why the consensus models between the two structural states depicted in Figure 1A are different.</p><p>The vast majority of the nucleotide annotations in the original Figure 1A were identical between the two models. However, sequence alignments that match the proposed distinct structural states (specifically the complete terminator stem versus P1) caused slight differences in the consensus sequence model near the 5’ terminus (due to alignment alterations). To avoid depicting these differences, we have revised Figure 1A so that we depict the two structural states using only the consensus nucleotide sequence model for the aptamer configuration alignment. This updated figure is included in the revised manuscript file.</p><p>Point 1G: The reviewers state that our claim that the motif has the classic characteristics of an intrinsic terminator stem is incorrect.</p><p>We disagree. As we indicate in the original manuscript, the structural model as drawn on the <underline>left</underline> side of Figure 1A (terminator configuration) has all the key characteristics expected for a classic intrinsic terminator. Specifically, this part of the figure depicts a long hairpin with strong and continuous base-pairing, followed by a run of U nucleotides. Even as originally drafted, we do not believe that readers will be unduly confused by the <underline>right</underline> side of Figure 1A (aptamer configuration), as we carefully label these two structural states. Thus, given the clarity of the text and the figure annotations, we feel that the original text and the revised graphics should serve the readers well, and so no additional edits beyond those noted in Point 1F have been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The novel computational pipeline the authors describe is from unpublished work.

Specifically, how is the current pipeline able to uncover rare riboswitch candidates?</p><p>These questions on the bioinformatics pipeline are fully addressed in the preceding manuscript (Stav et al.) that is mentioned in the response to Major Point 1A above. Briefly, our approach is a substantially updated version of a search strategy we first published in 2009. Specifically, this approach enriches for stretches of bacterial genomes that are likely to carry novel noncoding RNA motifs like riboswitches by collecting long, GC-rich intergenic regions (IGRs). This massively reduces the number of false positive candidates, and allows us to focus on motifs that are more likely to have the biochemical functions we seek. Although the delay in the initial review of the Stav et al. manuscript has been unusually long, as noted in the response to Point 1A, we have recently received word that our revised manuscript has been accepted for publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
