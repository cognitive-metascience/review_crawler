the mammalian host. How sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical, but poorly understood process. In this study, we examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels, using intravital microscopy in mice. Our data suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: in regions far from blood vessels, they exhibit ‘avascular motility’, defined by high speed and less confinement, while in the vicinity of blood vessels their motility is more constrained. We find that curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlight the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07789.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07789.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07789.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria remains a devastating disease in many parts of the world. Malaria parasites enter the host via the skin, where they are deposited by infected mosquitoes as they look for blood. The parasites must exit the skin to reach the liver, where they multiply and ultimately infect red blood cells, where they cause the symptoms of the disease. In the skin, the parasites must move to find blood vessels that they enter to travel via the blood circulation to the liver. Only about 10–20% of parasites make it out of the skin, making this a bottleneck for the parasite.</p><p>Scientists have been working to develop vaccines that would protect people against malaria. One way these could work would be to stop malaria parasites from leaving the skin and entering the blood vessels. But to do that, more needs to be learnt about how the parasites move in the skin and enter the blood vessels.</p><p>Hopp et al., using a mouse model of malaria, created malaria parasites that produce a fluorescent protein that allows the parasites to be tracked after they have been injected into the skin of a mouse's ear. This revealed that the parasites have two ways of moving. After first being injected, the parasites move quickly and freely. The parasites slow down when they come close to a blood vessel and move on or around the vessel for some time before entering it. During this stage of movement, the parasites tend to move in paths that follow the curvature of the blood vessels, which may improve how well they make contact with the blood vessel surface and may enable them to find the areas of the vessels best suited for entry.</p><p>Next, Hopp et al. investigated how two parasite mutants move through mouse skin. Both mutants had previously been found to be less likely than wild-type parasites to exit the inoculation site. Hopp et al. found that one of the mutants moves slowly after being injected and so explores a smaller tissue volume than normal and encounters fewer blood vessels. The second mutant parasite spends more time than normal moving on the surface of the blood vessels, but finds it difficult to enter them.</p><p>Continuing this work will allow us to learn more about the interactions between the parasite and the blood vessels, which in turn could reveal key events that could be targeted by a vaccine. Furthermore, the significant amount of time that the parasites spend moving and looking for blood vessels in the skin could be a good time to target them with antibodies and prevent malaria infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07789.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07789.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>sporozoite</kwd><kwd>gliding motility</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A1056840</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinnis</surname><given-names>Photini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hopp</surname><given-names>Christine S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1104637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiou</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Malaria parasites enter the host via the skin, where they are inoculated by an infected mosquito as it probes for blood: the inoculation site is a bottleneck for the parasite and the only time when the parasite is extracellular for more than a few minutes, thus possibly presenting the best opportunity for antibody-mediated inhibition of infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Through the bite of an infected mosquito, the mammalian host is infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites, which migrate through the skin to invade blood vessels. Sporozoites are then carried by the blood flow to the liver, where they initiate a liver- and subsequently a blood-stage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sinnis and Zavala, 2012</xref>). Sporozoite motility, a substrate-dependent gliding motility, is essential for the exit from the dermis, and as a result for sporozoite infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vanderberg and Frevert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). In comparison to fast migrating mammalian cells, such as lymphocytes, which crawl at approximately 0.1 μm/s, sporozoites move at 1–3 μm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). Given the energy cost of such a remarkable speed, fast migration is likely key for sporozoite infectivity. Gliding speed is affected by the turnover of focal adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Münter et al., 2009</xref>), as well as by environmental obstacles present in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>). While on two-dimensional substrates in vitro, salivary gland sporozoites glide in a circular pattern. In the dermis, this motion is transformed to a complex non-linear path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has shown that both the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) have important roles for the exit of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> sporozoites from the dermal inoculation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). Proteolytic processing of CSP leads to removal of the N-terminus and exposure of a cell-adhesion domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>). Sporozoites expressing a mutant CSP which lacks the N-terminus (CSΔN), thus mimicking the proteolytically processed form of CSP, display normal infectivity when inoculated intravenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>). However, when CSΔN sporozoites are injected intradermally, parasites are undetectable in the liver and exhibit a significant delay in the prepatency period, indicating that CSΔN parasites are impaired in their ability to exit the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>). CSΔN sporozoites show only a small reduction in gliding motility in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that these mutant sporozoites have additional impairments in vivo. Mutant TRAP-VAL parasites carry mutations in the putative rhomboid-cleavage site of TRAP and similar to the CSΔN mutant, they have a more dramatic reduction in their infectivity after intradermal inoculation, compared to intravenous inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike the CSΔN sporozoites, TRAP-VAL sporozoites display a significantly reduced gliding speed in vitro, moving at approximately 0.5 μm/s in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a quantitative in vivo study on the motility of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites over time, and by visualization of dermal vascular endothelia we describe their interaction with dermal blood vessels. We characterize changes in sporozoite motility over the first 2 hr after intradermal inoculation and identify an altered type of sporozoite motility in proximity of blood vessels. We rendered the CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites fluorescent in order to study the function of these surface proteins in dermal parasite motility and blood vessel recognition and found that CSΔN sporozoites spend more time engaging with blood vessels, yet are unable to enter the blood circulation. Imaging TRAP-VAL sporozoites, we find that their slow gliding speed significantly decreases the volume of tissue explored, which likely results in reduced ability to encounter blood vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sporozoite motility at the dermal inoculation site is increasingly constrained over time</title><p>To quantitatively assess sporozoite motility over the first 120 min after inoculation into the skin of a mouse, we generated <italic>P. berghei</italic> sporozoites expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry under the control of a strong sporozoite-stage promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and visualized them in the ear pinna. 4-min time-lapse stacks were acquired 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min after intradermal inoculation (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) and the paths of migrating sporozoites were manually tracked using Imaris software. Reconstructed tracks were re-centered by plotting to a common origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which revealed a gradual decrease in parasite dispersal over the first 120 min after inoculation. The mean square displacement (MSD) reflects the dissemination of a motile population from their origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltman et al., 2009</xref>).

This allowed us to ascertain whether sporozoite dissemination mimics that of a Brownian walk. The distribution of this probability P(r) was plotted in a normalized histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and it was found that the migration of sporozoites is not well described by an ordinary random walk. In particular, the probability of large displacements is much higher than would be expected for a Brownian walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the analysis of sporozoite displacement only included sporozoites predominantly moving in linear or meandering patterns. </p><p>While the ability of sporozoites to disperse decreases significantly after 20 min and further during the following 100 min, the apparent gliding speed does not change significantly until 60 min after inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which shows that the decrease in MSD is not merely a reflection of sporozoites moving more slowly. This prompted us to look at the pattern with which sporozoites move at the different time points. Over time, an increasing number of parasites engage in continuous circular motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While at early time points, this sporozoite behavior is seen less frequently, at 20 min and 30 min after inoculation, approximately 22% and 36% of total sporozoites exhibit continuously circling motility. Importantly, at these time points the increased percentage of circling sporozoites is not the result of the other motile sporozoites leaving the field, but rather an increase in the absolute number of sporozoites that are exclusively circling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, by 60 and 120 min, there are 20 and 40% fewer sporozoites in the field, respectively, and an increased number of non-motile sporozoites. Thus, at 120 min almost all moving sporozoites are circling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis shows that the change in sporozoite trajectories at 20 and 30 min was not due to their slowing down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To better understand this increase in parasite confinement, track straightness was calculated. Track straightness is defined as the ratio of displacement to track length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltman et al., 2009</xref>), and smaller ratios reflect more constrained tracks, while straight tracks are characterized by large ratios. This analysis included the entire population of motile sporozoites (meandering sporozoites, as well as sporozoites continuously moving in the same circle). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, the straightness of sporozoite tracks gradually decreases over the first 120 min after inoculation with the most significant decrease seen beginning at 20 min after inoculation. These data suggest that sporozoite motility changes over time such that after an initial phase of maximal dispersal, sporozoites move in more constrained circular paths. Of note, a similiar change in sporozoite motility was seen in data acquired from sporozoites imaged after inoculation by a probing infected mosquito, with a significant drop in MSD 20 min after mosquito bite and a concomitant increase in the number of sporozoites engaging in circular motility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Though these data suggest that overall, the pattern of motility is similar whether sporozoites are deposited by mosquito bite or needle; additional experimentation is needed to provide more quantitative data. Unfortunately, these data are more difficult to acquire because of technical issues in finding and capturing, by video-microscopy, sporozoites inoculated by a probing mosquito.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sporozoites recognize dermal CD31+ blood vessels</title><p>In order to exit the skin and enter the blood circulation, sporozoites must encounter and penetrate blood vessels. Although it was initially postulated that sporozoites might also reach the liver via the lymphatic vessels, a previous study found that sporozoites entering lymphatic vessels in the skin do not travel beyond the draining lymph node, and thus do not participate in liver stage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Radtke et al., 2015</xref>). To characterize the ability of sporozoites to engage with dermal vasculature, we visualized vascular endothelia by labeling the pan-endothelial junction molecule CD31 (also designated as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, PECAM-1) by intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled rat anti-CD31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Formaglio et al., 2014</xref>). CD31 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is present on the surface of endothelial cells of both lymphatics and blood vessels, where it is a constituent of intercellular junctions. However, as we performed our experiments within 2–3 hr of intravenous inoculation of anti-CD31, lymphatics were not labeled in our studies, since it takes ∼24 hr for intravenously inoculated antibody to get into the extravascular space and taken up by lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sarkisyan et al., 2012</xref>). This was confirmed by labeling lymphatic vessels with antibodies against the lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kilarski et al., 2013</xref>), which in the time frame of our experiments revealed no co-localization with CD31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, lymphatic vessels, being wider and flatter and frequently possessing blind endings, have a different shape than blood vessels.</p><p>We observed sporozoites gliding in close proximity to CD31-labeled vessels and frequently found sporozoites gliding in parallel to or in circular paths around the vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Surprisingly, sporozoites do not immediately penetrate blood vessels after contacting them. Instead, they move on and around vessels for significant periods of time, frequently even detaching from vessels and moving back into avascular areas of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). We quantified the time sporozoites spend in proximity to blood vessels and found that on average, sporozoites spend 28% of their gliding time near or on vessels, which in our 4-min videos correspond to over a minute of total gliding time.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07789.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sporozoites recognize dermal blood vessels.</title><p>Time-lapse microscopy of sporozoites, 10 min after intradermal inoculation, and CD31-labeled vascular endothelia.

A representative maximum intensity projection of this tracking is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> with the two data sets shown in different colors. Analysis of the two tracking sets showed that compared to sporozoites gliding independently of CD31-labeled vessels, the average apparent speed of gliding sporozoites decreases once they approach a blood vessel from 1.38 μm/s to 1.06 μm/s, and this difference is highly significant (p value &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To compare the dispersal of sporozoites gliding in avascular tissue to those gliding in proximity to vascular structures, the MSD of the two populations was plotted over time. To normalize for track length in this analysis, all tracks were fragmented to 30-s intervals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the displacement of sporozoites gliding on or in proximity to blood vessels is decreased, as is the slope obtained from linear regression fitting of the MSD plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, inset). This is partially a result of the decrease in gliding speed of these sporozoites, but also due to an increase in sporozoite confinement. This is demonstrated by an analysis of the curvature of sporozoite tracks, which is the curvature of the circles fitted to every 10-s interval of a given track and is defined as the inverse of the radius of that circle (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kevinkchiou/Malaria-Motility">https://github.com/kevinkchiou/Malaria-Motility</ext-link> and ‘Materials and methods’). The analysis revealed that while avascular tracks have little curvature, most commonly 0.077–0.125 μm<sup>−1</sup>, the majority of sporozoite tracks that overlap with blood vessels describe trajectories that have a curvature of 0.125–0.2 μm<sup>−1</sup>, which, remarkably, equals the curvature of the circumference of dermal capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yen and Braverman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braverman, 1997</xref>). These data demonstrate that sporozoite motility can change in response to environmental signals encountered by the sporozoite and suggest that sporozoites in the dermis exhibit two types of motility: ‘avascular motility’, which is defined by high speed and less confinement, leading to maximal displacements in avascular areas and a more constrained ‘perivascular motility’, which is observed once the parasite glides in proximity of a blood vessel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Motility of CSΔN and TRAP-VAL mutants in the dermis</title><p>Recent work suggested that both CSP and TRAP have important roles for exit from the dermis with the demonstration that CSΔN parasites, which express a truncated form of CSP, and TRAP-VAL sporozoites, which carry mutations in the putative rhomboid-cleavage site of TRAP, have a more dramatic reduction in their infectivity after intradermal inoculation, compared to intravenous injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>).

MSD analysis of the two tracking sets revealed that similar to wild-type control sporozoites, perivascular CSΔN tracks have a decreased MSD and gliding speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), indicating that while CSΔN sporozoites spend more time gliding in proximity to vasculature, the switch from ‘avascular’ to ‘perivascular motility’ appears normal. TRAP-VAL sporozoites also exhibit differential ‘avascular’ and ‘perivascular motility’, although the differences in MSD and speed between these two types of tracks is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Decreased blood vessel exit of CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites</title><p>Intravital microscopy of mutant CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites in conjunction with fluorescently labeled dermal vascular endothelia was performed, and invasion events were manually quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). Invasion was classified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>), with blood vessel invasion defined by a sudden increase in speed or visual entry of the blood vessel and disappearance out of the field of view. It should be noted that the speed with which sporozoites appear to be carried out of the field is slower in videos that include CD31-labeling, as a result of the slower acquisition speed due to capture of two channels. Lymphatic invasion was defined by the switch from directed forward movement to sideward drifting with a low velocity. On average, in a 4-min video beginning at 10 min after inoculation, 2.38% of wild-type control sporozoites in the field of view enters the blood circulation, and 2.06% of sporozoites enters the lymphatic system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Blood vessel invasion of the CSΔN mutant is reduced to 0.23% and only 0.05% of TRAP-VAL sporozoites is seen to enter into blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which is consistent with the decrease in infectivity of these mutants upon intradermal inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). Invasion of the lymphatic system by CSΔN sporozoites is reduced to 0.26% and not detected at all in the case of TRAP-VAL sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, CD31-labeling is not interfering with entry into dermal blood or lymphatic vessels or parasite dispersal, as vessel invasion rates, as well as sporozoite MSDs, are comparable in videos acquired in mice with and without labeled blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media7" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07789-media7.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07789.021</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Wild-type control sporozoites 10 min after intradermal inoculation together with CD31-labeled vascular endothelia highlighting blood and lymphatic vessel invasion events.</title><p>Squares indicate blood vessel invasion and circles point to sporozoites entered into the lymphatic system.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, these mutants sample less of their environment; however, this is unlikely to fully explain their dramatically decreased entry into the blood and lymphatic circulations. Since only motile sporozoites are included in the calculation of MSD, it is important to consider the increased number of non-motile CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites that together with the decreased dispersal, could account for the low numbers of mutants entering the blood circulation. To look at this, we normalized the total time control and mutant sporozoites spent in proximity of blood vessels, by including all sporozoites in the field, that is, both motile and non-motile sporozoites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (right panel), TRAP-VAL sporozoites spend on average, 40% less time on vessels compared to wild-type control sporozoites, a decrease that is due, in part, to the large number of non-motile TRAP-VAL sporozoites. Nonetheless, the population of TRAP-VAL sporozoites still spends approximately 10% of its time on or near blood vessels, yet blood vessel entry events were reduced by 97%, suggesting that even when TRAP-VAL sporozoites do contact vessels they cannot invade them. This is even more dramatically illustrated by the CSΔN mutant that spends approximately the same total time on vessels as the control wild-type sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right panel), yet blood vessel entry events were reduced by 90%. These data point to an additional impairment in blood vessel entry, that is, even when they do contact blood vessels, they cannot invade them. Indeed, both CSΔN and TRAP-VAL mutations result in the increased surface exposure of cell-adhesion domains: in CSΔN sporozoites, the absence of the N-terminus leads to constitutive exposure of the cell-adhesive type I thrombospondin domain in the C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>) and in TRAP-VAL sporozoites, the altered proteolytic cleavage site leads to the retention of TRAP molecules on the sporozoite's surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the inability of these mutants to regulate their adhesive interactions likely results in their inability to complete the entry process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The gliding motility of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites is essential for their infectivity. Previous reports have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>), but an in-depth analysis of their motility over time has not been performed. Intravital imaging of sporozoites over the first 120 min after inoculation highlights significant changes in their motility in this time frame. Within the first 20 min after intradermal inoculation, sporozoites displace with high speed and minimal constraint, which likely maximizes the volume of tissue that is explored by the population of sporozoites. After this initial period of dispersal, sporozoite motility changes. Most significantly starting 20 min after inoculation, the migratory pattern of sporozoites becomes increasingly confined, and a growing number of sporozoites engage in continuous circular motility. We hypothesize that this motility pattern optimizes engagement with blood vessels that will ultimately lead to blood vessel entry. 1 hr after inoculation, sporozoites begin to slow down and a significant proportion stop moving with the proportion of non-motile sporozoites increasing to 70% by 2 hr. Importantly, this late-phase slow down is distinct from the change in trajectory that occurs 20 and 30 min post inoculation when the speed and proportion of non-motile sporozoites does not change from what is observed at earlier time points. The reasons for this late-phase slow down are not known, but possibilities include resource exhaustion or encountering a host cell or factor that leads to their arrest.</p><p>In contrast to previous reports of apparently random motility of sporozoites in the dermis, which was suggested to be only environmentally constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>), our data show that distribution of displacements of migrating sporozoites is not Gaussian, which would be expected if sporozoites migrated in a pattern similar to a Brownian walk. Our observations of an altered sporozoite migration in proximity to blood vessels point to recognition of the vessel by the sporozoites, further demonstrating that sporozoite migration in the dermis is not well described by the statistics of a Brownian walk. This suggests that internal components or external host–pathogen interactions bias the directionality of sporozoite movement away from Brownian motion. The larger than expected displacements may allow the sporozoite to cover large distances between the blood vessels, which may enable the sporozoite to encounter blood vessels with higher efficiency than Brownian random walkers. We found that once the sporozoite approaches a blood vessel, the more linear type of motility is lost and the sporozoite switches to a more curved and confined motility. This points to a specific host–parasite interaction between the parasite and the environment of the blood vessel and provides evidence for the ability of the sporozoite to alter motility in response to host factors. Indeed, in vitro, sporozoites have been shown to respond to obstacle cues in micro-fabricated arrays so it is possible that environmental constraints alone account for the switch in the sporozoites' migration pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellmann et al., 2011</xref>). However, our observation that the sporozoites' walk statistics change in proximity to blood vessels indicates that there is a specific recognition event that leads to this change.</p><p>Sporozoites appear to engage in two types of motility: ‘avascular motility’ which is likely to optimize dispersal, and ‘perivascular motility’ defined by more confined trajectories with increased curvature. Our analysis of track curvature reveals that sporozoites gliding in the proximity of blood vessels describe trajectories with local curvatures that interestingly relate to the curvature of the capillary vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yen and Braverman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braverman, 1997</xref>). This suggests that ‘perivascular motility’ enhances contact with capillaries, rather than the larger dermal terminal arterioles or post-capillary venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yen and Braverman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braverman, 1997</xref>). Indeed, it has been observed previously, that the curvature of the sporozoite matches the geometry of capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Vanderberg, 1974</xref>) and more recently, a study using stochastic computer simulations of sporozoite motility found that in these models, sporozoite interaction with capillaries is greatly enhanced if the parasite has the ability to adapt its curvature and torsion to the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battista et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to the change in sporozoite trajectories, we found that they also had a significant decrease in speed when in the vicinity of blood vessels. These data build upon and solidify the previous observation of Amino et al., who quantified the speed of a small number of sporozoites gliding around blood vessels and reported a decrease after contact with the vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Intravital imaging of mutant sporozoites that do not efficiently exit the dermis provides additional insights into the factors required for dermal exit. The importance of high sporozoite gliding speed is highlighted by the behavior of the TRAP-VAL mutant that moves with less than half the motile speed of wild-type control parasites in the dermis. This decrease in speed corresponds to the reduction of final MSD, which reduces the area of tissue explored by 70%. Consequently, TRAP-VAL sporozoites have a significantly decreased chance to encounter and invade a blood vessel, which together with the increase in number of non-motile TRAP-VAL sporozoites, largely explains their reduced infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ejigiri et al., 2012</xref>). Although there is no evidence for an innate host immune response that may impair the exit of sporozoites from the dermis, the observed rapid dispersal of wild-type control sporozoites suggests that the parasite has evolved to leave the skin quickly, possibly as a means to escape from phagocytic host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amino et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>CSΔN sporozoites engage in a pattern of ‘avascular’ and ‘perivascular motility’ comparable to that of wild-type sporozoites, suggesting that while gliding in avascular parts of the dermis, their motility is normal. Of particular interest was the observed increase in the association of CSΔN sporozoites with dermal vascular endothelia. Since ‘perivascular motility’ is more constrained, this, together with the somewhat decreased gliding speed, explains the overall decrease in dispersal of this mutant. It was previously proposed that the function of the N-terminal portion of CSP is to mask the cell-adhesive TSR domain as sporozoites migrate through the skin and controlled proteolytic processing of CSP by a parasite protease regulates the exposure of the TSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coppi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2011</xref>). We find that the constitutively exposed TSR on the surface of CSΔN sporozoites leads to increased time spent on vascular endothelia. We therefore hypothesize that the ability of the sporozoite to dynamically regulate exposure of the TSR is necessary for continued migration through the dermis, which may be crucial for the sporozoite to locate the areas of the vasculature that allow for blood vessel entry or for blood vessel entry itself. More work is needed to determine if this is the case, however, our data with both TRAP-VAL and CSΔN mutant sporozoites demonstrate that the sporozoite's ability to regulate its adhesive intereactions is a key factor for successful movement through and out of the dermis.</p><p>We show that wild-type control sporozoites spend over a quarter of their time engaging with blood vessels, frequently without successful entry into the blood circulation. This suggests that only certain areas of the vasculature are suitable for sporozoite entry. It is known that the abluminal surface of dermal capillaries is not uniform; for example, the basement membrane surrounding the capillary bed is not continuous and through its gaps, pericytes form tight junctions with the underlying endothelial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braverman, 1997</xref>). Thus, there may be certain areas of the vasculature that are preferentially invaded by sporozoites.</p><p>With this study, we refine our understanding on how the sporozoite navigates through and out of the dermis. Mutant sporozoites that display modest changes in motility pattern or speed have dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity. These data suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene. Indeed, the partial success of RTS,S, the only malaria vaccine candidate in Phase III clinical trials, may result from antibodies that target sporozoites in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foquet et al., 2014</xref>). As we build upon RTS,S, it will be important to consider expanding the antigen repertoire to include proteins critical for dermal exit. Additionally, our data suggest that an analysis of dermal sporozoite motility could be incorporated in the evaluation of future vaccine strategies to predict efficiency of new vaccine targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mosquito infection</title><p><italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes were fed on Swiss Webster mice infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA wild-type control, CSΔN, or TRAP-VAL parasites as previously outlined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>).

Z-slices were imaged with an exposure time of approximately 150 ms and time-lapse stacks with 3–5 slices spanning a total depth of 30–50 μm were captured at approximately 1 Hz over a total time of 4 min using an EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, United States) and 3i slidebook 5.0 software. The indicated time points after inoculation refer to the starting time of the 4-min acquisition. Images were projected into a single z-layer and the resulting two-dimensional data set was processed and manually tracked using Imaris software (Bitplane, Concord, MA, United States). For visualization of dermal blood vessels, mice were intravenously injected with 15 μg of rat anti-mouse CD31 coupled to Alexa-Fluor-647 (clone 390, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, United States), 2–4 hr prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Manual tracking and data analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of scatter dot plots were analyzed using unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and statistical significance between samples is indicated with asterisks as follows *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001; ****p &lt; 0.0001; ns, nonsignificant (p &gt; 0.05).

The MSD of wild-type control sporozoites over time included the following data points: 5 min (2 videos, 37 tracks), 10 min (14 videos, 179 tracks), 20 min (7 videos, 95 tracks), 30 min (9 videos, 129 tracks), 60 min (8 videos, 77 tracks) and 120 min (7 videos, 67 tracks). In order to be able to analyze the MSD from sporozoite populations obtained from videos with varying frame rates, the data were interpolated to a common time interval using the cubic spline function in GraphPad prism. Linear regression fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism software and suggested a linear relationship between MSD and time. To obtain the MSD of CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites, 179 wild-type control sporozoites were tracked in 12 videos and compared to 211 tracks obtained from 29 videos of CSΔN parasites and 215 tracks of TRAP-VAL sporozoites originating from 33 videos; all videos for this analysis were acquired 10 min after intradermal inoculation of sporozoites.</p><p>To generate the MSD of sporozoites moving in proximity to CD31-labeled vessels 10 min after intradermal injection, 18, 25, or 24 videos of wild-type control, CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites, respectively, were analyzed, and 313, 352, or 192 tracks of sporozoites moving in proximity to CD31-labeled vessels were generated. 163, 121, or 89 tracks of sporozoites moving in avascular areas of the dermis were produced from the same set of videos of wild-type control, CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites, respectively. To calculate the MSD of the obtained tracks with various duration times, all tracks were uniformly fragmented into tracks of 30 s in duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Probability distribution</title><p>The x and y position data of sporozoite tracks were exported, and the total displacement exhibited by sporozoites at the end of the 4-min videos, defined as the Euclidean distance between first and last track location, was calculated. The probability distribution P(r) of the final displacements was obtained by binning displacement data and dividing each bin by the total number of tracks to create a frequency-normalized histogram. Data analysis was performed via custom-written MATLAB software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kevinkchiou/Malaria-Motility">https://github.com/kevinkchiou/Malaria-Motility</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Apparent speed</title><p>Apparent speed has previously been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kan et al., 2014</xref>) as an estimation of the instantaneous speed and is calculated as the sum of distances between track locations, divided by the track duration. This measure is highly sensitive to the frame rate with which the video was acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kan et al., 2014</xref>) and to achieve consistent interval times across the entire data set, for the calculation of apparent speed we utilized only positional data in 3-s intervals, which is larger than the longest interval time present in the data set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Track straightness</title><p>The track straightness is defined as the ratio of displacement to total track length and as a result can range between zero (entirely constrained track) and one (the track is a straight line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltman et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, this ratio is highly sensitive to the track duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltman et al., 2009</xref>) and therefore only tracks with the same duration were compared. To calculate the track straightness of wild-type control sporozoites over time, the tracks of meandering and linearly moving sporozoites tracked for the MSD analysis were used. To account for the percentage of circling sporozoites at the individual time point, 80 sporozoites continuously moving in the same circle were tracked, and the average track straightness of exclusively circling sporozoites was found to be 0.03. A number of tracks with this value were added to the analysis, representative for the percentages of circling sporozoites observed at the individual time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>Calculation of time spent in proximity to CD31-labeled vessel</title><p>To obtain duration of motility near blood vessels in videos acquired 10 min after intradermal inoculation, motile sporozoites were tracked when observed to be circling around or gliding alongside CD31-labeled vessels. In a given video, the durations of all tracks were added and expressed as percentage of total motile time, which was calculated as number of motile sporozoites multiplied by the total video time.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Prabhat Jha (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Your study regarding migration of dermally delivered <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites received favorable reviews from all the reviewers. The results convincingly show the difference between “avascular” and “vascular” migration of the parasites using both wild type and mutant parasites. The data acquisition is deemed accurate and the quantified data carefully evaluated. Overall, as a technical tour-de-force, the study provides important new insights into in vivo malaria sporozoite behavior during the critical interval between injection into the dermis and entry into blood vessels. The reviewers stated that the quality of the experiments and the importance of the observations merit an acceptance of the manuscript.</p><p>Notwithstanding, the reviewers had several major concerns, and collectively it was decided that the final acceptance is pending your responses to their comments.</p><p>1) Several questions arose in regard to the use of CD31 labeling. A concern was expressed whether labeling with CD31 might have interfered with sporozoite migration and invasion of the vasculature. Another concern was specificity. Because CD31 also labels lymphatic vasculature, the authors need to document sporozoite invasion into each of the CD31+ vessels. Otherwise, these cannot be called blood vessels or the motility cannot be referred to as vascular motility. This should be corrected throughout the text. Finally, there was concern considering the method of analysis. The proximity of the parasites to the CD31+ vessels was scored manually, which can lead to errors. Therefore, it would be helpful if the authors would perform analyses on one of the 3D datasets to validate that the numbers obtained from the maximum intensity projections are correct.</p><p>2) The interpretation that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites switch the mode of their motility to engage blood vessel should be toned down. This observation has previously been reported and the current data proposing such a change from fast to slow when engaging vessels are not convincing. For the quantification of the parasites that are changing the mode of motility it is essential to consider that while some parasites are losing straight/fast mode, the numbers of the parasites with curved/slow mode of motility is not increasing. Hence, it is the proportion, rather than the number, that changes.</p><p>3) It appears that some of the work has not been cited properly and some previously reported observations have been excluded from the Discussion. Among others, the authors should include published works on sporozoite gliding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vanderberg and Frevert (2004)</xref>, work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amino (2006)</xref> on decreased sporozoite speed on contacting blood vessels and work by Battista, Frischenechet and Schwarz (2014) on the curvature of sporozoites fitting the capillaries. The current results should be discussed further in the context of observations reported by Hellman (2011). It is suggested that the authors consider the possibility that the current data could be explained by simple physical constraints analogous to the microfabricated pillers in the Hellman paper.</p><p>4) Another comment relates to the mutant parasites that were shown to be impaired in their ability to invade blood vessels, despite the fact that they found blood vessels and remained associated with them. Although the authors do discuss it, it appears that the discussion may be inadequate in providing a cogent explanation for this observation.</p><p>5) A revision of the title has been suggested so that it precisely reflects the findings. A clarification should be provided – in your already well-written manuscript – about the use of the term “vascular,” which does mean that the sporozoites are inside the vessels.</p><p>6) A rather important question was posed regarding different migration patterns caused by the sporozoite delivery route: by a mosquito bites versus a syringe.</p><p>7) The legends need to include more detail about the identification of the sporozoites that invade the vessels and the video should be labeled more precisely.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07789.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have responded to the editor’s request to move all supplemental methods into the main body of the paper. This applied to the methodology for generating and verifying the mutants and to the mathematical analysis used for track curvature analysis, which are now in the Methods section of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>1) Several questions arose in regard to the use of CD31 labeling. A concern was expressed whether labeling with CD31 might have interfered with sporozoite migration and invasion of the vasculature.</italic></p><p>We agree with reviewers that interference of CD31-labeling with sporozoite motility and exit from the dermis is a valid concern. In the original version of the manuscript, in Figure 5–figure supplement 2, we showed that CD31-labeling did not interfere with entry into dermal blood or lymphatic vessels, as the sporozoite invasion rates are similar in videos acquired in mice with and without CD31-labeled blood vessels. However, we had not looked at the effect of CD31 labeling on sporozoite migration. In part, this was because vessels were not labeled in the majority of the videos used to determine MSD, they were only labeled in a subset of the 10-minute videos, since this was the time point used for quantification of vessel entry. We went back to the videos used for the MSD analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and reanalyzed the 10 minute time point data to separately calculate the MSD of sporozoites in videos with and without CD31-labeling. We found that the MSD in the two populations was similar and these data are now shown as a new panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Another concern was specificity. Because CD31 also labels lymphatic vasculature, the authors need to document sporozoite invasion into each of the CD31+ vessels. Otherwise, these cannot be called blood vessels or the motility cannot be referred to as vascular motility. This should be corrected throughout the text.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that CD31 is a pan-endothelial marker, expressed by both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial cells, although the expression level on lymphatic vessels is lower than on blood vessels (Podgrabinska et al., Molecular characterization of lymphatic endothelial cells, PNAS, Vol 99:16069, 2002). It is important to note, and we neglected to do so in the original manuscript, that the methodology we used does not result in CD31 staining of lymphatic vessels. We injected the anti-CD31 intravenously into the blood circulation 2-3 hours prior to the imaging experiment, and as a result it primarily stained blood vessels, since at this point the antibody has not crossed into the extravascular space to be drained into the lymphatic system. For imaging of lymphatic vessels, labeling antibodies are typically injected a day prior to the imaging experiment (Sarkisyan et al., Real-time differential labeling of blood, interstitium, and lymphatic and single-field analysis of vasculature dynamics in vivo, Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol., 2012). Included as a new figure supplement, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, is a still image obtained from live microscopy of a mouse ear in which anti-LYVE-1 antibody, specific for lymphatics, was inoculated intravenously 24 hours prior to imaging and anti-mouse CD31 antibody was inoculated 3 hours prior to imaging. No co-localization is observed, indicating that in our protocol, antibodies to CD31 do not label lymphatics. Lastly, given the unique structural characteristics of lymphatic capillaries, which possess frequent blind endings and are wider and flatter than blood vessels (Tripp et al., The lymph vessel network in mouse skin visualized with antibodies against the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1, Immunobiology, 213:715–28, 2008), we are confident that the vessels stained in our experiments are blood and not lymphatic vessels. We have changed the manuscript to clarify this important issue (see the subsection “Sporozoites recognize dermal CD31+ blood vessels”).</p><p><italic>Finally, there was concern considering the method of analysis. The proximity of the parasites to the CD31+ vessels was scored manually, which can lead to errors. Therefore, it would be helpful if the authors would perform analyses on one of the 3D datasets to validate that the numbers obtained from the maximum intensity projections are correct.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that 3D tracking would be ideal and that tracking sporozoites in the maximum projections may lead to errors. However, the acquired stacks have virtually no 3D resolution. Given the high gliding speed of sporozoites, entire stacks have to be acquired with short interval times, and since exposure times of up to 200 ms per capture are necessary to visualize the parasites in the dermis, we were only able to acquire 3-5 slices using a 10x objective with maximal pinhole setting. This amounted to only semi-confocal data, with essentially no z-resolution, which does not allow for tracking in three dimensions. While we agree that in individual cases we may have scored sporozoites as being close to vessels when they were not, given the number of data points we acquired, we do not think that this is a problem, particularly since these false positives would only minimize the differences between vascular and avascular motility, as this would not be an issue with sporozoites moving far from vessels.</p><p><italic>2) The interpretation that</italic> Plasmodium <italic>parasites switch the mode of their motility to engage blood vessel should be toned down. This observation has previously been reported and the current data proposing such a change from fast to slow when engaging vessels are not convincing.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct, the decrease in sporozoite gliding speed upon approach of a blood vessel has previously been documented (Amino et al., Nat. Med., 2006) and we have now discussed this previous finding in the Discussion: “These data build upon and solidify the previous observation of Amino et al., who quantified the speed of a small number of sporozoites gliding around blood vessels and reported a decrease after contact with the vessel”. We agree that the initial seminal study of Amino et al. is the first observation of this slow-down, however this study only looked at a few sporozoites, while our results are based on hundreds of measurements, thus really solidifying this finding. We were surprised to read the statement of the data not being convincing, since the editor’s letter stated: “The results convincingly show the difference between “avascular” and “vascular” migration […] the study provides important new insights into in vivo malaria sporozoite behavior during the critical interval between injection into the dermis and entry into blood vessels.” While the change in speed upon approach of a blood vessel is moderate, it is highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and hopefully the reviewers are persuaded to agree.</p><p><italic>For the quantification of the parasites that are changing the mode of motility it is essential to consider that while some parasites are losing straight/fast mode, the numbers of the parasites with curved/slow mode of motility is not increasing. Hence, it is the proportion, rather than the number, that changes.</italic></p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers and now include this information. We expressed the data as percentages because many of our videos were not part of complete time courses. Thus, in many instances we do not know the proportion of sporozoites that remain in the field at the late time points compared to earlier time points. Nonetheless, we do have two complete time courses, in which the same site was imaged from 5 to 120 minutes. These data were included in the original analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-F</xref>. We now use them to address the reviewers’ concern and have generated a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Two things become evident when we visualize the data this way. First, at 20 and 30 minutes after inoculation, while the total number of sporozoites and the number of non-motile sporozoites does not change significantly, the number of sporozoites moving in a linear fashion decreases and the number that are circling continuously throughout the video increases. These data are consistent with our observation of an initial period of high dispersal motility, followed by more constrained motility. However, when we look at the very late time points, 60 and 120 minutes after inoculation, these observations are confounded by the 20% and 40% fewer sporozoites in the field respectively, and by the significantly increased number of non-motile sporozoites. We have therefore added more discussion of these data in the Results section and in the Discussion: “In contrast to previous reports of apparently random motility […] indicates that there is a specific recognition event that leads to this change.”</p><p><italic>3) It appears that some of the work has not been cited properly and some previously reported observations have been excluded from the Discussion. Among others, the authors should include published works on sporozoite gliding by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"><italic>Vanderberg and Frevert (2004)</italic></xref><italic>, work by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><italic>Amino (2006)</italic></xref> <italic>on decreased sporozoite speed on contacting blood vessels and work by Battista, Frischenechet and Schwarz (2014) on the curvature of sporozoites fitting the capillaries.</italic></p><p>We have inserted references to the listed studies and more fully discussed the studies we had already cited. The Vanderberg et al. study (Int. J. Parasitol., 2004) is cited with other reports of sporozoite motility being important for dermal exit. We now mention the previous report of decreased sporozoite gliding speed in proximity to blood vessels (Amino et al., Nat. Med., 2006) in the Discussion. Additionally, we added a discussion on early descriptions of sporozoite geometry and how an in silico model, predicting the sporozoite's ability to change its curvature (Battista et al., Phys. Rev. E. Stat. Nonlin. Soft. Matter Phys., 2014) is supportive of our data.</p><p><italic>The current results should be discussed further in the context of observations reported by Hellman (2011). It is suggested that the authors consider the possibility that the current data could be explained by simple physical constraints analogous to the microfabricated pillers in the Hellman paper.</italic></p><p>The reviewers make a valid point that it has previously been discussed that the distance between obstacles in vitro and different dermal environments in vivo can induce changes in sporozoite motility, which leads to the hypothesis that obstacle distances in the dermis guide sporozoite migration (Hellman et al., PLoS Pathog., 2011). However, we are reporting the first evidence of the ability of the sporozoite to alter motility in response to a specific host structure, suggesting sporozoite migration is responsive to host signals more complex than simple physical constraints. We think that more intravital imaging needs to be performed with visualization of components of the extracellular matrix and host cells other than endothelial cells in order to shed light on the host-pathogen interactions relevant for blood vessel recognition. However, we have extended the Discussion to include the findings of Hellman et al., and to allow the reader to put our findings into the perspective of what has previously been found.</p><p><italic>4) Another comment relates to the mutant parasites that were shown to be impaired in their ability to invade blood vessels, despite the fact that they found blood vessels and remained associated with them. Although the authors do discuss it, it appears that the discussion may be inadequate in providing a cogent explanation for this observation.</italic></p><p>We agree that there was not a cogent explanation for this and, in large part, it is because more work is needed to fully explain this observation. We have, however, modified and added to our original text to improve clarity and flesh out some of our hypotheses as to what could cause the phenotype that we observe. Please see in the Results section: “These data point to an additional impairment in blood vessel entry, i.e. even when they do contact blood […] results in their inability to complete the entry process.”</p><p><italic>5) A revision of the title has been suggested so that it precisely reflects the findings. A clarification should be provided – in your already well-written manuscript – about the use of the term “vascular,” which does mean that the sporozoites are inside the vessels.</italic></p><p>The question of the title goes back to point number 4. We believe that the current title accurately reflects our findings. Regarding the term “vascular” – we now see the confusion that this could cause. We have gone back and changed all such uses of the word to “perivascular” which should clarify its meaning.</p><p><italic>6) A rather important question was posed regarding different migration patterns caused by the sporozoite delivery route: by a mosquito bites versus a syringe.</italic></p><p>We agree that this is an important point and had included a preliminary analysis of sporozoite migration patterns after inoculation by mosquito bite in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). For this figure, we combined two imaging time courses of mosquito-inoculated sporozoites and analyzed their MSD and motility patterns. As shown, we found no significant difference in sporozoite behavior in terms of MSD and proportion of manually counted sporozoite motility patterns. We have also added more commentary on these data, at the end of the first section of the Results.</p><p><italic>7) The legends need to include more detail about the identification of the sporozoites that invade the vessels and the video should be labeled more precisely.</italic></p><p>We have amended the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, as well as the fifth section of the Results, to give more details on the identification of invasion events. Compared to previous video material (Amino et al., Nat. Med., 2006), blood vessel invasion events in videos that include CD31-labeling are not always characterized by the sudden increase in speed, which is a result of our slower acquisition speed (due to the capture of two channels). The sporozoite in circulation is frequently carried out of the field of view before the next frame is captured. We therefore altered our description of the manual invasion counts and now define blood vessel invasion by “a sudden increase in speed or visual entry of the blood vessel and disappearance out of the field of view”. Since the frame rate with which images were acquired was higher in videos without CD31-labeling, these videos allow the viewer to see the sudden increase in speed. We therefore included an additional video (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>), in which two blood vessel invasion events, characterized by the sudden increase in speed, are clearly visible.</p></body></sub-article></article>
