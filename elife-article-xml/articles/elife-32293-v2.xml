We found that the cell-permeable furopyrimidine AIM-100 promotes dramatic oligomerization, clustering and CIE of human and mouse dopamine transporters (DAT), but not of their close homologues, norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. All effects of AIM-100 on DAT and the occupancy of substrate binding sites in the transporter were mutually exclusive, suggesting that AIM-100 may act by binding to DAT. Surprisingly, AIM-100-induced DAT endocytosis was independent of dynamin, cholesterol-rich microdomains and actin cytoskeleton, implying that a novel endocytic mechanism is involved. AIM-100 stimulated trafficking of internalized DAT was also unusual: DAT accumulated in early endosomes without significant recycling or degradation. We propose that AIM-100 augments DAT oligomerization through an allosteric mechanism associated with the DAT conformational state, and that oligomerization-triggered clustering leads to a coat-independent endocytosis and subsequent endosomal retention of DAT.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine trasporter</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA014204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sorkin</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine transporter (DAT) interaction with furopyrimidine called AIM-100 in intact cells leads to dramatic oligomerization, nanoclustering and endocytosis of DAT by a novel mechanism coupled to the transporter molecule conformation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activity of plasma membrane receptors, transporters and channels is regulated by endocytosis and post-endocytic trafficking through the endolysosomal system. The general repertoire of endocytic pathways and endosomal sorting events is well described for a number of transmembrane (TM) proteins (endocytic cargo). The molecular mechanisms of cargo internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) are particularly well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the multiple pathways of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) are less defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayor et al., 2014</xref>). Although progress has been made in characterizing the machinery that allows membrane invagination and vesicle scission during CIE, the mechanisms mediating selective recruitment of the cargo remain elusive. Whether and how cargo itself controls the CIE process is also unclear.</p><p>The dopamine transporter (DAT) has served as the prototypic model to study endocytic trafficking of monoamine transporters because of the fundamental physiological and pathophysiological importance of DAT [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melikian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zahniser and Sorkin, 2009</xref>)]. DAT is responsible for the clearance of dopamine released from synapses, and therefore, controls the duration and amplitude of dopamine signaling in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giros et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>). DAT is also known to be the principal target of psychostimulants like cocaine and amphetamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gainetdinov and Caron, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gowrishankar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spiga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Volkow and Morales, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Willuhn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wise, 2008</xref>). DAT belongs to the high-affinity saline carrier (SLC) six gene family of Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent transporters consisting of 12 TM domains, and cytosolic N- and C-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>). DAT is proposed to form dimers and high-order oligomers, although the mechanisms of oligomerization are not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hastrup et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hastrup et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torres et al., 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that DAT dimerization/multimerization modulates the substrate transport activity of DAT and is necessary for the effective transport of newly-synthesized DAT from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Reith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torres et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhen and Reith, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of DAT function by endocytic trafficking has been demonstrated in heterologous expression systems and in dopaminergic neurons. DAT has been shown to internalize in response to protein kinase C (PKC) activation, amphetamines, substrates, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neuronal activity and inhibition of Ack1 (Activated Cdc42 Kinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eriksen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabriel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoover et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Melikian and Buckley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaughan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wheeler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). DAT appears to be capable of internalization through both CME and CIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cremona et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabriel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorkina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorkina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wheeler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Although transporters of the SLC6 family share the molecular fold and conformational transition mechanics during substrate transport, some of the trafficking mechanisms discovered for DAT have yet to be demonstrated for other SLC6 transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matthies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">VuorenpÃ¤Ã¤ et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting there may be cargo-specific mechanisms controlling endocytic trafficking of these transporters.</p><p>It is possible that DAT endocytosis induced by the Ack1 inhibitor AIM-100 (5,6-Diphenyl-N-[[(2S)-tetrahydro-2-furanyl]methyl]furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine), could be an example of a cargo (DAT)-specific endocytosis pathway because the same compound does not increase endocytosis of the close homolog of DAT, serotonin transporter (SERT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, we compared the mechanisms of AIM-100-induced endocytosis of DAT with those of its constitutive and PKC-dependent endocytosis. Unexpectedly, multiple independent approaches demonstrated clearly that AIM-100 induces robust oligomerization and clustering of DAT, which precedes clathrin-independent internalization of DAT, and that these effects of AIM-100 are specific to DAT but unrelated to Ack1. Altogether, the present findings led to a hypothetical model whereby AIM-100 acts directly on DAT via an allosteric mechanism, and uncovered a novel CIE mechanism driven by the conformation-coupled cargo oligomerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AIM-100 induces DAT oligomerization and endocytosis in heterologous cells and dopaminergic neurons</title><p>Recent studies by Wu and co-workers used biotinylation techniques to demonstrate that AIM-100, an Ack1 inhibitor, promotes internalization of DAT in SK-N-MC cells and mouse brain striatal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). To gain insight into the mechanism of this novel endocytic regulation of DAT, we analyzed AIM-100-induced trafficking of DAT fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (YFP-DAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>) and YFP-DAT additionally tagged with an extracellular hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YFP-HA-DAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorkina et al., 2006</xref>) using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. Two approaches were employed and produced essentially identical results using YFP-DAT, YFP-HA-DAT or endogenous HA-DAT: (i) direct YFP imaging in fixed and living cells; and (ii) immunofluorescence imaging using an HA antibody uptake assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorkina et al., 2006</xref>). DirectÂ YFP imaging demonstrated that treatment of porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells stably expressing YFP-HA-DAT with AIM-100 at 37Â°C resulted in dramatic re-distribution of YFP-HA-DAT from the plasma membrane, where the transporter is concentrated in filopodia, cell edges and ruffles, to intracellular vesicular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). AIM-100-induced vesicular accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT was observed at AIM-100 concentrationsÂ â¥Â 10 ÂµM and reached a maximal extent at 20 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the time-course of YFP-HA-DAT endocytosis induced by AIM-100 using an HA antibody uptake assay revealed that this endocytosis follows a linear kinetics without reaching a plateau for at least 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref>). Such kinetics is characteristic of a non-saturable and/or irreversible trafficking process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32293.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AIM-100 causes accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT in endosomes and enhances DAT oligomerization in PAE cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells were incubated with vehicle (DMSO) or 20 ÂµM AIM-100 for 0â90 min at 37Â°C, and 3D images were acquired from fixed cells through the 515 nm channel.

Surprisingly, a greater than 5-fold increase in the fraction of high molecular mass species (~290 kDa) of YFP-HA-DAT was observed in lysates of AIM-100-treated cells when compared with vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). The same, discrete band of a high molecular mass DAT species could also be detected consistently in the absence of AIM-100, although the relative fraction of this species (10â40%) varies between different experiments and between cell lines. AIM-100 substantially increased the amount of this species, and in addition, the abundance of the larger DAT species in all experiments, suggesting that AIM-100 stabilizes SDS-resistant DAT oligomers and higher-order oligomers. Because AIM-100-induced oligomers were not disrupted by Î²-mercaptoethanol, iodoacetamide (see âMethodsâ) and dithiothreitol (DTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), oligomerization was not due to formation of disulfide bonds between DAT molecules. The ratio of oligomers to monomers (O/M) in the biotinylated fraction was significantly increased by AIM-100 demonstrating that AIM-100 induces DAT oligomerization at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, the O/M ratio was 4-times lower in the biotinylated fraction than in total cell lysates (surface plus endosomal DAT) in AIM-100-treated cells. This data indicate that AIM-100-induced DAT oligomers are enriched in endosomes as compared to the plasma membrane, and suggest that oligomerization facilitates DAT endocytosis. Small amounts of immature monomeric (~70 kDa) and corresponding oligomeric YFP-HA-DAT (~200 kDa) were detected in lysates of untreated and AIM-100-treated cells, respectively, but not in the biotinylated fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that AIM-100 also causes oligomerization of newly-synthesized DAT located in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>AIM-100 also induced endocytosis of YFP-HA-DAT or untagged DAT stably expressed in HeLa, HEK293 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, primary cultures of post-natal mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons derived from HA-DAT knock-in mouse displayed strong endocytosis of HA-DAT following AIM-100 treatment, as revealed using the HA11 antibody uptake assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cy3-enriched vesicles (internalized HA11:HA-DAT complexes) were abundant in axonal processes, varicosities, axonal widenings and soma of AIM-100-exposed neurons decorated with Cy5 (cell-surface HA11:HA-DAT complexes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). The Cy3/Cy5 ratio (the extent of endocytosis) was several times higher in AIM-100-treated than in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, AIM-100 treatment of striatal synaptosomes prepared from adult HA-DAT mice substantially increased HA-DAT oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Cells are incubated with DMSO (veh) (<bold>a</bold>) or PMA at 37Â°C for 30 min to internalize a fraction of DAT (<bold>b</bold>). At this point, most internalized DAT is in early endosomes, and thus is still capable of recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorkina et al., 2005</xref>).

The chase incubation of PMA-treated cells with GÃ¶6976 at 37Â°C results in the gradual re-distribution of DAT from endosomes to the plasma membrane (recycling), where it is accumulated in ruffles, cell edges and filopodia.

Treatment of PAE/YFP-HA-DAT cells with AIM-100 resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of diffraction-limited (&lt;200 nm) spots (clusters) of YFP-HA-DAT on the basal cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3âvideo 1</xref>). The number of spots approached a maximum afterÂ ~10â20 min of AIM-100 treatment and gradually declined during a subsequent 30 min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Approximately 35% of spots persisted forÂ &gt;1 hr, whereas other spots were quite transient with a life-time of a few minutes, putative of endocytic uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We noticed some spots were moving laterally within the imaging plane, characteristic of newly-formed endocytic vesicles. In addition to an almost complete clustering of YFP-HA-DAT in the planar regions of the membrane, the transporter either moved away from filopodia or formed clusters within the filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Simultaneously, strong accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT at the cell edges was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3âvideo 1</xref>). Importantly, the pool of YFP-HA-DAT visualized by TIR-FM is relatively small compared to the total cellular YFP-HA-DAT owing to high sensitivity of TIR-FM. Three-dimensional confocal imaging demonstrated that although small clusters of YFP-HA-DAT were seen on both the bottom and top plasma membranes domains of the cell, a bulk of total cellular YFP-HA-DAT was accumulated in endosomes after a 45 min AIM-100 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Given the observed timing of cluster formation on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and the kinetics of DAT accumulation in endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), it would appear that AIM-100-induced clustering of DAT precedes its endocytosis.</p><p>To directly examine the effect of AIM-100 on DAT oligomerization in living cells, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy was used. Constitutive oligomerization of DAT has been previously demonstrated by FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>). Using the same method of sensitized FRET measuments in cells co-expressing CFP-DAT and YFP-DAT, we found that the intensity of FRET from CFP to YFP was significantly higher in the plasma membrane clusters and intracellular vesicles in AIM-100-treated cells than this intensity in vehicle-treated cells where FRET was measured in various structures and regions of DAT accumulation, such as filopodia, ruffles and cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). An increased FRET in AIM-100-treated cells is indicative of a higher probability or an increased stability of the interaction between DAT molecules, and/or a closer proximity of multiple DAT molecules, thus demonstrating AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AIM-100 does not induce oligomerization and endocytosis of NET or SERT</title><p>It has been shown that AIM-100 does not increase the endocytosis of SERT in SK-N-MC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we compared AIM-100 effects on the closest homolog of DAT, norepinephrine transporter (NET) with AIM-100 effects on DAT and SERT. Live-cell imaging of PAE cells either transiently or stably expressing GFP-NET or GFP-SERT revealed that both transporters are efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane. In contrast to its effects on DAT, AIM-100 did not induce clustering and endocytosis of GFP-NET and GFP-SERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, GFP-SERT and GFP-NET were detected on western blots as predominantly monomeric species in the absence or presence of AIM-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the specificity of AIM-100 effects on transporter endocytosis correlates with the specific effects of AIM-100 on transporter oligomerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DAT inhibitors and substrates diminish the effects of AIM-100 on DAT</title><p>AIM-100 has been shown to inhibit binding of a radiolabeled cocaine analog to DAT, and given the structural similarity of AIM-100 to cocaine and DAT substrates, AIM-100 was proposed to bind DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore tested the effect of cocaine, a competitive inhibitor of DAT, on AIM-100-stimulated DAT oligomerization and endocytosis. Treatment of cells with cocaine (1â10 ÂµM) significantly inhibited AIM-100-enhanced oligomerization, clustering in the plasma membrane and endocytosis of YFP-DAT in cells treated with AIM-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâE</xref>). These data suggest that the effects of AIM-100 on DAT are prevented by the occupancy of S1 and S2 binding sites in the DAT or by the outward-facing (OF) conformation of DAT which is stabilized by cocaine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reith et al., 2001</xref>). To define the role of substrate binding sites and DAT conformation, the effects of AIM-100 on the W63A mutant of YFP-HA-DAT were examined. W63 is essential for maintaining the network of intramolecular interactions supporting the OF conformation of DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the W63A mutation results in narrowing the extracellular vestibule, which leads to the loss of substrate transport and cocaine binding, and a higher probability of an inward-facing (IF) conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sorkina et al., 2009</xref>). AIM-100 triggered the robust oligomerization and endocytosis of the W63A mutant but in this case endocytosis was unaffected by cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâH</xref>). These observations imply that (i) the AIM-100 effects on DAT do not require accessible extracellular substrate binding sites per se; but that (ii) cocaine binding to these sites in the wild-type DAT is necessary for counteracting the effects of AIM-100 on DAT.</p><p>To further examine the importance of DAT conformation in the observed effects of AIM-100, we tested whether DAT substrates interfere with the AIM-100 effects on DAT. Computational modeling predicts that the conformational equilibrium of DAT is shifted towards occluded-intermediate (OC) and IF states in the presence of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng and Bahar, 2015</xref>). This prediction is supported by the experimental evidence in studies of SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). We found that oligomerization and endocytosis of DAT in AIM-100-treated cells were significantly decreased by saturating concentrations (20â100 ÂµM) of DAT substrates, dopamine (DA) and amphetamine (Amph) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, modafinil, an atypical DAT inhibitor, that has been proposed to bind to S1 and S2 sites with micromolar affinity and stabilize DAT in the OC and/or IF states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmitt and Reith, 2011</xref>), also significantly reduced AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These experiments provide additional evidence that the occupancy of substrate binding sites in wild-type DAT is inhibitory to the AIM-100 effects on DAT and suggest that the shift to an OC/IF conformation is not sufficient for AIM-100 induced oligomerization and endocytosis of the wild-type DAT when substrates or inhibitors are present.</p><p>Together, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> imply that if the effects of AIM-100 on DAT are indeed mediated through the direct binding of AIM-100 to DAT that is blocked by DAT inhibitors and substrates, there should be a reciprocal inhibition of binding of these compounds to DAT by AIM-100. Such inhibition of cocaine binding to DAT by AIM-100 (KiÂ ~20â40 ÂµM) has been previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether the observed inhibitory effect of AIM-100 is competitive or non-competitive in nature, binding parameters of a cocaine analog, [3-H](2)â2-Î²-carbomethoxy-3-Î²-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane ([3 hr]-CFT) were determined in the absence or presence of AIM-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). The binding assays were performed under the experimental conditions used to demonstrate AIM-100 effects on DAT oligomerization, with the exception that binding was carried out at 20Â°C to minimize DAT endocytosis, which was confirmed by live-cell imaging of parallel cells. DAT oligomerization was significantly increased by AIM-100 at 20Â°C albeit to a lesser extent than at 37Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). In five independent experiments AIM-100 (20 ÂµM) consistently and statistically significantly decreased the Bmax value (an average decrease of 26%) but did not significantly affect K<sub>D</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). Thus, the effect of AIM-100 on CFT binding parameters is consistent with the hypothesis that this effect involves an allosteric mechanism. While the precise molecular mechanisms of AIM-100 binding to DAT remain to be defined, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> further support the strong correlation between DAT oligomerization, clustering and endocytosis stimulated by AIM-100.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DAT accumulates in early/sorting but not recycling or late endosomes in AIM-100-treated cells</title><p>To define DAT localization after AIM-100-induced endocytosis, fluorescently tagged Rab5, EEA.1, Rab11 and Rab7 were transiently expressed in PAE/YFP-HA-DAT cells. In AIM-100-treated cells YFP-HA-DAT was highly co-localized with Rab5 and EEA.1, markers of early and sorting endosomes, but not with Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that DAT is not efficiently sorted to the recycling compartment. Strong co-localization of DAT with endogenous EEA.1 was also confirmed using immunofluorescence staining of fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Only a minimal amount of YFP-HA-DAT was detected in Rab7- and LysoTrackerRed-labeled compartments, indicating that DAT is not sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes after AIM-100-induced internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). AIM-100 did not induce degradation of YFP-HA-DAT or YFP-DAT in contrast to a substantial PKC-dependent degradation of the transporter in cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8BâC</xref>). This result is consistent with the observation that AIM-100 does not significantly increase YFP-HA-DAT ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> reveal an unconventional itinerary of AIM-100-induced DAT traffic that involves the continuous retention of internalized DAT in early/sorting endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DAT internalized in AIM-100-treated cells does not recycle</title><p>The linear kinetics of AIM-100-induced DAT accumulation in early endosomes suggests that DAT may not recycle back to the plasma membrane from these endosomes. To test this hypothesis, YFP-HA-DAT was labeled with HA11 and internalized in the presence of AIM-100 for 1.5 hr followed by washing and further incubating the cells at 37Â°C without AIM-100. This 1.5 hr chase incubation did not lead to re-distribution of YFP-HA-DAT from endosomes to the cell surface (recycling), but unexpectedly, actually resulted in an augmented accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT in endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Cocaine did not prevent additional endocytosis of HA11:YFP-HA-DAT complexes during the chase incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), suggesting that cocaine binding must precede AIM-100 treatment in order for cocaine to inhibit AIM-100-induced DAT endocytosis. Importantly, these data indicate that AIM-100 has effects on DAT that are not readily reversible, and that DAT internalized in the presence of AIM-100 is not measurably recycled. In contrast, AIM-100 did not inhibit recycling of DAT that had been internalized upon PKC activation and protected from AIM-100-induced endocytosis by cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that AIM-100 does not affect the recycling process per se but acts in a cargo-specific fashion by blocking recycling of DAT exclusively only if DAT internalization is induced by AIM-100. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> together with the observations of (i) linear kinetics of DAT accumulation in endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); and (ii) lack of DAT in Rab11 recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) suggest that the robust AIM-100-induced accumulation of DAT in endosomes is at least partially due to an inability of DAT to recycle in the presence of AIM-100.</p><p>The endosomal accumulation of DAT has also been observed when DAT recycling is inhibited by monensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorkina et al., 2005</xref>). However, the extent of endosomal accumulation of DAT due to its constitutive internalization in the presence of monensin was found to be significantly smaller than in the presence of AIM-100, and the monensin-dependent accumulation was not inhibited by cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, AIM-100-induced accumulation of DAT in endosomes is the result of a combination of an ineffective recycling and an accelerated endocytosis, which is regulated by the mechanism apparently different from that of the constitutive endocytosis revealed in the presence of monensin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mechanisms of AIM-100-induced DAT trafficking</title><p>AIM-100-dependent accumulation of DAT in endosomes of PAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was undetectable by fluorescence microscopy at concentrations of AIM-100 sufficient to inhibit Ack1 activity (&lt;2 ÂµM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahajan et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that AIM-100-induced DAT endocytosis does not involve Ack1 under conditions of our experiments. To directly test for a specific role for Ack1, this protein was depleted by siRNA. PAE/YFP-HA-DAT cells were incubated with AIM-100 in the presence of transferrin conjugated with TexasRed (Tfn-TxR), an endocytic cargo that is internalized through the clathrin-mediated pathway. siRNA knock-down of Ack1 (65â80% depletion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) did not lead to YFP-HA-DAT endocytosis or other visible changes in the pattern of YFP-HA-DAT localization when compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The amount of Tfn-TxR in endosomes was not increased but rather reduced by AIM-100 treatment or Ack1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>), possibly due to the involvement of Ack1 in endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GrÃ¸vdal et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, AIM-100 caused robust YFP-HA-DAT endocytosis in Ack1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>) as evident by the strong increase in YFP-HA-DAT co-localization with Tfn-TxR in endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Finally, another highly efficient inhibitor of Ack1 (KRCA-0008, IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 18 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2013</xref>) did not induce YFP-HA-DAT oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) and endocytosis at concentrations of 2â20 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). Thus, together the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> indicate that AIM-100 induced DAT endocytosis is Ack1-independent in PAE cells.</p><p>The demonstration that endocytic trafficking induced by AIM-100 is not mediated by Ack1 in our experiments prompted testing the potential role of other endocytic mechanisms. Knock-down of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) had no inhibitory effect on AIM-100 induced YFP-HA-DAT endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10AâC</xref>) and oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), whereas Tfn-TxR endocytosis was strongly inhibited as would be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, insets; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, CHC knockdown caused a partial inhibition of the constitutive endocytosis of DAT observed in the presence of monensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10âfigure supplement 3</xref>) [also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorkina et al., 2005</xref>)]. These data suggest that AIM-100 re-directs DAT to a specific endocytosis pathway rather than abolishing the plasma membrane retention of DAT.</p><p>Stemming from the demonstration that AIM-100-induced endocytosis is clathrin-independent, we tested the importance of several mechanisms known to be involved in CIE. Surprisingly, AIM-100-induced endocytosis of YFP-HA-DAT was not significantly inhibited by dynamin-2 siRNA knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) and overexpression of the K44A dominant-negative dynamin mutant (data not shown). Latranculin B (inhibitor of cortical actin cytoskeleton), ML141 (cdc42 inhibitor) and nystatin (cholesterol-chelating drug) also did not affect AIM-100-dependent DAT endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Further, the PKC inhibitor, Go6976, did not block AIM-100-induced DAT endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>). ML141 treatment induced a moderate endocytosis of YFP-HA-DAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), suggesting that cdc42 could be involved in DAT retention at the cell surface. Interestingly, an inhibitor of phospholipase D, FIPI reduced AIM-100-induced endocytosis two-fold. The involvement of phospholipase D may be attributed to the importance of the product of phospholipase D activity, phosphatidic acid, in membrane fission and fusion processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donaldson, 2009</xref>). Src kinase family inhibitor, PP2, and genistein, a wide-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor, did not alter the subcellular distribution of YFP-HA-DAT in untreated or AIM-100-treated PAE cells (data not shown). These experiments ruled out the involvement of many known CIE mechanisms, such as those underlying caveolae-, CLIC/GEEC-, Arf6-, Rho-family-GTPase- and endophilin-dependent pathways, as well as micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayor et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, collectively the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> suggest that AIM-100 induces DAT endocytosis via a novel CIE mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present studies, we have demonstrated the remarkably robust effects of a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AIM-100, in promoting DAT oligomerization, clustering at the cell surface and endocytic trafficking.

The itinerary of AIM-100-induced trafficking of DAT was found to be unique as it involved a novel clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytosis mechanism followed by the retention of internalized DAT in early Rab5/EEA.1 endosomes without significant recycling and sorting of DAT to lysosomes.</p><p>To our knowledge, the strong effect of AIM-100 on DAT oligomerization is the first example of a chemically-enhanced non-covalent oligomerization of a multi-spanning TM protein. The mechanisms of DAT dimerization and oligomerization have been studied extensively but remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Reith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hastrup et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hastrup et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torres et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhen et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas the bacterial homolog of DAT LeuT was crystalized as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), Drosophila DAT was crystallized as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously used FRET and co-immunoprecipitation to demonstrate constitutive DAT oligomerization in the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>). In the same study, we detected a small fraction of SDS-resistant oligomers using immunoblots. Our new finding that treatment of intact cells and synaptosomes with AIM-100 robustly increases the fraction of these SDS-resistant DAT oligomers suggests that such oligomers are not the result of post-solubilization aggregation of DAT. In fact, AIM-100 did not increase DAT oligomerization when it was added to cell lysates (data not shown). Mild denaturation at 37Â°C (instead of 95Â°C) did not reduce the fraction of AIM-100-induced DAT oligomers, suggesting that this oligomerization is not thermally induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Dramatic AIM-100-stimulated oligomerization and clustering of DAT observed using TIR-FM and FRET provide further support to the view that SDS-resistant oligomers reflect DAT oligomerization in the intact living cell. It should be noted that functionally-important SDS-resistant oligomers of other proteins, such as for example G-protein coupled receptors, SNAREs and ERGIC, have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mascia and Langosch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neve et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salahpour et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Detection of a 290 kDa species of YFP-DAT/YFP-HA-DAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and supplements) and a 190 kDa species of HA-DAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) suggests that this âminimalâ DAT oligomer may correspond to a trimer. Although DAT and other SLC6 transporters are typically thought to be dimers, it was reported that chemical cross-linking of Cys246 and Cys306 results in the formation of dimers, trimers and tetramers of DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hastrup et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hastrup et al., 2003</xref>). The fact that similar SDS-resistant oligomeric species of NET and SERT were not detected in the absence or presence of AIM-100 implies that despite the structural similarity of catecholamine transporters and contrary to a generally accepted notion of an equivalence in their oligomerization mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alguel et al., 2016</xref>), these mechanisms might actually be fundamentally different. For example, an interaction of SERT with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was recently demonstrated to be important for the formation of stable oligomers of SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderluh et al., 2017</xref>). However, this mechanism may not be involved in DAT oligomerization. DAT has been shown to be oligomeric in endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhen and Reith, 2018</xref>), where PIP2 is present at extremely low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>). In the present study we observed conversion of an monomeric immature 70 kDa species of YFP-DAT into a large oligomeric SDS-species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and other figures). It is possible that differences in the sites of PIP2 binding to DAT and SERT (amino-terminus versus transmembrane core, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchmayer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamilton et al., 2014</xref>) are responsible for different mechanisms of their oligomerization.</p><p>The inhibitory action of DAT blockers and substrates on AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) suggest that AIM-100 effect may require binding of AIM-100 to a site in the DAT molecule that is inaccessible when the transporter is occupied by these substrates or inhibitors. The simplest explanation of these data is that AIM-100 acts by binding to the extracellular substrate binding sites (S1 and/or S2). However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with other data: (i) the W63A mutant is efficiently oligomerized by AIM-100 despite the fact that its substrate binding sites are inaccessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); (ii) the substrate binding sites are accessible to AIM-100 in SERT and NET but AIM-100 does not induce their oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); and (iii) AIM-100 non-competitively inhibits CFT binding to DAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, it could be hypothesized that in addition to a low affinity binding to S1/S2 sites, AIM-100 may interact more strongly with another region of the DAT molecule but only if the DAT is in a âflexibleâ folding state such that it is not locked into a specific conformation (OF, OC or IF). Such an interaction may occur at the cytoplasmic interface of the DAT molecule (AIM-100 is lipophilic and membrane-permeable), which may stabilize the DAT oligomers via an allosteric mechanism. The inability of AIM-100 to increase DAT oligomerization at 4Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) supports the hypothesis that an effective diffusion of AIM-100 across and/or within the membrane is involved in the AIM-100 action on DAT. Because the same species of the DAT oligomer was detected before and after AIM-100 treatment by immunoblotting, and because it has been shown that DAT substrates inhibit basal DAT oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Reith, 2008</xref>), it is possible that the molecular interfaces involved in basal/constitutive and AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization are similar. Future studies of the structure-based mechanisms by which AIM-100 stabilizes DAT oligomers may therefore shed light on the mechanisms and functional role of the constitutive DAT oligomerization.</p><p>Formation of highly stable oligomers and DAT clustering in living cells correlated with DAT endocytosis in experiments that examined the effects of transporter inhibitors and substrates, and compared AIM-100 effects on three monoamine transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These observations together with the fast kinetics of AIM-100-induced clustering of DAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâC</xref>) suggest that DAT oligomerization and clustering are part of the mechanism mediating AIM-100-induced DAT endocytosis. This point is supported by the observation of a higher proportion of DAT oligomers in endosomes than in the cell-surface pool of DAT molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, mutagenesis of potential oligomerization interfaces in DAT yielded misfolded DAT mutants incapable of reaching the plasma membrane (data not shown), thus precluding us to obtain a formal prove that oligomerization is necessary for endocytosis.</p><p>The extent of DAT accumulation in endosomes following treatment with AIM-100 was far greater than we have ever observed using any other stimulant of DAT endocytosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that such a dramatic accumulation is a synergistic effect due to both accelerated endocytosis and inefficient recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). We propose that in early endosomes DAT oligomers are not efficiently packaged into tubular recycling carriers due to the large size of these oligomers. When monomeric receptors that normally recycle are crosslinked by multivalent ligands, these receptors have been shown to be partially mis-targeted to the lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geuze et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopkins and Trowbridge, 1983</xref>). Indeed, the inability of cargo to recycle typically results in its lysosomal degradation. However, surprisingly AIM-100 did not lead to DAT degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is possible that targeting of non-ubiquitinated cargo to lysosomes occurs on a substantially longer time scale than our 2 hr time-course experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tewari et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of experimental evidence are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> to demonstrate that the AIM-100 effects are off-target and unrelated to inhibition of the Ack1 activity. This raises a question of whether the pathways and mechanisms of DAT endocytosis in the presence of AIM-100 observed by Wu and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>) and in the present study are different. The observation that AIM-100 did not induce endocytosis of SERT is indicative of the commonality of mechanisms analyzed in both studies. In contrast to observations by Wu and co-workers, AIM-100-induced DAT endocytosis was not affected by cdc42 inhibition and was clathrin-independent in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11B</xref>). The clathrin-dependency of AIM-100-induced endocytosis of DAT in SK-N-MC cells was established in the former study using a small-molecule clathrin inhibitor pistop-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). However, considerable general toxicity of this compound has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemmon and Traub, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Willox et al., 2014</xref>). Pitstop-2 has also been shown to strongly block the CIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutta et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, although Ack1 was reported to be associated with the clathrin coated structures, the importance of Ack1 for CME has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). Certainly, differences in the requirement for Ack1 may be attributed to different cell types, DAT expression levels or sensitivity of the endocytosis assays. Finally, it should be noted that screening for kinases involved in DAT regulation did not reveal the involvement of Ack1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">VuorenpÃ¤Ã¤ et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, we put forward a hypothetical model of AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization and endocytosis summarized as follows. First, we propose that AIM-100 increases DAT oligomerization by directly interacting with DAT in its conformation favorable for oligomerization and thus stabilizing DAT trimers/oligomers. We also suggest that the AIM-100:DAT interaction and the occupancy of the substrate binding sites are mutually exclusive. Second, we propose that DAT oligomerization results in an extensive surface clustering, which may be driven by the hydrophobic mismatch of oligomers and the membrane. Clustering is typically observed as the consequence of ligand-induced dimerization of receptors [for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zidovetzki et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zidovetzki et al., 1986</xref>). Third, DAT clusters may stabilize or promote spontaneous membrane invagination and scission leading to a coat-independent endocytosis. Such TM cargo-induced membrane remodeling has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johannes and Mayor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johannes et al., 2014</xref>), although experimentally-proven examples in intact cells or in vitro are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosholm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spoden et al., 2008</xref>). Independence of the AIM-100-induced endocytosis of clathrin, dynamin and other mechanisms mediating various known CIE pathways, supports the hypothesis that this endocytosis may not involve a specific membrane bending/scission machinery. Thus, experiments with AIM-100 uncover a novel mechanism of endocytosis triggered by the conformation-coupled cargo oligomerization. Future studies will address whether such mechanism is utilized by other oligomeric TM proteins.</p><p>Our findings inevitably lead to a hypothesis that coat-free endocytosis may serve as part of the regulatory and quality-control mechanisms that remove excess DAT from the cell surface in the absence of extracellular substrates and may clear DAT oligomers as they are functionally impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhen and Reith, 2018</xref>). Defining the molecular mechanisms and mapping a novel interface of AIM-100 interaction with the DAT should open avenues to developing new approaches for modulating DAT activities and subcellular localization at the highest specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Dopamine trasporter <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td valign="top">human DAT</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">Q01959</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Dopamine transporter <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">mouse DAT</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">Q61327</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent</td><td valign="top">Mouse transgenic <break/>knock-in HA-DAT</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao et al., 2012</xref> (available <break/>from Jackson lab)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-Sklca3<sup>tm1.1Asor</sup>/J;

The cells grown on 35 mm MatTek dishes were incubated with DMSO (vehicle) or AIM-100 at 37Â°C. A method of sensitized FRET measurement, that has been described in our studies previously was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galperin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang and Sorkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sorkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, images were acquired using the spinning disk confocal microscope at room temperature (to avoid artifacts due to the rapid movement of endosomes and filopodia during image acquisition) sequentially through 445 nm (CFP; excitation - 445 nm, emission - 470 nm), 515 nm (YFP; excitation - 515 nm, emission - 542 nm) and FRET (excitation at 445 nm; emission at 542 nm) filter channels.

Bleed-through coefficients were measured in cells expressing only CFP-DAT or YFP-DAT, and treated or not with AIM-100. FRET<sup>C</sup> images are presented in a pseudocolor mode. FRET<sup>C</sup> intensity is displayed stretched between the low and high renormalization values, according to a temperature-based lookup table with blue (cold) indicating low values and red (hot) indicating high values. To eliminate the distracting data from regions outside of cells or cells that do not express both CFP and YFP, the CFP channel was used as a saturation channel, and the FRET<sup>C</sup> images were displayed as CFP intensity-modulated images. In these images, data with CFP values greater than the high threshold of the saturation channel are displayed at full saturation, whereas data values below the low threshold are displayed with no saturation (i.e. black).</p><p>FRET<sup>C</sup> values were also calculated from the mean fluorescence intensities for multiple selected sub-regions of the images containing individual ruffles and filopodia (plasma membrane) in vehicle-treated cells, andÂ plasma membrane clusters and endosomes in AIM-100 treated cells as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorkina et al., 2003</xref>). Normalized sensitized FRET (FRETN) values for individual subcellular structures, regions and compartments were calculated according to the equation (1): FRETNÂ =Â FRET<sup>C</sup>/YFP x CFP, where FRET<sup>C</sup>, CFP and YFP are the mean background-subtracted intensities of FRET<sup>C</sup>, CFP and YFP fluorescence in the selected sub-region. Because FRETN displays a non-linear dependence when donor or acceptor are in a significant molar excess over each other, FRETN values were calculated in the sub-regions of the cell in which the relative stoichiometry of the donor and acceptor was not more than 3.

The internalization is found to be independent of dynamin, cholesterol and the actin cytoskeleton, suggestive of a novel internalization mechanism. The authors also find an unusual itinerary for the DAT internalization of DAT with accumulation of the transporter in early endosomes and little recycling and degradation. Overall, these findings reveal a novel mechanism for DAT trafficking and its oligomerization that are driven by the conformational-state of the transporter. There are however several issues that must be addressed as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important issue is the cell physiological relevance of the findings. To be critical, the authors find that a compound somehow affects DAT so it somehow oligomerizes, internalizes and accumulates in early endosomes without being degraded or recycled. The fact that the effect is conformation specific is interesting but the reviewers miss some experiments and a discussion that further deal with the physiological relevance of the observations in relation to DAT as such and in relation to the putative novel internalization mechanism. One obvious question is whether the effect is affected by the presence of substrates? Is the effect promoted or inhibited by dopamine and/or amphetamine? The authors specifically raise the issue whether or not AIM-100 binds to the substrate binding site or to another allosteric site so it seems obvious to address this question.</p><p>2) Along the same lines, because the effect of AIM-100 seems to be dependent on the inward facing conformation and the experiments are not conclusive about whether the compound binds to an allosteric site, it would be interesting to assess the effect of an inhibitor that preferentially binds an inward-facing conformation, such as ibogaine.</p><p>3) Also, does AIM-100 inhibit binding of a radiolabeled inhibitor to the transporter and, if so, is the inhibition competitive or allosteric in nature? This would further address the issue of how AIM-100 exerts its action on DAT.</p><p>4) Figure 9 should be supplemented.

Hence, it is not clear to the reviewer why only biochemical assays were used to make one of the two main statements in this paper.

These experiments demonstrated that high concentrations of substrates (20 Î¼M and higher) significantly inhibit AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization and endocytosis. These data are summarized in new Figure 6. Please see the second paragraph of the subsection âDAT inhibitors and substrates diminish the effects of AIM-100 on DATâ, and the figure legend for description of these experiments.</p><p>We discuss the physiological relevance of our observations in the âDiscussionâ section. For example, we propose that: 1) substrates may shift the equilibrium between oligomeric and monomeric species of DAT at the cell surface; 2) coat-free endocytosis may serve as part of the regulatory and quality-control mechanisms that remove excess DAT from the cell surface in the absence of substrates or clear DAT oligomers as they are functionally impaired (reduced functionality of DAT dimers/oligomers was proposed by Zhen and Reith, 2018); 3) cluster-triggered endocytosis may be common for other multimeric transmembrane proteins. We also emphasize that defining the molecular mechanisms of DAT interaction with AIM-100 and mapping the novel interaction interface in the DAT molecule may open avenues for developing new approaches for modulating DAT activities and subcellular localization at the highest specificity.</p><p>Please see the fourth and last paragraphs of the âDiscussionâ, and other parts of âDiscussionâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Along the same lines, because the effect of AIM-100 seems to be dependent on the inward facing conformation and the experiments are not conclusive about whether the compound binds to an allosteric site, it would be interesting to assess the effect of an inhibitor that preferentially binds an inward-facing conformation, such as ibogaine.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, ibogaine is a Schedule I controlled substance in US. While I am licensed to use Schedule II-IV compounds, obtaining the Schedule I license is a very tedious process and may take several months (I have applied two months ago). Therefore, instead of ibogaine, we tested the effects of modafinil, a compound that is available to us and that was proposed to bind DAT substrate binding sites and stabilize it in an occluded-intermediate and/or inward-facing conformation (Schmitt and Reith, 2011), similarly to what was proposed for the effects of ibogaine on DAT. We found that modafinil inhibits AIM-100-induced oligomerization and endocytosis of DAT. Please see the second paragraph of the subsection âDAT inhibitors and substrates diminish the effects of AIM-100 on DATâ, and a new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Also, does AIM-100 inhibit binding of a radiolabeled inhibitor to the transporter and, if so, is the inhibition competitive or allosteric in nature? This would further address the issue of how AIM-100 exerts its action on DAT.</p></disp-quote><p>Dr Melikian and co-workers previously demonstrated that AIM-100 inhibits CFT binding to DAT at 4<sup>o</sup>C with Ki 20-40 Î¼M. We performed several binding saturation assays using the radiolabeled cocaine analog WIN34545 (CFT) in the absence or presence of AIM-100 at 20<sup>o</sup>C, and found that the inhibition is of non-competitive nature. The rationale for conducting experiments at 20<sup>o</sup>C but not in 4<sup>o</sup>C is based on our observation that AIM-100 efficiently increases DAT oligomerization at 20<sup>o</sup>C but not at 4<sup>o</sup>C. Because AIM-100 is highly lipophilic, it is poorly water-soluble in concentrations higher than 20 Î¼M, which precluded testing the effects of high AIM-100 concentrations on CFT binding. Please see the last paragraph of the subsection âDAT inhibitors and substrates diminish the effects of AIM-100 on DATâ and new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>Altogether the data with various substrates and inhibitors of DAT (Figures 5-6 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) led to a new working model of how AIM-100 increases DAT oligomerization. This model is discussed as follows:</p><p>âThe inhibitory action of DAT blockers and substrates on AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization (Figures 5-6) suggest that AIM-100 effect may require binding of AIM-100 to a site in the DAT molecule that is inaccessible when the transporter is occupied by these substrates or inhibitors. [â¦] The inability of AIM-100 to increase DAT oligomerization at 4<sup>o</sup>C (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) supports the hypothesis that an effective diffusion of AIM-100 across and/or within the membrane is involved in the AIM-100 action on DAT.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 9 should be supplemented. Do Ack knock-down/inhibition or knock-down/overexpression of K44A dominant negative affect the AIM-100 induced multimerization of DAT?</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of the effect of a potent Ack1 inhibitor KRCA-008 on DAT oligomerization is shown in new Figure 10âfigure supplement 2. Because transient transfection of dynamin mutant results in its expression only in a small population of cells, biochemical experiments testing DAT oligomerization are not feasible. Therefore, we presented the blot demonstrating the lack of the effect of another robust inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin heavy chain siRNA, on AIM-100-induced DAT oligomerization. Please see Figure 10âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Sorkin and colleagues were among the pioneers to use FRET microscopy in neurotransmitter transporters and revealed for the first time that DAT forms oligomers in living cells throughout the secretory pathway and at the cell surface.

We were able to set up FRET measurements using spinning disk confocal system and test the effect of AIM-100 on CFP-DAT/YFP-DAT FRET in living cells with high resolution, so that FRET could be measured in individual structures, compartments and organelles. We observed a very clear AIM-100-induced increase in FRET intensities in the plasma membrane clusters and endosomes. Please see the last paragraph of the subsection âAIM-100 induced rapid nanoclustering of DAT on the cell surfaceâ and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1. These data together with the observation of rapid DAT clustering using high-resolution TIR-FM (Figure 3) support our conclusion that AIM-100 enhances DAT oligomerization in living cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors argue that an important control was unaffected by AIM-100: &quot;Furthermore, AIM-100 did not inhibit recycling of the transferrin receptor (data not shown).&quot; Here, my question is whether AIM-100 induces internalization of the TFR at all (which would also be a nice and independent control) and furthermore, to show these data.</p></disp-quote><p>The full-size images of transferrin conjugated to TexasRed (Tfn-TxR) in vehicle- and AIM-100-treated cells, which correspond to small insets in Figure 10, are now presented in new Figure 10âfigure supplement 1. Quantification of the amount of Tfn-TxR in endosomes are presented in the same figure. Constitutive clathrin-mediated internalization of transferrin is very fast (20-25%/min), and certainly, AIM-100 does not accelerate this process. On the contrary, we noticed that AIM-100 partially inhibits the accumulation of Tfn-TxR in endosomes, possibly due to a potential impact of AIM-100 on the activities of Ack1 (and possibly other tyrosine kinases) that are proposed to be involved in the endosomal sorting. Please see the first paragraph of the subsection âMechanisms of AIM-100-induced DAT traffickingâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
