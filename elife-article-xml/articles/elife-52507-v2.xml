Current models assume that commands that hold the limb at a target location do not depend on the commands that moved the limb to that location. Here, we report a surprising relationship between movement and posture in primates: on a within-trial basis, the commands that hold the arm and finger at a target location depend on the mathematical integration of the commands that moved the limb to that location. Following damage to the corticospinal tract, both the move and hold period commands become more variable. However, the hold period commands retain their dependence on the integral of the move period commands. Thus, our data suggest that the postural controller possesses a feedforward module that uses move commands to calculate a component of hold commands. This computation may arise within an unknown subcortical system that integrates cortical commands to stabilize limb posture.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Moving an arm requires the brain to send electrical signals to the arm’s muscles, causing them to contract. Neuroscientists call these types of brain signals “move signals”. The brain also sends so-called hold signals, which hold the arm still in a desired position. Part of the brain known as the primary motor cortex helps to calculate the move signals for the arm, but it was unclear how the brain produces the corresponding hold signals.</p><p>Fortunately, the fact that the brain moves other things besides arms may help answer this question. Previous research has shown, for example, that a brain area called the “neural integrator” calculates the hold signals needed to hold the eye in a specific position. The neural integrator does this by using basic principles of physics, and details of the speed and duration of the eye’s movements.</p><p>Now, Albert et al. show a similar mechanism appears to control hold signals for arm movements. In one set of experiments, muscle activity was measured as monkeys moved their arms or fingers to different target positions. In other experiments, human volunteers held a robot arm, and Albert et al. measured the forces they produced while reaching and holding still. Both the human and monkey experiments revealed a relationship between move signals and hold signals. Like for eye movements, hold signals for the arm could be calculated from the move signals. In further experiments with stroke patients where the brain had been damaged, the move signals were found to be deteriorated, but the way hold signals were calculated stayed the same. This suggests that there is an unknown structure within the brain that calculates hold signals based on move signals.</p><p>Investigating how the brain holds the arm still may help scientists understand why some neurological conditions like stroke or dystonia cause unwanted movements or unusual postures. This might also lead scientists to develop new ways to treat these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>motor

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To hold the limb still, the muscles are not quiet. Rather, they are actively engaged with coordinated inputs that maintain postural stability. Current models assume that these inputs are produced by an impedance controller that translates the sensory representation of a desired location to patterns of muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav and Sainburg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lametti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schabowsky et al., 2007</xref>). To move and then hold, one feedback controller generates the commands that move the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Todorov, 2007</xref>), and a separate controller generates commands that hold the limb still following movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav and Sainburg, 2011</xref>). This architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left) in which movement and postural controllers are independent is implicit in optimal control formulations of reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav and Sainburg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lametti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghez et al., 2007</xref>) and forms the basis for interpreting how neurons in the motor cortex encode reach kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sachs et al., 2016</xref>). While many predictions of this theory have been confirmed for control of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>), here we provide evidence that challenges the assumption that posture and movement are controlled independently.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Integral of muscle activity during the reach correlates with subsequent activity during the hold period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In current models (left), a feedback controller generates commands that move the arm, and then upon reach end, a postural controller holds the limb still. For this model, hold commands depend only on the target position. In the model considered here (right), the move commands are integrated in real-time by a postural controller. Thus, the hold commands depend on the preceding reach commands, not solely the target position.

(<bold>C</bold>) We selected muscles that have little to no holding activity, that is those whose activity during the hold period has a magnitude less than 10% of the peak moving activity. There are 6 out of 20 muscles who had such a property for most, if not all holding locations. We quantified the change in holding activity (from before to after the movement) and the integral of moving activity. We asked how well the integral of moving activity predicted the change in holding activity (the variance accounted for, or R<sup>2</sup>) in muscles with little holding activity (non-integrators) and others that were more active during holding still (integrators).

In order to hold the eyes at a target, the oculomotor system uses a hold controller whose output directly depends on the move controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Komatsuzaki, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cannon and Robinson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crawford et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFarland and Fuchs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godaux et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheron et al., 1986</xref>). The move controller produces a set of commands that displace the eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>). Simultaneously, these commands are integrated in real-time by a distinct brainstem structure, yielding sustained commands that hold the eyes and the head still when the movement ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Komatsuzaki, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miri et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the architecture assumed for move and hold controllers of the arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left) is not consistent with that of the eye and the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Komatsuzaki, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFarland and Fuchs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godaux et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheron et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cannon and Robinson, 1987</xref>).</p><p>While we do not know if the output of the reach controller serves as an input to the hold controller, there is evidence that moving and holding are controlled by separate neural structures; total inhibition of the mouse motor cortex during reaching causes the arm to stop moving, but the muscles continue to receive commands that hold the arm steady against gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). It is difficult to reconcile this observation with the idea that the cortex drives both moving and holding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphrey and Reed, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurtzer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Yet, there are also reasons to doubt that the neural control of the arm shares a design principle with control of the eyes and the head. The physical dynamics of the arm are much more complicated than the eye, casting doubt that any straightforward relationship might exist between commands that move the arm to a location, and the commands that subsequently hold the arm there. Furthermore, whereas damage to the brainstem structure that holds the eyes produces nystagmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaneko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko, 1999</xref>), we know of no condition that resembles nystagmus in the context of reaching.</p><p>We began by asking a simple question: are the commands that hold the limb at the target solely determined by the target position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left), or are they dependent in part on the preceding move commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right)? We began by measuring activity across arm muscles during point-to-point reaching. When monkeys reached to a single target from various directions, we found that the integral of reach activity predicted hold activity after the movement ended. Furthermore, as the target location varied, the same integration function accounted for hold period activity at the various endpoints. Thus, across a range of directions and endpoints, the hold period activity was related, through integration, with the preceding move period activity.</p><p>To ask whether this pattern held across other types of movements, we considered goal-directed finger movements in which the start and end target locations were kept constant. As monkeys flexed their finger, there was natural variability in muscle activity both during the movement and during the ensuing hold period. However, this variability had structure: on a within-trial basis, changes in hold period commands in all recorded muscles were correlated with the integral of the preceding commands that had brought the finger to its current location.</p><p>These patterns revealed a correlation, not causation. To test whether there might be a causal link between movement and holding, we imposed a change to the commands that moved the arm to a given target location, and quantified whether on a within-trial basis, the change in move period commands influenced the subsequent hold period commands. To do this, we altered the reach commands of humans through adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994</xref>). To measure the properties of the hold controller, we designed a procedure in which we slowly displaced the hand during the hold period while subjects were engaged in a working memory task. We recorded the forces produced by the hand in response to the involuntary displacements during the hold period, thus measuring the postural field that held the arm still. We found that as the reach period commands changed, the entire postural field shifted, indicating that changes to reach commands altered the null point of the hold controller. Notably, the function that related the hold period controller to the preceding reach period was the same integration function that we had observed in point-to-point reaching and finger movements.</p><p>Finally, we probed the neural circuits that might support this putative link between movement and holding by examining reaching in patients who had suffered damage to their corticospinal tract (CST) above the level of the brainstem. As expected, these stroke survivors exhibited large trial-to-trial variability in the commands that they produced during both the reach and the subsequent hold periods. Remarkably, the link between move and hold period commands appeared intact: on a within-trial basis, the hold period forces were related via a form of integration to the immediately preceding, but now imperfect, reach period forces.</p><p>Thus, in monkeys, healthy humans, and stroke survivors, across arm movements and finger movements, the hold period commands depended on the preceding commands that had moved the limb to its current location. These results raise the possibility that the postural controller possesses a subcortical feedforward module that calculates hold period commands through real-time integration of the move period commands. This feedforward computation then combines with visual and proprioceptive feedback to produce the sustained commands that result in postural stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We performed experiments in which monkeys and humans made goal-directed movements toward a target and then held their arm or finger at the target location.

Yet, if control of holding depends on the movement period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right), a single function must exist that transforms the commands that were generated during the movement period to the subsequent commands that are generated to hold the arm. To explore the plausibility of such a relationship, we used intramuscular electrodes to measure activity of 20 shoulder and elbow muscles during point-to-point reaching in the vertical plane (nine muscles in monkey A, 11 muscles in monkey B). On each trial, monkeys first moved their hand from a central location to one of eight targets, held their hand at that target for at least 0.5 s, then reached back to the central location and again held their hand for at least 0.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We normalized muscle activity by setting to zero its average activity at the central hold location, and setting to one its maximum activity in the task.</p><p>Consider the activity of the anterior deltoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) as the arm reached from the central position to a target. For some directions, this muscle exhibited a burst of activity during the reach, and then sustained activity during holding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, targets 3 and 5). For other targets, the muscle exhibited a smaller burst of activity during movement, and little or no activity during holding (target 1). Let us imagine that the measured EMG, denoted as <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), is actually the sum of two signals: a ‘hold’ command <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (brown traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and a ‘move’ command <italic>m</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (red traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The hold command is computed by adding the real-time integral of the move command to the initial hold activity that precedes movement (see Materials and methods Section A).</p><p>If the hold commands are computed from the move commands in this way, the two commands should be related by a common function across different types of reaching movements: the change in muscle activity from before the movement to after the movement, should be related to the intervening move period muscle activity (see Materials and methods A for derivation).

Indeed, for most muscles (14/20), change in the hold period activity was well predicted by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>. For example, when the target location was constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, reach back) across various movement directions, the changes in the hold period activities of many muscles were proportional to the integral of their respective activity during the preceding reach (red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When the target position varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, reach out), <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> was again a good predictor of the change in hold period activity, despite the fact that both direction and endpoint of the reach changed (green lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> presents the data across all muscles, directions, and endpoints. Remarkably, we found that integration of the reach period activity was a reasonable predictor of the change in hold period activity across all conditions (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58 for Monkey A and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.54 for Monkey B). Within each muscle, the integration gain <italic>k</italic> was no different for outward reaches and return reaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, paired t-test on single muscle regression slopes, p=0.943). In addition, the same integration gain predicted hold activity for fast and slow movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, fast vs. slow, two-sample t-test, p=0.30) which differed modestly in terms of movement duration (two-sample t-test, p&lt;0.001, fast movement duration of 350.3 ± 11.1 ms and slow movement duration of 453.6 ± 4.9 ms, mean ± SEM). This indicated that a single function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>) could account for various movements and speeds, despite the differing dynamics of these reaches.</p><p>Notably, despite these general trends, some muscles (6/20) did not exhibit the pattern described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>. These muscles shared a specific property: they had little to no activity during the hold periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> seemed to apply primarily to those muscles that modulated their activity during the hold period, contributing to maintenance of arm posture in this task. However, to not bias our results, we included all muscles in our regressions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F, G and H</xref>.</p><p>We considered an alternative hypothesis: a muscle that is more active to lift the arm will be also be more active to hold the arm. Perhaps, the correlations are driven mostly by biomechanical constraints of the reaching movements. Thus, we separated movements based on directions that were not affected by a change in gravitational forces (horizontal reaches), vs. other directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). If the relationship between move period and hold period was solely due to the gravitational field, we would expect that the integration function would differ for horizontal versus vertical movements. However, the gain of integration was similar for the two groups of movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, ANCOVA, movement type by moving EMG integral interaction effect on holding activity, F = 0.37, p=0.54). To broaden the scope of this alternative hypothesis, we considered the possibility that the change in hold period activity in each muscle depended on the maximum or minimum activity of that muscle during the reach period, not the integral of the entire reach period activity. This alternative hypothesis also proved to be significantly less accurate than <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> (within muscle comparison, paired t-test, p=0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In 17/20 muscles, integration of the reach period activity was a better predictor of the hold period activity than either the maximum or minimum muscle activity.</p><p>In summary, for reaching across various directions and endpoints, the change in a muscle’s activity from the pre-movement hold period to the post-movement hold period was partially predicted by the integral of that muscle’s activity during the intervening reach period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hold period activity for finger movements</title><p>According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>, trial-to-trial variation in the move period commands should lead to consistent trial-by-trial changes in the subsequent hold period commands, even if the target location remains constant.

To both flex the finger and support the mechanical load, muscle activity during each hold period was strongly modulated by finger location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle, one of the prime movers in this task, was more active when the finger was at the target as compared to the start location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). However, from one trial to the next, hold period EMG exhibited marked variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, note the vertical spread of the trial distribution at hold 2).</p><p>One possibility is that the variability in hold period EMG is due to position-related variability in the spring force applied to the finger (larger displacements lead to larger spring forces on the finger). To assess this possibility, for each muscle we regressed its activity onto its position during the target hold period. We found that variation in hold position accounted for less than 2% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0107 ± 0.0041, mean ± SEM across all muscles in both monkeys, individual regressions for each muscle) of the trial-to-trial variability in hold period EMG (we do not mean for this to give the impression that EMG was not strongly modulated by position, only that trial-by-trial differences in EMG were poorly explained by differences in position; see Materials and methods Section B2 for more information).</p><p>If variability in position could not explain the trial-to-trial changes in hold period EMG, what was the source of hold period variability? Inspection of muscle activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> suggested two possibilities: trial-by-trial changes in the hold period activity at the target (the hold 2 period) could be explained by (1) modulation in the initial holding activity prior to movement onset (the hold 1 period), or (2) modulation in move period activity. We first investigated the former possibility that when a muscle was more active during the initial hold period, it was also more active during the final hold period. This hypothesis stated that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. To evaluate this hypothesis, we regressed the activity of each muscle during hold 2 onto its activity during hold 1. The left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows the strength of this correlation in the FDP muscle for a single session. Each ellipse in the middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> represents the 95% confidence boundary for the trial-by-trial joint distribution between hold period activity at the target and hold period activity at the starting position, for each muscle, across all trials and sessions. Overall, hold activity at the start appeared to be a rather poor predictor of hold activity at the target, accounting for about 8% (monkey R) and 7% (monkey D) of the variance in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We next considered the hypothesis that variation in hold period activity may be due to variation in preceding move period activity. Using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>, we integrated the move period activity in the muscle, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with respect to its pre-movement activity, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and asked if this integral could predict the change in hold period activity from the start location, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, to the target location, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This comparison could be confounded by trial-to-trial differences in movement displacement. Under spring forces, a larger displacement might lead to greater move period as well as greater hold period activity. This did not appear consistent with the data: trial-to-trial displacement explained less than 1% of the variance in both the integral of move period activity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.006 ± 0.0018, mean ± SEM), and the change in hold activity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.005 ± 0.001, mean ± SEM). On the other hand, the integral of move period activity exhibited robust correlation with the change in hold period activity, as shown for an example recording session in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. For this session, about 56% of the trial-by-trial variance in FDP hold period activity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was accounted for by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> (linear fit for this session, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>To determine if all muscles exhibited similar within-trial correlations between moving and holding, we considered the data across all muscles and sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, middle and right panels). Each ellipse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> represents the 95% confidence boundary for the within-trial joint distribution between holding activity and the integral of moving activity, for each muscle. Strikingly, the orientations of various muscle distributions (the angle of the major axis) were roughly parallel with each other. Thus, the gain of the integration function was similar across muscles, and a single function accounted for approximately 50% and 40% (monkeys R and D) of the trial-by-trial variability in holding activity.</p><p>Finally, we considered another potential source of correlation between move and hold periods: co-contraction. If finger stiffness varied from one trial to another, we would observe correlations between move and hold periods. To change finger stiffness, agonist and antagonist pairs of muscles would exhibit coordinated increases or decreases in their activities. In other words, we should be able to predict the change in hold period activity in one muscle based on the activity of other muscles. To test this idea, we regressed the change in hold period activity in each muscle onto the integral of move period EMG in other muscles. Roughly 10% of the variability in the change in hold period EMG could be explained by the integral of move period activity of other muscles (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10 ± 0.02, mean ± SEM). Therefore, while some of the variance in hold period activity could be explained by the move period activity in other muscles, move period activity in a given muscle remained a much better predictor of the change in hold period activity in that same muscle (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42 ± 0.031, mean ± SEM).</p><p>In summary, for a constant target location, on trials in which a muscle moved the finger with greater activity, it also produced greater activity during the subsequent hold period. About 45% of the trial-to-trial variation in the change in hold period activity could be associated with the integral of the preceding move period activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Change in reach period commands alters hold period commands</title><p>These EMG patterns illustrated a correlation between move and hold period commands, but did not test whether there was a causal link between the two. That is, trial-to-trial coupling between move and hold period commands arose from variability that was internally generated by the animal. To rigorously test if hold period commands directly followed from move period commands, we next imposed external changes on move period commands and measured if hold period commands changed in a manner consistent with integration. To do this, we instructed participants to reach to a target while holding the handle of a robotic arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and adapted their move period commands by imposing a velocity-dependent force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert and Shadmehr, 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The integral of reaching forces correlates with forces produced during the subsequent hold period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human participants held the handle of a robotic arm and made point-to-point reaching movements (top).

If hold period commands partly depended on the preceding move period, then biases in move commands should lead to biases in hold commands, even though (1) the hold period commands were never perturbed, and (2) the hold location remained constant. To ensure that hold period commands were never perturbed, on all force field trials the hand was placed in a ‘well’ that held the hand still at the end of the movement for at least 1.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, target-hold well). Next, we used a channel to prevent the hand from suddenly moving off the target while participants transitioned from the target-hold well to the next reaching movement (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; see ‘partial channel’ in Materials and methods).</p><p>Unlike the monkey experiments, we did not record EMG during these experiments. Instead, we measured changes in the forces that participants exerted against the handle. These forces served as a low-dimensional proxy for the motor commands sent to the arm muscles. Critically, we drove the adaptation process with forces that acted perpendicular to the trajectory of the hand. Because the learning axis was orthogonal to the primary movement, we could cleanly isolate the component of the motor commands that varied in response to the field, from the motor commands responsible for the primary movement. To measure the forces perpendicular to the primary movement, on some trials the robot produced a stiff channel that connected the start position to the target via a straight line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, channel trial). To test the integration hypothesis, we recorded forces perpendicular to the direction of the target during the reach and hold periods, and asked if they were related through the following integration function (i.e. the force analogue of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>At the start of each experiment, participants (n = 220 in total) reached to the target in a neutral (i.e. null field) condition in which the robot did not produce any forces on the hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, null field trial). Even in the null field period, we observed significant trial-by-trial variability in the perpendicular reach period forces, as shown for a representative subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. During the reach period, the hand pushed slightly to the right on some trials, left on others, or exhibited a bimodal profile. However, because the movements were guided within a channel, the hand followed a straight line that ended at the center of the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom left). Notably, following conclusion of the reach, we observed that the arm generated forces during the hold period (period <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that were often different than baseline (period <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).

On a within-trial basis, the integral of move period force accounted for 39 ± 2% (mean ± SEM) of the variance in hold period force. Thus, just as EMG patterns exhibited a within-trial relationship between the reach and hold periods, so did the force patterns.</p><p>Like the EMG patterns, the force patterns did not appear to be trivially related to biomechanical constraints imposed on the arm due to gravity: the gain of the integration function was the same whether or not the weight of the arm was supported by a frictionless air-sled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, two-sample t-test, p=0.90). Remarkably, the relationship between move and hold period forces remained unchanged when we divided the null period reaches of each subject into fast and slow movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, ANCOVA, movement type by move force integral interaction effect on hold force, F = 0.007, p=0.935). Thus, in the null field, forces during the reach and subsequent hold periods showed natural variability. However, on a within-trial basis, the integral of the move period forces appeared to influence the subsequent hold period forces.</p><p>At the conclusion of the null field period, we gradually imposed a velocity-dependent force field during the reach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The velocity-dependent forces perturbed the hand perpendicular to the reach trajectory, thus leading to adaptation of reach period forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The gradual onset of the perturbation produced gradual changes in reach period forces (while also minimizing positional errors throughout the trajectory). Remarkably, as the reach period force changed from one trial to the next, so did the hold period force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Notably, the hold period forces were not transient, but sustained, persisting up to 6 s during the entire hold period interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The relationship between the change in hold period force and the (now externally-driven) reach period force was again consistent with integration: over the course of adaptation, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> accounted for 48 ± 3% (mean ± SEM across 32 participants) of the variance in the change in hold period forces.</p><p>As an alternative hypothesis, we considered the possibility that hold period forces may be a trivial continuation of the forces produced near the end of the preceding reach, not an integration of the entire history of the reach period. To test this idea, we conducted a pair of experiments. In the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), participants (n = 11) reached in a force field that was active only during the second half of the reach. In Phase 1 of the experiment, trial after trial we gradually increased the magnitude of the force field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Phase 1). As expected, participants produced hold period forces that increased with the integral of the reach period forces. In Phase 2, we maintained the force field at a constant magnitude for hundreds of additional trials. The change in hold period forces and the integral of reach period forces remained correlated during all trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Phase 2).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Holding forces are an integration of moving forces, not a continuation.</title><p>We designed a set of experiments to test the possibility that hold period forces are a continuation, not an integral, of moving forces.

In this way, the reach period forces should integrate to approximately zero. If holding forces were a simple continuation of the reach period forces, then the addition of the force field during the first half of the movement should not alter the hold forces at the end of the movement. However, this is not what we observed: as the integral of reach period forces approached zero, hold period forces gradually vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, Phase 2). That is, even though reach period forces were matched just before the end of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the ensuing hold period force depended on the entire history of the reach. In addition, we observed no difference in the integration function between each phase of the experiment (paired t-test on slope, p=0.22, paired t-test on intercept, p=0.09).</p><p>Together, these observations demonstrated that on a within-trial basis, as the reach period forces changed, so did the ensuing hold period forces.

To address this concern for our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, we re-analyzed the correlation between move and hold activity, but only on trials in which hold 1 activity fell within one standard deviation of the mean. This criterion reduced the variance in hold 1 activity by 75% for our finger movement dataset, and 88.6% for our reach force dataset. Despite this dramatic reduction in hold 1 variability, we found little effect on the measured correlations: the correlation coefficient between integral of move activity and change in hold activity remained 58.4% for muscles in the finger (compared to 64.2% if all trials are included) and 48.5% for reach forces on channel trials in the null field (compared to 52.2% if all trials are included).</p><p>In summary, the observed trial-by-trial correlations between move activity and change in hold activity were almost entirely driven by the integration of the move commands, with little dependence on variability in the initial hold activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The postural field during the hold period</title><p>Thus far, we have described the state of the limb during the hold period in terms of muscle activity or force generation.

In the presence of a velocity-dependent force field, the reach controller readily adapts and changes the move period forces. However, changes to the move period forces are integrated and cause the hold system to program an entirely different null position. This implies that postural stability will be compromised in the face of an adapting reach controller. To solve this problem, the integrator must also be adaptive: the integration function must change when there is an error between its current output and the desired movement endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Presumably, this error-based adaptation would be driven by unexpected deviations from the hand’s desired trajectory as the reach period ends and the hand arrives at the target location.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Adaptation of the integration gain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To maintain endpoint stability after adaptation of the reach controller, the postural controller must also adapt.

To detect these errors, we looked for deviations in the reach trajectory after the reach exceeded 80% of its displacement. We spatially aligned reaches by subtracting off the terminal hand position and then temporally aligned the reach trajectories to the point in time at which the hand had the largest endpoint error. These errors are marked as ‘endpoint correction’.

These trajectories exhibited two primary types of errors. The first error happened midway through the movement and was caused by incomplete compensation for the velocity-dependent perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the large negative mid-movement error). The second error happened near the end of the movement and was oriented in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, ‘endpoint correction’). This near endpoint error possessed two properties that were well-suited for integrator adaptation: (1) they occurred late in the movement as the participant attempted to stop their hand within the target, and (2) they were oriented in the direction opposite the shift in postural null point reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. To quantify the size of these endpoint errors, we measured the largest ‘positive’ deviation (or ‘negative’ if the lateral deviation was in the opposite direction) from the terminal hand position, after the hand exceeded 80% of its reach displacement.</p><p>To determine if endpoint errors caused integrator adaptation, we compared the size of these errors during the adaptation process, to the gain of integration observed at the end of adaptation.

Critically, we found that participants with larger endpoint errors ultimately produced smaller holding forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In other words, these errors appeared to reduce the gain of integration. In fact, about 40% of the variability in integration gain could be explained by the magnitude of the late endpoint errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>This adaptation of integration gain progressed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA, F = 12.60, p&lt;0.001).

In certain conditions, for example velocity-dependent force fields, the reach period commands change, but if one is to hold the hand at the target, then the hold period commands cannot simply integrate the preceding move period commands. Rather, as the move period commands adapt, so too must the integration function. Like the adaptation of movement commands, the adaptation of hold commands does not occur instantaneously, but appears to emerge gradually as errors near the end of the movement are experienced repeatedly. This process may also explain why holding forces gradually diminish during adaptation to an abrupt force field, where endpoint errors are large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sing et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Differential contributions of the corticospinal tract to reaching and holding</title><p>The CST conveys the cortically generated reach commands to downstream motor structures.

The reaching impairment coincided with a marked increase in the trial-to-trial variability of move period forces (traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> solid lines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> paretic vs. control, Wilcoxon rank-sum, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> paretic vs. non-paretic, Wilcoxon signed-rank, p=0.058). However, like healthy subjects, these move period forces, no matter how variable, terminated with stable holding forces (traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> dashed lines). The trial-by-trial variability of the hold period forces, like the move period forces that preceded them, was significantly greater in the paretic arm of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; paretic vs. control, two-sample t-test, p=0.01; paretic vs. non-paretic, paired t-test, p=0.06).</p><p>If move period commands were integrated into hold period commands, the increased variability in holding forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) could arise indirectly from the normal integration of the highly variable moving commands. If this were true, the variability in the moving and holding commands would be similarly structured in both healthy subjects and stroke patients. To test this idea, we quantified the within-trial correlation between change in hold period forces and the integral of the preceding move period forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, left column, representative subjects). Remarkably, in the null field trials, the coupling between move and hold periods was intact in stroke patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, paretic vs. control, two-sample t-test, p=0.14; paretic vs. non-paretic, paired t-test, p=0.63).</p><p>We next used adaptation to systematically manipulate move period forces. Because force field adaptation is largely a cerebellar-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Shadmehr, 2005</xref>), despite damage to the CST the patients learned to alter their move period forces. As the move period force changed in the paretic arm, so did the change in hold period force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, right column, example subjects). Once again <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> provided a reasonable account of the within-trial relationship between the move period and the change in hold period forces for the paretic arm, non-paretic arm, and the dominant arm of age-matched control subjects (paretic vs. control, two-sample t-test, p=0.08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>: paretic vs. non-paretic, paired t-test, p=0.24). Notably, the integration gain was not significantly different across the paretic and non-paretic limbs of the patients, nor across the patients and age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>; paretic vs. control, two-sample t-test, p=0.86; paretic vs. non-paretic, paired t-test, p=0.91). In other words, the integration function was similar in healthy participants and stroke patients.</p><p>In summary, damage to the CST severely affected the reach period commands, resulting in high trial-to-trial variability. However, the change in hold period commands remained coupled to the integral of the preceding reach commands in both null field and force field trials. The gain of this integration in the stroke patients was not different than that of healthy controls, suggesting that CST damage impaired the reach commands, but not the process of integration that may have generated the hold commands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current computational models of reaching view move and hold periods as events that take place in sequence: the sensory representation of the target engages a feedback controller that moves the arm, and then once the desired endpoint has been achieved, a separate controller is engaged that produces the sustained commands that hold the arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav and Sainburg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lametti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghez et al., 2007</xref>). These models have usually assumed that the motor cortex is responsible for generating the move period as well as the ensuing hold period commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphrey and Reed, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurtzer et al., 2005</xref>). Here, our experiments suggest the possibility of a different architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), one in which movement commands are integrated in real-time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by a separate network of neurons of possibly subcortical origin, resulting in holding commands. If true, this would imply that control of the arm shares a design principle present in control of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Komatsuzaki, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cannon and Robinson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crawford et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFarland and Fuchs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godaux et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheron et al., 1986</xref>) and the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crawford et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaikh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We measured muscle activity during point-to-point reaching in the vertical plane and found that across directions and durations, a form of mathematical integration related muscle activity during the hold period with the preceding reach period activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When the start and end positions of finger movements were kept nearly constant, there was still large variability in the hold period EMG of many finger muscles. On a within-trial basis, for all muscles recoded the integral of the move period EMG partly accounted for the change in hold period EMG. In contrast, activity before the start of the movement, co-contraction, or even finger position itself were poor predictors of the final hold period EMG. Thus, fluctuations in the integral of the move period commands influenced the change in hold period commands.</p><p>Next, we altered the move period commands and asked whether that change altered the commands that were generated during the hold period. We approached this question in healthy participants, as well as patients who had survived a stroke affecting their CST above the brainstem. In both populations, as reach period forces changed during force field adaptation, so did the subsequent hold period forces, as predicted by integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Integration was also observed during the null period prior to the introduction of the force field, effectively ruling out the possibility that moving and holding correlations arose due to reach adaptation. Critically, the same integration function was observed for both healthy participants and stroke patients, suggesting that the putative integrator might reside within a subcortical structure.</p><p>As an alternative to integration, we considered the possibility that the hold period forces may be a continuation of the reach period forces, not an integration of the entire period. To test this idea, we changed the reach period forces via adaptation to a bidirectional force field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), one in which the integral of the move period forces was zero, but not the forces near the start or end of the move period. We found that as the integral of the move period force approached zero, so did the change in hold period force.</p><p>Finally, we considered the fact that in order to hold the arm at a specific location, the nervous system must produce a postural field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mussa-Ivaldi et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shadmehr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giszter et al., 1993</xref>). We measured this field by engaging subjects with a working memory task, while slowly moving their hand away from the target location. We found that as the reach period commands changed, so did the null position of the postural field. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the integral of the preceding reach forces. These results suggested that the hold forces we measured in our adaptation experiments were generated by a disparity between hand position and the null point established by the integration of moving commands. This mismatch may help explain the paradoxical illusions in perception of arm position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darainy et al., 2013</xref>) that accompany force field adaptation.</p><p>The idea that move period activity is integrated into a specific null point might explain why we observed poor trial-by-trial correlation between hold activity and finger position in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Note that the tube housing the finger constrained the motion of the finger to an arc, and thus may have prevented it from moving to its true ‘null position’ in three-dimensional space. Therefore, if move commands integrated to a position outside of the tube, for a fixed tube rotation, there could be many null positions lateral to the tube, thus decreasing the observed correlation between the rotational position we measured and the associated EMG. In other words, trial-to-trial variability in move period activity should integrate to different magnitudes of hold activity, thus leading to hold positions that do not necessary lie within the tube.</p><p>The notion that holding commands control a null position is reminiscent of earlier theories in which the principal role of the motor system was to specify equilibrium positions for the arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feldman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman, 1986</xref>). These theories posited that movement arose from the transition between holding locations. In sharp contrast, our results imply that the hold commands are generated in real-time via integration of the ongoing move period commands.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A hypothetical architecture for control of arm posture</title><p>The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> represents our conjecture regarding architecture of the reach and hold controllers.

During a movement, the commands that arrive at the motoneurons are a sum of commands for moving and holding, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>There are a number of predictions that arise from this model. Motor commands required to move the arm to a target position are not fixed, but vary because of interactions with external objects, interaction torques that arise when the body is in motion, and over time as our bodies change. We know that the move system continuously adapts to these novel dynamics. A similar process of adaptation would also be required of the proposed reach integrator.</p><p>Indeed, in the oculomotor system, move period and hold period commands can both undergo adaptation, and this adaptation depends on the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>). However, different regions of the cerebellum are required for adaptation of the move and hold periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Optican and Miles (1985)</xref> demonstrated that the oculomotor integrator could be adapted by translating the target position as the eye transitioned from a saccade to gaze holding. In our reaching experiments, we found evidence for a similar adaptation mechanism. Errors near the end of the reach that were consistently encountered as the arm attempted to stop within the target location reduced the gain of the integration function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Through adaptation of the hold system, the arm would be able to cope with novel dynamics during the reach while also maintaining the ability to hold the arm at the target.</p><p>While this adaptation mechanism would achieve endpoint stability over the sequence of many movements, immediate corrections in the integrator output would be handled through the parallel operation of sensory feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, sensory feedback). This scheme would resemble a neural integrator for control of the head in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crawford et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaikh et al., 2013</xref>), which relies on proprioceptive and visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaikh et al., 2013</xref>). The importance of these feedback pathways is further illustrated by conditions in which the arm is passively moved to a new position.</p><p>We think that this new model of reaching might shed light on a number of interesting puzzles. For example, transient inhibition of the motor cortex during a reach results in ‘freezing of the arm’ at its current posture, and not loss of muscle tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). That is, despite near complete removal of output from the motor cortex during a reach, commands of unknown origin continue to sustain arm position against the force of gravity. Our model suggests that a distinct structure, possibly located in a subcortical area, integrates the cortically-generated reach commands up until the moment of cortical inhibition, and thus maintains posture despite removal of reach commands. This model is also consistent with the observation that cortical stimulation not only moves the limb, but also produces specific postures in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the total displacement of the limb appears to scale with the duration of stimulation, consistent with the idea that displacement is produced due to integration of motor commands over time.</p><p>The idea that integration occurs outside of the motor cortex potentially explains why successful decoders of cortical activity are designed to control cursor velocity, as opposed to cursor position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sachs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilja et al., 2012</xref>). To hold the cursor still, these decoders assume that the cortex encodes a zero-velocity command rather than a position-based command. This observation is consistent with the possibility that the cortex is primarily concerned with dynamic quantities, that is changes in the state of the limb, rather than the maintenance of a specific limb state over time. This idea would account for the observation that neurons in the motor cortex modulate their activity when there is a change in force production, but less so when the constant force is maintained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shalit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Georgopoulos et al., 1992</xref>). To maintain a constant force over time, our conjecture states that a subcortical area integrates phasic activity from the cortex, and maintains its output over time. This idea is consistent with evidence that transient stimulation of the brainstem in decerebrate cats produces sustained (timescale of minutes) changes in extensor muscle force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mori et al., 1982</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations</title><p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations (1) and (2)</xref> describe how the integration of move activity may relate to changes in hold commands, but does not specify the hold command at the target. This reflects the reality that move period commands alone will not determine the terminal position of the arm: the initial arm position must also be taken into account. In other words, to hold the limb at the target, the integrator must not only integrate move commands, it must add this integral to the hold period activity that preceded movement (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation (6)</xref> in Materials and methods; illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). We do not know if the integrator internally performs this addition, or if a downstream structure handles this adjustment for initial limb position.</p><p>Without a biomechanical model of the arm, it is not obvious why the linear functions in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations (1) and (2)</xref> robustly predicted the relationship between change in hold activity and the integral of move activity. It may be that as we test movements that are more complex than simple point-to-point reaches, the observed linearity will break down. For example, how would the reach integrator maintain endpoint accuracy when the arm grasps an object, thus altering its mass? Such a scenario would require an increase in muscle activity to move the larger mass, and then hold it still against the forces of gravity, so it may be the case that integration would naturally account for these positive correlations. Furthermore, over successive movements, inaccuracies in the output of the integrator could be reduced through adaptation of the integration gain as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Finally, as is the case for the move controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howard et al., 2013</xref>), the reach integrator may store object-specific or environment-specific memories and implicitly alter its integration properties when an often-encountered dynamical context is re-experienced. These mechanisms, along with the parallel output of visual and proprioceptive controllers would allow the arm to be stabilized under different inertial conditions.</p><p>These possibilities could be tested in the future, by altering the mass of the arm and recording EMG from various arm muscles. With regard to EMG recording, it should be re-emphasized that the reach period forces measured in our human subject experiments were perpendicular to the direction of movement, and thus represented only part of the complete motor command. Because perturbations were applied perpendicular to the reach trajectory, our measure captured the primary dimension of adaptation. In future studies, a more complete picture of the integration process would be provided by recording EMG during adaptation.</p><p>It is unlikely that the motor cortex has no role in postural control. At the very least, the monosynaptic projections from corticomotoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffin et al., 2015</xref>) to alpha-motoneurons in the spinal cord are likely to be active during periods of holding still. We do not know if these hold period signals in the cortex arise from recurrent connections with a subcortical integration system, or from a separate position controller.</p><p>Understanding the differential contributions of the cortical systems and the putative subcortical integrator is essential to improve our understanding of neurological disorders such as stroke and dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sadnicka et al., 2018</xref>). Identifying the locus of the reach integration may help explain why these patients exhibit abnormal postures at rest. These abnormalities could arise from a lesion to the integrator circuit, or perhaps more provocatively, from the normal integration of chronically abnormal moving commands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The reach integrator hypothesis</title><p>Muscles are engaged during the period of moving as well as the subsequent period of holding still.

Briefly, at the start of each trial the monkey held its hand at a central home location. After a ‘GO’ cue, the monkey reached to one of eight peripheral targets displayed in the vertical plane on a monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and then held its arm at the target for at least 0.5 s. After this holding period, the monkey returned its arm to the central home location and held it there for at least 0.5 s, until the start of the next trial.</p><p>On each trial, hand position was recorded through infrared optical tracking of a bead fixed to the third and fourth fingers. The activity of several muscles was also recorded using intramuscular electrodes. In Monkey A, these muscles included the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoid, the medial and lateral bicep, and the upper and lower trapezius. From Monkey B, these muscles included the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoid, the pectoralis, the brachialis, the medial and outer bicep, and the upper and lower trapezius. EMG signals were filtered (10–500 Hz), digitized at 1 kHz, rectified, and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (standard deviation of 20 ms). Muscle activity was then averaged across movements towards each target, separately. We normalized the data by setting to 0 the average muscle activity at the center hold location, and setting to 1 its maximum activity in the task.</p><p>We asked whether activity in a given muscle during the hold period could be related to its activity during the preceding reach period (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>).

The post-movement holding activity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was quantified as the mean activity over [+300, +450] ms period after movement termination for both outwards and return movements. We started this interval 300 ms after movement offset to allow time for muscle dynamics to settle. And finally, the bounds for integration (i.e. <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>T</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) were set as 140 ms before movement onset up until movement offset. We started integration prior to movement onset to capture changes in muscle activity that preceded change in kinematics.</p><p>Of the 320 different movement types (20 muscles x two reaches per trial x eight targets), six movements (1.9% of trials) had reach durations that were too slow to gain an accurate measurement of holding activity prior to the start of the next movement. To identify these trials, we used a cutoff for movement duration of 850 ms. The six trials with movement durations that exceeded 850 ms were not included in our analysis.</p><p>We fit the integration parameters, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> in the least-squares sense. To determine if the integration gain differed for outward and return movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), we fit the outwards and return movements separately, and then tested for a difference in integration gain with a paired t-test. To determine if integration gain differed for movements of different durations, for each movement type (16 possible movements, eight directions for outwards and return movements), we sorted movements into fast and slow, based on the median movement duration. Because muscles were recorded on different sets of sessions, the average movement durations for each muscle differed. For the slow and fast movement groups, we fit the integration parameters in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>, and tested for a difference in integration gain with a paired t-test.</p><p>To determine how gravity impacted the gain of integration, we separated movements into two groups: (1) the horizontal movements to and from Targets 2 and 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and (2) the other six movements (all contained a vertical component). Because the horizontal group groups consisted of only four movements (2 out and 2 back) for each muscle, we used a different technique to test for differences in integration gain. We collapsed data across all muscles and movements in the horizontal group, and then separately in the vertical group. We then fit integration parameters in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>. To test if there was a difference in the integration gain (i.e. the slope of the linear regression), we tested for a group by move period interaction effect on the hold period activity, using an ANCOVA.</p><p>We also tested if the maximum activity during moving (as opposed to the integral) was an equally good predictor of holding activity. For this, we quantified either the max activity (if the muscle increased activity) or min activity (if the muscle decreased activity) over the entire movement. We then regressed holding activity onto the max or min activity, for each muscle separately. We compared the R<sup>2</sup> of this fit to that of the integral fit using a paired t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Finger movements</title><p>To examine the within-trial covariance between the commands generated during the movement period and the subsequent holding period, we considered finger movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soteropoulos et al., 2012</xref>). Two monkeys (R and D) used their index finger to track a visual target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The index finger was splinted within a narrow plastic tube, constraining movements to the metacarpophalangeal joint. The hand on the recording arm and all other digits were placed in a padded pocket which prevented movement. The recording arm was placed in a sleeve to prevent movement. The contralateral arm was not restrained.</p><p>On each trial, the target moved between two positions at a speed of 12 deg/s. On flexion trials the target moved from 12° to 24°. On extension trials, this order was reversed. The finger flexion movements were resisted with a spring load that measured 0.026 N⋅m at 12° and 0.048 N⋅m at 24°. Each trial started with a rapid movement to the start position. The monkey then held its finger at the start location (hold 1) for 1 s, and then made a slow tracking movement to the target over a 1 s interval (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The trial ended with a 1 s hold at the target (hold 2).</p><p>We recorded activity of nine muscles of the finger and forearm (1DI, AbPL, EDC, ECR, ECU, FDS, FDP, FCR, and FCU) on each trial and on each monkey (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Muscle activity was measured using subcutaneous electrodes. In order to analyze single-trial activity, we first rectified the data, and then smoothed it with a Gaussian kernel (standard deviation of 200 ms). After this, we normalized the data by setting to 0 the average muscle activity at the 12° hold period, and setting to 1 its maximum activity during movement.</p><p>We used <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> to test whether there was a within-trial relationship between move period and the subsequent hold period activity of each muscle. We focused on flexion movements in which the finger moved against the external load. For this analysis, pre-movement holding activity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was the mean activity over a 400 ms interval starting 1 s prior to movement onset. The post-movement holding activity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was the mean activity over a 200 ms period starting 700 ms after movement termination. And finally, the bounds for integration (i.e. <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>T</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref>) were set as 150 ms before movement onset up until movement offset.</p><p>We considered data across all muscles and trials (n = 6177 for Monkey R, n = 2830 for Monkey D). We then fit the integration parameters, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> in the least-squares sense, for each monkey separately. We quantified the variance in holding activity accounted for by the integral of moving activity. For visualization, we also computed the 95% confidence ellipses that describe the joint distribution of holding force and the integral of moving force across all trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We compared integration to an alternative hypothesis: fluctuation in the final holding activity was caused by fluctuation in the initial holding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is described by the linear equation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. To test the alternative hypothesis, we collapsed data across all muscles and trials and regressed hold 2 activity onto hold 1 activity, and computed the variance accounted for (i.e. R<sup>2</sup>). For visualization, we also computed the confidence ellipses that describe the joint distribution of hold 2 activity and hold 1 activity.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that the observed correlations between move and hold period activity could be spuriously generated by the physical constraints required to move and hold against the spring load. That is, larger movements would require more work against the spring, leading to larger displacements that in turn would require greater hold force. This alternative hypothesis hinges on two relationships. One, trial-by-trial changes in hold position must correlate with trial-by-trial changes in hold EMG activity. Two, trial-by-trial changes in the finger displacement (i.e. movement size) must correlate with the integral of moving EMG activity. To test these possibilities, we used linear regression. First, we regressed muscle activity during the target hold period onto the position of the finger during the hold period. In addition, we also regressed the change in hold activity from the start location to the target location, onto the change in finger position across these two periods (i.e. the total displacement of the spring). Finally, we also regressed the integral of move period activity onto the change in finger position. In all cases, we performed separate regressions for each muscle, and then averaged the resulting R<sup>2</sup> values across muscles.</p><p>Note that there is a critical difference between regressing hold activity on hold 2 position alone versus regressing hold activity onto the combination of the hold 1 and hold 2 conditions. Regression within, but not across conditions, is the appropriate way to measure the trial-by-trial correlation between EMG and position without the influence of spurious across-condition correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>). If hold 1 and hold 2 are combined into the same regression (thus doubling the number of data points), these combined measurements account for 42 ± 4% of the variance in EMG activity in individual muscles, as compared to approximately 2% for hold 2 activity alone. The inflated variance accounted for is caused by the large separation between the associated distributions for hold 1 and hold 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> at right for an example), not by a strong coupling between EMG and position <italic>within</italic> any of these distributions. Therefore, we were careful not to collapse across both hold 1 and hold 2 when quantifying trial-by-trial correlation between EMG and finger position, to avoid these spurious correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>). With that said, we mention the combination of hold 1 and hold 2, to confirm that the spring load does indeed require a substantial modification in the EMG activity of individual muscles, even though trial-by-trial variations in EMG activity at the hold 2 position are only very weakly related to position (see the main text).</p><p>Finally, we considered the possibility that the observed correlations between move and hold period activity could have been caused by trial-to-trial fluctuations in co-contraction. If on some trials, the finger was stiff and co-contracted its muscles, and on other trials less so, we may observe correlations between move and hold activity, without any relation to hold position. To change finger stiffness, agonist and antagonist pairs of muscles would exhibit correlated increases or decreases in activity. In other words, we should be able to predict the hold period activity in one muscle not solely based on its move period activity (as in the integration hypothesis) but also on the activity of simultaneously recorded muscles. To test this idea, we regressed hold period activity of each muscle onto the integral of move period EMG in other muscles. For a given muscle, we performed this regression separately for all of its possible pairs, calculated the R<sup>2</sup> value for each pair, and then averaged across pairs to obtain a single R<sup>2</sup> value per muscle. We report the average R<sup>2</sup> value across all muscles. For context, we compare this R<sup>2</sup> value with that obtained by regressing hold period activity in a muscle onto the integral of move period activity in that same muscle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Human experiments</title><p>All human subject experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Two separate raters scored these assessments in each patient. In each limb, we measured the strength of elbow flexion and extension and shoulder horizontal adduction and abduction using a dynamometer (microFet 2). During measurements, participants rested their arm on a side table so the arm rested slightly below shoulder level. Strength measurements were repeated twice, the maximal force was recorded on each effort, and forces were averaged over repetitions. FMA scores, ARAT scores, strength, and other patient characteristics are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Missing entries in table indicate that the patient was unable to perform the desired action.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Overview of human reaching experiments</title><p>In all our human experiments (healthy participants and stroke patients), participants held the handle of a planar robotic arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and made point-to-point reaching movements between targets in the horizontal plane. For stroke patients and age-matched controls, the arm was supported by a frictionless air-sled. In addition, both the paretic (contralateral to lesion) and non-paretic (ipsilateral to lesion) arms were tested. For all other participants, the subject supported the weight of their own arm, and only the dominant arm was tested.</p><p>As the subject held the robot handle, the forearm was obscured from view by an opaque screen. An overhead projector displayed a small white cursor (diameter = 3 mm) on the screen that tracked the motion of the hand. Visual feedback of the cursor was provided continuously throughout the entirety of the testing period, except where otherwise noted. Throughout testing, we recorded the position of the robot handle using a differential encoder with submillimeter precision. We also recorded the forces produced on the handle by the subject using a 6-axis force transducer. Data were recorded at 200 Hz. Except where otherwise noted, kinematic time series were aligned to the onset of movement at the time point where hand velocity crossed a threshold of 1 cm/s.</p><p>At trial onset, a circular target (diameter = 1 cm) appeared in the workspace, coincident with a tone that cued reach onset. After stopping the hand within the target, a holding period of various durations (1.8 to 6.5 s) ensued where subjects were instructed to continue holding the handle within the target. After this holding period, a random inter-trial-interval sampled uniformly between 0.3 and 0.4 s elapsed prior to the start of the next trial.</p><p>At the end of each reach, coincident with the start of the holding period, movement timing feedback was provided. If the reach was too fast (or too slow), the target turned red (or blue) and a low tone was played. If the reach fell within the desired movement interval the target ‘exploded’ in rings of concentric circles, a pleasing tone was played, and a point was added to a score displayed in the upper-left-hand corner of the workspace. For stroke patients and age-matched controls, the desired movement duration was 600–800 ms. For all other participants, this interval was 450–550 ms. Participants were instructed to obtain as many points as possible throughout the experimental session.</p><p>In all human reaching experiments, trials were ordered in pairs of outwards and backwards movements. In other words, each pair started with a reach from a start position to a target (outward reach). The subject then held the arm still at the target position, and then reached back to the start position (the backward reach). Only outwards movements were analyzed here. All backwards movements were performed in a channel, or a partial channel condition (described below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Measurement of moving and holding forces in human subjects</title><p>At regular intervals throughout each experiment (generally every 5<sup>th</sup> outwards trial) we measured forces in a channel trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheidt et al., 2000</xref>). On these trials, the motion of the handle was restricted to a linear path connecting the start and target locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To restrict hand motion to the straight-line channel trajectory, the robot applied perpendicular stiff spring-like forces with damping (stiffness = 6000 N/m, viscosity = 250 N⋅s/m). This condition maintained the hand in equilibrium along the axis perpendicular to movement. Therefore, the force applied by the robot was equal and opposite to the lateral force applied by the subject, thus serving as a precise measurement of lateral reaching forces. Before analyzing these forces offline, we first subtracted the baseline force from all force time series. We obtained the baseline force by averaging the forces recorded on the channel trials within the null field period at the start of each experiment.</p><p>One of the primary objectives of our study was the comparison of moving and holding forces on channel trials. In each of our experiments, the hand remained in the channel during both the moving period and the holding period (a period of time of at least 1.8 s after the reach ended) to allow us to measure both moving and holding forces.</p><p>Our primary hypothesis was that the holding forces could be described as an integral of moving forces according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref>.

The termination of the reach was determined based on a velocity threshold of 3.5 cm/s. The integral of reach forces was computed over the entire movement duration (from movement onset to movement offset). Movement onset was determined based on a velocity threshold of 1 cm/s.</p><p>We conclude this section with a critical point. Holding forces would tend to move the hand off the target during periods of holding still. We hypothesized that these departures might result in adaptation of postural control. For this reason, we wanted to prevent this unwanted motion. On channel trials, we prevented this by keeping the hand in the channel, as described above. However, on all other trials, we also wanted to prevent motion of the hand during the holding process. Therefore, for all outwards movements not performed in the channel (this does not apply to the return movements), we applied a two-dimensional clamp to the hand at the end of the reaching movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This clamp prevented motion of the hand during the hold period, despite any forces the participant might have applied to the handle, and was programmed as a ‘well’ within the target location that attracted the hand in two dimensions, with stiff spring-like mechanics (stiffness = 4000 N/m, viscosity = 75 N⋅s/m). The target-hold well was applied when the hand entered the target location and the hand velocity fell below a threshold value of 3.5 cm/s.</p><p>And finally, to make sure that holding forces on outwards movements did not affect the initial motion of the hand on the following backwards movement trial, all return movements were performed in a partial channel. The channel was removed after the hand had traveled 40% of the desired movement amplitude. Therefore, the hand terminated at the start position without any external forces.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Working memory task</title><p>In some of our experiments, we employed a cognitive task to distract participants during measurement of holding forces. The working memory task consisted of a modified 2-back task where subjects were randomly shown an integer between 1 and 4. The integers appeared one at a time so that the next integer replaced the previous integer on the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Participants were told to determine if the integer on the display matched the integer shown two numbers in the past. If the integers matched, participants verbally responded with the keyword ‘same’. If the integers did not match, participants verbally responded with the keyword ‘different’. If the response was correct a pleasant tone was played and a point was added to the experiment score. If the response was incorrect a low pitch tone was played and no point was awarded. To confirm that participants were engaged in the cognitive task, we recorded each correct and incorrect response. Participants were clearly engaged in the cognitive task and responded correctly to 91.8 ± 0.6% of items correctly, at rates of approximately 0.77 ± 0.6 items per second.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Reaching movements in the null field</title><p>A total of 220 healthy subjects participated in these experiments. The general structure of the task is described in the previous two sections. Almost all movements were performed in a null field, that is the subjects freely reached between the start and target positions. At the end of these null field movements, the robot applied a target-hold well during the holding period, as described in a previous section. On some trials, we applied a channel and measured moving and holding forces as described in a previous section. All return movements were performed in a channel, or partial channel as described in a previous section.</p><p>This process was the same for healthy subjects and stroke patients. The only differences were that we tested both arms of the stroke patients (paretic then non-paretic), supported the weight of the arm of the stroke patients and their age-matched controls with a frictionless air sled, and allowed for differences in movement timing are described above.</p><p>We measured the relationship between the move period forces and the change in holding forces as described in C2. Specifically, we measured the within-trial relationship between these two quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for healthy controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> for stroke patients). At various points throughout the manuscript, we also report the integration gain, or in other words, the slope of the linear relationship between hold forces and the integral of reach forces. We compared the gain of integration for the control group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to the experiment groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, to test if adding weight support altered the integration gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom-right).</p><p>It is important to note that we combined several datasets for our analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. While the structure of each dataset was the same, they differed in the kinematics of the reaching movement. Across these tasks, we varied several parameters of the movement, including the target location (center of the body, to the left of the body, and to the right of the body), the reaching direction (towards the body, away from the body, or at an oblique angle), and the reach amplitude (10 cm or 20 cm). Most subjects reached between the same two locations, but for some subjects, there were two potential targets for each trial. The number of reaching trials performed varied across tasks. They ranged from 40 trials to 288 trials (half were outwards movements; the other half were backwards movements).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, we tested to see if the integration gain differed for fast and slow movements. For each participant, we sorted their channel trial reaching movements in the null field period according to their duration. Then, we selected the two fastest and two slowest movements for each subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left, individual points) and combined these movements across all subjects. Then we fit <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> to both the slow movement and fast movement distributions. We tested for differences in integration gain by reporting the move duration by move force integral interaction effect on hold force within an ANCOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Reaching movements in a velocity-dependent force field</title><p>The serial architecture between moving and holding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) makes a strong prediction: external adaptation of moving activity will lead to changes in holding still.

The experiment was structured so that the force field magnitude would start at 0 (a null field trial) and then gradually increase to its maximum strength over many trials. After this, the magnitude would then be reduced back to 0 over many trials. The exact perturbation schedule for healthy subjects is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. The experiment started with 40 trials (20 outwards movements and 20 backwards movements) of null field trials. Next, subjects were adapted to either a CW or CCW force field. The magnitude of CW/CCW perturbation was increased/decreased from 0 to 15 /- 15 N⋅s/m over the course of 100 outwards reaching trials (200 trials in total). The perturbation magnitude was then maintained at a constant level of 15 /- 15 N⋅s/m over the course of 50 outwards reaches (100 trials total) and then brought back to 0 gradually in a de-adaptation period of 100 outwards reaching trials (200 trials total). After this de-adaptation period, participants continued to reach in a washout period of 20 outwards reaches (40 trials total) where no force field was applied. Participants were then given a short break and this structure was repeated (either for the same force field, but a different target position (n = 17), or the opposite force field and the same target position (n = 15).</p><p>The experimental protocol was nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) for our stroke patient experiments, with two small differences. First, trial counts differed. Adaptation and de-adaption periods were 160 trials, as opposed to 200 trials. The period of maximal perturbation magnitude was reduced from 100 trials to 80 trials. The second difference is that we increased the maximal force field magnitude to 18 N⋅s/m. We increased this magnitude to compensate for slower movements (we required 600–800 ms movement duration for stroke patients and their age-matched controls, but 450–550 ms in other experiments). Each arm was tested in the stroke experiments in four blocks: paretic, non-paretic, paretic, non-paretic. The perturbation magnitude went in an A-B-B-A order (where A and B refer to either a CW or CCW field). The arm was supported by a frictionless air sled for both patients and age-matched controls.</p><p>For both healthy subjects and stroke patients, we measured the relationship between the move period forces and the change in holding forces at regular intervals throughout the process of adaptation and de-adaptation. To do this, every 5<sup>th</sup> outwards reaching movement was performed in a channel. We measured the within-trial relationship between moving and holding forces (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>).</p><p>We performed a control experiment (n = 7 subjects, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) to determine if holding forces were stable over longer periods of time. In this experiment, the length of the hold period was increased from approximately 1.8 to 6.5 s. To keep subjects engaged over this period of time, subjects were exposed to a working memory task during the holding period of channel trials as described in C3. The experiment was otherwise similar to the other tasks described in this section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Reaching movements in a zero integral force field</title><p>We considered an alternative hypothesis: holding forces could be a trivial continuation of moving forces (as opposed to an integral of moving forces). To test this idea, we designed two position-dependent force fields, A and B, with the latter integrating to 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Subjects reached between two targets separated by 20 cm. To form a zero integral force field, we designed a perturbation with two components, FF<sub>1</sub> and FF<sub>2</sub>. Each perturbation produced force along the x-axis, while movements were made along the y-axis. The first component FF<sub>1</sub> was applied during the first 10 cm of the reach, and the second component FF<sub>2</sub> was applied during the last 10 cm of the reach. Each component was programmed as a quadratic function of position. For FF<sub>1</sub> zero force was applied at the start position and at 10 cm. The maximal force was reached at 5 cm (the vertex of the first parabola). For FF<sub>2</sub> zero force was applied at 10 cm and at the target position. The maximal force was reached at 15 cm (the vertex of the second parabola). Here, we refer to the magnitude of FF<sub>1</sub> and FF<sub>2</sub> as the maximal force of each perturbation. To obtain a zero integral force field, FF<sub>1</sub> and FF<sub>2</sub> produced forces in opposite directions.</p><p>The experiment started with 25 outwards (50 trials total) null field trials (FF<sub>1</sub> and FF<sub>2</sub> were both equal to zero). Then we gradually increased the magnitude of FF<sub>2</sub> while FF<sub>1</sub> remained at zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, Phase 1). FF<sub>2</sub> was increased from 0 N to 3.5 N in even increments, over the course of 100 outwards reaching movements (200 trials total). Then Phase 2 of the experiment started. In this phase, FF<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 3.5 N on all trials, while FF<sub>1</sub> was gradually changed. The magnitude of FF<sub>1</sub> was decreased from 0 N to −3.5 N over the course of 200 outwards reaching trials (400 trials total). In this way, at the end of the experiment, participants were exposed to two force fields within the same reaching movement that perturbed the hand in opposite directions but with equal magnitude. Throughout this paradigm, we measured moving and holding forces on every 5<sup>th</sup> outwards reach in a channel.</p><p>We found that holding forces gradually decreased in Phase 2 of the experiment, consistent with our hypothesis of integration. To make sure that the introduction of FF<sub>1</sub> caused this decrease in holding force, as opposed to repetition or fatigue, we performed a control experiment (n = 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the control experiment, Phase 1 was identical to the main experiment described above. However, during Phase 2, the magnitude of FF<sub>1</sub> was maintained at 0 and the magnitude of FF<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 3.5 N. All other details were identical. We measured moving and holding forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) on every 5<sup>th</sup> outwards movement in a channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Measurement of the postural field</title><p>In order to hold the limb still, the postural controller generates a converging field of position-dependent forces that counters unwanted displacement of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mussa-Ivaldi et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shadmehr et al., 1993</xref>). In some of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we set out to measure this field. To do this, we designed a postural probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). On a postural probe trial, the robot moved the hand slowly in a random direction after the hand stopped within the target. As the hand was moved, visual feedback of hand position was prevented: the display cursor was frozen at the holding location.</p><p>To quantify the output of the holding controller, we measured the forces the subject applied to the handle while the robot moved the hand. To prevent participants from voluntarily opposing the imposed hand displacement, we distracted each participant with the working memory task described in an earlier section. We did not inform participants as to the nature or presence of the postural perturbation. Instead, we instructed participants to solely concentrate on the working memory task and obtain as many points as possible by answering memory questions correctly. Points for correct responses were combined with the points awarded for successful reaching movements.</p><p>The postural probe consisted of a straight-line displacement designed to make the probe as imperceptible as possible. To move the hand, we placed the hand in a two-dimensional clamp with stiff spring-like mechanics (stiffness = 4000 N/m, viscosity = 75 N⋅s/m) and moved the equilibrium position of the clamp through the workspace a total of either 2.5 cm, 4 cm or 5 cm, depending on the trial. The imposed motion consisted of three phases.</p><p>In Phase 1, the hand was moved a short distance (0.15 cm for 2.5 cm probes, 0.15 cm for 4 cm probes, and 0.3 cm for 5 cm probe) along a minimum jerk trajectory, over a short duration (0.75 s for 2.5 cm probes, 0.75 s for 4 cm probes, and 1.5 s for 5 cm probes). At the end of this displacement the velocity of the hand was equal to 0.375 cm/s. In Phase 2, the hand was then moved at this constant velocity for a specified displacement (2.2 cm for 2.5 cm probes, 3.7 cm for 4 cm probes, and 4.4 cm for 5 cm probes). This constant velocity displacement lasted for 5.87 s for 2.5 cm probes, 9.87 s for 4 cm probes, and 11.73 s for 5 cm probes. In Phase 3, the hand was slowed to rest over a short distance (0.15 cm for 2.5 cm probes, 0.15 cm for 4 cm probes, and 0.3 cm for 5 cm probe) along a minimum jerk trajectory, over a short duration (0.75 s for 2.5 cm probes, 0.75 s for 4 cm probes, and 1.5 s for 5 cm probes). Finally, an additional buffer period of 0.3 s was added after reaching the final displaced position, prior to the end of the probe trial. The total duration of the probe was therefore 7.67 s for 2.5 cm probes, 11.67 s for 4 cm probes, and 15.03 s for 5 cm probes.</p><p>Critically, as stated earlier, the participant was not provided position feedback during the postural probe. Instead, cursor feedback of hand position was frozen at the target. Therefore, at the end of the postural probe, there was a discrepancy between the location of the hand and the location of cursor feedback. To seamlessly reunite the hand with its cursor feedback without drawing the attention of the participant, we manipulated visual feedback during the following reaching trial; as the next reach was executed, we projected the cursor position onto the line connecting the frozen cursor position and the position of the next target. In this way, it appeared to the participant as if they were reaching perfectly straight between the start and target position. At the same time, we confined the motion of the hand to a straight line connecting its displaced position with that of the next target. When the hand entered the target, a small and brief force pulse was applied to move the hand to the center of the target at which point <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> feedback was reunited with the true hand position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Quantifying the null point and shape of the postural field</title><p>As the hand of the participant was moved by the robot during postural probe trials, the displacement of the hand was opposed by postural restoring forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mussa-Ivaldi et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shadmehr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Subjects (n = 27) were adapted to a CCW velocity-dependent force field. To measure the postural field, postural probes moved the hand in 1 of 12 directions (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°, 330°, and 345° with respect to the x-axis) while participants were distracted with a working memory task.</p><p>We measured the postural field before and after adaptation. Before adaptation, participants completed 3 blocks of trials, each separated by a short break. In each block, all 12 postural probe directions were visited a single time. The probe displacement was 2.5 cm for all probe directions. Postural probes were given on every 4<sup>th</sup> outward reaching movement. Therefore, participants completed a total of 288 baseline trials (3 blocks x 12 probes/block x 4 reaching movement pairs/probe x 2 movements/reaching movement pair). Outwards reaching movements of 10 cm were all performed directly away from the body.</p><p>Participants were then gradually adapted to a velocity-dependent force field. The field magnitude was decreased from 0 to −10 N⋅s/m in constant increments over the course of 65 outwards reaching trials (130 trials total). After this adaptation period, the postural field was re-measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). As before, all 12 probe directions were probed in a random order, three times. No breaks were provided in between blocks. We anticipated that the postural field would shift after adaptation to the force field. Therefore, we extended the probe displacement to 4 cm for probe angles of 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 315°, 330°, and 345°. Postural probes occurred at the same frequency as before adaptation for a total of 288 trials. To maintain participants in an adapted state, on all outwards reaching trials other than postural probe trials, a velocity-dependent perturbation was maintained at −10 N⋅s/m. Target-hold wells were applied to the final hand position during all outwards trials (with the exception of postural probe trials) during the holding period (1.5 s duration, with an addition 0.3–0.4 inter-trial-interval).</p><p>Our analysis focused on changes in the postural field due to adaptation. First, we looked for within-subject changes to the location of the null point of the field. Second, we looked for within-subject changes to the orientation and stiffness magnitude of the field. For visualization purposes, we constructed a two-dimensional postural field from the forces measured during probe trials using linear interpolation. To do this, along each probe direction we resampled forces in x and y spatially in intervals of approximately 0.1 cm. For each of the resampled restoring forces, we calculated the corresponding polar coordinates (i.e. the radius and angle). In polar coordinates, all x and y forces lied along a rectangular grid. We used bilinear interpolation along these polar coordinates to estimate the postural field within the space between the 12 probe angles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-10"><title>Measuring the relationship between holding forces and the null point of the postural field</title><p>We reasoned that the holding forces measured in our other experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) were potentially caused by a misalignment between the hand (fixed in the channel at the target) and the postural null point (somewhere displaced from the target). If this is true, we could gradually eliminate these forces if we displaced the hand toward its null point.</p><p>We recruited a set of subjects (n = 19) to test these predictions at several points during adaptation to a velocity-dependent force field. At regular intervals during adaptation, we inserted postural probe trials along 0°, with respect to the x-axis. This corresponded to the direction of the holding force. During the probe, participants were distracted with the working memory task. For the first 10 participants, we used 5 cm postural probe trials. For the last nine participants, we shortened the probe length to 4 cm. Here, we analyze only the first 4 cm of displacement to combine both versions of the experiment.</p><p>Before adaptation, we measured the postural forces a total of 10 times. Postural probes were inserted regularly on every 5<sup>th</sup> outward reach, within a baseline period of 100 trials (50 outwards and 50 backwards movements). Outwards reaching movements of 10 cm were all performed directly away from the body. Next, we adapted participants gradually to a CCW velocity-dependent force field, where we decreased the field magnitude from 0 to −10.5 N⋅s/m in constant increments over 175 outwards reaching trials (350 trials total). We measured moving forces, holding forces, and the response to the postural probe on every 5<sup>th</sup> outwards reaching movement.</p><p>We found that hand forces during the postural probe passed through a null point as the hand was displaced from its terminal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To determine the location of the null point of the arm on a trial-to-trial basis we fit a three-parameter exponential function to the hand forces as a function of hand displacement in the probe, and recorded its x-intercept. To do this, we first resampled subject forces spatially in increments of 0.05 cm. Next, to reduce noise inherent in the single-trial force measurements, we used a bootstrapping approach. On each trial, we randomly sampled subjects with replacement, calculated the mean postural force as a function of distance across the sample, and fit the exponential to this mean behavior. We repeated this process 2000 times, and used this distribution to estimate 95% confidence intervals around the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-11"><title>Measuring adaptation in the gain of integration</title><p>To maintain stability at the endpoint, the integrator must adapt as the reach controller adapts. For the oculomotor system, adaptation of the integrator occurs when there are consistent errors between the terminal position of the eye, and its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Optican and Miles, 1985</xref>). We speculated that such a mechanism might also adapt the gain of the reach integrator. To detect these errors, we considered the reach trajectories of participants as they adapted to velocity-dependent force fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We spatially aligned reach trajectories by subtracting off the terminal hand position. Next, we isolated the lateral component of the reach trajectory.</p><p>We observed that participants often exhibited deviations in their hand position as they attempted to stop their hand at the end of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, endpoint correction). To quantify the size of these errors, we measured the largest ‘positive’ deviation of the hand from its terminal position, after the hand exceeded 80% of its reach trajectory. On movements in which no such error occurred, we instead calculated the largest ‘negative’ deviation of the hand from its terminal position. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we highlight these errors for two example participants by temporally aligning reach trajectories to the point at which the hand exhibited the largest ‘positive’ deviation from its terminal position.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, we compare the magnitude and sign of the late trajectory deviations, to the gain of integration at the end of adaptation. To calculate the integration gain, we divided the median hold force by the median reach force integral, measured over 10 channel trials after the perturbation magnitude had plateaued (see horizontal line after CCW+ and CW+ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, bottom). Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, the integration gain was calculated by dividing the hold force by the reach force integral, either over the first one-third of CCW+/CW+ trials (for the FF early period) or the final 50% of CCW+/CW+ trials (for the FF late period). For the null period, we could not use this technique, as the mean reach force integral and the hold force were both nearly zero. Therefore, to calculate integration gain, we linearly regressed hold period force onto the integral of reach period force, and reported the slope of the regression line.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01NS078311, 1DP2NS083037, R01NS100066, 1U19NS104649, F31NS095706, and F32NS092350), the National Science Foundation (1723967), the Simons Foundation (SCGB#542957), the UK Medical Research Council (MR/P023967 and MR/K023012/1), and the Sheikh Khalifa Stroke Institute.

control and postural control of the arm. With a series of cleverly-designed behavioral experiments, the present study provides convincing evidence that the commands for holding the arm still depend on the integral of the motor commands that move the arm to the holding position. This new relationship has been shown in arm and finger movements, in monkeys and humans, and among stroke survivors. As the damage to descending cortical pathways spares this dependence between movement and posture, the postulated process of neutral integration might reside in subcortical areas. These new insights echo similar findings in eye movement control, suggesting a possible unifying principle for movement and posture control of different effectors. The study provides a new perspective for resolving the posture-movement paradox in the area of motor control. Furthermore, the findings will inspire researchers in motor learning (e.g., how can the integration function adapt to different situations?), neurophysiology (e.g., what are the neural underpinnings of proposed cortical and subcortical processing related to movement and posture, respectively?), brain-machine interface (e.g., what to decode from motor cortex at different phases of movement?), and medicine (e.g., a possible holistic view of movement and postural disorders among stroke survivors or individuals with dystonia).</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Postural control of arm and fingers through integration of movement commands&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The relationship between postural control and movement control has puzzled movement scientists for long. The current study proposes a novel model for limb motor control with a surprising linear correlation of motor commands during movement and the postural holding period. The study includes a broad set of experiments using different animal and human paradigms. When monkeys were moving their limb against gravity and a spring load, the authors found a linear correlation between EMG integral during movement and a change of average EMG amplitudes during the holding period. Consistent with the integration model, the authors found that the hand force measured by the force channel during reaching and during the hold period around the target conformed to the same correlation. Stroke survivors who had damage to the corticospinal tract showed a similar integration function, hinting that the integration of movement commands may happen in some unknown subcortical system.</p><p>Both reviewers find the study provides a broad range of evidence supporting the proposed integration model. The paper is well written, and the analyses are appropriate overall with a few exceptions. The major criticism includes 1) the data could be explained by alternative explanations that are less attractive, and 2) the utility of the model might be limited, but it has not been fully explained.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data from the two monkey experiments might have alternative explanations. The correlation between EMG integral and the difference in EMG between two hold periods might reflect biomechanical demands for moving and maintaining posture in a force field, as both reviewers pointed out. For moving against gravity in the vertical plane and moving against a spring force, the EMG activity for holding at the end posture is biomechanically determined by the end position, and the end position is determined by the muscle work (best characterized by EMG integral) during the movement. Thus, the integration function is expected, given only postural muscles are included for analysis. Similarly, reviewer 2 also pointed out that for moving against a spring load, different EMG magnitude will cause different displacement and lead to altered static force.</p><p>2) However, the EMG integral will only predict the EMG at the hold position if movement time is maintained constant. Reviewer 2 suggests to provide more data on this issue to address related questions, i.e., was movement time roughly constant? Was the integral relation less accurate for outlier trials?</p><p>3) Did movement-period EMG predict hold position and its EMG at the same time? If hold EMG was not correlated with position (force), what decoupled them? Variation in co-contraction? Variation in activity levels across redundant muscles?</p><p>4) Similarly, for ruling out the biomechanical explanation, reviewer 1 suggests performing a small experiment without force field, e.g., reaching towards horizontal targets with frictionless weight support. If the same integration function is found, the integration model will be more supported as a principal explanation for the relationship between movement control and postural control. As the paper is already lengthy with a variety of experiments, the authors might consider whether this suggested experiment can be skipped. If so, a full discussion about constraints and limitations of the current model, along with the additional analyses above, should be included in the revision.</p><p>5) The rationale of the force adaptation experiment is not clear.</p><p>6) Reviewer 2 realized that the object of having the partial return channels, the target-hold well, and gradual adaptation was to make the perturbation unnoticed to the subject. However, the purposes of these methodological designs were buried in Materials and methods. We thus suggest to explain it in the Results briefly.</p><p>7) Reviewer 1 pointed out that force integral or average force is equated to motor command by the authors without justification. Furthermore, the force measured by the force channel is perpendicular to the movement direction, while the propelling force for reaching is in the movement direction. Thus, the integration function only accounts for perpendicular deviations from the movement direction.</p><p>8) Currently, the integration model poses to be applicable to all movements. In a similar vein, reviewer 1 questioned whether the correlation between force integral and the holding force could be explained by a common positional deviation during and after the reach. We suggest explaining the rationale of data analysis and experimental design of the force field adaptation experiments, and/or making it clear at the outset that the model is only for countering positional deviations in a force field.</p><p>9) Related to the point 1 above, a discussion on how the proposed integration system of posture control could work in the real world is needed. Reviewer 2 pointed out that mass or moment of inertia changes on a moment-to-moment basis with limb posture during movement, and the impedance of the limb is also modulated when we interact with different objects. The changes in viscous or inertial loading affect the movement forces without affecting static/postural forces. These real-life situations are common, but they depart from the current contrived lab conditions and appear unpredictable by the current model. The authors must provide some plausible explanations for the utility of the current model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52507.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data from the two monkey experiments might have alternative explanations.

For gravity, the work should be proportional to displacement, and for a spring, the work should be proportional to the square of displacement. If work done by the muscles can be roughly approximated by the integral of muscle activity, then the correlations between moving and holding activity we observe might be a consequence of these biomechanical constraints.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we perform control analyses for both our reaching data (Figure 1) and finger movement data (Figure 2) to rule out each of these possibilities. First, we consider reaching movements. Here, we made use of the fact that the monkey performed movements to eight different directions. Two of these directions were entirely horizontal movements, and the other six directions contained a vertical component. If the relationship between hold activity and the integral of move activity was solely due to moving in the gravitational field, we would expect that the integration function would differ for these two classes of movements. However, this is not what we observed. The gain of integration was no different for horizontal movements in which little to no work is done against gravity, and vertical movements where much of the work is done against gravity (ANCOVA, movement type by moving EMG integral interaction effect on holding activity, F=0.37, p=0.54).</p><p>Therefore, it appears unlikely that the integration function we observed is solely caused by moving under the influence of gravity. We now have added this analysis to Figure 1.</p><p>We also considered reaching movements in humans with and without support of the arm against gravity. We discuss this comparison in point 4 below. Briefly, we found that integration was present with a gain that was indistinguishable for movements with and without weight support of the arm.</p><p>Next, we considered how biomechanical constraints may have impacted our analysis of finger movements in Figure 2. In the original manuscript, we noted that muscle activity during the hold periods was highly variable across trials, despite little trial-to-trial variability in the position of the finger. Nevertheless, as noted by the reviewers, it remains possible that trial-to-trial changes in the magnitude of the primary finger movement could have led to the trial-by-trial correlations in move and hold activity; movements with a larger displacement require more work (i.e., moving muscle activity) and terminate at a position with a larger spring force (necessitating more holding activity).</p><p>This alternate hypothesis, hinges on two relationships. One, trial-by-trial changes in hold position must correlate with trial-by-trial changes in hold EMG activity. Two, trial-by-trial changes in the finger displacement (i.e., movement size) must correlate with the integral of moving EMG activity. However, across the recorded muscles, both of these correlations were exceedingly weak. Variation in the final finger position accounted for less than 2% of the trial-to-trial variability in the final hold EMG activity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0107 ± 0.0041, mean ± SEM, across all muscles in both monkeys, individual regressions for each muscle). We now address this point in the Results section. And secondly, variations in finger displacement accounted for less than 1% of the trial-to-trial variability in the integral of moving EMG activity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.006 ± 0.0018, mean ± SEM, across all muscles in both monkeys, individual regressions for each muscle). We now address this point in the Results section.</p><p>For comparison, we re-evaluated the integration hypothesis. Here, we found that approximately 40% of the variance in the change in hold EMG activity was predicted by trial-by-trial changes in the integral of moving EMG activity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42 ± 0.031, mean ± SEM, across all muscles in both monkeys, individual regressions for each muscle).</p><p>Therefore, for both reaching movements and finger movements, differences in the physical constraints imposed by either gravity, or spring forces, did not appear to be viable alternative solutions to the integration hypothesis. We now discuss all of these control analyses in the figures and text of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) However, the EMG integral will only predict the EMG at the hold position if movement time is maintained constant. Reviewer 2 suggests to provide more data on this issue to address related questions, i.e., was movement time roughly constant? Was the integral relation less accurate for outlier trials?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted, time is another dimension along which integration can be tested. Unfortunately, for the finger movement data, movement time was carefully constrained in this tracking task. Trials with errors larger than 1.4° at any point in the movement were immediately aborted. This served to strongly constrain movement time and movement kinematics, so there are no outlier trials which can be analyzed to address the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><p>However, in our reaching experiment, movement time was less constrained. Although the monkeys tended to reach at a stereotypical speed, this speed fluctuated across sessions. Therefore, to test how time affected integration, for each movement direction, we split our data about the median movement speed. We collected all muscles recorded on slower movement sessions, and all muscles recorded on faster movement sessions. We performed separate regressions for each of these groups, and for each movement direction. The same integration gain was observed for both types of movements (two-sample t-test, p=0.30).</p><p>These results should be taken with some caution however. The duration of fast movements was roughly 350 ms (350.3 ± 11.1 ms, mean ± SEM) and the duration of slow movements roughly 450 ms (453.6 ± 4.9 ms, mean ± SEM); slower movements were only 30% slower than fast movements. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the integration gains reported here would extend to vastly different movement durations. But it does appear that the same integration gain applies across roughly 30% differences in movement duration. We now report this control analysis in Figure 1.</p><p>We also performed a similar analysis for our human reaching data. For each subject in the null period, we sorted their channel trial movements according to movement duration. Then we selected the two fastest reaches and two slowest reaches for each participant, and collapsed these into a distribution of fast movements (Figure 3, red dots at left) and a distribution of slow movements (Figure 3, black dots at left).</p><p>For each of these distributions we linearly regressed the change in hold forces onto the integral of reach forces. At right we show the 95% confidence intervals for the regression slope, i.e., the integration gain. Even though fast and slow movements differed by approximately 30% in duration (see middle inset, fast movement duration of 0.49 ± 0.05 sec and slow movement duration of 0.66 ± 0.05 sec, mean ± SD), we found no difference in the gain of integration (ANCOVA, movement type by move force integral interaction effect on hold force, F=0.007, p=0.935). We now report this control analysis in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Did movement-period EMG predict hold position and its EMG at the same time? If hold EMG was not correlated with position (force), what decoupled them? Variation in co-contraction? Variation in activity levels across redundant muscles?</p></disp-quote><p>As we noted in our response to point 1 above, we did not observe a correlation with either movement-period EMG or hold period EMG, and the associated hold displacements or positions. Generally, differences in hold position accounted for less than 2% of the variability in either hold period or move period EMG.</p><p>As noted by the reviewer, one possibility that could explain both the correlations between move and hold EMG, and the lack of dependence on hold position, is co-contraction. If on some trials, the finger was stiff and co-contracted its muscles, and on other trials less so, we may observe correlations between move period and hold period activity, without any relation to hold position. To change finger stiffness, agonist and antagonist pairs of muscles would exhibit correlated increases or decreases in activity. In other words, according to this hypothesis, we should be able to predict the hold period activity in one muscle not solely based on its move activity (as in the integration hypothesis) but also on the activity of simultaneously recorded muscles. To test this idea, we regressed hold period activity in each muscle onto the integral of move period EMG in other muscles. We found that roughly 10% of the variability in hold EMG could be explained by the integral of move activity of other muscles (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10 ± 0.02, mean ± SEM, across all muscles in both monkeys, individual regressions for each muscle-muscle pair).</p><p>For comparison, recall that the integral of move EMG predicted approximately 40% of the variance of hold activity in the same muscle. Therefore, while some of the variance in hold activity was indeed shared across the move activity of other muscles (consistent with co-contraction), move activity in a given muscle remained a much better predictor of hold activity in that same muscle (consistent with integration). We now note these points in the Results.</p><p>It is important to note that while finger movements were constrained to one degree of freedom using a narrow tube, it is likely that the true equilibrium position of the finger on any given trial, did not lie exactly along the constrained movement axis, but somewhere in three-dimensional space. In other words, like our reaching experiments in Figure 5, if the narrow tube were removed, the finger would likely have moved to a slightly different terminal position. This might explain why muscle activity only poorly correlated with the final position of the finger, even under the spring load. Therefore, under the integration hypothesis, we speculate that variability in activity during the finger movement would integrate to different levels of hold activity, thus leading to slight deviations in the final hold position. Such an interpretation is consistent with the trial-by-trial integration of natural movement variability we observe for reaching movements in Figure 3B and C. We describe this possible interpretation in the Discussion.</p><p>Taken together, our combined results from points 1, 2, and 3, suggest that while co-contraction and movement against spring-like forces can explain part of the observed relationship between moving and holding activity, the integration hypotheses remains the best descriptor of our primary findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, for ruling out the biomechanical explanation, reviewer 1 suggests performing a small experiment without force field, e.g., reaching towards horizontal targets with frictionless weight support. If the same integration function is found, the integration model will be more supported as a principal explanation for the relationship between movement control and postural control. As the paper is already lengthy with a variety of experiments, the authors might consider whether this suggested experiment can be skipped. If so, a full discussion about constraints and limitations of the current model, along with the additional analyses above, should be included in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We collected reaching data with and without arm support. We placed the arm on a frictionless air sled to support its weight for both our stroke patients and associated control participants (Figure 7). Consistent with our integration hypothesis, we found that the integration gain did not differ across the supported and unsupported conditions (p=0.90, see Figure 3).</p><p>Therefore, it does not appear that the correlations between moving and holding activity are a trivial consequence of biomechanical demands imposed by gravity. This analysis further supports our response to point 1 above, where we show no difference in the integration for vertical and horizontal reaching movements of the arm. We now address this important control in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The rationale of the force adaptation experiment is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important feedback. The integration hypothesis makes a more important prediction: if there is a change to the move commands, there should be a change in hold commands, even if the holding location remains the same. We used force fields as a means of testing this idea. By perturbing reaching movements with force fields our goal was to bias the moving commands in different directions through the process of adaptation. If holding commands are computed from the moving commands, biases in moving forces should lead to changes in holding commands even though (1) we never perturbed the holding commands and (2) the holding position was invariant throughout the entire process of adaptation. In this way, we feel that our data in Figures 3-7 support a more causal role of movement integration in the control of holding still.</p><p>We appreciate that this rationale was not well-motivated in the text. We have revised the subsection “Hold period activity for finger movements” to better explain our thought process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewer 2 realized that the object of having the partial return channels, the target-hold well, and gradual adaptation was to make the perturbation unnoticed to the subject. However, the purposes of these methodological designs were buried in Materials and methods. We thus suggest to explain it in the Results briefly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful review of our methods. We agree that we could make these more apparent in the main text. The reason we made these methodological choices was not to mask adaptation per se (though it does help in that regard), but instead to prevent the process of reach adaptation from impacting periods of holding still. Because our goal was to adapt moving commands, without perturbing holding commands, we attempted to prevent our perturbations and assays from impacting the period of holding still. The three constructs identified by the reviewer were intended to do just that.</p><p>1) We used the target-hold well (we now use this terminology in place of endpoint clamp to distinguish it from channel trials) to prevent subject holding forces from moving the hand off the target, thereby resulting in errors in the process of holding still.</p><p>2) At the end of the hold period, participants actively reached back to the start position. We realized that suddenly removing the target-hold well prior to this return reach could also cause a sudden displacement of the hand (for the same reason as point 1 above). Therefore, we used a partial channel trial for the return movement, so that the hand would continue to be supported in the perpendicular direction as the subject transitioned from holding at the target to reaching back to the start.</p><p>3) Finally, we used gradual adaptation to keep errors small throughout training. Large feedback responses to within-movement errors could lead to more errors in the stabilization of the hand within the target at the endpoint.</p><p>We now describe these points more clearly in the rationale for our force field experiments in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Reviewer 1 pointed out that force integral or average force is equated to motor command by the authors without justification. Furthermore, the force measured by the force channel is perpendicular to the movement direction, while the propelling force for reaching is in the movement direction. Thus, the integration function only accounts for perpendicular deviations from the movement direction.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s criticism is well-taken. Unlike our non-human primate experiments, we did not record EMG during our human experiments. Instead, we measured changes in the forces that participants exerted against the handle. These forces served as a low-dimensional abstraction of the motor commands sent to the arm muscles. Therefore, the integral of reach force serves as a rough kinetic analogue of the integral of moving EMG activity (Figures 1 and 2). The fact that EMG signals and forces vary roughly linearly with one another, might explain why the gain for EMG integration was similar to that of force integration.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52507-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Critically, we designed our perturbations so that the learning dimension was orthogonal to the primary movement direction – the robot forces were perpendicular to the trajectory of the hand. This way, we could cleanly isolate the component of the motor commands that varied in response to the perturbation, from the motor commands responsible for the primary movement.</p><p>Because adaptation occurred along the perpendicular axis, this dimension served as the principal dimension along which to evaluate the integration hypothesis. In other words, because participants modified their perpendicular forces, but not their parallel forces, we would expect only changes to the holding commands along the perpendicular direction. In support of this idea, when we measured how reach adaptation altered the postural field in Figure 5, we observed that the null point of the postural field shifted along the perpendicular axis exclusively, consistent with our integration hypothesis.</p><p>Another benefit of using the force integral measure, was that it provided a signed measure to test if motor commands that pushed the arm left (i.e., reaching forces to the left) canceled out the motor commands that pushed the arm right (i.e., reaching forces to the right), in a manner consistent with integration. We tested this idea with our experiment in Figure 4.</p><p>We now more clearly state that our force measurements describe a component of the total motor command (the component along the adaptation direction). While we do not feel that our integration hypothesis solely accounts for this perpendicular dimension (i.e., we observe integration in the entire EMG signal for reaching and finger movements in Figures 1 and 2), we now note in our Discussion that measurement of EMG during the process of reach adaptation would provide a means of further testing the integration model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Currently, the integration model poses to be applicable to all movements. In a similar vein, reviewer 1 questioned whether the correlation between force integral and the holding force could be explained by a common positional deviation during and after the reach. We suggest explaining the rationale of data analysis and experimental design of the force field adaptation experiments, and/or making it clear at the outset that the model is only for countering positional deviations in a force field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting this concern. Recall that moving and holding forces are only measured on channel trials, where the motion of the hand deviates by less than 1 mm from a straight path connecting the start and target position (see example trajectories in Figure 3A). Therefore, perpendicular deviations on channel trials are rather small (i.e., &lt;1% of the total hand displacement from start to target). Furthermore, these deviations are not the result of the force field, but rather the subject’s own forces. Therefore, if holding forces arise to counteract positional deviations, it is entirely counterproductive to produce them on the channel trials (where we measure such forces).</p><p>With that said, in line with the reviewer’s comment, it is important to consider the possibility that holding forces arise from a process of adaptation driven by perpendicular deviations that occur on the intervening force field trials. In other words, perhaps the small positional deviations on the gradual force field trials drive a process of adaptation in both moving and holding forces, thus leading to the observed correlations.</p><p>Fortunately, we can be confident that this possibility does not explain our results. Recall that in addition to our force field experiments, we also describe the relationship between moving and holding forces on channel trials interspersed within null field periods where there were never any perturbations (Figure 3B, C, Figure 7C, F left column, and H). We specifically measured forces during these periods to establish that the correlations between moving and holding forces are present for normal reaching movements that were never perturbed by a force field. Therefore, common positional deviations related to the force field did not cause the observed correlations between moving and holding forces. And by extension, it is not true that our model applies only for countering positional deviations in a force field. We re-emphasize this point in the Results section.</p><p>With that said, it does appear that positional deviations do lead to adaptation of postural control. However, this adaptation process acts to eliminate the holding forces, rather than increase them. We describe this in much more detail in point 9 below and in Figure 6 of the revised manuscript. In brief, positional errors that occur near the endpoint of the reaching movement require a correction that is oriented opposite to the observed holding forces. For this reason, the occurrence of these errors teaches the integrator to reduce its gain, thus leading to smaller holding forces. Please see point 9 below for a more comprehensive discussion.</p><p>Overall, we hope that our revisions in the subsection “Hold period activity for finger movements” better explain the rationale of data analysis and experimental design of the force field adaptation experiments, as suggested. And in addition, we hope our addition of Figure 6 better address the relationship between positional errors and the process of neural integration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Related to the point 1 above, a discussion on how the proposed integration system of posture control could work in the real world is needed. Reviewer 2 pointed out that mass or moment of inertia changes on a moment-to-moment basis with limb posture during movement, and the impedance of the limb is also modulated when we interact with different objects. The changes in viscous or inertial loading affect the movement forces without affecting static/postural forces. These real-life situations are common, but they depart from the current contrived lab conditions and appear unpredictable by the current model. The authors must provide some plausible explanations for the utility of the current model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now significantly revised our Discussion section to better address the role of the integrator in the larger context of postural control. We feel that our data support the idea that movements are encoded by the cortex and then integrated over time by an unknown subcortical area. This subcortical area then generates the commands required to stabilize the arm, holding it still after movement ceases.</p><p>One of the major advantages of this control scheme is that this hypothetical neural integration pathway would provide a feedforward mechanism by which reach commands could be used to predict the hold commands required to stabilize the terminal position of the arm, overcoming the instabilities that would arise from delays in sensory feedback.</p><p>There are a number of predictions that must be true if such a feedforward integration system were to maintain endpoint stability in real world scenarios. As noted by the reviewers, motor commands required to move the arm to a target position are not fixed, but vary across a range of conditions: (1) interactions between the arm and external objects, (2) interaction torques that arise when the body is in motion, and (3) even over time as our bodies grow. We know that the move system continuously adapts to these novel dynamics. A similar process of adaptation would also be required of the neural integrator.</p><p>In fact, this point is well-illustrated by our data. Consider the puzzling scenario presented in Figure 5 of the manuscript. In the presence of a force field, the reach controller readily adapts and changes the reach forces in order to steer the hand to the target. However, downstream of the reach controller, changes to the reach forces are integrated and cause the hold system to program an entirely different null position, creating a discrepancy. This implies that postural stability will be compromised in the face of an adapting reach controller.</p><p>To solve this problem, the integrator must also be adaptive: the integration function must change when there is an error between its current output and the desired movement endpoint (Figure 6A). In the oculomotor system, adaptation of the integrator is driven by consistent errors between the terminal eye position and the location of the target (Optican and Miles, 1985). In the revised manuscript, we report a similar mechanism by which the reach integrator also appears to adapt. We address this in a new figure added to the manuscript, Figure 6.</p><p>In Figure 6, we demonstrate that reach trajectories during adaptation to the gradual force field exhibit two different types of errors (Figure 6B). The first error comes midway through the movement. This “negative” error occurs due to incomplete compensation for the force field; this is the error that drives the process of reach adaptation. The second error comes late in the movement, just before the hand stops within the target. This “positive” deviation (labeled endpoint correction in Figure 6B) occurs in the direction opposite the shift in null point in Figure 5. Therefore, this deviation could serve as an error signal for adaptation of the neural integrator.</p><p>In support of this idea, we observed that individuals with larger perpendicular errors near the end of the movement (x-axis in D) also exhibited a smaller integration gain (y-axis in D; also see the absent hold forces in C for the subject with larger endpoint errors in B). Here, the errors were measured during the process of adaptation. The gain was measured at the end of adaptation. Therefore, about 40% of the variance in the final integration gain was explained by differences in perpendicular errors near the end of movement. If these changes in integration gain were driven by a gradual learning process, we would expect that the integration gain should change during the adaptation period, as errors are experienced repeatedly. To test this idea, we measured the integration gain at several points during the experiment. Indeed, as time progressed, the gain of integration decreased (repeated measures ANOVA, F=12.60, p&lt;0.001). Critically, the integration gain was no different between the null field period and the initial part of adaptation (Figure 6E, post-hoc comparison, p=0.88). In other words, initially, the forces produced to counteract the force field were not integrated differently than the forces that arose from natural movement variability in the null field period. However, later in adaptation, the integration gain decreased (Figure 6E, post-hoc comparison, p&lt;0.001), as late positional deviations were repeatedly encountered on force field trials.</p><p>Altogether, these data suggest that Equation 2 alone cannot predict the magnitude of holding forces. The gain of integration changes over time as the postural controller encounters errors between the desired holding location and the output of the putative integrator. This process of adaptation would be necessary to maintain integration accuracy with dynamical changes to the arm. We describe these new experiments and analysis in the Results and Materials and methods sections. In addition, we relate our proposed mechanism of adaptation to that observed for the adaptation of the oculomotor integrator in the Results.</p><p>In our Discussion, we emphasize how this adaptation mechanism is critical for the utility of the integrator in real world scenarios (Results). In addition, we re-emphasize that the control of posture is not a task that would be handled by the neural integrator alone. There are a number of layered controllers that together, would provide for more robust control of endpoint stability. These include visual corrective systems in the cortex, and proprioceptive controllers in the spinal cord and cortex. We describe these ideas in the Results and Discussion sections, and relate them to our knowledge about the control of head movements, which we know both uses a neural integrator in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and a separate proprioceptive controller.</p><p>We hope that our changes to the manuscript (Results) more clearly address the utility of the proposed model, and provide a better description for how the integration system may fit into the larger context of postural control.</p></body></sub-article></article>
