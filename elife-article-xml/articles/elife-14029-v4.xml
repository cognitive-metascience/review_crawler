halts mitotic exit upon spindle mis-orientation. Here, we monitored the interaction between SPB proteins and the SPOC component Bfa1 by FRET microscopy. We show that Bfa1 binds to the scaffold-protein Nud1 and the γ-tubulin receptor Spc72. Spindle misalignment specifically disrupts Bfa1-Spc72 interaction by a mechanism that requires the 14-3-3-family protein Bmh1 and the MARK/PAR-kinase Kin4. Dissociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 prevents the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by the polo-like kinase Cdc5. We propose Spc72 as a regulatory hub that coordinates the activity of Kin4 and Cdc5 towards Bfa1. In addition, analysis of <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells shows that a mitotic-exit-promoting dominant signal, which is triggered upon elongation of the spindle into the bud, overrides the SPOC. Our data reinforce the importance of daughter-cell-associated factors and centrosome-based regulations in mitotic exit and SPOC control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14029.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14029.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14029.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A cell must duplicate its genetic material and then separate the two copies before it divides. This process is carefully controlled so that each new cell receives an identical set of chromosomes after cell division. In budding yeast, new daughter cells grow as a bud on the side a larger mother cell and are eventually pinched off.</p><p>A surveillance mechanism in budding yeast monitors the placement of the molecular machine (called the spindle) that separates the copies of the chromosomes. This mechanism then stops the cell from dividing if the spindle is not positioned correctly. Many of the components of this surveillance mechanism – which is called the spindle position checkpoint – associate with structures at the ends of the spindle. However, it was not clear how these components do this and how it helps them to check if the spindle is positioned correctly.</p><p>Now, Gryaznova, Caydasi et al. have used a technique called FRET to answer these questions for an important component of the spindle position checkpoint, a protein called Bfa1. The main advantage of FRET is that it can be used to monitor changes in protein-protein interactions in living cells. This approach identified two proteins that provide sites for Bfa1 to bind to at the ends of the spindle. The experiments also showed that Bfa1 specifically detaches from one of these proteins (called Spc72) when the spindle position checkpoint is activated. This action keeps Bfa1 (and therefore the spindle position checkpoint) active, which in turn stops the cell from starting to divide.</p><p>Further experiments then showed that Spc72 acts like a regulatory hub that controls Bfa1’s activity. This allows an as-yet unidentified mechanism to coordinate cell division with the position of the spindle. The findings of Gryaznova, Caydasi et al. also suggest that unknown factors switch off the spindle position checkpoint when the spindle is correctly positioned to allow the cell to divide. Future work could now aim to identify the mechanism and the unknown factors. Finally, in a related study, Falk et al. show that the spindle position checkpoint is inactivated when one end of the spindle is moved out of the mother cell and into the bud.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14029.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14029.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>checkpoint</kwd><kwd>centrosome/spindle pole body</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PE1883-1/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koca Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Gislene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PE1883-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Gislene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Daughter-cell-associated factors and centrosome-based regulation is important in mitotic exit and spindle position checkpoint control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alongside their canonical role as microtubule organizing centers, centrosomes of metazoans or spindle pole bodies (SPBs, the functional equivalent of the centrosome) of fungi modulate eukaryotic cell division by serving as signaling centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arquint et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2015</xref>). In budding yeast, the SPB is associated with components of two linked pathways: the mitotic exit network (MEN) and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The MEN drives mitotic exit (transition from M-G1 phase) after extension of the anaphase spindle into the daughter cell body. The SPOC is a surveillance mechanism that monitors orientation of the mitotic spindle. The SPOC prevents M-G1 transition when the spindle fails to align along the mother to daughter axis and so is unable to deliver one nucleus into the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloecher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muhua et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>). SPOC activation inhibits the MEN.</p><p>SPBs are embedded in the nuclear envelope throughout the cell cycle and are composed of three distinct layers (inner, central and outer plaques) that are named according to their position with respect to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</xref>). SPOC and MEN proteins associate with the cytoplasmic side (outer plaque) of the SPBs, where cytoplasmic microtubules are nucleated. Within this outer plaque, the transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) family protein Spc72 (the yeast homolog of CDK5RAP2) anchors the γ-tubulin small complexes that nucleate cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Usui et al., 2003</xref>). Nud1 (the yeast homolog of Centriolin) links Spc72 to the central layer of the SPB through Cnm67 - another SPB core protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brachat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 1999</xref>). Nud1 also serves as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of MEN kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rock and Amon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The key element of SPOC is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex composed of the GAP Bub2 and its binding partner Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). The GAP-complex inhibits the GTPase Tem1, whose activation would otherwise trigger the MEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scarfone and Piatti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). This cell cycle arrest provides extra time to enable the cell to correctly align its spindle along the mother-to-daughter cell axis. Loss of SPOC function in cells with misaligned spindles leads to multi-nucleation and anucleation, as cells undergo mitotic exit and cytokinesis irrespective of whether one nucleus has migrated into the daughter cell or not.</p><p>The two components of the bi-partite Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex localize interdependently at the SPB outer plaque throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2001</xref>). During normal spindle alignment, the Bfa1-Bub2 complex is unequally distributed between the two SPBs, to predominantly associate with the SPB that is directed towards the daughter cell (dSPB) (asymmetric localization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fraschini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2001</xref>). As long as the spindle is correctly positioned, Bfa1-Bub2 remains stably bound to the dSPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). As soon as the anaphase spindle moves into the daughter cell compartment, Bfa1 is inactivated by the conserved polo-like kinase Cdc5 that inhibits Bfa1-Bub2 GAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Elledge, 2002</xref>). Upon spindle misalignment, the MARK/PAR family kinase Kin4 is recruited to the Spc72 component of both SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 at SPBs converts the asymmetric and stable SPB localization of Bfa1-Bub2 into a symmetric (same amount on each SPB) and dynamic association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). Kin4 also reduces the levels of SPB-bound Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). These drastic changes in Bfa1-Bub2 SPB localization are essential for SPOC function and require binding of the 14-3-3 family protein Bmh1 to Bfa1 previously phosphorylated by Kin4 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caydasi et al., 2014</xref>). Although, it is known that Kin4/Bmh1 pathway alters Bfa1-Bub2 association with the SPBs to engage the SPOC, some important questions remain unanswered: How is the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex recruited to the SPB outer plaque? How does Bfa1-Bub2 association with the SPB respond to spindle misalignment? Which SPB pool of Bfa1 is regulated by Kin4 and Bmh1?</p><p>Here, we have used acceptor photobleaching Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) to analyze the interaction between Bfa1-Bub2 and structural components of SPBs. Our data reveal that, in an unperturbed mitosis Bfa1 C-terminus associated with the C-termini of two components of the SPB outer layer, Nud1 and Spc72. SPOC activation specifically disrupted the interaction of Bfa1 with the microtubule linker Spc72 but not with the MEN-scaffolding protein Nud1. The remodeling of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction in response to spindle misalignment required Kin4 and Bmh1. We propose a model in which the Kin4/Bmh1 pathway disturbs the interaction between Bfa1 and Spc72 to prevent the inhibition of the GAP complex by Cdc5. This step is essential for SPOC function and propagates the SPOC signal throughout both cell compartments. Cells lacking <italic>SPC72</italic> were SPOC proficient. However, after prolonged mitotic arrest, we observed that <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells frequently became binucleated due to SPOC slippage. In binucleated <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells that possessed two misaligned spindles, re-alignment of only one of the two spindles was sufficient to silence the SPOC and promote mitotic exit irrespective of the presence of one mis-placed nucleus. The dominant nature of this impact of one spindle over the other suggests that there is a MEN activating and/or SPOC inhibitory signal that is released upon the passage of one SPB into the bud. These findings highlight both the importance of local regulation at the SPB for SPOC integrity and the key contribution of a daughter-specific mechanism that triggers MEN activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acceptor photobleaching FRET identifies protein-protein interactions at the SPB</title><p>We employed acceptor photobleaching FRET to assess where Bfa1-Bub2 is located at SPBs. In this technique, protein-protein proximities are determined by the energy transfer between protein pairs labeled with fluorescent FRET donor and acceptor tags. In contrast to the conventional FRET detection, which is based on acceptor emission measurements (i.e., sensitized emission FRET), the acceptor photobleaching FRET monitors the increase in donor fluorescence upon photobleaching of the acceptor (i.e., donor de-quenching) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Llopis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wouters and Bastiaens, 2001</xref>). The proportionate increase in the donor fluorescence intensity after photobleaching of the acceptor directly yields the apparent FRET efficiency (E<sub>FRET</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karpova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kentner and Sourjik, 2009</xref>), which is further corrected for the unspecific signal observed in the donor-only sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Detection of this type of FRET signal is more straightforward and more robust than the sensitized emission measurements of FRET that demands multiple corrections for the spectral crosstalk between donor and acceptor fluorophores.</p><p>We optimized the bleaching and imaging parameters for acceptor photobleaching FRET by using resident structural SPB proteins as reference associations. The topology of the core SPB proteins including Spc42, Cnm67 and Spc110 has been previously defined by sensitized emission FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). Based on this analysis, we chose the FRET pairs of Spc42-Cnm67 and Spc110-Cnm67 as a molecule pair that interacted and a molecule pair that did not interact, respectively. As fluorophores, we used monomeric Turquoise (mTUR, donor) and enhanced YFP (EYFP, acceptor). In each case the fluorophore was fused to the C-terminus of each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goedhart et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muller et al., 2005</xref>), the acceptor photobleaching FRET technique yielded a positive FRET interaction between Spc42-mTUR and Cnm67-EYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, 14% mean FRET efficiency in the donor-acceptor pair), while no FRET was detected for the Spc110-mTUR and Cnm67-EYFP pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In order to estimate the maximum FRET efficiency that could be obtained for the mTUR-EYFP fluorophore pair at the SPB in our experimental system, we constructed a tandem tag composed of EYFP and mTUR fused to Bfa1. Bfa1-EYFP-mTUR yielded a FRET value of 26% at SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), to define the maximum value that can be measured for this particular donor-acceptor pair (mTUR-EYFP). We could however detect no FRET in the cytoplasm using the chimeric Bfa1-mTUR-YFP tandem pair (data not shown), indicating that the concentration of Bfa1 in the cytoplasm sits below our FRET detection limit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FRET analysis reveals a close juxtaposition between Bfa1 and both Spc72 and Nud1 at the SPB outer plaque</title><p>Immuno-electron microscopy has established that Bfa1-Bub2 localize to the outer plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore analyzed the juxtaposition of Bfa1-Bub2 to SPB outer plaque structural proteins Nud1, Spc72 and Cnm67. C-terminal tagging of Nud1, Spc72 and Cnm67 with fluorescent proteins did not affect their functionality in microtubule organization, as no defect in nuclear migration and positioning was observed in strains encoding tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grava et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Next, we constructed chromosomally integrated C- or N-terminal fusions of <italic>BFA1</italic> or <italic>BUB2</italic> with <italic>mTUR</italic> or <italic>EYFP</italic> at their respective endogenous loci.

Pairing Bfa1-EYFP with Nud1-mTUR or Spc72-mTUR yielded a FRET signal, whereas no FRET was detected between Bfa1-EYFP and Cnm67-mTUR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar FRET efficiencies were measured in metaphase- and anaphase-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Unlike Bfa1, mTUR-Bub2 did not display any FRET when paired with Nud1-EYFP or Spc72-EYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, the mTUR-Bub2 and Bfa1-EYFP combination generated a FRET signal at SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data show that the C-terminus of Bfa1 resides in close proximity to the C-termini of both Nud1 and Spc72 at SPBs.

To determine whether Bfa1 also directly interacts with Spc72, we used bacterially purified Bfa1 fused to maltose binding protein (MBP-Bfa1), full length Spc72 tagged with glutathione-binding protein (GST) (GST-Spc72) and a C-terminal truncated fragment of Spc72 (codons 231–622) tagged with 6 histidines (6His-Spc72-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The C-terminal 391 amino acids of Spc72 were sufficient to confer this interaction, as 6His-Spc72-C associated with MBP-Bfa1 but not to MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4).

This behavior is referred to as asymmetric Bfa1 localization. We asked whether differential association of Bfa1 with Nud1 and Spc72 at the two SPBs explains this asymmetric accumulation of Bfa1. To test this hypothesis, we compared FRET for Bfa1-Nud1 and Bfa1-Spc72 pairs at the dSPB and mSPB in metaphase arrested cells where Bfa1 predominately associates with dSPB and is only weakly detectable on the mSPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). The metaphase arrest was achieved through the depletion of the anaphase promoting complex regulatory subunit Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shirayama et al., 1999</xref>). The levels of FRET between Bfa1-Nud1 or Bfa1-Spc72 were similar at the mSPB and dSPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). This indicates that Bfa1 is in close proximity with Nud1 and Spc72 on both SPBs.

In cells lacking <italic>BMH1</italic>, Bfa1 remains asymmetrically and stably associated with SPBs, even when Kin4 phosphorylates Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caydasi et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore proposed that Bmh1 would be required to break the Bfa1-Spc72 interaction. To test this notion, we compared the FRET efficiency between Bfa1 and Spc72 when Kin4 was overproduced in wild type and in <italic>bmh1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Kin4 overexpression in the presence of <italic>BMH1</italic> greatly decreased the FRET efficiency of the Bfa1-Spc72 pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This was not the case in <italic>bmh1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Deletion of <italic>BMH1</italic> did not influence the FRET efficiency of Nud1–Bfa1 pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the interaction between Bfa1 and Spc72 is lost upon SPOC activation, we analyzed the FRET efficiencies of Bfa1-Nud1 and Bfa1-Spc72 in cells with correctly and incorrectly positioned anaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Spindle position had no impact upon FRET between Bfa1 and Nud1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, spindle misalignment reduced the FRET efficiency of the Bfa1-Spc72 pair to the level seen in the donor-only control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the absence of <italic>KIN4</italic>, however, the FRET between Bfa1 and Spc72 persisted irrespective of spindle position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Together, these data show that, upon spindle misalignment, Kin4, with the assistance of Bmh1, rearranges Bfa1 molecules on the SPB by specifically influencing the Bfa1-Spc72 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Bfa1-SPB binding in the absence of Spc72</title><p>Our FRET data shows that SPOC activation specifically interrupts Bfa1 association with Spc72 but not with Nud1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). We therefore asked whether there were two separate pools of Bfa1, one that binds Spc72 and another Nud1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–i</xref>) or whether Bfa1 molecules bind both Spc72 and Nud1 simultaneously to form a single pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-ii</xref>). In the scenario where two individual Bfa1 pools exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–i</xref>), Spc72 should recruit the majority of Bfa1 to SPBs because SPB-bound Bfa1 levels fall drastically upon spindle misalignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). This coincides well with the loss of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction observed by FRET. Therefore, if two separate Spc72- and Nud1-bound Bfa1 pools exist, less Bfa1 would bind to SPBs in the absence of <italic>SPC72</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–i</xref>). We therefore analyzed Bfa1 localization in cells lacking <italic>SPC72</italic>. For this analysis, we used the W303 strain background in which <italic>SPC72</italic> is not essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoepfner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soues and Adams, 1998</xref>) yet Bfa1-Bub2 SPB binding and phospho-regulation is the same as in S288C background where <italic>SPC72</italic> is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>).

After photobleaching, Bfa1-GFP failed to recover at SPBs in cells with normally aligned anaphase spindles in the presence of <italic>SPC72</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This confirms the previously reported immobile pool of Bfa1 at the dSPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). Cells lacking <italic>SPC72</italic> also recruited Bfa1-GFP stably to the dSPB when the anaphase spindle was correctly aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, Bfa1 interaction with Nud1 is stable throughout anaphase when spindle is correctly aligned, independently of Spc72. Next, we examined cells with misaligned spindles. Consistent with previous data, in the presence of <italic>SPC72</italic>, Bfa1 was highly dynamic at both SPBs with a half recovery time of ~ 11 s during spindle misalignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). The half recovery time of Bfa1 was 6 times longer in <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells than in <italic>SPC72</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>). These data suggest that Spc72 regulates the mode of Bfa1 association with Nud1 when the spindle is mis-positioned.</p><p>Together, our data favor a model in which Bfa1 molecules simultaneously associate with Nud1 and Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, ii</xref>).

This is consistent with previous reports that Spc72 recruits Kin4 to SPBs and that Kin4 SPB binding is necessary for its function in SPOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>).

As Spc72-Bfa1 interaction is disrupted during the SPOC arrest, we reasoned that the disassociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 might be required to prevent the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5. To test this hypothesis, we constructed cells bearing endogenous <italic>SPC72</italic> C-terminally fused with the GFP-binding protein (GBP). GBP efficiently binds GFP or GFP tagged proteins in human and yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>). Spc72-GBP constitutively recruited Bfa1-GFP to both SPBs regardless of the spindle position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Emphasizing the importance of Spc72-Bfa1 disengagement for SPOC, coexistence of Bfa1-GFP and Spc72-GBP in the same cell resulted in SPOC failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We further analyzed the phosphorylation profile of Bfa1-GFP in these cells. In the presence of Spc72-GBP, Bfa1-GFP accumulated hyper-phosphorylated forms, which disappeared upon depletion of Cdc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lanes 3 ,4 and 5).

To understand why SPOC deficient phenotypes accumulated in these populations, we analyzed the behavior of <italic>spc72∆ GFP-TUB1</italic> cells by live cell imaging in greater detail. We monitored the time from anaphase onset until spindle re-alignment. In a <italic>kar9∆</italic> population most of the cells reoriented their spindle in less than 50 min after anaphase onset. In contrast, spindle mis-orientation persisted for longer than 50 min in the majority of <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The spindles of <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells that remained arrested in anaphase for an extended period (&gt; 50 min) broke down as a consequence of mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). These cells re-entered the cell cycle to become binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This indicated that the SPOC was unable to maintain an indefinite cell cycle arrest in this population of cells. Interestingly, in the majority of binucleated cells that entered anaphase (10 out of 15 cells), one spindle remained in the mother cell compartment while the second entered the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, upper panel). In all such cells, the mother-bud oriented spindle and the misoriented spindle disassembled simultaneously, as the cells exited mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). This behavior was not due to binucleation per se, because cells harboring two mis-oriented spindles remained arrested in late anaphase with intact anaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, lower panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This indicates that satisfaction of the SPOC by the correctly aligned spindle triggers a dominant signal that silences or bypasses the SPOC throughout the cell. This signal is likely to be a diffusible signal as the breakdown of the correctly aligned and misaligned nuclei occurs simultaneously.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14029.039</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>SPOC slippage in <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells (<bold>A</bold>) Population analysis of <italic>GFP-TUB1 kar9</italic>∆ and <italic>GFP-TUB1 spc72</italic>∆ cells.</title><p>Percentage of cells with single or multiple spindles is indicated in the left panel.

One hallmark of SPOC activation is the drastic loss of Bfa1-Bub2 molecules from one of the two SPBs upon spindle mis-positioning. This change is essential for SPOC function and is thought to arise from a decrease in Bfa1-Bub2 residence time at SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). In this study, we investigated how Bfa1-Bub2 interacts with SPBs by FRET microscopy. Our findings unraveled a novel molecular rearrangement of SPOC proteins at SPBs that is essential for SPOC function. In addition, the analysis of binucleated cells showed that the SPOC is switched off as soon as one spindle enters the bud. This indicates the generation of a dominant and diffusible signal that promotes mitotic exit and SPOC silencing upon checkpoint satisfaction.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SPOC activation disturbs Bfa1-Spc72 interaction through Kin4/Bmh1 branch of the SPOC</title><p>A positive FRET between two fluorophores only occurs when the fluorophores are in close apposition (&lt; 10 nm). This indicates that the fluorophore-fused proteins are in close proximity and likely to physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zal and Gascoigne, 2004</xref>). Interactions between SPB core components have been previously mapped by conventional FRET based on acceptor emission measurements (sensitized emission FRET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). In comparison to sensitized emission FRET, acceptor photobleaching FRET yielded more robust measurements for Bfa1-Bub2 SPB interactions. Our FRET data show that the C-terminal domain of Bfa1 resides in close proximity to the C-termini of the γ-tubulin receptor protein Spc72 and the MEN scaffold protein Nud1 at the SPB outer plaque. Direct physical interaction of Nud1 and Bfa1 was already shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>). In vitro binding assays performed here established that Bfa1 also associates with Spc72. Thus, FRET interactions between Bfa1-Nud1 and Bfa1-Spc72 most likely reflect physical interactions at SPBs in vivo. C-terminally tagged Bfa1 also yielded positive FRET with N-terminally tagged Bub2 at SPBs, which is in agreement with the fact that Bfa1 and Bub2 bind to SPBs as a bipartite complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). We could not detect FRET between the N-terminally tagged Bub2 and Nud1 (or Spc72). However we cannot exclude the possibility that Bub2 may interact with Nud1 or Spc72 by other means.</p><p>We observed loss of Bfa1-Spc72 (but not Bfa1-Nud1) FRET upon SPOC activation. The loss of FRET signal between Bfa1 and Spc72 might indicate the physical separation of the two proteins or only the separation of the fluorophores coupled to Bfa1 and Spc72 C-termini. Forced binding of Bfa1 to Spc72 resulted in loss of SPOC activity, suggesting that dissociation of the two proteins is important for checkpoint functioning. Our data show that Kin4 kinase and the 14-3-3 protein Bmh1 are involved in this process. Loss of Bfa1-Spc72 FRET interaction during spindle misalignment was only observed in <italic>KIN4</italic> but not in <italic>kin4</italic>∆ cells. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>KIN4</italic> abolished the FRET signal between Bfa1 and Spc72 in cells with normal aligned anaphase spindles in a Bmh1-dependent manner. We propose that the remodeling of Bfa1-SPB binding is triggered by Kin4 phosphorylation of Bfa1. As a direct consequence of this phosphorylation, Bmh1 binds to Bfa1 and breaks Bfa1-Spc72 proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caydasi et al., 2014</xref>). The reorganization of Bfa1-SPB binding may result from a possible Bfa1 conformational change triggered by recruitment of Bmh1 to Kin4 phosphorylated Bfa1. Such regulation may resemble the conformational change that Mad2 undergoes upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mapelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mapelli and Musacchio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sironi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The γ-tubulin complex receptor Spc72 coordinates activation and inhibition of Bfa1-Bub2</title><p>Spc72 has been proposed to constitute a part of the SPOC mechanism that senses cytoplasmic microtubule failure and recruits Kin4 to SPBs in response to this defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells were SPOC proficient even though Kin4 neither localized at SPBs nor phosphorylated Bfa1. However, Cdc5-dependent hyper-phosphorylation of Bfa1, which inactivates the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geymonat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2001</xref>), was greatly reduced in the absence of <italic>SPC72</italic>. The loss of Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 in the absence of Spc72 probably explains why the SPOC is still functional in these cells despite the lack of Kin4 phosphorylation of Bfa1. Given that Cdc5 interacts with Spc72 and phosphorylates Bfa1 at the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archambault and Glover, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Snead et al., 2007</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that Cdc5 only phosphorylates Bfa1 when in complex with Spc72. In this case, disruption of the Bfa1-Spc72 interaction in cells with mis-oriented spindles might be a way to insulate the GAP complex from being inhibited by Cdc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We tested this model using <italic>BFA1-GFP SPC72-GBP</italic> cells where Spc72-Bfa1 interaction is maintained even during spindle misalignment. In support of our model, Bfa1-Spc72 tethering caused increased phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 and hence SPOC failure. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 was also observed in these cells. This indicates that Kin4 can only inhibit Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 if Bfa1 dissociates from Spc72. This is in line with the observation that Bfa1 phosphorylated by Kin4 is still a substrate of Cdc5 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore propose that Spc72 acts as a scaffold protein that coordinates the regulation of the checkpoint effector Bfa1 by both Kin4 and Cdc5 kinases in cells with mis-aligned spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Contribution of Nud1 and Spc72 for Bfa1 SPB binding behavior</title><p>Biochemical and FRET data are consistent with the binding of Bfa1 to Nud1 and Spc72. This raises the question of how Bfa1 associates with these proteins at the SPB. Bfa1 could bind separately or simultaneously to Nud1 and Spc72. The analysis of <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells exclude the possibility of a stable Bfa1-Spc72 and a dynamic Bfa1-Nud1 pool co-existing at SPBs since Bfa1 still associated with SPBs via Nud1 in a stable manner in <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells with correctly aligned spindles. Interestingly, in <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells with mis-aligned spindles, Bfa1 became dynamic, yet not as much as in wild type cells but similar to <italic>kin4∆</italic> cells. This observation is important two-fold: First, it indicates that the Bfa1 binding site of Nud1 functions efficiently without Spc72. Second, it suggests that the main function of Spc72 is not in Bfa1 binding to the SPB but instead in the SPB recruitment of Kin4, which then regulates Bfa1 SPB dynamics through phosphorylation of Bfa1 as discussed above.</p><p>Simultaneous binding of Bfa1 to Spc72 and Nud1 is a possibility considering the SPB structure, where Nud1 and Spc72 interact through their C-termini with each other and with Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>). If this is the case, the binding affinity of Bfa1 to Nud1 must be higher than to Spc72. This would explain why the loss of Spc72 does not significantly influence Bfa1 protein levels and binding dynamics at SPBs. However, alternative scenarios might also explain why Bfa1 has the same SPB binding behavior in wild type and <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells with properly aligned spindles. For example, an adaptation mechanism that activates an additional SPB binding site for Bfa1 at SPBs may compensate for the loss of Spc72 or Bfa1 might not directly bind to Spc72 in vivo. We consider the latter possibility as unlikely because of the positive Bfa1-Spc72 FRET signal at the SPB, demonstrating the very close neighborhood of both proteins at this organelle. Moreover, we observed changes in Bfa1-Spc72 FRET signal that are consistent with previous dynamic measurements of Bfa1 in response to spindle alignment defects or <italic>KIN4</italic> overexpression. In any case, further biochemical and biophysical studies will be necessary to evaluate the affinity of Bfa1 towards Nud1 and Spc72, and to establish whether the same Bfa1 molecule can bind simultaneously to Nud1 and Spc72.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Asymmetric association of Bfa1 with SPBs in cells with correctly aligned spindles</title><p>The Bfa1-Bub2 complex is recruited preferentially to the dSPB (asymmetric binding) in cells progressing normally through the cell cycle. How this asymmetry is established is still unclear. SPB duplication generates a newly formed SPB next to the old one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Winey et al., 1991</xref>). Under normal growth conditions, the old SPB moves to the daughter cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, it was shown that the old SPB binds more Spc72 molecules then the new one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>), raising the possibility that Spc72 could be the determinant of Bfa1 SPB binding asymmetry. However, our data indicate that Bfa1 asymmetry is maintained even when Spc72 is absent through stable binding to Nud1. In addition, randomization of SPB inheritance (through transient microtubule depolymerization) did not alter the asymmetric association of Bfa1 with the dSPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, our FRET analyses show that, in cells with normal aligned spindles, Bfa1 is still in close proximity to Spc72 and Nud1 at both SPBs. We thus consider it as unlikely that the asymmetric SPB binding of Bfa1-Bub2 arises from association of Bfa1 with different receptors at mother and daughter SPBs.</p><p>The asymmetry of Bfa1 at SPBs could arise from differential phospho-regulation at the poles. This regulation could be at the level of Bfa1, Nud1 or Bub2, which is also required for Bfa1 SPB asymmetry and subjected to phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Elledge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rock et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation could either stabilize Bfa1-Nud1 interaction at the dSPB or destabilize it at mSPB. Cdc5 has been previously suggested to preferentially target Bfa1 to the dSPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). However, the fact that Bfa1 asymmetry was not disturbed in Cdc5-depleted cells challenges this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). Existing data indicated that Kin4 does not contribute to the reduced levels of Bfa1 at the mSPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). In addition, our data now shows that Bfa1 asymmetry is not disturbed in <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells, where Cdc5 and Kin4 do not phosphorylate Bfa1. These observations suggest that kinases other than Kin4 and Cdc5 are involved in Bfa1 asymmetry, if the regulation is at the level of phosphorylation.</p><p>It has been proposed that Bfa1-Bub2 asymmetry is established through cytoplasmic microtubule-cortex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>) or cell polarity determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). Bfa1 asymmetry was maintained in <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells, which have very short and unstable cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoepfner et al., 2002</xref>). This implies that cells do not require an intact cytoplasmic microtubule cytoskeleton to establish and/or maintain Bfa1-Bub2 asymmetry. How cell polarity determinants control Bfa1 asymmetry is unclear. Daughter cell associated factors could stabilize the Bfa1-Nud1 interaction at the dSPB, for example by influencing the post-translational regulation of Bfa1-Bub2 or Nud1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Local SPOC satisfaction triggers a global dominant signal promoting mitotic exit</title><p>Our data show that SPOC is not an everlasting checkpoint. Slippage from SPOC can occur after prolonged mitotic arrest. In <italic>kar9</italic>∆ cells, this is a relatively rare event because the spindle is able to realign quickly in the majority of the cells due to the presence of the alternative dynein-dependent spindle alignment pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eshel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 1993</xref>). This situation is however different in <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells. Lack of functional cytoplasmic microtubules impairs spindle realignment in the majority of the <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells. As a consequence of this long cell cycle arrest, we frequently observed SPOC slippage and accumulation of multi-nucleated cells. Our data is consistent with a previous report that analyzed the cell cycle progression of binucleated yeast cells lacking cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sullivan and Huffaker, 1992</xref>). By following <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells that underwent SPOC slippage and became multinucleated, we observed a novel phenomenon in yeast mitotic exit: In cells with two misaligned anaphase spindles, realignment of one spindle was sufficient to trigger mitotic exit in both misaligned and correctly aligned nuclei. A similar phenomenon was described in binucleated budding yeast cells obtained by other means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falk et al., 2016</xref>). This observation indicates that a dominant mitotic exit signal is generated after spindle entry into the bud. This is likely a diffusible signal as it almost simultaneously affects the other nuclei that still reside in the mother cell compartment with a misaligned spindle.</p><p>The passage of one nucleus into the bud may trigger mitotic exit via several possible SPOC bypassing and/or silencing mechanisms. Daughter cell specific factors, such as the putative Tem1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lte1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirayama et al., 1994</xref>) could trigger the MEN to initiate mitotic exit in the bud. Active GTP-bound Tem1 would then fully activate the phosphatase Cdc14 that in turn counteracts and decreases the activity of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) to promote mitotic exit and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardin and Amon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meitinger et al., 2012</xref>). In this case, Tem1 activation in the daughter cell followed by mitotic Cdk1 down-regulation would bypass the SPOC in the mother cell compartment (SPOC bypassing mechanism). Interestingly, Lte1 is also a Kin4 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk et al., 2011</xref>), implying that bud specific factors may promote MEN activation through inhibition of SPOC components (SPOC silencing). SPOC silencing can also occur at the level of Bfa1-Bub2. Cdc5 was proposed to inhibit Bfa1-Bub2 GAP activity in cells with normal aligned spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Elledge, 2002</xref>). However, it is likely that factors other than Cdc5 inactivate Bfa1-Bub2 in the daughter cell compartment. Two observations support this notion. We found that Bfa1-Bub2 was not efficiently phosphorylated by Cdc5 in <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells, yet these cells did not have a delayed mitotic exit when their mitotic spindle was correctly aligned. In addition, a mutant form of Bfa1 (Bfa1-11A), which cannot be phosphorylated by Cdc5, does not cause a delayed mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2001</xref>). Mathematical modeling also predicted the existence of an additional Bfa1-Bub2 inhibitory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caydasi et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the Cdc42 effector protein Gic1 was shown to directly bind to Bub2 and inhibit its interaction with Tem1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofken and Schiebel, 2004</xref>). Our study thus re-invigorates the concept that cell polarity associated factors play a critical role in SPOC silencing and mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hofken and Schiebel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). The molecular characterization of these factors, which were undermined in the last decade, will be critical to shed light onto the mechanisms controlling mitotic exit and/or SPOC silencing.</p><p>Of importance, our data indicate that the mitotic exit stop-signal generated by the SPOC at the misaligned spindle cannot sustain the mitotic arrest if the checkpoint is satisfied in the neighboring spindle. Analogously, in mammalian cells with two mitotic spindles, the stop-anaphase signal generated by the SAC at one of the two spindles was not sufficient to sustain the checkpoint arrest if the checkpoint was satisfied at the neighboring spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rieder et al., 1997</xref>). Similar observations were made for G2-M checkpoint in binucleated plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">del Campo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gimenez-Abian et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, local satisfaction of checkpoints seems to be sufficient for global checkpoint silencing in binucleated cells. Interestingly, cytokinesis defects often generate binucleation, which is associated with aneuploidy and tumor formation. We postulate that misbalanced checkpoint integrity in binucleated cells might be a driver for genome instability and cancer development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>All yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD24-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudin-Baillieu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caydasi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khmelinskii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Surana et al., 1993</xref>).

SPOC is a critical checkpoint mechanism that regulates mitotic exit (i.e. upstream of mitotic exit network, MEN) depending on the state of spindle positioning within the cell to ensure correct segregation of two nuclei into two daughter cells. An elegant series of FRET experiments are used to assess the association of Bfa1 with the SPB components Nud1 and Spc72. The data show that Bfa1 simultaneously associates with Spc72 and Nud1 but that it is the association with Spc72 that alters in the SPOC dependent manner.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this study provides a significant progress toward the understanding of molecular mechanism for SPOC. The novel role of Spc72 as a scaffold for Cdc5 and Kin4 is the key point of this study.</p><p>In this regard, the major concern was that FRET data are still correlational because the functional significance of Spc72 interactions (measured by FRET) with SPOC components is not defined. So, this correlational nature has to be mentioned in the text.</p><p>In the most rigorous manner, one could 1) map the interaction domains of Spc72 that recruits Cdc5 and Kin4, then 2) generate separation of function alleles to define the phenotypic outcome, which will provide a fine model on how Spc72 operates in SPOC signaling, and 3) use FKBP-FRB system to test the model by manipulating Spc72's interaction with SPOC components.</p><p>However, the reviewers also agreed that the above points 1 and 2 may be beyond the scope of the current work, and that the existing data presented in this manuscript are sufficient to formulate a working model (as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, the reviewers agreed that the authors should describe their model of how the differential change in Bfa1-Spc72 and Bfa1-Nud1 FRET relates to the ability of Cdc5 and Kin4 to phosphorylate Bfa1, and test the model by additional, relatively simple experiment(s) along the line of above point 3).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A FRET-based study reveals site-specific regulation of spindle position checkpoint proteins at yeast centrosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>..

But the reviewer #3 felt that the description can be improved (accuracy of interpreting results, discussion on alternative possibilities etc.). This can be all taken care by revising the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I believe that the authors adequately addressed reviewers' comments in this revised version. In particular, the use of Spc72-GBP Bfa1-GFP clearly addressed the concern on the correlational nature of FRET experiments. Now, the results support their idea more strongly that Spc72-Bfa1 interaction represents a critical step in SPOC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>My main suggestion to the authors is that they elaborate on all of the implications of their experimental findings, and clearly discuss alternative models that are also consistent with the data.</p><p>1) Address the inconsistency regarding the proposed model of simultaneous interaction of one Bfa1 with both Nud1 and Spc72.</p><p>The authors use FRET between Spc72 C-terminus and Bfa1 C-terminus and in vitro pull-down to conclude that the two interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the authors also find that the deletion of Spc72 does not have any detectable effect on steady-state Bfa1 recruitment or its turn-over rate at the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). The authors reconcile these findings by arguing that the same Bfa1 molecule simultaneously interacts with both Spc72 and Nud1.</p><p>If there are two binding sites in close physical proximity, then their combined affinity can be expected to be more than the sum of the individual affinities. Even if this expectation is somehow not relevant in this case, the deletion of one of the two binding sites (Spc72) should have a measurable effect on either the recruitment or turn-over of Bfa1. The in vivo data do not support this.</p><p>I can think of four possible reasons for these contradictory data: (1) a mutation/suppressor counteracts the effects of Spc72 deletion on Bfa1 recruitment, (2) the increased stoichiometry of Bfa1:Nud1 in the <italic>spc72Δ</italic> strain exactly compensates for the loss of one binding site, (3) the affinity of the Bfa1 binding site in Spc72 is very low, and Nud1 is mostly responsible for Bfa1 recruitment, and (4) the in vitro result is an artifact; Spc72 does not interact with Bfa1 in vivo. It should be noted that the Spc72-Bfa1 FRET is correlative. Changes in this FRET could simply reflect increased separation between the fluorophores due to the binding of Bmh1 to Bfa1.</p><p>The authors should clearly discuss the inconsistency in the in vivo and in vitro result and other possible interpretations of the data.</p><p>2) Discuss all possible reasons for the origin of asymmetric recruitment of Bfa1 by mother and daughter SPB.</p><p>The point discussed above also affects the authors' explanation for why the daughter SPB recruits higher amounts of Bfa1. The authors note that &quot;Previously, correlative experiments excluded the possibility that an age-related difference of the two SPBs could account for the preferred binding of Bfa1-Bub2 complexes to the dSPB (Juanes et al., 2013; Pereira et al., 2001).

The correlative nature of FRET data is now mentioned in the text (subsection “SPOC activation disturbs Bfa1-Spc72 interaction through Kin4/Bmh1 branch of the SPOC”, last paragraph). We now performed additional experiments to test the functional significance of the change in Bfa1-Spc72 FRET and also to test the model that dissociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 prevents inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5. As suggested by the reviewers, we manipulated Spc72-Bfa1 interaction so that Bfa1 remained constitutively bound to Spc72. For this, we expressed <italic>BFA1-GFP</italic> in cells carrying Spc72 fused to the GFP-binding protein (GBP). In the presence of Spc72-GBP, Bfa1-GFP localized at both SPBs independently of the spindle position. We show that <italic>BFA1-GFP SPC72-GBP</italic> cells were SPOC deficient, indicating the functional significance of remodeling Bfa1-Spc72 interaction upon spindle misalignment. We also show that Bfa1-GFP became hyperphosphorylated in nocodazole-treated <italic>SPC72-GBP</italic> but not in <italic>SPC72</italic> cells. Depletion of <italic>CDC5</italic> greatly reduced the Bfa1-GFP hyperphosphorylation in <italic>SPC72-GBP</italic> cells, establishing the contribution of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction to Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1. <italic>KIN4</italic> also phosphorylated Bfa1-GFP in <italic>SPC72-GBP</italic> cells. These data indicate that Kin4 and Cdc5 phosphorylate Bfa1 upon SPOC activation, if Bfa1 remains constitutively bound to Spc72. These new data support our model and are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, explained in the subsection “Bfa1-Spc72 interaction enhances Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 and Kin4” and discussed in the subsection “The γ-tubulin complex receptor Spc72 coordinates activation and inhibition of Bfa1- Bub2”. We also described the model in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>My main suggestion to the authors is that they elaborate on all of the implications of their experimental findings, and clearly discuss alternative models that are also consistent with the data.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Address the inconsistency regarding the proposed model of simultaneous interaction of one Bfa1 with both Nud1 and Spc72.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors use FRET between Spc72 C-terminus and Bfa1 C-terminus and in vitro pull-down to conclude that the two interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In this section, we discuss whether Bfa1 binds to Nud1 and Spc72 separately or simultaneously. We discuss our in vitro and FRET data as well as the data obtained from the analysis of Bfa1 SPB binding behaviour in <italic>spc72∆</italic> cells. We also discuss the inconsistencies of in vitro and in vivo data (in respect to Spc72’s contribution to Bfa1 SPB binding behaviour):</p><p>“Contribution of Nud1 and Spc72 for Bfa1 SPB binding behavior:</p><p>Biochemical and FRET data are consistent with the binding of Bfa1 to Nud1 and Spc72. This raises the question of how Bfa1 associates with these proteins at the SPB. Bfa1 could bind separately or simultaneously to Nud1 and Spc72. […] In any case, further biochemical and biophysical studies will be necessary to evaluate the affinity of Bfa1 towards Nud1 and Spc72, and to establish whether the same Bfa1 molecule can bind simultaneously to Nud1 and Spc72.”</p><p>We now discuss that loss of FRET could also indicate separation of the fluorophores only:</p><p>“We observed loss of Bfa1-Spc72 (but not Bfa1-Nud1) FRET upon SPOC activation. The loss of FRET signal between Bfa1 and Spc72 might indicate the physical separation of the two proteins or only the separation of the fluorophores coupled to Bfa1 and Spc72 C-termini. […] Such regulation may resemble the conformational change that Mad2 undergoes upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (Luo et al., 2002; Luo et al., 2004; Mapelli et al., 2007; Mapelli and Musacchio, 2007; Sironi et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2007).”</p><p><italic>2) Discuss all possible reasons for the origin of asymmetric recruitment of Bfa1 by mother and daughter SPB.</italic></p><p><italic>The point discussed above also affects the authors' explanation for why the daughter SPB recruits higher amounts of Bfa1.

[…] How cell polarity determinants control Bfa1 asymmetry is unclear. Daughter cell associated factors could stabilize the Bfa1-Nud1 interaction at the dSPB, for example by influencing the post-translational regulation of Bfa1-Bub2 or Nud1.”</p><p><italic>3) Cite prior studies that demonstrate that the satisfaction of mitotic checkpoint locally produces a dominant signal that silences the checkpoint globally.</italic></p><p><italic>At least two prior studies demonstrate that it takes very little to tip the balance of the cell cycle biochemistry: (a) &quot;Synchronous nuclear-envelope breakdown and anaphase onset in plant multinucleate cells&quot; Protoplasma (2001) 218:192-202, and (b) &quot;Mitosis in vertebrate somatic cells with two spindles: Implications for the metaphase/anaphase transition checkpoint and cleavage&quot; PNAS 94, pp. 5107-5112.

We now discuss previous work showing checkpoint behaviour in binucleated cells:</p><p>“Of importance, our data indicate that the mitotic exit stop-signal generated by the SPOC at the misaligned spindle cannot sustain the mitotic arrest if the checkpoint is satisfied in the neighboring spindle. […] We postulate that misbalanced checkpoint integrity in binucleated cells might be a driver for genome instability and cancer development.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
