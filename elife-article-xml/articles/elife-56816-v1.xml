entorhinal cortex layer III (LEC III) supports temporal associative learning is still unknown. In this study, persistent firing was evoked in vitro from LEC III neurons from young and aged rats that were behaviorally naive or trained on trace eyeblink conditioning. Persistent firing ability from neurons from behaviorally naive aged rats was lower compared to neurons from young rats. Neurons from learning impaired aged animals also exhibited reduced persistent firing capacity, which may contribute to aging-related learning impairments. Successful acquisition of the trace eyeblink task, however, increased persistent firing ability in both young and aged rats. These changes in persistent firing ability are due to changes to the afterdepolarization, which may in turn be modulated by the postburst afterhyperpolarization. Together, these data indicate that successful learning increases persistent firing ability and decreases in persistent firing ability contribute to learning impairments in aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AHP</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd><kwd>temporal associative learning</kwd><kwd>entorhinal</kwd><kwd>persistent firing</kwd><kwd>alzheimer's</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG008796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Disterhoft</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG017139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Disterhoft</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG55331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Temporal associative learning enhances persistent firing in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) layer III neurons, while aging decreases persistent firing, leading to cognitive impairments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Persistent firing is the ability of a neuron to continuously fire action potentials even after the termination of a triggering stimulus. Temporal associative learning and other working memory-dependent tasks are thought to rely on persistent firing because this mechanism may serve to bridge the temporal gap between task-relevant stimulus presentation and the execution of a learned response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zylberberg and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence that persistent firing may support temporal associative learning comes from an in vivo study of prefrontal neurons, which showed elevated activity during the delay period of a working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuster, 1972</xref>).</p><p>One region that has been shown to be important for temporal associative learning is the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrissey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). In vitro, persistent firing in the LEC is dependent upon cholinergic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tahvildari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tahvildari et al., 2008</xref>). Application of a cholinergic antagonist into the entorhinal cortex impairs the acquisition of temporal associative learning tasks such as trace fear and trace eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Esclassan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tanninen et al., 2015</xref>). Within the LEC, layers III and V pyramidal neurons have been shown to be capable of persistent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tahvildari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tahvildari et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, layer III pyramidal neurons integrate and provide object information directly to the CA1 region of the hippocampus, forming the temporoammonic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Groen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hargreaves et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>). Thus, persistent firing by layer III LEC pyramidal neurons is a prime candidate to support temporal associative learning. However, how this may occur is yet to be determined.</p><p>Along with its role in hippocampus-dependent learning, the LEC is also highly susceptible to aging-related changes. The LEC is the initial site of Alzheimer’s-related tau pathology in cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morys et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gómez-Isla et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stranahan and Mattson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khan et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies have also determined that changes to LEC structure and activity in normal aging is associated with learning and other cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodrigue and Raz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yassa et al., 2010</xref>). For example, LEC hypoactivity has been shown to be associated with impairments in pattern separation in aging humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reagh et al., 2018</xref>). As a result of its susceptibility to aging, there may be alterations to persistent firing ability in LEC III that may contribute to the aging-related learning impairments we and others have observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knuttinen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tombaugh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galvez et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether persistent firing properties of LEC III pyramidal neurons are altered as a result of learning and/or aging. Persistent firing was evoked from neurons of young adult and aged rats that were behaviorally naïve or trained on trace eyeblink conditioning, a temporal associative learning task. Measurements of the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and afterdepolarization (ADP) were also made to determine the mechanisms underlying these changes. The results of this study are a first step in understanding how persistent firing supports trace eyeblink conditioning and how this function is altered with aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Persistent firing probability is decreased with aging</title><p>To determine whether aging decreased persistent firing ability in LEC III neurons, persistent firing was evoked in neurons from behaviorally naive young adult (Young Naive – YN) and aged (Aged Naive – AN) male rats based on protocols previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tahvildari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tahvildari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batallán-Burrowes and Chapman, 2018</xref>).

Previous studies determined that a 2 s long depolarizing current step that elicited firing at 20–30 Hz was sufficient to evoke persistent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tahvildari et al., 2007</xref>). When persistent firing was evoked in neurons from YN and AN rats with this protocol, neurons from AN rats again had a lower probability of firing compared to neurons from YN rats, which were able to fire at nearly 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

The aged rats were separated into aged impaired (AI) or aged unimpaired (AU) groups based upon whether they achieved a 60% conditioned response (CR) learning criterion. 60% CRs were chosen based on the separation of behavior amongst aged animals on the last session of trace eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The young adult rats were either trained on trace eyeblink conditioning (Young Conditioned – YC) or pseudoconditioned (Young Pseudoconditioned – YP) as a control.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neurons from aged impaired animals have a decreased persistent firing probability.</title><p>Successful learning increases persistent firing probability in neurons from both young adult and aged animals.

Neurons from AU animals reached a peak firing rate of 7.00 ± 0.52 spikes/sec at the 8–9 s bin. The activity of AU neurons was not able to reach the same rate of firing as YC.

The postburst AHP is a hyperpolarizing current that mediates a refractory period after a burst of action potentials. It can be divided into the medium (mAHP) and slow (sAHP) components. These two components are mediated by separate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). The mAHP lasts for 50–200 ms after the burst of action potentials and is typically measured at the peak of the AHP. The mAHP is mediated by the apamin-sensitive SK2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammond et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKay et al., 2012</xref>). The sAHP lasts for several seconds after the burst of action potentials and is measured 1 s after the burst of action potentials. The channels that mediate the sAHP have yet to be identified. However, it is known that it is not mediated by the same apamin-sensitive SK2 channel that mediates the mAHP, as increasing or knocking out SK2 activity has no effect on the sAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammond et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKay et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the mAHP and sAHP are larger in pyramidal neurons from aged animals compared to young adult animals, indicating decreased excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Power et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>).

Following a burst of action potentials, then, instead of an AHP, there is a depolarization of the membrane potential above the baseline. This is known as the afterdepolarization (ADP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). Following the peak of the ADP, the depolarized membrane potential is usually sustained above the baseline membrane potential. This sustained depolarization is known as the plateau potential (PP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fraser and MacVicar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tahvildari et al., 2007</xref>). The ADP allows the neuron to reach spontaneous firing threshold during an up-state and fire action potentials, while the PP allows the firing to persist. We examined the ADP and PP in LEC III neurons using a 250 ms train of 20 Hz (2 ms, 2 nA) depolarizing current pulses and held the neuronal membrane potential at 10 mV more hyperpolarized than spontaneous firing threshold, to preclude persistent firing. The peak amplitude of the ADP was used to determine the size of the ADP.

The ADP amplitude heavily influenced whether or not a neuron was able to persistently fire when the membrane potential was held at 5 mV below spontaneous firing. An ADP amplitude of ~4 mV was the boundary which determined successful or unsuccessful firing, with amplitudes at or above 4 mV allowing a neuron to successfully persistently fire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The ADP amplitude was also positively correlated with mean persistent firing rate (Pearson, r = 0.6265, p&lt;0.0001), indicating that a larger ADP size allowed for the neuron to fire more quickly. Finally, ADP amplitude was also negatively correlated with onset latency (Pearson, r = −0.4291, p=0.0029), indicating that a larger ADP size allowed the neuron to start firing earlier in the sweep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Just as we observed with persistent firing rate and postburst AHP amplitude, the ADP size is significantly positively correlated with learning ability amongst AU and AI animals, but not amongst YC animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Amongst the aged group, then, learning ability may help determine intrinsic excitability, the size of the ADP, and subsequently, persistent firing. Amongst the YC animals, there may not be a significant correlation because the young animals trained on trace eyeblink conditioning successfully learned the task. </p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The ADP and PP in behaviorally naive young adult and YC animals are Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the ADP and PP that generate persistent firing in LEC III and V are mediated by an activity-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tahvildari et al., 2008</xref>).

In behaviorally naive animals, persistent firing probability was decreased in LEC III pyramidal neurons from aged animals. On the other hand, under conditions which did not evoke robust firing in neurons from behaviorally naïve or control animals, successful learning enhanced firing probability in neurons from both young adult and aged animals. The rate of persistent firing was also affected, with aging and learning again having opposing effects. We determined that there were also learning and aging-related changes to the postburst AHP, a measure of intrinsic excitability. The changes to the postburst AHP may contribute to the changes to persistent firing that we have observed. We also observed aging and learning-related changes to the afterdepolarization (ADP). The ADP size was highly correlated with persistent firing rate and onset latency. In neurons from both YN and YC animals, the ADP was eliminated with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, implying that not only is the ADP activated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent mechanism, as others have reported, but also that successful learning enhances this mechanism to allow for the enhanced persistent firing ability we have observed.</p><p>Although the persistent firing of neurons from aged animals was less robust, a learning-related increase in the size of the ADP in neurons from both aged and young adult animals allowed for the gap between a more hyperpolarized membrane holding potential and spontaneous firing threshold to be more easily overcome than in control animals. Functionally, this may allow for persistent firing to occur more easily following learning, which may be important for the expression and consolidation of the memory.</p><p>The other effect of a learning-related increase in ADP size is to increase the rate of persistent firing within the theta range. Theta-modulation in the LEC has been shown to be relevant for task-specific actions, such as running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshmukh et al., 2010</xref>). A previous study has also shown theta-locking of LEC III neurons when the animal attends to sensory cues during an associative learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>). It has been hypothesized that persistent firing rate could provide a phase code for changes to object features in the continuous dimension, such that an increase in persistent firing rate could allow for a phase shift in firing to encode continuous dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hasselmo et al., 2010</xref>). In this manner, an increase in persistent firing rate during trace eyeblink conditioning could allow for the properties of the stimuli (e.g. tone, timing) to be properly encoded so that a more precise behavioral response can be elicited.</p><p>Previous studies have also indicated the functional importance of LEC theta-coupling with the hippocampus and other memory-associated regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2011</xref>). The LEC has been shown to increase theta synchronization with both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex following CS onset during the acquisition phase of trace eyeblink conditioning. Theta oscillations between the LEC and the prefrontal cortex, in particular, become strongly synchronized as the animal acquires trace eyeblink conditioning, and continue this synchronized activity through encoding and consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, lesions to the temporoammonic pathway have been shown to eliminate consolidation of a hippocampus-dependent memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Remondes and Schuman, 2004</xref>). An increase in persistent firing rate, therefore, may also be the result of successful acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning and may support consolidation of the newly acquired association into long-term memory. Aging, however, had the effect of decreasing persistent firing properties such as probability and rate of firing. We observed that neurons from aged animals that were trained on trace eyeblink conditioning but failed to learn the paradigm had a reduced capacity for persistent firing even compared to neurons from young adult control animals (i.e. YP). An aging-related decrease in persistent firing ability may, therefore, contribute to the learning impairments that we and others have observed in the aging population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knuttinen et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, although neurons from AU animals were able to persistently fire, they were not able to fire as robustly as neurons from YC animals. When the gap between the neuronal membrane holding potential and spontaneous firing threshold was increased, neurons from aged animals that successfully learned were unable to reach the ceiling effect that neurons from young animals that successfully learned were able to reach. Their firing rate was also slower than those from young animals that learned. They also had a slower time to reach peak firing rate compared to neurons from YC animals. A slower time to reach peak firing may make it more difficult for neurons to be included in an ensemble to help bridge the trace interval. Alternatively, it may also result in desynchronization within the LEC network of theta and other rhythms that are necessary for hippocampus-dependent learning, such as gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As a result, although neurons from unimpaired aged animals were still able to persistently fire, they were also affected by the changes in neuronal properties that are associated with aging. This leads to their reduced capacity for persistent firing as compared to their young adult counterparts. The ability of AU animals to achieve the same level of learning behaviorally may be the result of compensatory mechanisms in other regions. These regions may include those that are functionally connected to the LEC, such as the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.</p><p>In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, for example, if an aged animal is able to acquire a hippocampus-dependent task such as trace eyeblink conditioning, the excitability of the neurons increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the excitability of these neurons is comparable to those of a young animal who successfully acquired trace eyeblink conditioning, unlike in neurons of LEC III. The firing ability of CA1 neurons, therefore, may serve to help compensate for the less robust persistent firing in LEC III neurons of AU animals. It also seems that the excitability of CA1 neurons may be a better determinant of successful learning in aging than that of LEC III neurons. The differences in excitability changes across separate regions of an interconnected memory network point to individually weighted contributions to the development of hippocampus-dependent memory. Although there may be excitability differences in each region as a result of aging, they may not be equal contributors to memory acquisition.The changes we have observed in excitability in LEC III are also reflected in the AHP. While learning increased the ADP, it decreased the AHP. Aging, on the other hand, had the effect of decreasing the ADP and increasing the AHP. As a result, an inverse relationship between the AHP and the ADP may exist in LEC III pyramidal neurons, with a smaller AHP (i.e. following learning) allowing for the development of a larger ADP, and a larger AHP (i.e. as a result of aging) impeding the development of a larger ADP. A previous study performed in CA1 neurons has in fact shown that elimination of the postburst AHP allows for the development of an ADP. The presence of the AHP inhibited the temporal summation of the mechanism supporting the ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although the exact channels and mechanisms that underlie the ADP are still unknown, what is known is that both the AHP and ADP are mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following a burst of action potentials. Postburst Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, via voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, which generate the AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKay et al., 2012</xref>). However, if the AHP is suppressed, as with neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated cationic conductances (e.g. CAN channels), also activated by postburst Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, may present themselves, resulting in the development of an ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tahvildari et al., 2008</xref>). Further experiments are needed to elucidate the interaction between the AHP and the ADP in LEC III pyramidal neurons, however, and how learning and aging affect both mechanisms in order to support and inhibit persistent firing, respectively.</p><p>Finally, although we have established that learning and aging differentially affect persistent firing, the functional role that persistent firing plays during trace eyeblink conditioning and other temporal associative tasks is yet to be determined in vivo. The answer to this question is beyond the scope of the current study, although there are a few possibilities that may be considered.</p><p>One possible role is to enhance the activity of their direct downstream target, CA1 pyramidal neurons. Temporoammonic activity from LEC III to CA1 has the ability to modulate Schaffer-Collateral (SC) evoked CA1 spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Remondes and Schuman, 2002</xref>). As such, persistent firing in LEC III neurons may enhance SC input to CA1 neurons, allowing for CA1 neurons to be more responsive to convergent CS and US information that is provided via the tri-synaptic pathway. Evidence for this comes from previous studies from our laboratory, which have shown an increase in CA1 activity in response to both the CS and the US in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1999</xref>). Therefore, persistent firing in LEC III may serve to enhance the processing of salient stimuli within CA1 neurons, allowing for the successful acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning.</p><p>The prevailing hypothesis in the literature, however, is that persistent firing supports a ‘memory’ of the CS during the trace interval, so that the association between the CS and the US can be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zylberberg and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>). Previous in vivo work has shown that persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex bridges the delay period during a working memory task, and inhibition of persistent activity impairs acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuster, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). On the level of individual neurons, persistent firing ability as we have described here may support the trace by spanning the entire trace interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinidis et al., 2018</xref>) or allow the neuron to participate in an ensemble pattern of activity that allows the trace to be bridged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lundqvist et al., 2018</xref>). Either way, persistent firing in LEC III is strongly suggested to support the acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning. Blocking activity of the LEC has been shown to inhibit temporal associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrissey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>), and in the medial entorhinal cortex, inhibition of layer III activity to the CA1 region has been shown to impair trace fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suh et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these data suggest that persistent firing in LEC III is a crucial mechanism in supporting the formation of the temporal association during trace eyeblink conditioning.</p><p>Whatever the functional role of persistent firing may be in supporting trace eyeblink conditioning, what we have established is that it is a mechanism that is, at the very least, important for acquiring this temporal associative paradigm. Successful acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning enhances persistent firing ability in both young adult and aged animals, while an aged-related decrease in persistent firing ability may lead to learning impairments in acquiring the paradigm. Along with examining the functional role of persistent firing in acquiring temporal associative learning in vivo, future studies should also examine the extent to which persistent firing is necessary. Such studies would pave the way to better understanding the neural network that underlies the acquisition of this type of complex task.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Carbachol</td><td valign="top">EMD Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat#212385</td><td valign="top">10 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cadmium Chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>)</td><td valign="top">Millipore Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#10108-64-2</td><td valign="top">100 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">F1 Hybrid F344 x Brown Norway Rat</td><td valign="top">National Institutes of Aging</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007317">SCR_007317</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">LabView 8.20</td><td valign="top">National Instruments</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014325">SCR_014325</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism 8.3.1</td><td valign="top">GraphPad</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Anaconda Navigator 1.9.6</td><td valign="top">Python</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB R2014b</td><td valign="top">Mathworks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Subjects were young adult (3–6 months old) and aged (26–32 months old) male F1 hybrid Fischer 344 x Brown Norway rats.

In total, the rats received one session of habituation and five training sessions of trace eyeblink conditioning. Rats were trained in a sound-attenuating chamber allowing for free movement. Rats were trained with a tone as the conditioned stimulus (CS; 250 ms, 8 kHz, 85 dB free field) paired with an electrical shock to the periorbital region of the right eye as the unconditioned stimulus (US; 100 ms; 15–20 mA; biphasic at 60 Hz). The CS and the US were separated with a trace period of 500 ms. A single training session consisted of 30 CS-US pairings with an intertrial interval of 20 to 40 s (30 s average). EMG activity exceeding 4 SD above baseline activity occurring 200 ms before US onset was considered a conditioned response (CR). A criterion of 60% CRs was set to separate the impaired learners from the unimpaired learners. Young Pseudoconditioned rats were given 30 unpaired CS alone trials pseudo-randomly dispersed with 30 unpaired US alone trials with a 10 to 20 s intertrial interval (15 s average). Stimuli were delivered and data were acquired and analyzed using custom LabView software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JPow2020/Eyeblink-Conditioning">https://github.com/JPow2020/Eyeblink-Conditioning</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Power, 2011</xref>, copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Eyeblink-Conditioning">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Eyeblink-Conditioning</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>In-vitro whole cell recordings</title><p>Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made from visually identified LEC III neurons using an Axoclamp 2A amplifier, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKay et al., 2013</xref>). LEC slices were prepared from rats that had been trained on trace eyeblink conditioning 24 hr after the last training session. The experimenter was blinded to the training and learning condition of the animal. LEC slices were cut as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tahvildari and Alonso, 2005</xref>) using a Leica VT1000s vibratome in ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>-5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices from young rats were cut using ACSF composed of the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 KCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 25 D-glucose.

Slices were incubated for ~20 min at 34°C and allowed to cool to room temperature for at least another 30 min before recording.</p><p>For whole-cell recordings, slices were placed in a submerged recording chamber and were perfused with oxygenated ACSF warmed to 32–34°C using an in-line heater and temperature controller (Warner Instruments). LEC layer III neurons were visualized using a CCD camera (Orca R2, Hamamatsu) mounted on a Leica DM LFS. High resistance seals (&gt;1 GΩ) were obtained prior to whole cell recordings. The microscope was equipped with a long working distance 40 x (0.8 NA) water-immersion objective and infrared differential interference contrast optics. To be included in the study, cells were required to have a resting membrane potential between −50 mV and −80 mV, an R<sub>input</sub> of &gt;25 MΩ that remained stable throughout the recording, and an action potential height of at least 70 mV above the holding potential. R<sub>input</sub> was calculated by a linear fit of the steady state voltage response (average membrane potential 700–900 ms of the 1 s current step) vs current steps (−0.3 to 0 nA, 0.05 nA increments). Action potential properties (i.e. threshold, half-width, amplitude, dV/dt max) were measured from the first action potential evoked by persistent firing and the last action potential recorded in the sweep (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table17">Table 17</xref>). Recordings were acquired and analyzed using pClamp v10 and digitized using a Digidata 1440A analog-to-digital converter. Custom routines using Python were written to analyze R<sub>input</sub>, and action potential threshold, half-width, amplitude, and dV/dt.</p><table-wrap id="table17" position="float"><label>Table 17.</label><caption><title>Passive membrane properties of LEC III pyramidal neurons, separated into YN, AN, YC, YP, AU, and AI.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">RMP (mV)</th><th valign="top">R<sub>input</sub> (MΩ)</th><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">YN</td><td valign="top">−72.28 ± 1.12</td><td valign="top">54.49 ± 1.39</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">AN</td><td valign="top">−70.73 ± 0.89</td><td valign="top">60.39 ± 2.91</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">First AP Threshold (mV)</th><th valign="top">Last AP Threshold (mV)</th><th valign="top">p-Value</th><th/><th/></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" valign="top">YN</td><td rowspan="3" valign="top">-41.54 ± 0.33</td><td rowspan="3" valign="top">-41.63 ± 0.33</td><td valign="top">AP Threshold, <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 0.6896, p = 0.4068</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Group, <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 8.744, p = 0.003**</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Group x AP Threshold, <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 2.902, p = 0.0893~</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">AN</td><td valign="top">-43.40 ± 0.48</td><td valign="top">-43.15 ± 0.53</td><td valign="top">Young vs. Aged <break/>First AP Threshold, p = 0.0028**</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">First AP Half-Width (ms)</th><th valign="top">Last AP Half-Width (ms)</th><th valign="top">p-Value</th><th/><th/></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" valign="top">YN</td><td rowspan="3" valign="top">1.97 ± 0.04</td><td rowspan="3" valign="top">2.00 ± 0.03</td><td valign="top">AP Half-Width <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 8.761, p = 0.0033**</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Group, <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 2.667, p = 0.1033</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Group x AP Half-Width <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 3.120, p = 0.0781~</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">AN</td><td valign="top">1.83 ± 0.04</td><td valign="top">1.95 ± 0.04</td><td valign="top">Young vs Aged <break/>First AP Half-Width, p = 0.0523~</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">First AP Amplitude (mV)</th><th valign="top">Last AP Amplitude (mV)</th><th valign="top">p-Value</th><th/><th/></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" valign="top">YN</td><td rowspan="3" valign="top">83.61 ± 0.44</td><td rowspan="3" valign="top">80.45 ± 0.43</td><td valign="top">Two-Way ANOVA, AP Amplitude <break/>F<sub>1, 379</sub> = 521.7, p &lt;

Persistent firing was evoked with three different types of protocols: 1) with a 2 s long training stimulus of 100 pA, 150 pA, and 200 pA amplitudes while the cell’s membrane potential was held at 2 mV below spontaneous firing threshold and 2) with a 2 s long train of 2 ms, 2 nA current injection pulses at 20 Hz while the cell was held at 2 mv below spontaneous firing threshold and 3) with a 250 ms long train of 2 ms, 2 nA current injection pulses at 20 Hz while the cell’s membrane potential was held at 2 mV and 5 mV more hyperpolarized than its spontaneous firing threshold. Each cell’s unique spontaneous firing threshold was determined before the protocols were evoked and measured at intervals throughout the recording session to ensure threshold had not drifted. Persistent firing activity was measured during 20 s long sweeps. Each protocol was evoked three times per cell and the recorded activity was averaged across the three sweeps. There was an average of 1 min interval between each sweep. An incidence of persistent firing was considered if the firing activity occurred within 10 s after the end of the current injection. The average group probability of persistent firing for each protocol was determined as the averaged probability of all cells, based on the proportion of sweeps each cell persistently fired.</p><p>Measurements of the afterdepolarization (ADP) and plateau potential (PP) were made while the cell’s membrane potential was held at 10 mV more hyperpolarized than its spontaneous firing threshold to ensure that persistent firing would not be evoked. The ADP and PP was then evoked with a 250 ms long train of 2 ms, 2 nA current injection pulses at 20 Hz. Firing rate analyses were performed only from neurons that were able to persistently fire at least once out of the three sweeps (i.e. if a neuron was at 0% firing ability, that neuron was not included in the frequency analysis.) Firing rate was measured in 1 s bins after the offset of the training stimulus. In bins in which there were no action potentials, a value of 0 was assigned to the bin. The mean firing rate of the neuron was determined by averaging the firing rate across the three sweeps. If the neuron was able to persistently fire for one, but not for all three sweeps, a value of 0 was assigned to all bins in the sweeps in which the neuron did not persistently fire.

learning. Using eye-blink conditioning in young and old rats, the authors demonstrate that increasing age decreases learning in this condition. They then go on to show how this change in learning correlates with an age-related decline in persistent firing (i.e., the ability of neurons to maintain a high firing rate even after the removal of a stimulus) in the entorhinal cortex, which has been proposed to serve a key role in working and associative memory processes. Consequently, this work has the potential to provide new insight on the circuit mechanisms of memory within the entorhinal-hippocampal network and how entorhinal dysfunction contributes to memory deficits in aging.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Persistent firing in LEC III neurons is differentially modulated by learning and aging&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Alexander Ainge (Reviewer #1); Kei Igarashi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper presents a series of studies examining the effects of learning and aging on persistent firing of layer 3 neurons within the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). The studies examine eye-blink conditioning in young and old rats and show interesting opposing effects such that increasing age has the opposite effect of learning. The studies are well-designed and present an interesting mechanism for how changes in persistent firing may underlie associative memory within the LEC. Moreover, the paper goes on to show how this mechanism is affected in aging. Consequently, this work has the potential to provide new insight on the circuit mechanisms of memory within the entorhinal-hippocampal network and how entorhinal dysfunction contributes to memory deficits in aging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers felt there were two major avenues or revision that are needed for publication. The first is a series of analyses that should be feasible to conduct on the current data set. The second is re-writing portions of the paper to improve clarity, flow and the communication of the results.</p><p>Analyses:</p><p>1) Reviewers were concerned there could be other behavioral differences between young and old animals that could be measured using the current data set (levels of locomotion or anxiety, for example).</p><p>2) The authors should provide justification of the 60% conditioning threshold. It would be informative to know if the distribution of conditioning scores is bimodal or unimodal. A bimodal distribution would suggest that the rats can be split into two groups whose responses are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different; learners vs. non-learners. A unimodal distribution would call into question the validity of splitting the group in 2. Collapsing animals into 2 groups loses a lot of the variance in the data. A more interesting approach would to examine the exact relationship between electrophysiological measures and level of conditioning using some form of regression or correlation. This would capture much more of the variance in the data and remove the arbitrary 60% cut-off.</p><p>3) The authors should provide and criteria for splitting the data into slow and medium AHP.</p><p>4) The authors should include text indicating the implications of the slower time to reach peak firing rate Figure 5?</p><p>Writing and Discussion:</p><p>1) The authors found the organization of the manuscript difficult to follow. For example, Figure 1 discusses the mechanism underlying persistent firing while Figure 2 discusses the properties of persistent firing but it may be clearer to present the generate properties of persistent firing before mechanism. A suggested order was: 1) Comparison of persistent firing between naïve young vs. naïve old, 2) Effect of learning in young rats (comparing naïve, learned and unlearned young rats), 3) Effect of learning in old rats(comparing naïve, learned and unlearned old rats), 4) Assessment of AHP and ADP, 5) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of AHP.

Therefore, intrinsic excitability might change everywhere with aging, which raises a question as to what unique contribution the reported changes in the LEC would make to learning deficits in aged rats. 2) The authors state that &quot;The ability of AU animals to achieve the same level of learning behaviorally must be the result of compensatory mechanisms other than those mediated by persistent firing in LEC III neurons.&quot; Please expand this point by listing some brain regions that may compensate for the LEC dysfunction. 3) The relationship between the ADP and AHP is unclear and they may be interdependent (small AHP may produce a large ADP).

However, we did not measure or record other behavioral differences such as levels of locomotion or anxiety from our animals. Although there is a possibility that there may be a difference, we did not note any differences between our young and aged animals in this particular experiment nor in any of our previous experiments involving young and aged animals performing trace eyeblink conditioning (Knuttinen et al., 2001; Matthews et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide justification of the 60% conditioning threshold.

In response to this comment, we included the frequency distribution of the %CR on the final session of trace eyeblink conditioning (session 5) for the aged animals (Figure 2). The distribution shows a split in behavior at the 55% CR mark, which informed our decision to separate the aged animals into Aged Unimpaired and Aged Impaired based on a 60% CR criterion. We included text in the subsection “Successful Learning Enhances Persistent Firing Probability, and Learning Impairments are Associated with Lower Firing Probability” to explain the decision for a 60% CR criterion.</p><p>We also believe, however, that a regression analysis would allow us to gain some insight into the relationship between behavior and certain electrophysiological measures. To that end, we ran Pearson’s correlation tests on the % CR from session 5 of trace eyeblink conditioning against persistent firing rate, postburst AHP amplitude, and ADP amplitude. We found that there was a positive correlation between behavior and these electrophysiological measures for the aged group of animals that underwent trace eyeblink conditioning (AU and AI). However, the correlation was not present for the young group of animals that underwent trace eyeblink conditioning (YC). We have included these correlations as supplementary figures (Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Figure 6—figure supplement 2) and included text in the subsections “Aging Decreases Persistent Firing Rate while Learning Increases Firing Rate”, “The Postburst AHP is altered with Aging and Learning in LEC III Pyramidal Neurons” and “Persistent Firing Properties are Dependent on ADP Size”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should provide and criteria for splitting the data into slow and medium AHP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included text explaining the criteria for splitting the postburst AHP into the medium and slow AHP (subsection “The Postburst AHP is altered with Aging and Learning in LEC III Pyramidal Neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should include text indicating the implications of the slower time to reach peak firing rate Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included text in the Discussion section indicating the implications of the slower time to reach peak firing rate amongst the aged group of animals (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Writing and Discussion:</p><p>1) The authors found the organization of the manuscript difficult to follow.

We understand the confusion regarding placing the postburst AHP, a mechanism underlying changes in persistent firing in Figure 1 before discussing persistent firing properties in Figure 2. We agree that placing the postburst AHP section after the comparisons of persistent firing properties in young and aged rats is better for organization. However, we wished to preserve the group comparisons that we had already done (i.e. young naïve vs. aged naïve and young conditioned vs. young pseudo vs. aged unimpaired vs. aged impaired). We believe the comparisons between young conditioned and aged unimpaired offered insight into the effects of aging-related changes to persistent firing on learning (i.e. that aged unimpaired and young conditioned reached the same level behaviorally but not in terms of persistent firing).</p><p>However, we do agree that there is insight to be gained from comparisons of learning on all young rats (i.e. young naïve vs. young conditioned vs. young pseudo) and on all aged rats (i.e. aged naïve vs. aged unimpaired vs. aged impaired). To that end, we have included supplementary figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplement 1; Figure 6—figure supplement 1) which shows the differences in persistent firing probability, persistent firing rate, postburst AHP amplitude, and ADP size amongst all young rats and all aged rats. We have also included text in the subsections “Successful Learning Enhances Persistent Firing Probability, and Learning Impairments are Associated with Lower Firing Probability”, “Aging Decreases Persistent Firing Rate while Learning Increases Firing Rate”, “The Postburst AHP is altered with Aging and Learning in LEC III Pyramidal Neurons” and “Persistent Firing Properties are Dependent on ADP Size”.</p><p>We have reorganized the manuscript as follows: 1) Comparison of persistent firing between young and aged naïve, 2) Comparison of persistent firing between young conditioned, young pseudoconditioned, aged unimpaired, and aged impaired, 3) Assessment of persistent firing rate and onset latency, 4) Assessment of postburst AHP, 5) Assessment of ADP, and 6) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the ADP.
