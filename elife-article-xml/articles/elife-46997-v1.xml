B-1 cells can, however, also rapidly respond to infections with increased local antibody production. The mechanisms regulating these two seemingly very distinct functions are poorly understood, but have been linked to expression of CD5, an inhibitor of BCR-signaling. Here we demonstrate that TLR-mediated activation of CD5+ B-1 cells induced the rapid reorganization of the IgM-BCR complex, leading to the eventual loss of CD5 expression, and a concomitant increase in BCR-downstream signaling, both in vitro and in vivo after infections of mice with influenza virus and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium.</italic> Both, initial CD5 expression and TLR-mediated stimulation, were required for the differentiation of B-1 cells to IgM-producing plasmablasts after infections. Thus, TLR-mediated signals support participation of B-1 cells in immune defense via BCR-complex reorganization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD5</kwd><kwd>B-1

binding by the TCR and BCR results in negative selection, leading to the removal of strongly self-reactive lymphocytes from the T and B cell repertoire. Depending on the strengths of these antigen-BCR interactions, self-reactive B cells undergo deletion, receptor-editing, or they become anergic, that is unresponsive to antigen-receptor engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melchers, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Self-reactive, anergic bone marrow-derived B cells up-regulate expression of the signaling inhibitor CD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hippen et al., 2000</xref>). On developing T cells, the levels of CD5 expression correlate with TCR signaling intensity encountered during thymic development, with those most strongly binding to self-antigens expressing the highest levels of CD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Punt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>). While several ligands have been proposed for CD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Punt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berland and Wortis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biancone et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bikah et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Lacey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calvo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pospisil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van de Velde et al., 1991</xref>), none seem to have significant CD5-dependent biological effects. Instead, CD5 expression seems to directly reduce antigen-receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hippen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Punt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perez-Villar et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, CD5 seems to act primarily as a component of the antigen-receptor complex, directly modulating TCR and BCR signaling.</p><p>In addition to anergic B cells, most B-1 cells also express CD5. In contrast to lymphocytes developing postnatal, these primarily fetal and neonatal-derived B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>) seem to undergo a positive selection step during development, requiring self-antigen recognition and strong BCR signaling. The lack of self-antigen expression, or the deletion of co-stimulatory molecules that enhance BCR signaling, diminished B-1 cell development, while deletion of negative co-stimulatory signals, or enhanced surface expression of the BCR, resulted in enhanced B-1a cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berland and Wortis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casola et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayakawa and Hardy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Specificity of CD5+ B-1 cells for self-antigens and self-antigen binding during development is consistent with their known self-reactive BCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayakawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lalor and Morahan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercolino et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and thus a role for CD5 in silencing B-1 cell responses to BCR-engagement in order to avert autoimmune responses.</p><p>Yet, not all B-1 cells express CD5, instead depending on their expression or not of CD5, they are typically divided into two subsets, B-1a and B-1b, respectively. In contrast to B-1b cells, and consistent with their expression of CD5, B-1a cells do not proliferate in response to BCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris and Rothstein, 1993</xref>). However, in CD5-/- mice and in mice in which the association of membrane IgM with CD5 was inhibited, mature B-1 cells demonstrated a proliferative response similar to that of conventional B (B-2) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tarakhovsky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bikah et al., 1996</xref>), further confirming that CD5 expression reduces B-1 cell responsiveness to BCR-signaling.</p><p>A BCR-signaling independent response of B-1 cells might be inferred from the fact that B-1 cells strongly respond to innate, TLR-mediated signals, such as LPS, and that they are a major source for ‘natural’ self-reactive IgM. Moreover, steady-state secretion of natural IgM does not appear to require external antigenic stimulation, as total serum levels of natural IgM and frequencies of IgM-secreting B-1 cells are similar in mice held under both, SPF and germfree housing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumgarth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochsenbein et al., 1999</xref>). However, natural IgM production is not stochastic, but instead likely driven by expression of self-antigens. This was demonstrated by Hayakawa et al, who showed a lack of anti-Thy-1 self-reactive IgM antibodies in the serum of Thy-1-deficient but not Thy-1 expressing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayakawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayakawa et al., 2003</xref>), as well as repertoire studies by Yang et al, which showed selective and extensive clonal expansion of certain CD5+ B-1 cell clones during the first 6 months of life, including in germfree mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, B-1 cells can be also actively involved in immune responses to various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alugupalli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alugupalli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gil-Cruz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Baumgarth, 2008</xref>). Given that CD5 is a BCR inhibitor, it was suggested that CD5- B-1b cells, but not B-1a cells, respond to pathogen encounters in an antigen-dependent manner. Haas and colleagues, conducting studies in CD19-deficient mice that lack B-1a development, concluded that B-1a cells are responsible for natural IgM secretion, while only the B-1b cells responded to <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, CD5- B-1b cells were shown to expand and secrete protective IgM after infection with <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alugupalli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alugupalli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gil-Cruz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>This model of a ‘division of labor’ between B-1a and B-1b cells leaves the B-1 cell response to influenza infection as an outlier. Chimeric mice reconstituted with either allotypically-marked CD5+ or CD5- B-1 cells showed that only CD5+ B-1 cells were responding in vivo to influenza infection with migration from the pleural cavity to the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MedLN) in a Type I IFN-dependent process, where they differentiated into IgM-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Baumgarth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waffarn et al., 2015</xref>). The reasons for the apparent different behaviors of CD5+ and CD5- B-1 cells in the various infectious disease models are unexplained. Furthermore, it is unclear how B-1 cells expressing CD5 can participate in antigen-specific immune responses.</p><p>This study addresses some of these questions and reconciles previous divergent findings on B-1 cell responses to infections by demonstrating that only CD5+ B-1 cells respond to influenza virus as well as <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections, but that once activated, these B-1 cells lose expression of CD5 and thus become ‘B-1b’ like. Mechanistically, the downregulation of CD5 requires expression of TLR, triggering of which resulted in the reorganization of the IgM-BCR complex. BCR reorganization led to the rapid dissociation, and then eventual loss of CD5 from the complex, and triggered enhanced IgM-CD19 and CD79:Syk interactions, resulting in enhanced down-stream BCR-signaling. Thus, TLR-mediated signals support participation of B-1 cells in immune defense via BCR-complex reorganization, linking innate and adaptive antigen-recognition by B-1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD5 negative B-1 cells are responsible for local IgM secretion after influenza infection</title><p>We previously identified three populations of cells involved in natural IgM secretion: CD5+ B-1 cells, CD5- B-1 cells, and plasma cells, the latter are CD19- and CD138/Blimp-1+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Savage et al., 2017</xref>) and also B-1-derived (B-1PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Savage et al., 2017</xref>). This was shown using a ‘neonatal chimera’ model, in which host B-1 cells are replaced in neonatal host mice by congenic but Ig-allotype-disparate donor B-1 cells, while the host B-2 cells remain of the host and thus its allotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lalor et al., 1989</xref>). After full reconstitution B-1 cells as well as their secreted IgM can be identified and quantified using allotype-specific anti-IgM (and anti-IgD) antibodies. Because B-1-derived IgM is important for protection from lethal influenza infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgarth et al., 2000</xref>), we sought to determine which B-1 cell populations generate IgM in the draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes (MedLN) after influenza infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Baumgarth, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Examination of the MedLN of neonatal chimeras showed that B-1 cells migrated to MedLN and then rapidly differentiated to IgM-secreting B-1PC on day seven after infection with influenza A Puerto Rico 8/34 (A/PR8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The MedLN B-1PC mostly lacked expression of CD5, particularly among the Blimp-1<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Also, the CD5+ Blimp-1-YFP+ cells expressed less Blimp-1-YFP than the CD5- Blimp-1-YFP+ B-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). The data were unexpected, as we had shown previously that only the CD19+CD43+CD5+but not the CD5- B-1 cells were able to migrate from the pleural cavity to the MedLN after influenza infection, where they differentiated into IgM-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Baumgarth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waffarn et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46997.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CD5 negative B-1 cells secrete most IgM in the mediastinal lymph nodes (MedLN) after influenza infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FACS plot of MedLN cells from day seven influenza-A/PR8-infected neonatal chimeric mice generated with Ighb B-1 donor cells and Igha host cells.

Also consistent with studies on the MedLN after influenza infection, we found a similar percentage of CD5+ and CD5- B-1 cells (identified as IgM<sup>b</sup>+IgM<sup>a</sup>-) in the MesLN and Peyer’s Patches on day four after infection, regardless of the initial percentage of CD5+ cells used to reconstitute the B-1 compartment of these mice .

The lack of responsiveness of the CD5+ B-1 cells to BCR-stimulation was explained by the PLA data, which showed the maintenance and even increase in IgM-BCR:CD5 association and an increase in the association of the inhibitor CD5 with CD19 following anti-IgM treatment. Furthermore, B-1 cells lost the interaction of the IgM-BCR with CD19. Consequently, CD79-Syk interactions remained very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, BCR-engagement on B-1 cells inhibits BCR-signaling by reducing steady-state IgM-CD19 interactions and likely also by initiating instead interactions between CD5 and CD19.</p><p>In contrast to direct stimulation of the IgM-BCR, CpG stimulation led to changes in the BCR-signaling complex that are consistent with induction of positive BCR-signaling, and/or the ability to signal through the antigen-receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The dissociation between the IgM-BCR and CD5 occurred within 24 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and thus significantly before the reduction in surface CD5 expression was measurable by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and before changes to CD5 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The already weak CD5:CD19 interaction was further reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), consistent with the eventual loss in surface CD5 expression noted following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These rapid changes in the BCR-signaling complex were associated with increases in CD79:Syk interaction, suggesting active BCR-signaling in CpG-stimulated B-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This was further supported by sustained increased levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt; pS473) following stimulation of CD5+ B-1 cells with CpG, while anti-IgM stimulation reduced pAkt levels below that of unstimulated B-1 cells by 24 hr, after an initial increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Given that B-1 cell responses following CpG-stimulation were TLR-expression dependent in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and no external antigen was provided to the cultures, TLR-signaling may directly link to BCR-signaling.

This was shown previously to be associated with their expression of the BCR-signaling inhibitor CD5, and a lack of fully functional CD19 signaling. It is consistent with the notion that these self-reactive cells must be silenced in order to avert the risk of autoimmune disease induction. Yet B-1 cells do respond rapidly to various infections with migration to secondary lymphoid tissues and with differentiation to IgM secreting cells. The present study resolves this conundrum by providing a mechanism by which B-1 cell can overcome their inherent BCR-signaling block, namely the TLR-mediated activation and reorganization of the BCR-signalosome complex. This non-redundant signal induced the dissociation of CD5 from the IgM-BCR and eventual its loss from the cell surface of the initially CD5-expressing B-1 cells. It also enhanced the association between IgM and the co-stimulatory molecule CD19, and caused strong increases in CD79:Syk interaction and phosphorylation of BCR downstream effectors.</p><p>The study also clarifies the respective roles of the CD5+ and CD5- B-1 cells, previously suggested to form two distinct subsets ‘B-1a’ and ‘B-1b’.

This is consistent with previous reports on the phenotype of natural IgM-secreting cells as mostly CD5- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Savage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohdan et al., 2000</xref>), and could explain earlier reports that CD5+, not CD5- B-1 cells form natural IgM secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masmoudi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayakawa et al., 1984</xref>). In addition, it could explain the findings that CD5- B-1 cells contain CD5- memory-like B-1 cells in the body cavities of previously infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alugupalli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foote and Kearney, 2009</xref>) which also likely respond to antigen.</p><p>Thus, the data presented here and in the accompanying work by Kreuk and colleagues are inconsistent with models that consider B-1 cell responses as a division of labor between two subsets of B-1 cells: B-1a and B-1b cells, where CD5+ B-1a contribute ‘natural’ IgM and CD5- B-1b the induced IgM, proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alugupalli and Gerstein, 2005</xref>). Given CD5 expression is dynamically expressed and thus cannot be used to identify B-1 cell subsets, and no other clearly subset-defining differences have been reported to-date, we suggest that the separation of B-1 cells into B-1a and B-1b ‘sister populations’ be revoked, and that instead these cells are simply referred to as B-1 cells. If distinctions in CD5 expression are important, those could be indicated by describing B-1 cells as CD5+/CD5- instead.</p><p>Our data do not exclude the possibility that some B-1 cells develop which either express no, or undetectable levels of surface CD5, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kantor et al., 1992</xref>).

It remains to be explored whether the presence of DAMPS in the in vitro cultures could contribute to the loss of CD5 on otherwise CD5+ B-1 cells, or whether these cells never expressed CD5. Our data are not consistent with early reports suggesting that CD5+ B-1 cells could only reconstitute themselves, but not CD5- B-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kantor et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stall et al., 1992</xref>), as reconstitution of neonatal mice with even very highly FACS-purified body cavity CD5+ B-1 cells led to significant numbers of CD5- B-1 cells recovered from these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Baumgarth, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which the TLR-induced reorganization of the BCR-signalosome drives the differentiation of B-1 cells to IgM-secreting B-1PC will require future in-depth analysis. We favor the concept of a ‘licensing’ step, in which initial TLR-stimulation supports subsequent BCR-stimulation through the here observed reorganization of the BCR-signalosome. This is supported also by the in vitro studies which demonstrated that an initial engagement of the TLR could overcome the block in B-1 cell proliferation after BCR stimulation, while an initial BCR stimulus followed by TLR stimulation failed to induce B-1 cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Such a licensing step may explain the recent data by Kreuk and colleagues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreuk et al., 2019</xref>), which showed a degree of B-1 response specificity, and thus presumably BCR-responsiveness, that was dependent on the type of TLR stimulus provided to the B-1 cell. However, how such licensing step could induce antigen-specific B-1 cell responses that are dependent on the specificity of the TLR remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p>An attractive alternative and perhaps simpler concept would be that the BCR-mediated binding to antigen and then its uptake by BCR-internalization leads to engagement of particular TLR, which then synergize with BCR-mediated stimulation and support the strong proliferation and differentiation of antigen-specific B cells. This concept is very consistent with the outcome of B-2 cell stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), where TLR stimulation strongly and synergistically enhanced the initial BCR-mediated activation of these cells. However, the model cannot explain the complete lack of B-1 cell proliferation in response to BCR-engagement, the strong inhibition of TLR-mediated proliferation when preceded by BCR-engagement, and the BCR-signaling induced enhanced unresponsiveness of the BCR signalosome at the molecular level, as demonstrated by a failure to enhance CD79:syk interaction and upregulation of pAkt.</p><p>A potential third model would involve a direct linkage of TLR and BCR-signalosome effects. For example, low-affinity BCR-antigen interactions might be enabled by having DAMPS and PAMPS first bind to TLR on the B cell surface, which then brings these antigens in close proximity to the BCR, triggering antigen-specific BCR activation event. Although in some cultures we did not provide antigens other than the TLR-ligands to the in vitro cultures, dead and dying cells provide ample antigens, including PTC, that could have stimulated these cells. This would potentially explain why the stimulation of B-1 cells with TLR-agonists activates BCR signaling pathways, and why we found such strong enrichment for PTC-binders among cultures of TLR-stimulated B-1 cells. However, not all TLR are expressed on the cell surface, and their initial engagement prior to that of the BCR would necessitate the initial BCR-independent phagocytosis of antigen by B-1 cells, which others have reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Popi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The lack of phenotypic differences between CD5- B-1 cells and B-2 cell-derived non-switched plasmablasts, both expressing CD19, CD43, low levels of CD45 and lack IgD, further complicates the identification of responding B cell subsets in vivo, as demonstrated with the analysis to the <italic>Salmonella</italic> antigen OmpD. Using allotype-marked B cell lineages, we show here that anti-OmpD secreting B cells were derived predominantly from B-2 cells, and not as previously suggested from B-1b cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gil-Cruz et al., 2009</xref>). When CD5+ B-1 cells lose CD5, some also seem to begin to express CD138, thus becoming indistinguishable from B-2-derived plasma cells and plasmablasts that carry the same phenotype. Some investigators used expression of CD11b to identify B-1 versus B-2 cells in infectious models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gil-Cruz et al., 2009</xref>), but this marker is also dynamically regulated depending on tissue site and B-1 cell activation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waffarn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohdan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Recent lineage-tracing approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2016</xref>) may help the development of novel approaches or markers that can unequivocally identify B-1 cells. In the meantime, the use of neonatal B-1 allotype-chimeras remains a valuable tool for such analyzes.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that the BCR-complex composition on neonatally-derived, self-reactive B-1 cells is controlled by TLR-mediated signals, preventing inappropriate activation and autoimmune disease on the one hand, while facilitating rapid B-1 cell participation in anti-viral and anti-bacterial infections on the other. TLR-signaling thereby influences not only innate B-1 cell activation, but may also affect their antigen-specific responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse) musculus (mouse), C57BL/6J (M + F)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6, <break/>Control, Ighb</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock 000664</td><td valign="top"><italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse), C57BL/6J (M + F)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">Igha</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock 001317</td><td valign="top">Mouse, B6.Cg- Gpi1aThy1aIgha/J (M + F)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">BALB/C</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock 000651</td><td valign="top">Mouse, BALB/CJ mice (F)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">Blimp-1YFP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rutishauser et al., 2009</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Breeding pairs from Michel Nussenzweig (The Rockefeller University) <break/>Mouse, B6-Cg- Tg(PRDM1- EYFP)^(1Mnz) (M + F)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">TLR-/-</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Breeding pairs from Greg Barton (The University of California, Berkeley) <break/>Mouse, Tlr2-/- Tlr4-/- Unc93b1^(3d/3d) (M + F)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">Chimera</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lalor et al., 1989</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generated in-house <break/>Mouse, Igha/Ighb B-1 Cell Neonatal Chimera</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">Chimera</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lalor et al., 1989</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generated in-house <break/>Mouse, Igha/Ighb- YFP B-1 Cell Neonatal Chimera</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>8-16 week old male and female C57BL/6J or female BALB/c mice and breeding pairs of B6.Cg-<italic>Gpi1<sup>a</sup>Thy1<sup>a</sup>Igh<sup>a</sup>/</italic>J (Igh<sup>a</sup>) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Thank you very much for your patience in the reviewing process. Since the paper was submitted with &quot;B cell receptor and TLR signaling coordinate to control distinct B-1 responses to both self and the microbiota&quot; by Dr Barton and colleagues, we aimed to secure reviewers (Nos. 1 and 2) for both papers, so that the complementary nature could be fairly considered. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>A key point in the discussion was the B cell-intrinsic nature of the TLR signaling in the other paper. We have requested a revision of both papers, and we would be grateful if you could liaise especially on this point to call out the complementarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Baumgarth et al. describe their discovery and characterization of a novel mechanism by which innate signals can license B1 cells to respond to antigen receptor signaling and produce IgM. Specifically, they show that B cell-intrinsic TLR signaling can trigger the downregulation of the inhibitor of BCR signaling CD5, which effectively blocks antigen recognition-based activation of CD5+ B-1 cells. In so doing, the authors resolve multiple long-standing mysteries surrounding the mechanisms by which CD5+ B1 cells respond to antigen-dependent stimuli, overturn previously held views regarding the cellular origins of specific IgM responses, and uncover a defined mechanism by which B cells integrate innate and adaptive stimuli. The experiments that support these main conclusions are both elegant and, in my opinion, performed to an exceptionally high standard-e.g., the extensive use of neonatal B-1 allotype-chimeras enabled detailed and definitive examinations of the roles of B cell subsets in vivo. Overall, I have little to criticize regarding the veracity of the work and believe that this will be an important paper. My one remaining confusion has to do with the order of engagement of the innate versus adaptive stimuli. The authors speculate a bit about this in the discussion, but as far as I can tell don't directly address this experimentally. To me, the logical order of events under in vivo conditions (in response to self-derived debris or infection) would be BCR mediated uptake of complexes that contain innate stimuli. However, the experiments performed by the authors in vitro instead seem to test the opposite scenario-where TLR activation precedes BCR activation and licenses B cells to respond to antigen. I think that a few additional in vitro experiments that address how the timing of exposure to these signals affects B1 responsiveness could at least begin to clarify some of these issues and thus improve the paper. For example, does prior engagement of the BCR in CD5+ B1 cells stabilize the inhibitory complex and prevent future licensing by TLRs? Also, can CD5+ B1 cells acquire antigen through BCR mediated endocytosis despite the blunting of signaling by CD5 (the answer to this may already be known)? If not, then how do they respond to TLR stimuli such as nucleic acids from dying cells that would typically be recognized in endosomes after BCR-mediated endocytosis? Or, is this licensing in vivo restricted mostly to TLR ligands that can either signal on the cell surface or be readily acquired by other mechanisms (pinocytosis)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors showed that CD5 negative B1 cells were the source of IgM producing cells in the draining lymph nodes upon influenza infection. These CD5 negative B1 cells were originally CD5 positive B1 cells, and down-regulated CD5 expression during cell proliferation upon TLR stimulation. In vitro experiments showed that the down-regulation of CD5 was at the level of gene expression, and was not due to the expansion of contaminated originally CD5 negative B1 cells. The B1 cells secreted significantly higher amount of IgM after the down-regulation of CD5 when stimulated with TLR ligands. An in vivo approach using neonatal chimeric mice showed that CD5 positive B1 cells lose CD5 expression in the draining lymph nodes upon influenza or <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, and these CD5 negative B1 cells secrete high amount of IgM. The molecular analysis of purified B1 cells showed that the down-regulation of CD5 enhanced the BCR signaling by releasing from the suppressive effect of CD5. Finally, TLR-/- CD5 positive B1 cells were not able to down-regulate CD5 and thus failed to elicit IgM response upon the influenza infection.</p><p>This study addressed a long-standing question how B1 cells secrete a large amount of IgM by rapidly responding to infections. Importantly, the authors demonstrated that IgM-producing CD5 negative B1b cells that were previously thought different origin from CD5 positive B1a cells, were phenotypically indistinguishable from TLR-stimulated B1a cells. This finding is exciting in the field of B1 cell biology, as it requests reconsideration for the interpretation of previous studies.</p><p>In general, the experiments were well done, but the data presentation and explanations could be improved. For example, some of the data could be moved to supplementary information to improve readability. In addition, some more elaboration would be required for a few of the data (see below). Although it is not strictly required, the hypothesis that TLR-signaling may &quot;license&quot; BCR-dependent reaction could be more deeply explored, as it is functionally important. For example, in Figure 7, what happens for the BCR-signaling in vitro if B1 cells are stimulated both with TLR-ligands and anti-IgM? Also, in Figure 8, does VDJ repertoire skew upon influenza infection due to the &quot;licensed BCR reaction&quot; in WT B1 cells, which may be disappeared in TLR-/- B1 cells?

This was already known, however Savage and colleagues here demonstrate that CD5+ B1 cells are the actual TLR-responsive cells, and that TLR signaling activates these cells and results in downregulation of CD5. Potentially, this leads to disruption of CD5-IgM-BCR association and allows for subsequent BCR-medicated signaling, also the latter is not demonstrated.</p><p>This manuscript proposes a model in which CD5- B1 cells (B1b cells) are derived from CD5+ B1 cells (B1a cells), and reflect a post-activation state. This opposes the theory of 'division of labor' of B1a and B1b cells.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the data are well presented. The overall message is interesting and adds to our knowledge of these innate-like B cells.</p><p>Questions/remarks:</p><p>1) As a general remark, the authors mostly focus on secondary lymphoid tissues, in which the differentiation into plasma cells probably occurs. Why do the authors not investigate the body cavities, where initial activation of B1 cells occurs? Downregulation of CD5 likely already occurs at this site.</p><p>2) What is the rationale of choosing the neonatal chimeric model as described in the Materials and methods for pleural cavity and mediastinal lymph node B1 cells, as the model is peritoneum-oriented (anti-IgM treatment and transfer of cells is i.p.)? This should be better explained.</p><p>3) The authors should include the transfer of CD5- cells as a control (now only 100% CD5+, 99% or 95% CD5+). Do CD5-B1 cells also upregulate CD138 upon TLR signaling?</p><p>4) Is there plasticity of CD5+ and CD5- B1 cells or is their fate set (in the pre-PC differentiated state)? mRNA (Figure 2) suggests transcriptional regulation of CD5 expression by TLR signaling (is this significant?). Is CD5 mRNA and surface expression restored upon removal of TLR agonists in vitro? This could be easily tested, and would add to the message of this manuscript.</p><p>5) Figure 6: the PLA data are difficult to interpret and may be redundant, as CD5 surface expression was already been shown to be lost upon TLR signals. This obviously affects the assay and it is thus questionable as of whether these results are useful. In addition, how can CD5 be detected in the PLA in CD5- B1 cells? (Figure 6A, panel 3).</p><p>6) Many plots are gated from IgM+cells (i.e. Figure 1A and Figure 8A): is it possible that the authors miss populations, as the B1 cells may have already undergone CSR, for example to IgA? Did they check for IgA+ or IgG+ B1-like cells? (dump-CD23-CD43+CD19<sup>+</sup>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46997.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A key point in the discussion was the B cell-intrinsic nature of the TLR signaling in the other paper.

The question raised by this reviewer (and also reviewer #2) is very important and one we are currently considering how best to explore in the future. We agree that the order of stimulation (BCR/TLR) is not fully addressed in this manuscript. We expect additional extensive work is required to fully address this critical point which we believe to be outside the scope of this manuscript. However, in response to the comment, we have conducted additional experiments in vitro, now shown in a new Figure 7 and subsection “Initial stimulation through IgM-BCR suppresses subsequent activation of B-1 cells via TLR- stimulation” of the revised manuscript, in which we studied the effects of pulsed stimulation with one stimuli (either BCR or TLR for 2h and 24h followed by wash-out), followed by exposure to the second stimulus (for 70h and 48h, respectively). At 72h after initial stimulation we measured B-1 cell proliferation.</p><p>Stimulation for 2h with either ligand, followed by 70h stimulation with the other ligand showed no significant difference compared to 72h stimulation with the second stimulus alone (data not shown). However, when we exposed B-1 cells to the first stimulus for 24h and then the other stimulus for an additional 48h we found significant effects. Stimulation first with anti-IgM (BCR-signaling) and then CpG resulted in significant reductions in B-1 cell proliferation compared to stimulation only with CpG. In contrast, 24h stimulation with CpG followed by 48h stimulation via the BCR resulted in significant enhanced B-1 cell proliferation compared to BCR stimulation alone, however, still less than CpG only (Figure 7).</p><p>The data indicate that TLR stimulation must proceed BCR-stimulation for B-1 cells to be able to maximally respond to the innate stimulus. These data are consistent with the PLA experiments, which suggested strong BCR signaling-enhancing effects of TLR stimulation, while initial BCR stimulation enhanced the dissociation of the BCR with positive signaling components of the BCR complex.</p><p>How these findings relate to the findings by Barton and colleagues in the companion paper, in which they find effects of TLR-signaling on antigen specificity of the B cell response is now outlined in more detail in paragraphs two, three and five of the Discussion section.</p><p>Our current view is that the TLR-signal enhances potential responsiveness of B-1 cells in vivo, followed by a BCR-mediated signal that would then drive antigen-specific expansion of those cells that have already received a TLR signal. We are not aware of studies that have studied antigen uptake via BCR-internalization by B-1 cells. There are reports, however, that B-1 cells can uptake antigen via phagocytosis (Popi, Longo-Maugeri and Mariano, 2016), which would explain engagement of specific endosomal TLRs without first engagement and internalization of the BCR. This clearly requires further exploration, which we believe is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Importantly, for conventional B cells TLR-mediated stimulation may function quite differently, given their ability to vigorously respond to BCR-signaling alone. Here antigen-binding via the BCR would cause antigen/BCR-internalization and then exposure of the antigen to endosomal TLRs, enhancing antigen-specific responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors showed that CD5 negative B1 cells were the source of IgM producing cells in the draining lymph nodes upon influenza infection.

We have now moved part of our data into two supplemental figures.

Figure 5—figure supplement 1 now contains the data from the <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection experiments, which demonstrate that similar to what was observed after influenza infection, it is the CD5+ B-1 cell that responds to infection with downregulation of CD5 and differentiation to an IgM secreting cell.

We agree that assessing the repertoire of B-1 cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes of influenza infected mice would be highly informative. Unfortunately, this is also a very challenging study to do, given the small numbers of B-1 cells that can be obtained from one mouse (about 2,000 – 5,000 total B-1 cells per animal). We hope that recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing will help us to do this in the future. In terms of overall influenza-binding IgM-secreting cells, we previously published (Choi and Baumgarth, 2008) that the frequency of influenza-binding cells was similar in the MedLN between days 7 and 10 after infection and also similar compared to splenic B-1 cells prior to infection by ELISPOT analysis. Thus, we were unable to demonstrate influenza-specific clonal expansion. Thus, either the ELISPOT analysis lacked the necessary sensitivity to demonstrate expansion of influenza-binding B-1 cells, or the specificity of B-1 cells might be direct against altered self-antigens, rather than influenza virus and thus possibly triggered by DAMPS rather than PAMPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points:</p><p>Results section, paragraph four.</p><p>B-1(Igha) and B-2(Ighb) cells should read B-1(Ighb) and B-2(Igha) cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake – it has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results section, paragraph five.</p><p>“we expanded the analysis to include all IgM<sup>b</sup>-expressing (B-1 donor-derived) and IgM<sup>a</sup>- (recipient-derived) cells, regardless of expression of CD19 or other surface markers.” Please provide the gating strategy together with Figure 1F, as this gating is important to show the increased CD5-negative population.</p></disp-quote><p>In response we expanded the data shown to include all IgM<sup>b</sup>-expressing (B-1 donor-derived) and IgM<sup>a</sup>- (recipient-derived) cells, regardless of expression of CD19 or other surface markers.

In short, the question we attempted to address was whether the expanding population of CD5- cells we see emerge after stimulation of B-1 cells with TLRs could have arisen from small contaminations with CD5- cells that would survive better and/or proliferate stronger in response to the stimulus. We did not find that this was the case. Instead, if anything CD5- cells spiked into the cultures died faster and proliferated less than the CD5+ cells. From that we concluded that the increase in CD5<sup>lo/-</sup> cells in the culture was due to the loss of CD5 expression of originally CD5+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results paragraph eight: Figure 3J-K should read Figure 2J-K.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved this data now into the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and reordered the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C-D: Why did the authors use Mtb lipids?

B-1 cells are often somewhat more prevalent in females than in males. However, overall we found that the lymph nodes had similar levels of IgM secretion (5C).

This was already known, however Savage and colleagues here demonstrate that CD5+ B1 cells are the actual TLR-responsive cells, and that TLR signaling activates these cells and results in downregulation of CD5. Potentially, this leads to disruption of CD5-IgM-BCR association and allows for subsequent BCR-medicated signaling, also the latter is not demonstrated.</p><p>This manuscript proposes a model in which CD5- B1 cells (B1b cells) are derived from CD5+ B1 cells (B1a cells), and reflect a post-activation state. This opposes the theory of 'division of labor' of B1a and B1b cells.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the data are well presented. The overall message is interesting and adds to our knowledge of these innate-like B cells.</p><p>Questions/remarks:</p><p>1) As a general remark, the authors mostly focus on secondary lymphoid tissues, in which the differentiation into plasma cells probably occurs. Why do the authors not investigate the body cavities, where initial activation of B1 cells occurs?Downregulation of CD5 likely already occurs at this site.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As we outlined in the Introduction of the manuscript, our previous work has shown that the cells entering the MedLN after influenza infection are nearly exclusively CD5+ B-1 cells (Choi and Baumgarth, 2008; Waffarn et al., 2015). The activation signal that traps these cells in the draining lymph node was shown by us to be the activation of the integrin CD11b, which was flipped into an active state via Type I IFNR signaling of pleural cavity B-1 cells by 2-days following influenza infection. At that timepoint the cells express CD5 at normal levels. While total numbers of CD5+ B-1 cells decline in the pleural cavity, the CD5- cells stay unaltered, suggesting that the CD5+ cells leave the pleural cavity before downregulating CD5 (Waffarn et al., 2015). We also generated CD5- only chimeras to demonstrate that CD5- B-1 cells cannot enter the lymph nodes (Choi et al., 2008). Based on these data, and the fact that IgM responses occur in the lymph nodes and not the body cavities, our focus has been on the secondary lymphoid tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the rationale of choosing the neonatal chimeric model as described in the Materials and methods for pleural cavity and mediastinal lymph node B1 cells, as the model is peritoneum-oriented (anti-IgM treatment and transfer of cells is i.p.)? This should be better explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity. The only way to inject a newborn mouse with B-1 cells is via the i.p. route. As was established in the original protocols we cited in the Materials and methods section and our own subsequent work (Lalor et al., 1989, Baumgarth et al., 1999, Baumgarth et al., 2000, Choi and Baumgarth, 2008, Choi et al., 2012, Waffarn et al., 2015 and Savage et al., 2017), subsequent to their injection i.p. B-1 cells in the neonate will expand into all compartments of the mouse, including both pleural and peritoneal cavities, spleen, bone marrow, all lymph nodes tested (mesenteric, mediastinal, inguinal, axillaris, cervical) as well as the gastrointestinal tract (Kroese et al., 1989) and lung (Baumgarth, unpublished). Thus, rather than seeing this chimera as a mouse with peritoneal cavity B-1 cells of a different allotype, the chimera has nearly all of its B-1 cell compartment exchanged for that of the donor. We have expanded the Materials and methods subsection “Chimera generation” to provide more information on these chimeras. We have also clarified the rationale for the use of the chimeras in the manuscript text in the first and fifth paragraphs of the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should include the transfer of CD5- cells as a control (now only 100% CD5+, 99% or 95% CD5+). Do CD5-B1 cells also upregulate CD138 upon TLR signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have previously conducted such a study and demonstrated that mice reconstituted with only CD5- B-1 cells have only very few MedLN B-1 cells and of those few that made it (about 200 B-1 cells in the entire lymph node), 65% of which expressed CD5, potential contaminants of our FACS-sorts, although we cannot exclude “reversion” to CD5+ status (Choi et al., 2008). For that reason we felt it was better in this manuscript to provide a range of mixes of CD5+ and CD5-, as this would expand on the data, by enabling us to correlate the secretion of IgM and CD5 expression with reconstitution frequencies. Importantly, our hypothesis to be tested was that CD5+ cells would lose CD5 expression. We now provide a more detailed description of that previous experiment and the rationale for the study, as conducted in subsection “CD5+ B-1 cells become CD5- IgM ASC in the MedLN after Influenza infection”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is there plasticity of CD5+ and CD5- B1 cells or is their fate set (in the pre-PC differentiated state)? mRNA (Figure 2) suggests transcriptional regulation of CD5 expression by TLR signaling (is this significant?). Is CD5 mRNA and surface expression restored upon removal of TLR agonists in vitro? This could be easily tested, and would add to the message of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We have analyzed CD5 expression in cells that were pulsed with CpGs followed by 2-day exposure to anti-IgM stimulation or medium only. During that timeframe we did not see what appeared to be reexpression CD5 (not shown). The difficulty with interpretation of the data from those experiments is, however, that not all cells are stimulated to lose CD5 and it is not clear whether those expressing CD5 never lost its expression or potentially re-expressed it. Thus, although a “simple question” in principle, experimentally this is not quite as easy to address. Additional experiments that would test the effects of BCR-stimulation and/or removal of CpG stimulation followed by conditions that allowed B-1 cell survival without further stimulation would need to be developed, which we believe to be outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6: the PLA data are difficult to interpret and may be redundant, as CD5 surface expression was already been shown to be lost upon TLR signals. This obviously affects the assay and it is thus questionable as of whether these results are useful. In addition, how can CD5 be detected in the PLA in CD5- B1 cells? (Figure 6A, panel 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the PLA data to be of utmost important for interpretation of our studies. They demonstrate effects of CpG stimulation and BCR-engagement that are much more fine-grained than we can measure by surface staining only. What they demonstrate is that CD5 association with IgM is actually rapidly enhanced after BCR-signaling, while it is lost upon stimulation with CpGs – even at a time where the CD5 protein is still expressed on the cell surface. Thus, we see changes in the BCR complex configuration well before we see a loss of surface expression of CD5. Furthemore, we demonstrate effects of CpG stimulation on CD79a:Syk interaction, clearly linking TLR and BCR-complex signals.</p><p>To more clearly make this point we have rewritten the corresponding text in paragraph three of subsection “Changes in BCR signaling following innate activation of B-1 cells”. The very low frequencies expression of CD5 on the CD5- cell are presumably small impurities in the FACS-sort. We chose a figure that include one of those impurities for fullest disclosure, but as can be seen in the summary figure there frequencies are very low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Many plots are gated from IgM+cells (i.e. Figure 1A and Figure 8A): is it possible that the authors miss populations, as the B1 cells may have already undergone CSR, for example to IgA? Did they check for IgA+ or IgG+ B1-like cells? (dump-CD23-CD43+CD19<sup>+</sup>)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Previous work by us (Baumgarth et al., 1999) showed that for those antibodies for which we can discern allotypic differences (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a/c), the major contribution of B-1 cells was the generation of IgM. Hence we have focused on this response in our work and the goal of this manuscript is the study of IgM responses by B-1 cells. We agree with the reviewer, however, that B-1 cells may generate other isotypes. Of particular interest is IgG3. We showed data supporting strong contributions of IgG3 by B-1 cells in the steady state (Savage et al., 2017) and our colleagues in the Barton lab found previously that much microbial antibodies are of the IgG3 isotype that are generated by B-1 cells (Koch et al., 2016). The companion paper outlines their follow-up work (Kreuk et al., 2019). Unfortunately, IgG3 has no allotypic variation among mouse strains, and thus our chimera approach cannot distinguish B-1 from B-2-derived antibody secretion. In unpublished studies we looked at IgA production in the lung tissue before and after influenza infection and found the levels of IgA-production by B-1 cells to not be affected by the infection (Baumgarth, not published). However, a more detailed analysis on the MedLN might be warranted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
