The core subunit SMARCB1 is required for early embryonic survival, and mutations can give rise to atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) in the pediatric central nervous system. We report that in contrast to other studied systems, SMARCB1 represses bivalent genes in hESCs and antagonizes chromatin accessibility at super-enhancers. Moreover, and consistent with its established role as a CNS tumor suppressor, we find that SMARCB1 is essential for neural induction but dispensable for mesodermal or endodermal differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SMARCB1 is essential for hESC super-enhancer silencing in neural differentiation conditions. This genomic assessment of hESC chromatin regulation by SMARCB1 reveals a novel positive regulatory function at super-enhancers and a unique lineage-specific role in regulating hESC differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45672.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our bodies contain trillions of cells that play a wide variety of roles. Despite looking and behaving very differently to one another, all of these ‘mature’ cells somehow descend from a single fertilized egg that contains just one set of genes. This process is partially controlled by how ‘accessible’ genetic material is to the cell machinery that switches genes on or off. For example, in immature brain cells, genes required for memory are accessible, but genes needed to produce bone are not.</p><p>The developing embryo needs to control gene accessibility carefully to ensure that the right genes become available at the right time, and that crucial genes are not incorrectly ‘hidden’. In humans, the protein SMARCB1 plays an important role in this process: if damaged or deleted, development will be severely disrupted, sometimes causing brain cancer early in life. However, it remains unclear how exactly SMARCB1 regulates the accessibility of its ‘target’ genes. Now, Langer et al. set out to answer this question, and also to determine which parts of the body need SMARCB1 to develop properly.</p><p>Human stem cells can develop into multiple mature cell types if given the right signals. Langer et al. found reducing levels of SMARCB1 prevented stem cells from maturing into brain cells, but not other kinds of cells. This suggests that SMARCB1 has a specific role in brain development, which is consistent with its devastating effect on brain health when damaged.</p><p>A detailed analysis of genetic activity and DNA accessibility showed that SMARCB1 was doing this by switching off specific regions of DNA, called stem cell super-enhancers. These regions normally enhance the activity of genes that maintain stem cells in their immature state: when certain super-enhancers are turned off by SMARCB1, this allows stem cells to progress towards a brain cell fate.</p><p>These results help us understand why damage to SMARCB1 during development causes brain cancer more often than other kinds of cancer. In the future, they could also help explain how certain types of cancer form, which would be the first step towards knowing how to treat them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SMARCB1</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>super-enhancer</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>accessibility</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01 ES071006-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Archer</surname><given-names>Trevor K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM120018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>Lee F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The chromatin remodeler and tumor suppressor SMARCB1 acts to restrict superenhancer function to direct neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells while repressing bivalent gene activity in the pluripotent state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Given the near complete uniformity of the DNA sequence across cell types, the regulation of chromatin accessibility, and thereby gene activity, is critical for all stages of development, including the initial fate decisions of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Accordingly, it has been observed that widespread chromatin re-organization occurs during ESC differentiation via the activity of multiple chromatin-remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lessard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>). One of the most studied of these complexes in terms of the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation is the <underline>SWI</underline>tch/<underline>S</underline>ucrose <underline>N</underline>on-<underline>F</underline>ermentable (SWI/SNF) complex. In mESCs and hESCs, the SWI/SNF complex is composed of SMARCA4 and several core subunits, including SMARCB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Complex activity as a whole is essential for the full complement of pluripotency in ESCs and appears to function widely, regulating accessibility and transcription at promoters, active and poised enhancers, as well as at pluripotency factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">King and Klose, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hodges et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The roles of certain SWI/SNF subunits have been examined in the context of hESC pluripotency and differentiation; for example, separate studies have detailed the requirement of SMARCC2 in the maintenance of self-renewal and revealed that its negative regulation by the microRNA mir-302 is essential for efficient definitive endodermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wade et al., 2015</xref>). However, the functions of most subunits in hESCs have not been considered, and no data are available on how they regulate chromatin accessibility in this cell type.</p><p>The core SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1 is required for embryonic survival past implantation in mice and therefore likely has essential roles in early cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2000</xref>). SMARCB1 is also a potent tumor suppressor, being mutated or deleted in nearly all atypical rhabdoid/teratoid tumors (AT/RTs), aggressive cancers that primarily affect the central nervous system and which can be diagnosed at very young ages, even prenatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pawel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Negahban et al., 2010</xref>). Whether AT/RT-like tumors develop in mouse models is highly sensitive to the timing of SMARCB1 inactivation. Specifically, deletion at embryonic day (E)6 – E7 leads to highly penetrant CNS tumors, whereas deletion at subsequent time points has lower penetrance or no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that a more undifferentiated state is necessary for tumorigenesis. Recent studies in SMARCB1-null cell lines have revealed that its reintroduction results in the widespread recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex to previously unoccupied enhancers, the activation of these enhancers, and the resolution of bivalency at promoters toward an active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>). However, these findings are somewhat in disagreement as regards SMARCB1 activity at super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>), with different groups reporting either a requirement or dispensability of SMARCB1 in targeting the SWI/SNF complex to super-enhancers and maintaining the active H3K27ac histone marks ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We sought to explore the transcriptional and genomic impact of SMARCB1 loss in steady state and differentiating hESCs, focusing on the role of this subunit in enhancer architecture and differentiation. We find that <italic>SMARCB1</italic> knockdown (KD) leads to widespread transcriptional upregulation in hESCs, with an enrichment in bivalent genes, as well as differential effects on enhancer and superenhancer accessibility. Directed differentiation assays subsequently revealed that loss of SMARCB1 activity strongly inhibits neural induction in a lineage-specific manner. These findings reveal a precise requirement for SMARCB1 in the earliest stages of development and indicate a complex, state-specific role in enhancer regulation. These results will be relevant to additional developmental stages and pathological processes, including oncogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SMARCB1 protein reduction relieves repression of bivalent genes in hESCs</title><p>To assess the function of SMARCB1 in steady state hESCs, H1 cells were transduced with lentiviral constructs carrying a doxycycline-inducible shRNA against <italic>SMARCB1</italic> or a non-targeting control (<italic>NTC</italic>) region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), followed by treatment with 1 µM doxycycline (dox) for two or three days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meerbrey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Silva et al., 2005</xref>). qPCR analysis and western blotting revealed strong downregulation of SMARCB1 at the transcript and protein levels, whereas dox-treated cells expressing the <italic>NTC</italic> control shRNA showed no such reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The component functions within this category consisted of processes involved in multiple developmental processes, including neural development, angiogenesis, and genitourinary system development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the pathway analysis, qPCR for several early markers of the three germ layers all showed upregulation following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD, including <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>SOX1</italic>, <italic>BRN2</italic> (ectoderm), <italic>BRACHYURY</italic>, <italic>GOOSECOID</italic> (mesoderm), and <italic>CXCR4</italic> (endoderm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walther and Gruss, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bylund et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ro and Dawid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). As SMARCB1 was recently reported to activate bivalent gene transcription upon reintroduction into SMARCB1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, we assessed the set of differentially affected genes based on their histone modification characteristics, using previously defined genes sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2007</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that genes upregulated by <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD were more than 50% more enriched in bivalent genes than the total considered gene set (29% vs. 18%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A similar percentage (28%) of the small number of downregulated genes were also bivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Notably, when considering the most highly upregulated genes, the percentage of bivalent genes was nearly 3-fold that of the considered gene set (51% vs. 18%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with this result, we found that the TSS (±2.5 kb) of all upregulated genes significantly overlapped with the hESC ChIPseq binding sites of several members of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), including EZH2 (4.7e-12) and SUZ12 (1.0e-4), as well as the repressive histone marks H3K27me3 (1.5e-25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also tested for enrichment for the only SWI/SNF subunit for which ChIPseq data are available in this cell type, the catalytic subunit SMARCA4. Although these peaks did not emerge as significantly enriched near the TSS of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), this is largely due to SMARCA4 being highly biologically enriched at most promoters in hESCs. Specifically, SMARCA4 peaks are present at 16,031/17,462 (92%) of the considered genes in the RNAseq analysis, whereas these values were 90% and 88% for up- and downregulated genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). SMARCB1 therefore appears to function largely as a transcriptional repressor in hESCs, particularly at bivalent genes, in contrast to what has been reported in experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and several null tumor cell lines, including TTC-1240 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD differentially affects chromatin accessibility at key regions associated with hESC identity</title><p>To interrogate the chromatin effects of decreased SMARCB1 levels, we performed the chromatin accessibility assay ATACseq on cells subjected to <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD for 48 and 72 hr, with a total of 163,782 peaks being called (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As for the RNAseq analysis, only 3day knockdown data were considered for subsequent analysis, with 15,318 peaks being lost between the untreated and knockdown conditions, and 9949 peaks being gained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We therefore utilized an approach in which the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within a given distance of all differentially accessible ATAC peaks was compared to the total number of genes within those ranges. A hypergeometric test was then used to assess whether more DEGs fell within this range than would be expected by chance. For example, when ranges of 20 kb were made around all HA peaks, 955 TSS are encompassed, 132 of which were upregulated following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD. These values respectively correspond to 5.3% of the total gene set and 7.5% of the upregulated gene set, indicating a significant enrichment of upregulated genes, with a p-value of 7.6e-5 (Also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Plotting these significance values over ranges from 5 kB to 2 MB revealed that <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD higher and lower accessibility peaks were significantly associated with up- and downregulated genes, respectively. To confirm that this association derived from the fact that these peaks were differentially accessible and was not a feature of any similar set of ATAC peaks, 1000x sets randomly selected hESC ATAC peaks were matched to the differential peaks in size and number and subjected to the same analysis. The shaded regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> correspond to the significance values for these random peaks and indicate no meaningful association with gene expression compared to differential peaks. SMARCB1 therefore both positively and negatively regulates gene expression over a range that is consistent with activity at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, and consistent with SMARCB1’s regulation of bivalent genes, the closest genes to differential peaks were significantly enriched in those classified as bivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Based on the association between differentially accessible peaks and differentially expressed genes at distances of 500 kb, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and given previous reports of SMARCB1 activity at enhancers and super-enhancers, we assessed how <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD affected accessibility of the enhancer landscape in hESCs. For this analysis, we considered hESC active and poised enhancers as well as defined human super-enhancer data sets for 98 other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan and Zhang, 2016</xref>). The super-enhancers of other cell types were included in this analysis given previous results indicating that manipulation of the SWI/SNF complex can promote or repress particular fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wade et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). As super-enhancers are key regions associated with cell identity, the preferential localization of differential ATAC peaks in these regions for other cell types would inform any effects of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD on differentiation. <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD lower accessibility peaks were enriched in active hESC enhancers, such as an enhancer located 12 kB upstream of <italic>KCNQ2</italic>, as well as poised hESC enhancers, with limited enrichment in other enhancer sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with this result, enrichment analysis using publicly available hESC ChIPseq peaks for histone marks showed strong enrichment for <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD lower accessibility peaks in the enhancer markers H3K4me1 (p=2.1e-218), H3K27ac (p=4.4e-36), and H3K4me2 (p=1.2 e −153) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>).

Of all considered enhancers sets, <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD higher accessibility peaks were enriched only in H1 hESC super-enhancers (p=4.6e-42), being present in ~19% (127/684) of these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A subset of these super-enhancers (34/127, 27%) contained multiple higher accessibility peaks, including the super-enhancer 40 kB downstream of the phospholipase <italic>PLA2G16</italic>, indicating that some super-enhancers may be more strongly regulated by SMARCB1 than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In addition to SMARCA4 binding sites, <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD lower accessibility peaks were significantly enriched in SOX2 (p=1.8E-156) and OCT4 (p=8.0e-15) ChIPseq peaks, indicating that SMARCB1 is necessary to maintain chromatin accessibility at key pluripotency factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In contrast, <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD higher accessibility peaks were enriched in binding sites for the cohesin complex member RAD21 (p=7.3E-174) and the cohesin-interacting protein CTCF (p=2.3E-155).

The strongest association was seen within 500 kB of higher accessibility peaks within super-enhancers, and a slowly declining association was observed for more distal genes. As before, 1000x sets of randomly selected sized-matched ATAC peaks did not show a significant association with differential gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

To assess whether these enhancers exhibited maintained activity, we analyzed levels of transcription in these regions. Consistent with maintained activity, higher levels of transcription were detected in 89 hESC super-enhancers in <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD cells compared to the control condition, whereas lower levels of transcription were observed at only 23 super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Indeed, higher accessibility peaks were enriched in the binding sites for several key hESC TFs, including OCT4 (p=5.3e-125), NANOG (p=6.7e-40), and SOX2 (p=1.2e-29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This overlap comprised a significant percentage of these binding sites, including 14%, 10% and 7% of hESC SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG, binding sites, respectively. Moreover, higher accessibility peaks overlapped 14% of hESC peaks for the SWI/SNF-associated factor BCL11A (p=2.1e-37), suggesting that the SWI/SNF complex mediates the repression of these regions during the early stages of neural induction in a SMARCB1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In all of these pluripotency factor binding sites, the normalized accessibility signal in <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD cells subjected to neural induction was similar to that of untreated hESCs, whereas the signal for control cells was strongly attenuated compared to the hESC accessibility signal, indicating a failure to repress accessibility in these regulatory regions in <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several SWI/SNF subunits are known to be essential for hESC to maintain their full complement of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schaniel et al., 2009</xref>). However, there are few data on the specific role of core subunits in genome-wide chromatin accessibility in hESCs, nor has the role of SMARCB1 been explored in terms of its role in regulating hESC differentiation. An inducible knockdown strategy permitted the assessment of SMARCB1’s regulation of transcription and chromatin accessibility in steady state hESCs and under differentiation conditions. These data revealed surprising insights into SMARCB1’s regulation of the hESC enhancer landscape and its specific requirement for neural induction.</p><p>The observed widespread upregulation of bivalent genes in <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD hESCs was unexpected given previous reports that SMARCB1 loss leads to PCR2-mediated repression in MEFs and that reintroduction leads to bivalent gene activation in <italic>SMARCB1</italic>-null cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Given the highly euchromatic nature of embryonic stem cells and the developmental repercussions of premature differentiation, it is possible that the SWI/SNF complex has a more repressive role in hESCs than in differentiated or tumor lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</xref>). In line with this interpretation, a previous microarray analysis of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> KD in hESCs revealed a bias in gene upregulation (472/529, 74%), a result that is consistent with our unpublished observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). It is also worth noting that while there were a greater number of lower accessibility peaks in the steady <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD condition, there was a strong bias towards transcriptional upregulation. We hypothesize that SMARCB1 positively affects transcription by other mechanisms than altered accessibility. For example, SMARCB1 may be required for the recruitment of transcription factors or transcriptional machinery to promoters hESCs, which would result in decreased transcription but not a dramatic change in accessibility. Evidence for transcriptional control independent of accessibility changes include the established antagonism between the SWI/SNF and PRC2 complexes, the interaction between the complex and the tumor suppressor p53, and the observed associations between SMARCB1 and RNA Pol I and RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadoch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The role of SMARCB1 at enhancers has received significant attention in recent years, and the results are not wholly in agreement. Specifically, it was reported that SMARCB1 deletion in MEFs decreases levels of the active markers H3K27ac and H3Kme1 at enhancers, whereas super-enhancers were relatively spared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, others have found that both enhancers and super-enhancers show increased levels of H3K27ac upon SMARCB1 reintroduction into null tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>). Our data are consistent with both sets of previous results in that <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD in steady state hESCs leads to widespread loss of enhancer accessibility. However, we find that SMARCB1 has a repressive role at hESC super-enhancers, a previously undescribed effect and one not observed for any of the 98 other analyzed human super-enhancer datasets. This is a salient difference in the context of AT/RT tumorigenesis in that the cell of origin is likely an undifferentiated NSC, indicating that current models of SMARCB1 activity at enhancers that are based on differentiated cells or reintroduction experiments may not fully capture the functions that contribute its tumorigenic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>That <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD leads to elevated accessibility at CTCF binding sites is particularly noteworthy given recent findings that a SMARCB1-excluding non-canonical SWI/SNF complex (ncBAF, also termed GBAF) preferentially targets CTCF sites in mESCs and several tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatchalian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michel et al., 2018</xref>). That CTCF sites gain accessibility in <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD conditions suggests that an absence of SMARCB1 may promote the formation of the ncBAF. This is an intriguing possibility given that the ncBAF complex positively regulates naïve pluripotency in mESCs and may provide a mechanism by which SMARCB1-deficient cells resist differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatchalian et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The lineage specificity of SMARCB1’s requirement in neural differentiation is relevant in the context of its role as a tumor suppressor. Although loss of SMARCB1 in adult mice leads to lymphoma, SMARCB1 mutation-associated pediatric AT/RTs are found in the CNS, a finding that has been recapitulated in a conditional <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KO mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babgi et al., 2018</xref>). Neural differentiation has been reported to be the default lineage choice of ESCs, and recent work indicates that this characteristic is cell-intrinsic and driven in part by expression of the zinc finger protein Zfp521 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muñoz-Sanjuán and Brivanlou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamiya et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that loss of SMARCB1 activity renders cells deficient in the mechanisms involved in this intrinsic process, leaving differentiation pathways that normally require extrinsic stimuli unimpaired.</p><p>The above results provide critical insights into how a core SWI/SNF subunit regulates both the hESC enhancer landscape as well as differentiation down a lineage where it is strongly implicated as a developmental tumor suppressor. The complex roles that SMARCB1 plays at different enhancer subtypes should be borne in mind when assessing both subsequent stages of development as well as the initial stages of cellular transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>H1 hESCs were cultured in <italic>TeSR</italic>-<italic>E8</italic> growth medium (STEMCELL Technologies, #05990) at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

The R package <italic>limma</italic> was used to call regions with differential read counts among genes/regions with a max group mean (mgm) of 8 (hESCs) or 32 (neural induction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>ATACseq</title><p>Two replicates were used for all ATAC experiments. Cells were dissociated by incubation with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (steady state hESCs) or Accutase (neural induction) (StemCell Technologies, #07920) for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were then collected by pipetting, counted, and spun for 5 min at 300 x g, after which they were resuspended in to 1e6 cells/ml. Cells were then subjected to the ATACseq protocol as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al. (2015)</xref>, with the following parameters. Buffer: CSK buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100). Transposase volume/25 µl cell suspension: 5 µl. Transposase treatment time: 30 min, with mixing every 10 min. Libraries were sequenced at the NIEHS Epigenomics Core Facility on the NextSeq 500 platform, and reads were trimmed using default parameters (steady state hESC experiments) or with -q 26 (neural induction experiment), with the latter modification made due to a technical issue with the sequencing run. Reads were aligned to hg19 with bowtie2 with the following parameters: -X 2000 N 1 --no-unal --no-mixed --dovetail --no-discordant. Uniquely aligned reads were filtered using an in-house python script, which was also used to remove mitochondrial reads. Reads <underline>&lt;</underline> 135 bp were retained for analysis of accessible regions and deduplicated with picard, using the following parameters: MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM = 5000000, REMOVE_DUPLICATES = true. Peaks were called for each replicate using macs2, with the following parameters: callpeak --nomodel --nolambda --keep-dup all --slocal 10000 -q 0.005 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/taoliu/MACS">https://github.com/taoliu/MACS</ext-link>]. After the top 0.1% of Regions of Exceptionally High Depth of Aligned Short Reads were removed from the called peak files, Untreated, Day 2, and Day 3 KD peaks were merged and used as the considered regions for statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pickrell et al., 2011</xref>). Differential peaks were called using the R package <italic>limma</italic>, with cut-offs of q &lt; 0.01, log2(FC) &gt;2, and a max group mean (mgm) of <underline>&gt;</underline>32 reads. Peaks in which this mgm criterion was not met in any condition were excluded from further analyses.</p><p>The signal normalization factors required to permit comparison of conditions were determined by finding the scale factors required to equalize the median read counts for all considered regions of interest. For these determinations, to exclude the use of regions with signals that could not be distinguished from noise, only regions with signals above the median signal value were considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Differential peak/gene significance analysis, enrichment analyses</title><p>For each of the differential ATAC-seq peak sets, ranges of increasing size were made around the peaks (from 5 kb to 2 Mb beginning with 5 kb increments). Analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1 and visualized with ggplot2 version 3.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">R Core Team, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wickham, 2016</xref>).

Ranges were intersected with the TSS of all RNA-seq genes in the given analysis (i.e., steady state or neural induction), and a hypergeometric test was used to determine if differential RNA-seq TSS gene hits were enriched in the regions overlapping the differential ATAC-seq peaks. In addition, for each analysis, an equivalent random subset of observed ATAC-seq peaks were selected 1000 times and tested for enrichment using the same procedure. The data were collected to visualize the P-value of observed differential ATAC-seq peaks, the median and 5–95% quantile range of random ATAC-seq peaks. The detailed workflow is available in a supplementary file (Peak_gene_enrichment_analysis.html).</p><p>To assess the significance of overlaps between differentially accessible peaks and genomic regions of interest, the following command was performed in R: phyper(q, m, n, k, lower.tail = FALSE), where q = the number of intersection between the differential peak set and the genomic regions of interest, m = the intersection between all considered ATAC peaks, regardless of condition, and the genomic regions of interest, n = the number of all considered ATAC peaks not intersecting the genomic regions of interest, and k = the number of differential peaks in the considered set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>HOMER</title><p>HOMER motif analysis was used with findMotifsGenome.pl, using the following parameters: -size given, background regions defined as non-differential peaks that were similar to the considered differential peak set in terms of size, ATAC signal, and distance to the nearest promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study addresses the role of the SMARCB1 subunit of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in regulating gene expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) before and after differentiation. Study of SMARCB1 is particularly important, because mutations in this subunit are strongly associated with pediatric neural tumors. The authors compare gene expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) in control and SMARCB1 knockdown (KD) hESCs made using a lentivirus carrying a dox-inducible shRNA. The effects of initiating differentiation into neural cells, endoderm or mesoderm are also assessed using the same methods.</p><p>In undifferentiated hESCs, many genes are activated in response to knockdown, whereas only a few are repressed, indicating that SMARCB1 has a primarily repressive role. This observation is particularly true of genes with bivalent chromatin marks. Changes in chromatin accessibility occur primarily at enhancers: the accessibility of active enhancers decreases in KD cells (LA peaks), indicating that SMARCB1 promotes accessibility at active enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers show the opposite trend, indicating that SMARCB1 represses their function (HA peaks). They find that SMARCB1 KD hESCs can be differentiated into mesoderm or endoderm but not neural cells. In the latter case, only some neural genes are induced and many genes characteristic of stem cells remain active. They conclude that SMARCB1 is needed for the initial stages of neural induction, but not for mesoderm or endoderm induction. In particular, the hESC super-enhancers remain accessible in neurally induced KD cells.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found the study to be interesting and felt that the major claims were supported by the presented results. The reviewers did express some difficulty in following the text in places and requested that more explanation of the analyses be included in the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2B, the aim appears to be to correlate changes in ATAC-peaks with changes in gene expression. This is tricky because the target genes of specific enhancers are unknown and difficult to infer because they are often separated by large genomic distances. The reviewer did not understand the method used in Figure 2B to calculate the probability of association – what assumptions underlie this analysis? Detailed explanation in the text is needed.</p><p>2) The reviewer also found the &quot;dot plots&quot; such as those in Figure 2C/D difficult to understand. In Figure 2C, I think they have calculated the probability of low (LA) and high (HA) accessibility ATAC-peaks coinciding with enhancers and super-enhancers found in 98 human cells using data from other papers (subsection “<italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD differentially affects chromatin accessibility at key regions associated with hESC identity”). Some significant dots in Figure 2C are labeled – but what cell type do they belong to? Presumably the current experiments. The reviewer was not sure why they did this analysis. Isn't it sufficient to examine the correlations between enhancer types and LA/HA peaks in the cells used here? The justification for this analysis seems obscure, but perhaps I'm missing something. More explanation is needed in the text.</p><p>3) What about the promoters of differentially expressed genes? Do their accessibilities change as expected from the RNA-seq data?</p><p>4) Figure 1F shows the significance of overlap between up- or down-regulated genes and the genomic binding sites of numerous regulatory proteins or histone modifications. In this figure, it would be reasonable to include the binding sites of any SWI/SNF subunits for which ChIP-seq data are available to better assess the extent to which the gene expression changes are direct.</p><p>5) In hESCs, many more genes go up than down in SMARCB1 KD cells, suggesting SMARCB1 largely represses (or at least limits) gene expression. On the other hand, many more regions become less accessible than more accessible in SMARCB1 KD hESCs, which suggests a greater role in activation of transcription. How do the authors explain these phenotypes?</p><p>6) Figure 2B, Figure 4D, and Figure 5C seem strange in that no matter how large the bin size surrounding a region of interest (e.g., differential ATAC peaks), the association with differentially expressed genes is statistically significant. For lower accessibility peaks in Figure 2B, significance actually increases as the bin size increases from 300 to 500 kb from the aggregate ATAC-seq peak center. This seems unlikely. Furthermore, Figures 4D and Figure 5C seem to flatten out on the right as bin size gets very large, but they seem to approach an asymptote of -log10(p) = 2-3 (e.g., p = 0.01-0.001). Shouldn't they approach -log10(p) = 0?

This is tricky because the target genes of specific enhancers are unknown and difficult to infer because they are often separated by large genomic distances. The reviewer did not understand the method used in Figure 2B to calculate the probability of association – what assumptions underlie this analysis? Detailed explanation in the text is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in that attributing changes at a particular enhancer to a particular gene is not possible given the available data. For this reason, we chose instead to infer such effects at a bulk level by considering enriched proximity of differential ATAC peaks to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as indirect evidence of peak/gene interactions. Specifically, the number of DEGs within a given range of all differentially accessible ATAC peaks was compared to the total number of TSS within those ranges. A hypergeometric test was then used to assess whether more DEGs fell within this range than would be expected by chance. For example, when ranges of 20 kb in either direction were made around all HA peaks in the steady state condition, 955 TSS are encompassed, 132 of which are upregulated following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD. These values respectively correspond to 5.3% of the total gene set and 7.5% of the upregulated gene set, indicating a significant enrichment of upregulated genes, with a p-value of 7.6e-5. These values were then plotted for all ranges out to 2 MB (Figure 2B) in the revised manuscript. A visual workflow was added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, and the following explanation and example were added to subsection “SMARCB1 protein reduction relieves repression of bivalent genes in hESCs”. Additional detail was also added to the Methods, and as HTML file with a detailed computational workflow is provided in the supplementary material.</p><p>“An important readout of modified chromatin accessibility is differential gene expression, although it is difficult to assign changes in a particular ATAC peak to changes in transcriptional output. We therefore utilized an approach in which the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within a given distance of all differentially accessible ATAC peaks was compared to the total number of genes within those ranges. A hypergeometric test was then used to assess whether more DEGs fell within this range than would be expected by chance. For example, when ranges of 20 kb were made around all HA peaks, 955 TSS are encompassed, 132 of which were upregulated following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD.

In Figure 2C, I think they have calculated the probability of low (LA) and high (HA) accessibility ATAC-peaks coinciding with enhancers and super-enhancers found in 98 human cells using data from other papers (subsection “SMARCB1 KD differentially affects chromatin accessibility at key regions associated with hESC identity”). Some significant dots in Figure 2C are labeled – but what cell type do they belong to? Presumably the current experiments. The reviewer was not sure why they did this analysis. Isn't it sufficient to examine the correlations between enhancer types and LA/HA peaks in the cells used here? The justification for this analysis seems obscure, but perhaps I'm missing something. More explanation is needed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that the enhancer sets labeled in Figure 2C are from the cell types used in the present analysis, as are the data in Figure 2E; the figure and text have been modified appropriately. The unlabeled dots in Figure 2C reflect all published super enhancer data sets for other cell types. The reasoning behind the inclusion of these data is that manipulation of the SWI/SNF complex has been shown to promote or repress certain differentiation pathways (Zhang et al., 2014, Wade et al., 2015). As super-enhancers are key regions of cell identity, we sought to assess whether <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD would preferentially alter accessibility dynamics within particular super-enhancer sets and thereby illuminate any effects of this manipulation on hESC differentiation (Hnisz et al., 2013). This explanation has been added to the text of the applicable Results section:</p><p>“The super-enhancers of other cell types were included in this analysis given previous results indicating that manipulation of the SWI/SNF complex can promote or repress particular fates (Wade et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2014). As super-enhancers are key regions associated with cell identity, the preferential localization of differential ATAC peaks in these regions for other cell types would inform any effects of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD on differentiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What about the promoters of differentially expressed genes? Do their accessibilities change as expected from the RNA-seq data?</p></disp-quote><p>In the neural induction experiments, multiple differentially expressed pluripotency-related genes contained higher accessibility peaks (in the <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD condition) in their promoters, including <italic>OCT4, mir302, DNMT3B, ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>DPPA2/4</italic>. Similarly, multiple neural/neural induction-related genes that were expressed at lower levels in the <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD condition, including <italic>CER1, CRX, DPP6, SIX1</italic>, contained lower accessibility peaks in their promoters. These data were added to Supplementary Table 4.</p><p>The situation differed in the steady state condition, where fewer than 5% of differentially accessible peaks were near promoters, and very few differential peaks were observed in the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes (N=0 higher accessibility peaks in promoters of upregulated genes, N=6 lower accessibility peaks in the promoters of downregulated genes). The accessibility at the promoters of upregulated genes do show a modest increase in the <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD condition, and the signal at downregulated gene promoters shows little change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). However, the lack of statistically significant accessibility changes in these regions indicate that the effects of differential accessibility on transcriptional output are mediated principally distal to the target gene. This result was not unexpected as promoter accessibility correlates rather poorly with gene expression in pluripotent cells. This is because the promoters of developmental genes remain poised and strongly accessible, even though they may be expressed at low levels in ESCs (Schlesinger and Meshorer, 2019). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref> is a browser track of accessibility data for 4 kB around the <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter in steady state hESC (top) and neural induction conditions. The signals are very similar despite the &gt;500-fold expression difference in <italic>PAX6</italic> between the conditions. We believe that the differential peak vs. differential gene data graphed in Figure 2B convincingly demonstrate that the effects of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD on accessibility are mediated distally to the TSS.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45672.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45672-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1F shows the significance of overlap between up- or down-regulated genes and the genomic binding sites of numerous regulatory proteins or histone modifications. In this figure, it would be reasonable to include the binding sites of any SWI/SNF subunits for which ChIP-seq data are available to better assess the extent to which the gene expression changes are direct.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that determining the degree of intersection between differential gene promoter and SWI/SNF factor binding sites would is appropriate. In fact, the publicly available ChIPseq data for BRG1 (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011) was included in this analysis, although the results did not reach significance. However, BRG1 peaks are biologically enriched at most hESC promoters. Specifically, BRG1 peaks were observed in 16,031 of the 17,462 genes (92%) considered in the RNAseq analysis. In contrast, BRG1 peaks were present at 90% of the promoters of upregulated genes following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD and 88% of the promoters of downregulated genes. Although significance is not reached for these comparisons, the high frequency of BRG1 binding at the promoters of differentially expressed genes clearly indicates that the SWI/SNF is active at these promoters. The text has been modified to include this information:</p><p>“We also tested for enrichment for the only SWI/SNF subunit for which ChIPseq data are available in this cell type, the catalytic subunit SMARCA4. Although these peaks did not emerge as significantly enriched near the TSS of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), this is largely due to SMARCA4 being highly biologically enriched at most promoters in hESCs. Specifically, SMARCA4 peaks are present at 16,031/17,462 (92%) of the considered genes in the RNAseq analysis, whereas these values were 90% and 88% for up- and downregulated genes, respectively (Supplementary file 1) (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In hESCs, many more genes go up than down in SMARCB1 KD cells, suggesting SMARCB1 largely represses (or at least limits) gene expression. On the other hand, many more regions become less accessible than more accessible in SMARCB1 KD hESCs, which suggests a greater role in activation of transcription. How do the authors explain these phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>We have also noticed this difference in the effects of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD on accessibility and transcription and note, as mentioned in the response to comment #3, that accessibility at promoters is not a strong prediction of transcriptional output in ESCs. We also hypothesize that SMARCB1 positively affects transcription by other mechanisms than altered accessibility. For example, SMARCB1 may be required for the recruitment of transcription factors or transcriptional machinery to promoters hESCs, which would result in decreased transcription but not a dramatic change in accessibility. Evidence for transcriptional control independent of accessibility changes include the established antagonism between the SWI/SNF and PRC2 complexes, the interaction between the complex and the tumor suppressor p53, and the observed associations between SMARCB1 and RNA Pol I and RNA Pol II (Kadoch et al., 2017, Lee, 2002, Cho, 1998, Zhai et al., 2012).” This hypothesis has been added to the Discussion section:</p><p>“It is also worth noting that while there were a greater number of lower accessibility peaks in the steady <italic>SMARCB1</italic> KD condition, there was a strong bias towards transcriptional upregulation.

For lower accessibility peaks in Figure 2B, significance actually increases as the bin size increases from 300 to 500 kb from the aggregate ATAC-seq peak center. This seems unlikely. Furthermore, Figure 4D and Figure 5C seem to flatten out on the right as bin size gets very large, but they seem to approach an asymptote of -log10(p) = 2-3 (e.g., p = 0.01-0.001). Shouldn't they approach -log10(p) = 0? How might a set of &quot;peaks&quot; consisting of random locations in the genome (with the number of different random locations equal to the number of real peaks) look when subjected to the same analysis? This comparison could be added to these figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the differential ATAC peak vs. differential gene association analysis out to 2 Mb for each of the mentioned subfigures, and we indeed observe that the p-value drops below significance (p=0.01) over distance in each case. These extended data have been substituted for Figure 2B, Figure 4D and Figure 5C, respectively. In addition, to confirm that the observed significance of the associations is specific to those ATAC peaks that are differentially accessible, we generated 1000x sets of random ATAC peaks that were matched in size and number to the differential peaks and subjected these sets to the same analysis. In each case, we found that these random peak sets displayed levels of significance that were well below those of the considered differential peak set. The 5-95% confidence levels of the significance for these random sets are displayed as shaded regions in Figure 2B, Figure 4D and Figure 5C and the text/figure legends have been modified accordingly.
