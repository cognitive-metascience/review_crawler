termed SV priming. Here we show that the C2A domain of UNC-13L, like the corresponding domain in mammalian Munc13-1, displays two conserved binding modes: forming C2A/C2A homodimers, or forming a heterodimer with the zinc finger domain of UNC-10/RIM (C2A/RIM). Functional analysis revealed that UNC-13L’s C2A promotes synaptic transmission by regulating a post-priming process. Stimulus-evoked release but not SV priming, was impaired in <italic>unc-10</italic> mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization, leading to decreased release probability. Disrupting C2A/C2A homodimerization in UNC-13L-rescued animals had no effect on synaptic transmission, but fully restored the evoked release and the release probability of <italic>unc-10</italic>/RIM mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization. Thus, our results support the model that RIM binding C2A releases UNC-13L from an autoinhibitory homodimeric complex to become fusion-competent by functioning as a switch only.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>release probability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP160100849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1122351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM54728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austism Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REG15-006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nedelcu</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>William Randolph Hearst Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nedelcu</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RIM binding UNC-13L C2A domain releases UNC-13L from an autoinhibitory homodimeric complex to become fusion-competent, and regulates probability of synaptic vesicle release in the post-priming process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmitters are released by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis, a processmediated by the SNARE complex, and regulated by synaptic proteins such as Munc18s, Munc13s, RIMs, and synaptotagmins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Südhof and Rizo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>). Before final fusion with the plasma membrane, SVs undergo two crucial steps: docking and priming. These processes ensure that the SVs are translocated to the plasma membrane and become fusion-competent at the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sudhof, 2004</xref>). Defects in docking or priming produce corresponding decreases in SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imig et al., 2014</xref>). However, post-priming regulation of SV release has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). Various studies have demonstrated that Munc13-1, a protein with multiple functional domains, is required for the docking and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>), as well as post-priming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). The functions of Munc13-1 in these processes are believed to be mediated by its central MUN domain, which directly interacts with syntaxin and promotes SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Multiple domains of Munc13-1 have been implicated in regulating the MUN domain’s SV priming activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). In mammals, four Munc13 isoforms have been identified, two of which contain an N-terminal C2A domain (Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brose et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2001</xref>). Betz et al. first found that the C2A domain binds to the zinc finger (ZF) domain of RIM, an active zone protein that is required for SV priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2001</xref>). A double mutation in rat RIM2α’s ZF domain (K97/99E) disrupts C2A/RIM heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>) and was subsequently shown to produce a large reduction in the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that C2A binding to RIM plays an important role in SV priming. Apart from forming a heterodimer with RIM, the C2A domain also forms a homodimer, thereby promoting formation of Munc13-1 homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). This homodimerization, however, is not necessary for SV priming and post-priming SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, studies in chromaffin cells have shown that a truncated Munc13-1 lacking the N-terminal C2A domain is fully able to mediate vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that the role of Munc13-1 in priming is independent of the C2A domain and its binding with RIM. Similarly, a recent study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> found that removing the N-terminal C2A domain from UNC-13L, a Munc13-1 homolog, does not cause a change in the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>). These conflicting findings have called into doubt whether binding of the C2A domain with RIM is indeed playing a role in SV priming, prompting us to re-analyze the function of both C2A/RIM heterodimerization and C2A/C2A homodimerization using an in vivo system.</p><p>Here, we examined the functional importance of the C2A domain by generating a transgenic line of UNC-13L with a point mutation in the C2A domain (K49E) that blocks formation of C2A/C2A homodimers, and a mutant carrying two mutations in the <italic>unc-10</italic>/RIM ZF domain (K77/79E) that disrupts C2A/RIM heterodimer formation. We found that tonic neurotransmitter release at a low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and stimulus-evoked release were significantly reduced in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutants, whereas SV release was normal in the UNC-13L(K49E)-rescued <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants. Moreover, the hypertonic sucrose-evoked responses were unaltered following disruption of homodimerization and heterodimerization, suggesting that SV priming is not determined by the state of the C2A domain. Interestingly, simultaneously disrupting C2A/C2A homodimerization in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant fully restored both tonic and evoked release. These results suggest that the synaptic transmission defect in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant is most likely caused by formation of more C2A/C2A homodimers, and that the role of UNC-10/RIM binding UNC-13 C2A domain is to release the C2A from an autoinhibitory state, allowing it to become a fusion-competent monomeric form. Finally, we show that UNC-13’s C2A domain increases release probability but has little effect on SV priming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>C2A/C2A homodimerization and C2A/RIM heterodimerization are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>The UNC-13L C2A domain and the UNC-10/RIM ZF domain share high sequence identity with the corresponding domains of mouse Munc13-1 (50%) and RIM (48%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), suggesting that UNC-13’s C2A would form homo- and heterodimers in a manner similar to mouse Munc13-1. To test this idea, we directly assessed homo- and heterodimer formation by the UNC-13 C2A domain. Gel filtration analysis indicated that recombinant C2A forms a homodimer, and that this homodimerization was disrupted by a mutation (K49E) analogous to that which disrupts Munc13-1 homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). To determine whether UNC-13L forms a heterodimer with UNC-10/RIM, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Our results showed that the UNC-13L C2A domain tightly binds the UNC-10/RIM ZF domain (Kd = 1.29 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), and that this interaction was eliminated by a double mutation in the ZF domain (K77/79E), which is analogous to mutations that disrupt binding of the corresponding mammalian Munc13-1 and RIM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>).

Both the mEPSCs and the mIPSCs were recorded in the presence of 0 mM and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as we have previously found that the mIPSCs are almost arrested in 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> but are normal 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in some mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations should be tested to provide an accurate and thorough evaluation of tonic release. Our results showed that the mEPSCs and mIPSCs were completely abolished in the <italic>unc-13(s69)</italic> null mutant, and were fully restored by neuronal expression of full-length UNC-13L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Thus, the UNC-13L C2A domain is important for tonic release of both ACh and GABA; however, the requirement for C2A in GABA release can be bypassed by the presence of extracellular calcium, presumably because of increased release probability. The differential impact of deleting C2A on ACh and GABA release in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> could reflect differences in release probability at these two types of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).

To investigate this, we first examined the mEPSCs and mIPSCs in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants rescued by UNC-13L carrying the K49E mutation, which blocks C2A/C2A homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The mEPSC and mIPSC frequencies in the UNC-13L(K49E) rescue animals were comparable to those in the UNC-13L rescue animals in both 0 mM and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that homodimerization does not affect tonic ACh or GABA release. To determine the role of C2A/RIM heterodimerization, we used crispr to introduce a K77/79E double mutation in the UNC-10 ZF domain, <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E). Compared to wild-type animals, <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutants display slightly uncoordinated behaviour (data not shown). Analysis of tonic release showed that the mEPSCs and mIPSCs were markedly reduced in <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutants in 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas both were unaltered in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>), suggesting that C2A/RIM heterodimerization is only required for tonic release in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> when release probability is reduced. To confirm this, we measured mEPSCs and mIPSCs in two additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (0.05 mM and 0.1 mM). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 0 mM to 0.05 mM and 0.1 mM caused robust enhancement of the mEPSC and mIPSC frequencies in wild-type animals. In <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutants, a significantly lower mIPSC frequency was observed in 0.05 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> but not in 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas mEPSCs were unaltered in both 0.05 mM and 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Our results therefore demonstrate that C2A/RIM heterodimerization promotes tonic release but that this effect is bypassed when release probability is increased by raising external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A monomeric C2A domain is fully functional for tonic release</title><p>The decreased mEPSC frequency observed in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue animals at 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicates that the C2A domain may have an additional function in regulating tonic release, particularly at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We therefore examined whether simultaneously blocking the homo- and heterodimerization of the C2A domain could account for this additional function. To do that, we made UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) double mutant by crossing the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) into the UNC-13L(K49E) rescue strain. In 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings, the UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) double mutant mIPSC rate was significantly higher than that observed in <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) single mutants, suggesting that blocking homodimer formation was sufficient to prevent the decreased tonic GABA release caused by the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, blocking homodimerization did not significantly improve mEPSC rates in 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, heterodimerization increases tonic GABA release by preventing homodimer formation, whereas heterodimerization promotes tonic ACh release by a distinct mechanism. In addition, the tonic ACh and GABA release were at wild-type level in the UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) double mutant in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, similar to those in the UNC-13L(K49E) rescue and the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that blocking C2A homo- and heterodimerization does not decrease tonic ACh and GABA release. These results differ from those obtained in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue animals, suggesting that the effect of deleting the C2A domain on the tonic release is not a result of a lack of homo- and heterodimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stimulus-evoked release is reduced when C2A/RIM heterodimerization is blocked</title><p>Next, we analysed the impact of C2A interactions on stimulus-evoked ACh release. Compared to UNC-13L, UNC-13LΔC2A exhibited a smaller evoked EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>). The evoked EPSCs were significantly smaller in <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutants, exhibiting decreased amplitude and total charge transfer compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). The percentage decrease of the evoked charge transfer in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant (44%) was similar to that observed in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue animals (46%), suggesting that C2A/RIM heterodimerization accounts for the role of the C2A domain in evoked release. Thus, our results revealed that C2A/RIM heterodimerization is required for evoked neurotransmitter release. It should be noted that the evoked EPSCs were recorded in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution in which, however, the mEPSCs were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These different observations on tonic and evoked neurotransmitter release may reflect differential release probabilities of the two release modes at various Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Indeed, the mEPSCs and the stimulus-evoked EPSCs exhibit large differences in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Williams et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40585.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of homodimerization and heterodimerization on evoked neurotransmitter release.</title><p>Electronic stimulus and hypertonic sucrose-evoked EPSCs were recorded from the body wall muscle of adult animals in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

The evoked EPSCs mediated by UNC-13L(K49E) were indistinguishable from those rescued by wild-type UNC-13L, indicating that C2A homodimers are not required for evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). To determine whether homodimers inhibited evoked ACh release, we analyzed UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10(nu487</italic> K77/79E) double mutants. We found that preventing C2A/C2A homodimerization in the <italic>unc-10(nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant fully restored the evoked EPSC to a wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). These results suggest that the reduced evoked EPSC caused by blocking C2A/RIM heterodimerization is mediated by increased formation of C2A homodimers. These results are consistent with prior analysis of mouse synapses, which suggest that Munc13-1 homodimers inhibit SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). These results also demonstrate that the monomeric C2A domain is sufficient to support evoked release, consistent with the observation of tonic release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the RIM ZF domain appears to function only as a switch that releases the C2A domain from the inhibitory homomeric complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The C2A domain is not required for SV priming</title><p>A decrease in evoked EPSCs may arise from a priming defect or a change in release probability. We therefore examined whether SV priming is regulated by the C2A domain and its two different states (homodimer and heterodimer). SV priming was measured by the pulsed application of hypertonic sucrose solution (1M, 2 s) onto the ventral nerve cord, and the size of the RRP was calculated by integrating the sucrose-evoked current. The current was almost eliminated in the <italic>unc-13</italic> null mutants, and was fully restored by expressing a wild-type UNC-13L transgene in all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Strikingly, UNC-13L lacking the C2A domain could still restore the sucrose-evoked current to a wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the C2A domain is not required for SV priming. These results differ from those reported in mouse hippocampal neurons, in which the RRP was largely reduced when the Munc13-1 C2A domain was removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these differences, our results, together with those obtained in chromaffin cells in which Munc13-1 lacking the C2A domain enhances secretion to as high a level as does Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2001</xref>), support the notion that truncated UNC-13 lacking the C2A domain is still able to prime SVs.</p><p>The C2A deletion had no effect on SV priming, suggesting that C2A/C2A homodimerization and C2A/RIM heterodimerization are also not required for priming. Nevertheless, we assessed the RRP size in the UNC-13L(K49E) rescue animals and the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutant by puffing hypertonic sucrose (1M, 2 s). Our data showed that the sucrose-evoked currents in these animals were comparable to those observed in UNC-13L rescue and wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), demonstrating that homodimerization or heterodimerization is not playing a role in SV priming. The unchanged SV priming in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutant was also confirmed by puffing a lower concentration of sucrose (0.5M, 5 s; data not shown). Consequently, the probability of synaptic vesicle release (P<sub>vr</sub>) calculated by the ratio of the charge transfer of the evoked EPSCs to the charge transfer of the sucrose-evoked currents was significantly reduced in the ΔC2A rescue and the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). It should be noted that recording of the sucrose-evoked current requires a tight gigaohm seal between the recording pipette and the cell, as a loose seal often leads to an unreal current. We therefore analyzed the leak currents for each sucrose recording. Our data showed that all recordings were controlled well with acceptable leak currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate that the UNC-13L C2A domain regulates release probability by interacting with the UNC-10/RIM, rather than by regulating SV priming.</p><p>The decreased release probability in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue and the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutant could arise from a change in the expression level of UNC-13, or a change in sub-localization of the UNC-13 proteins at the nerve terminals. We next analyzed the UNC-13 protein levels from different transgenic rescue lines. A fluorescence protein (mApple) was fused to the C terminus of the various UNC-13L constructs (WT, K49E, and ΔC2A), and expressed in <italic>unc-13</italic> null mutants. Our prior study showed that c-terminal mCherry tags do not interfere with UNC-13’s function in promoting SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). All mApple-tagged UNC-13L constructs rescued the SV release in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants, and the phenotypes were similar to those rescued by corresponding untagged UNC13L constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). By quantifying the mApple fluorescence intensity from different rescue lines, we showed that there were no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), indicating that the UNC-13 proteins were expressed at similar levels in these lines. These results suggest that the decreased tonic and evoked release in UNC-13LΔC2A rescued animals are unlikely to result from reduced UNC-13L abundance. Prior studies have shown that the C2A domain is crucial for synaptic localization of UNC-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Melom et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the decrease in release probability in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue animals was caused by mis-localization of UNC-13 at the active zone.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40585.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Expression of UNC-13 transgenic constructs and effects of disrupting UNC-13L/RIM heterodimerization on sub-localization of UNC-13L.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Presynaptic distribution of UNC-13 at the dorsal nerve cord in <italic>unc-13</italic> animals rescued by the indicated transgenic constructs.

Prior studies in mouse and <italic>C. elegans</italic> have reported contradictory results regarding the role of the C2A domain in priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). This motivated us to investigate the function of this domain, with a particular focus on its two binding modes, in SV priming and post-priming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis. Below we discuss our findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>UNC-13L primes SVs independently of the C2A domain</title><p>The fact that the UNC-13/Munc13 is required for SV priming has been reported in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>). Sucrose-evoked responses are almost eliminated in neurons lacking UNC-13 or Munc13. Thus far, however, it is still unclear how the priming activity of UNC-13/Munc13 is achieved and regulated. It is believed that the MUN domain plays an essential role in SV priming. Removing the C2A domain from Munc13-1 leads to a marked decrease in the RRP of SVs in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role for C2A in priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). However, we found that <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants lacking a C2A domain (UNC-13LΔC2A rescued animals) exhibit a normal RRP, arguing that the C2A domain is not required for priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Zhou et al. showed that an isolated <italic>unc-13</italic> mutant (<italic>n2609</italic>) with a point mutation in the C2A domain of UNC-13L exhibits a similar reduction in evoked EPSCs to UNC-13LΔC2A, whereas docked SV numbers are normal in the <italic>unc-13(n2609)</italic> mutant. This suggests that the C2A domain is not required for docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>), consistent with our observations in relation to priming. It should be noted that all the UNC-13 transgenes in this study are extrachromosomal arrays, and that the UNC-13 proteins are overexpressed in these transgenic animals. The overexpression of UNC-13 may cause differential effects with wild-type expression of this protein. Despite this, our findings (e.g., ΔC2A) are similar to the results of Zhou et al., which were obtained from <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants rescued by a single copy of UNC-13.</p><p>Our results imply that UNC-13L regulates SV priming via a different mechanism, and that this mechanism is independent of the C2A domain. Prior studies have shown that a point mutation in the C1 domain of Munc13-1 accelerates hypertonicity-induced SV release without changing the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>). Transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> rescued by a truncated UNC-13L lacking its C1 or C2B domain also exhibit a normal RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of a mutated Munc13-1 (P827L, located in the linker domain between C2B and MUN) leads to a significant increase in release probability without causing an increase in the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lipstein et al., 2017</xref>). These observations appear to support the notion that the regulatory domains in UNC-13L (e.g. C2A, C1 and C2B) alter release probability but are not required for SV priming. Thus, our results, together with the findings from other studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mouse, suggest that UNC-13 has multiple regulatory effects on synaptic strength and plasticity, which are achieved by differential control of release probability by its various functional domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>State of the C2A domain and release probability</title><p>The reduced evoked EPSCs and unchanged RRP in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue animals led to a significant decrease in release probability (P<sub>vr</sub>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to these observations, the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutant also exhibits an impairment in evoked EPSCs but a normal RRP, thereby leading to a decreased P<sub>vr</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results demonstrate that deleting the C2A domain or blocking C2A/RIM heterodimerization decreases release probability. It should be noted that, release probability remains unchanged in the hippocampal neurons when C2A/RIM heterodimerization is disrupted, because of a similar decrease in the evoked EPSCs and the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>), different from our findings in this study.</p><p>The function of the C2A domain in regulating the release probability appears to be determined by its state. It has been proposed that the Munc13 C2A domain has three binding states, homodimer, heterodimer, and monomer, and that these three forms may co-exist in synaptic terminals. The decrease in evoked EPSC and release probability in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant was blocked by disrupting C2A/C2A homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This indicates that the synaptic transmission defect caused by disrupting C2A/RIM heterodimerization occurs because of an increase in C2A/C2A homodimerization, which is proposed to comprise an autoinhibitory state. Again, this is post-priming regulation, as SV priming is normal in both the UNC-13L(K49E) rescue and UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although our findings are similar to the observations reported in cultured hippocampal neurons in which the reduced evoked EPSCs caused by the disruption of heterodimerization were partially recovered when homodimerization and heterodimerization were disrupted simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>), we found that UNC-13L with a monomeric C2A domain is fully functional for both the priming and post-priming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered tonic and evoked release. Thus, our results support the notion that homodimerization of the C2A domain inhibits SV release, and that RIM releases the C2A domain from the autoinhibitory homodimeric complex by competitively binding the C2A domain to form a heterodimer, thereby allowing the C2A domain to become fusion-competent. The heterodimer itself, however, does not produce an additional effect on synaptic transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Distinct priming mechanisms between worm and mouse?</title><p>RIM binding to Munc13-1 is a key determinant in SV priming in the mouse central nervous system. In fact, deleting Munc13-1 C2A or disrupting C2A/RIM heterodimerization leads to a similar reduction in the size of the RRP to that observed in RIM knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas SV priming in worm does not rely on the UNC-13 C2A and the heterodimerization of UNC-13/RIM, although this interaction is highly conserved between worm and mouse. This raises a question of whether the UNC-10/RIM is required for priming in worm. Electron microscopy results have revealed that the number of docked SVs is slightly decreased in the <italic>unc-10</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koushika et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gracheva et al., 2008</xref>), which cannot account for the far more dramatic SV fusion defect, suggesting a post-docking role of RIM in the active zone. Consistent with these relatively minor docking defects, we found that the size of the RRP in <italic>unc-10</italic> mutants (assessed by sucrose evoked currents) is comparable to that in the wild-type animals (data not shown), demonstrating that UNC-10/RIM is not required for SV priming. These results suggest that UNC-10/RIM primarily regulates SV fusion by increasing release probability and not by promoting SV priming. UNC-10/RIM increases release probability via its ability to bind UNC-13 but also through its requirement for recruiting CaV2 calcium channels to presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Why does RIM play different roles at worm and mouse synapses? SV priming is thought to consist of two sequential steps, termed molecular and positional priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). Molecular priming is proposed to account for a slow component of release, which consists of fusion of SVs that are docked far from calcium channels driving release. Positional priming is proposed to mediate a faster form of release, which comprises fusion of SVs that are docked very close to calcium channels. One possibility is that worms rely less on positional priming, which presumably requires UNC-13/RIM interaction, and instead rely more on molecular priming. In this scenario, worm <italic>unc-10</italic> RIM mutants would have decreased release probability but relatively normal RRP size. By contrast, mice may require positional priming to maintain the RRP, and thus RIM mutants would have significant priming defects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional functions of the C2A domain</title><p>Despite the above findings, the actual mechanism whereby the UNC-13L with a monomeric C2A regulates SV release remains unclear. Based on the normal synaptic transmission in the UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) double mutants, RIM binding to the UNC-13L C2A domain only appears to be playing a switch role. The C2A domain must therefore have additional functions for regulation of SV release. This is confirmed by our observations in relation to tonic release, which has been proposed to have a different regulatory mechanism from evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramirez and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Melom et al., 2013</xref>). The mEPSC frequency was reduced by 50% in the UNC-13LΔC2A rescue animals at both 0 mM and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, similar to the evoked release findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), revealing an important role of the C2A domain for tonic release at cholinergic synapses. However, this role cannot be explained by the state of the C2A domain (homodimer, heterodimer, or monomer), as the mEPSC frequencies were normal in the UNC-13L(K49E) rescue, <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) mutant, and UNC-13L(K49E); <italic>unc-10</italic>(<italic>nu487</italic> K77/79E) double mutants in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We only observed a change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in very low Ca<sup>2+</sup> at GABAergic synapses, and this phenotype disappeared when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Our observations at cholinergic synapses therefore demonstrate that, although the C2A/C2A homodimer inhibits evoked release, it does not affect tonic release. There must still be an unknown mechanism by which the monomeric C2A domain regulates post-priming SV exocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Strain maintenance and genetic manipulation were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

UNC-13/Munc13 proteins are essential regulators of synaptic vesicle priming. Their loss causes a complete arrest of transmitter release, and their regulation by protein-interactors or second messengers determines several key aspects of synapse function, most notably short-term synaptic plasticity. In this regard the focus on the UNC-13/UNC-10 interaction is important and of very substantial interest because the accounts in the literature are confusing, with evidence for (and against) roles in synapse targeting and sub-synaptic localization of UNC-13/Munc13 and in the regulation of UNC-13/Munc13 dimerization and UNC-13/Munc13 activity. Liu et al. show that the UNC-13L C2A domain homodimerizes and also heterodimerizes with UNC-10, in correlation with previous results obtained with the mammalian proteins. Their data suggest that the UNC-13L C2A domain and its interaction with UNC-10 are important to increase the release probability but do not control priming. The latter result contrasts with data described in Camacho et al., 2017. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not clear, but the reviewers believe that the present results will be of substantial interest to the field of synapse biology and, overall, are supportive of the manuscript. However, they also have a number of concerns that are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Earlier studies showed that a truncation of mammalian Munc13-1 that abolishes RIM1 binding leads to a priming defect that can be (partially) overcome by prolonged strong overexpression of the truncated Munc13-1 variant (Betz et al., – 2001 –). This indicated that the Munc13/RIM interaction might play a role in the synaptic trafficking and sub-synaptic positioning and anchoring of Munc13s. This notion is supported by the fact that Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 levels are massively reduced in RIM1 KO mice. Subsequent analyses in RIM1 KOs showed that synaptic targeting and active zone anchoring of Munc13-1 (and of the other RIM-binding Munc13, ubMunc13-2) are perturbed in the absence of RIM1 (Andrews-Zwilling et al. – 2006 – J. Biol. Chem. 281, 19720). In a parallel study, it was shown that perturbation of the Munc13-RIM interaction by infusion of the isolated RIM2 ZnF domain strongly inhibits transmitter release from the calyx of Held while a Munc13-binding-deficient ZnF domain variant does not (Dulubova et al., – 2005 –), which corroborates the earlier/parallel work cited above. Since the first study on the functional effects of the RIM-Munc13 interaction on Munc13-dimerization (Deng et al., – 2011 –), the whole field focused almost exclusively on this issue, without addressing the effects of perturbing RIM/Munc13 or UNC-13/UNC-10 interactions on Munc13/UNC-13 localization (beyond the analysis of the mere presence or absence of Munc13/UNC-13 at synapses). This is unfortunate because we know that the levels of Munc13/UNC-13 at synapses and its sub-synaptic positioning affect key synapse features. In addition, previous studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed altered distributions of docked vesicles away from the active zone in the presence of UNC-13 constructs lacking the C2A domain as well as UNC-10 mutants, and this positional effect likely accounts for the reduced release probability observed in the present study. Liu et al. did not analyze sub-cellular localization and did not present expression data to determine the levels of the protein constructs reintroduced in the nerve cord. This is problematic given that all of the UNC-13 constructs are extrachromasomal arrays and thus could be highly or differentially expressed. Furthermore, the present study would have benefited from using CRISPR or some other form of homologous recombination throughout, as was done for their UNC-10 (K77/79E) construct so that expression level effects do not confound the interpretation of the results. Of particular concern is the possibility that overexpression of UNC-13 K49E in the rescue of release in the UNC-10 (K77/79E) background may not be physiologically relevant.</p><p>For these reasons, the present study and its interpretation would profit tremendously from a comparative analysis of the expression levels and sub-cellular localization of the different UNC-13 variants at synapses (as well as of UNC-13 levels and positioning in the presence of the different UNC-10 variants). If analyzing sub-synaptic UNC-13 localization cannot be performed within a reasonable timeframe for this communication, the authors should at least quantify the synaptic UNC-13 levels. The authors should also discuss these various issues and tone down their conclusions accordingly (including the definitive nature of the title).</p><p>2) Crucial differences observed between the results described by Liu et al. and by Camacho et al., 2017 correspond to the measurements of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles by treatment with hypertonic sucrose. It is unclear whether these are indeed real differences between the mammalian and worm systems, or the different results arise from differences in experimental protocols. For instance, the authors use 1 M sucrose instead of 500 mM sucrose, which is more common and was used by Camacho et al. It is also plausible that differences might arise from the method of application of sucrose. The authors should perform experiments with 500 mM sucrose to examine whether their results stand at this lower concentration, provide more experimental details on these experiments and discuss how experimental details might influence the results obtained. Raw traces for both concentrations should be provided and, when collecting the 500 mOsm data, the leak current for each trace used in the analysis should be noted.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Heterodimerization of UNC-13/RIM regulates synaptic vesicle release probability but not priming in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nils Brose (Reviewer #2); Janet E Richmond (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and with the Reviewing Editor. They found most revisions satisfactory, but there are still some concerns that are summarized below to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The authors produced new extrachromasomal lines for the UNC-13 constructs tagged with C-terminal Apple, which allowed them to measure comparable expression levels, but these were not the arrays used to do the functional electrophysiological analysis in the paper. It is the case that arrays can vary in expression levels from one injection to the next. The authors only provide assurances that the behavior was rescued but did not show the data or the extent of the rescue. More concerning, they did not repeat the electrophysiological analyses on these strains. Without this, how can we be certain that these are similar to the original array-expressing strains and that the same results would be found.</p><p>2) As for the hyperosmotic traces, only those for the unc-10(k77/79E) were reexamined in 0.5M sucrose and the requested leak currents for the two data sets (i.e. 0.5 and 1M) were not provided. The concern is that at 1M sucrose, if there were substantial leak, the large inward currents observed would arise not from sucrose-induced release but poor seals. This problem has arisen in the past in analyses of fly embryos in which large inward currents were observed in mutants that were subsequently shown to have no primed vesicles; the reason was leaky recordings. If the authors could have produced these data for the <italic>unc-13</italic> null and the UNC-13 rescuing arrays tagged with Apple, this would have greatly improved confidence in the conclusions of the paper. The leak currents should be provided and the data should be interpreted considering these issues.</p><p>3) In the decision letter a critical discussion of the use of extrachromosomal-array-based expression was provided. Clearly, overexpression via this approach could mask effects that would become detectable with WT-like expression levels. This issue should be discussed briefly as a possible caveat.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40585.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Earlier studies showed that a truncation of mammalian Munc13-1 that abolishes RIM1 binding leads to a priming defect that can be (partially) overcome by prolonged strong overexpression of the truncated Munc13-1 variant (Betz et al., 2001).[…] Furthermore, the present study would have benefited from using CRISPR or some other form of homologous recombination throughout, as was done for their UNC-10 (K77/79E) construct so that expression level effects do not confound the interpretation of the results.

The use of extrachromosomal arrays in this study raised the question of whether the UNC-13 protein levels from distinct transgenic lines (UNC-13L, UNC-13LK49E, and UNC-13LDC2A rescues) are similar or not.</p><p>To determine this, we made all the rescue constructs with a fluorescence protein tag (mApple). Re-introducing these constructs into the <italic>unc-13</italic> null mutants rescued the locomotion defects (data not shown). Indeed, the UNC-13 with a C-terminal tag is fully functional in mediating SV exocytosis (Hu et al., 2013). By analyzing the fluorescence intensity of mApple, we showed that the average proteins levels of UNC-13L, UNC13LK49E, and UNC-13LDC2A are not significantly different (Figure 4A, B). These results exclude the possibility that the decreased SV release in the UNC-13LDC2A rescue is due to a change in the protein level, and that disrupting the C2A/C2A homodimerization has no effect on protein level. It should be noted that we didn’t compare release in these new mApple transgenic strains, as prior studies have shown that a fluorescence tag does not affect UNC-13 protein’s function (Madison et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2013).</p><p>To examine whether the sub-localization of UNC-13L is altered when heterodimerization with RIM is disrupted, we analyzed UNC-13L co-localization with ELKS1, another active zone protein. In wild-type background, UNC-13L (tagged with mCherry) and ELKS<sup>-1</sup> (tagged with Cerulean) exhibit an obvious colocalization (Figure 4C, D). This colocalization was still observed in <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutants (Figure 4E, F). These results suggest that disrupting the UNC-13L/RIM interaction does not dramatically alter UNC-13L synaptic localization and that UNC-13L likely has other binding partners that promote its active zone localization.</p><p>All the above results have been incorporated into the figures and text.</p><p>“The decreased release probability in the UNC-13LDC2A rescue and the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) mutant could arise from a change of the expression level of UNC-13, or a change of the sublocalization of the UNC-13 proteins at the nerve terminals. […] These results suggest that disrupting UNC-13L binding to RIM does not prevent synaptic localization of UNC-13L.”</p><p>The new generated imaging lines have been added into the “Strain names” in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Crucial differences observed between the results described by Liu et al. and by Camacho et al., 2017 correspond to the measurements of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles by treatment with hypertonic sucrose. It is unclear whether these are indeed real differences between the mammalian and worm systems, or the different results arise from differences in experimental protocols. For instance, the authors use 1 M sucrose instead of 500 mM sucrose, which is more common and was used by Camacho et al. It is also plausible that differences might arise from the method of application of sucrose. The authors should perform experiments with 500 mM sucrose to examine whether their results stand at this lower concentration, provide more experimental details on these experiments and discuss how experimental details might influence the results obtained. Raw traces for both concentrations should be provided and, when collecting the 500 mOsm data, the leak current for each trace used in the analysis should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>Since Rosemund and colleagues first established the assay of using hypertonic sucrose-evoked synaptic current to estimate the size of the readily releasable vesicular pool (RRP), this assay has been widely used in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The sucrose concentrations and puffing durations, however, vary in different studies (Aravamudan et al., 1999; Richmond et al., 1999; Yoshihara and Littleton, 2002; Pang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2013). It is unlikely that the different results in SV priming in the <italic>unc-10</italic>(K77/79E) arise from the experimental protocols we used, as the large priming defect in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants has been consistently observed in our lab. Nevertheless, to address the reviewer’s question, we compared the synaptic currents elicited by 0.5M sucrose between wild type and the <italic>unc10(K77/79E)</italic> mutants. To record a relatively stable sucrose response under this condition, a 5s puffing duration was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A, B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the charge transfer of the sucrose currents in the <italic>unc-10(K77/79E)</italic> mutants were comparable to those in wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>), consistent with the observation when using 1M sucrose. We have added these results in the main text. All the raw traces recorded in both 0.5M and 1M sucrose were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A, B, D, E</xref>). These results confirmed the notion that disrupting the UNC-13L/RIM heterodimerization does not affect SV priming.</p><p>We have described more details how to perform the sucrose puff experiments at the worm NMJ in the “Materials and methods”.</p><p>“A pulsed application of sucrose (1M, 2s) was applied onto the ventral nerve cord using a Picospritzer III (Parker).

They found most revisions satisfactory, but there are still some concerns that are summarized below to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The authors produced new extrachromasomal lines for the UNC-13 constructs tagged with C-terminal Apple, which allowed them to measure comparable expression levels, but these were not the arrays used to do the functional electrophysiological analysis in the paper. It is the case that arrays can vary in expression levels from one injection to the next. The authors only provide assurances that the behavior was rescued but did not show the data or the extent of the rescue. More concerning, they did not repeat the electrophysiological analyses on these strains. Without this, how can we be certain that these are similar to the original array-expressing strains and that the same results would be found.</p></disp-quote><p>Both mEPSCs and evoked EPSCs were analyzed in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants rescued by mApple-tagged UNC-13 proteins (UNC-13L, DC2A, and K49E). Basically, we found very similar results in these rescue strains, compared to those observed untagged UNC-13 rescue strains, indicating that the UNC-13 with C-terminal tag is fully functional. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>“All mApple-tagged UNC-13L constructs rescued the SV release in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants, and the phenotypes were similar to those rescued by corresponding untagged UNC13L constructs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As for the hyperosmotic traces, only those for the unc-10(k77/79E) were reexamined in 0.5M sucrose and the requested leak currents for the two data sets (i.e. 0.5 and 1M) were not provided. The concern is that at 1M sucrose, if there were substantial leak, the large inward currents observed would arise not from sucrose-induced release but poor seals. This problem has arisen in the past in analyses of fly embryos in which large inward currents were observed in mutants that were subsequently shown to have no primed vesicles; the reason was leaky recordings. If the authors could have produced these data for the unc-13 null and the UNC-13 rescuing arrays tagged with Apple, this would have greatly improved confidence in the conclusions of the paper. The leak currents should be provided and the data should be interpreted considering these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added the quantification for two more mutants, <italic>unc-13(s69)</italic> and UNC-13L rescue, under the lower sucrose condition (0.5M, 5s). The results are similar with what we obtained when puffing 1M sucrose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Moreover, Zhou et al. have shown that removing the C2A domain from UNC-13L does not cause a change in the RRP size measured by puffing 0.5M sucrose (Zhou et al., 2013, <italic>eLife</italic>), consistent with our findings in this study. We hope that the reviews can agree that our current protocol for sucrose puffing (1M, 2s) is reasonable.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40585-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>We remade the following figures with all sucrose traces. The leak current can be seen on each individual traces. We also quantified the leak current for all the sucrose recordings (1M, 2s). The results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as a supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). As you can see, the leak current is controlled very well in our recordings. The averaged leak current for each genotype is between -20pA and -30pA.</p><p>“It should be noted that recording of the sucrose-evoked current requires a tight gigaohm seal between the recording pipette and the cell, as a loose seal often leads to an unreal current. We therefore analyzed the leak currents for each sucrose recordings. Our data showed that all recordings were controlled well with acceptable leak currents (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the decision letter a critical discussion of the use of extrachromosomal-array-based expression was provided. Clearly, overexpression via this approach could mask effects that would become detectable with WT-like expression levels. This issue should be discussed briefly as a possible caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and have discussed the issue of rescue using extrachromosomal arrays.</p><p>“It should be noted that all the UNC-13 transgenes in this study are extrachromosomal arrays, and that the UNC-13 proteins are overexpressed in these transgenic animals. The overexpression of UNC-13 may cause differential effects with wild-type expression of this protein. Despite this, our findings (e.g., DC2A) are similar with Zhou et al. results which were obtained from <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants rescued by single copy of UNC-13.”</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40585-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40585-resp-fig4-v1"/></fig><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40585-resp-fig5-v1"/></fig><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40585-resp-fig6-v1"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
